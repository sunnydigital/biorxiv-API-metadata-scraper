    "abstract": "Social recognition consists of multiple memory processes, including the detection of familiarity - the ability to rapidly distinguish familiar from novel individuals - and recollection - the effortful recall of where a social episode occurred and who was present. At present, the neural mechanisms for these different social memory processes remain unknown. Here, we investigate the population code for novel and familiar individuals in mice using calcium imaging of neural activity in a region crucial for social memory, the dorsal CA2 area of the hippocampus. We report that familiarity changes CA2 representations of social encounters to meet the different demands of social memory. While novel individuals are represented in a low-dimensional geometry that allows for rapid generalization, familiar individuals are represented in a higher-dimensional geometry that supports high-capacity memory storage. The magnitude of the change in dimensionality of CA2 representations for a given individual predicts the performance of that individual in a social recognition memory test, suggesting a direct relationship between the representational geometry and memory-guided behavior. Finally, we show that familiarity is encoded as an abstract variable with neural responses generalizing across different identities and spatial locations. Thus, through the tuning of the geometry of structured neural activity, CA2 is able to meet the complex demands of multiple social memory processes.",

    "abstract": "The compounding symptomatology of comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) gives rise to an interaction of maladaptive neurobiological processes, the etiology of which remains elusive. Here, we devised an optogenetic strategy aimed at rescuing maladaptive responses to fearful stimuli in male c57BL/6 mice following chronic ethanol administration and forced abstinence. In the first experiment, we confirmed that fear acquisition and maladaptive contextual generalization was potentiated in ethanol-exposed mice during fear conditioning and exposure to a novel environment, respectively. In the second experiment, using an activity-dependent tet-tag system, we labeled and artificially inhibited the neural ensemble selectively activated by contextual fear conditioning in the dorsal hippocampus to attenuate behavioral dysfunctions resulting from ethanol exposure. We found that acute optogenetic inhibition during exposure to a novel environment suppressed maladaptive generalization in ethanol-exposed mice. These results provide further evidence for a crucial link between ethanol exposure and impaired fear memory processing by providing cellular and behavioral insights into the neural circuitry underlying AUD and PTSD comorbidity.",

    "abstract": "Several neuronal mechanisms have been proposed to account for the formation of cognitive abilities through postnatal interactions with the physical and socio-cultural environment. Here, we introduce a three-level computational model of information processing and acquisition of cognitive abilities. We propose minimal architectural requirements to build these levels and how the parameters affect their performance and relationships. The first sensorimotor level handles local nonconscious processing, here during a visual classification task. The second level or cognitive level globally integrates the information from multiple local processors via long-ranged connections and synthesizes it in a global, but still nonconscious manner. The third and cognitively highest level handles the information globally and consciously. It is based on the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) theory and is referred to as conscious level. We use trace and delay conditioning tasks to, respectively, challenge the second and third levels. Results first highlight the necessity of epigenesis through selection and stabilization of synapses at both local and global scales to allow the network to solve the first two tasks. At the global scale, dopamine appears necessary to properly provide credit assignment despite the temporal delay between perception and reward. At the third level, the presence of interneurons becomes necessary to maintain a self-sustained representation within the GNW in the absence of sensory input. Finally, while balanced spontaneous intrinsic activity facilitates epigenesis at both local and global scales, the balanced excitatory-inhibitory ratio increases performance. Finally, we discuss the plausibility of the model in both neurodevelopmental and artificial intelligence terms.",

Correlations between pairs of neocortical neurons can be segmented into either sensory or noise according to their stimulus specificity. Here we show that pairs of spikes, corresponding to reliable sensory correlations in imaged populations in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex are particularly informative of visual stimuli. This set of spikes is sparse and exhibits comparable levels of trial-to-trial variance relative to the full spike train. Despite this, correspondence of pairs of spikes to a specific set of sensory correlations identifies spikes that carry more information per spike about the visual stimulus than the full set or any other matched set of spikes. Moreover, this sparse subset is more accurately decoded, regardless of the decoding algorithm employed. Our findings suggest that consistent pairwise correlations between neurons, rather than first-order statistical features of spike trains, may be an organizational principle of a single trial sensory coding scheme.",

    "abstract": "Locomotion has long been associated with rhythmic oscillations in the rat hippocampus. Running speed and acceleration affect the spectral density at the theta (6-10 Hz) and gamma (30-150 Hz) bands and the rhythmic entrainment of neuronal activity. However, less is known about other oscillatory rhythms. Recent studies have shown that oscillatory activity in the delta (1-4 Hz) band also relates to locomotion in stationary conditions, such as running on a treadmill or in a running wheel. To further investigate the effects of stationary running on hippocampal oscillations, we recorded CA1 local field potentials and neuronal activity while rats ran at different speed protocols on a treadmill. We found a remarkable oscillatory activity at 2 Hz that was strongly modulated by running speed. Delta power and peak frequency were highest at the fastest running speed, both in constant and progressively increasing speed protocols. Delta and theta oscillations co-occurred and showed independent relationships in their instantaneous power and frequency. Moreover, the delta phase modulated the amplitude of low-gamma (20-50 Hz) oscillations and the spiking activity of putative pyramidal neurons in a speed-dependent manner. Finally, spectral components in the delta frequency range, but not theta, predicted running speed using a naive Bayes classifier. In summary, our study shows that locomotion-related delta oscillations convey information about stationary running speed and coordinate hippocampal rhythmic activity in a speed-dependent manner.\n\nStatement of significanceTheta and gamma oscillations are hallmarks of rhythmic activity in the rat hippocampus during locomotion and exploratory behaviors, but less is known about other oscillatory rhythms. This study shows the emergence of delta ([~]2 Hz) oscillations in the dorsal CA1 of rats running on a treadmill. Locomotion-related delta oscillations are independent of the concomitant theta activity and convey information about running speed. Delta waves modulate low-gamma oscillations and the spiking activity of pyramidal neurons in a speed-dependent way. These results suggest that oscillatory activity in the delta band aids rhythmic coordination during stationary locomotor behaviors.",

The dried discs were screened against various strains of bacteria and the antimicrobial effects of the infused agents determined by measuring zones of inhibition due to the agents infused into the discs. By the zones of inhibition, C. ovata showed antimicrobial activity against the following gram-negative bacteria: E. coli (14 mm mean zone of clearing), P. vulgaris (13 mm mean zone of clearing), E. cloacae (16 mm mean zone of clearing), and K. pneumoniae (13 mm mean zone of clearing). C. ovata showed antimicrobial activity against the following gram-positive bacteria: S. aureus (22 mm mean zone of clearing) and S. agalactiae (8 mm mean zone of clearing). C. ovata did not show antimicrobial activity against S. pyogenes. By its antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, C. ovata displayed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, S. agalactiae, P. vulgaris, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. C. ovata may have the potential to serve as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial in the future. Further testing should be done to investigate the toxicities and side effects of C. ovata.

Simultaneous interrogation of all RNA locations allows the system-wide quantification of RNA proportional distribution and the comprehensive analysis of RNA subcellular dynamics.

    "abstract": "Mutations in USH2A gene are responsible for the greatest proportion of hearing and vision loss among individuals with Usher Syndrome (USH) and for autosomal recessive non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa. Mutations on USH2A exon 13 account for more than 35% of the disease causing USH2A variants including the most prevalence point mutation, c.2299delG, a frameshift mutation. The lack of a clinically relevant animal model has been a bottleneck for the development of therapeutics for USH2A related vision loss. Using CRSPR/Cas9 technology, this study establishes a rabbit line carrying an USH2A frameshift mutation on exon12 (equivalent to human USH2A Exon 13) as a novel mammalian animal model of USH2A. The bi-allelic mutant rabbits exhibit hyper reflective signals in FAF indicating RPE damage and OCT changes indicating photoreceptor degeneration as early as 4 months of age. ERG signals of both rod and cone function were reduced in the USH2A mutant rabbits starting from 7 months old and further decreased at 15-22 months old, indicating progressive retinal photoreceptor degeneration, which is further confirmed by retinal histopathology examination. ABR examination showed moderate to server hearing loss in the USH2A mutant rabbits. These results indicated that disruption of USH2A gene in rabbits is sufficient to induce hearing loss and progressive photoreceptor degeneration. To our knowledge, this is the first mammalian animal model of USH2 which closely recapitulates the phenotype of retinitis pigmentosa in human patients. This study supports the use of rabbits as a clinically relevant animal model to understand the pathogenesis and to develop novel therapeutics for Usher Syndrome.",

    "abstract": "In most metazoans, early embryonic development is characterized by rapid division cycles which pause before gastrulation at the mid-blastula transition (MBT).1 These early cleavage divisions are accompanied by cytoskeletal rearrangements which ensure proper nuclear positioning. Yet, the molecular mechanisms controlling nuclear positioning are not fully elucidated. In Drosophila, early embryogenesis unfolds in a multinucleated syncytium, and nuclei rapidly move across the anterior-posterior (AP) axis at cell cycles 4-6 in a process driven by actomyosin contractility and cytoplasmic flows.2,3 Previously, shackleton (shkl) mutants were identified in which this axial spreading is impaired.4 Here, we show that shkl mutants carry mutations in the cullin-5 (cul-5) gene. Live imaging experiments show that Cul-5 is downstream of the cell cycle but required for cortical actomyosin contractility. The nuclear spreading phenotype of cul-5 mutants can be rescued by reducing Src activity genetically, suggesting that a major target of Cul-5 is Src kinase. cul-5 mutants display gradients of nuclear density across the AP axis at the MBT which we exploit to study cell cycle control as a function of the N/C ratio. We found that the N/C ratio is sensed collectively in neighborhoods of about 100m and such collective sensing is required for a precise MBT in which all the nuclei in the embryo pause their division cycle. Moreover, we found that the response to the N/C ratio is slightly graded along the AP axis. These two features can be linked to the spatiotemporal regulation of Cdk1 activity. Collectively, our results reveal a new pathway controlling nuclear spreading and provide a quantitative dissection of how nuclear cycles respond to the N/C ratio.",

    "abstract": "Migratory waterbirds (i.e., shorebirds, wading birds, and waterfowl) rely on a diffuse continental network of wetland habitats to support annual life cycle needs. Emerging threats of climate and land-use change raise new concerns over the sustainability of these habitat networks as water scarcity triggers cascading ecological effects impacting wetland habitat availability. Here we use important waterbird regions in Oregon and California, USA, as a model system to examine patterns of landscape change impacting wetland habitat networks in western North America. Wetland hydrology and flooded agricultural habitats were monitored monthly from 1988 to 2020 using satellite imagery to quantify the timing and duration of inundation--a key delimiter of habitat niche values associated with waterbird use. Trends were binned by management practice and wetland hydroperiods (semi-permanent, seasonal, and temporary) to identify differences in their climate and land-use change sensitivity. Wetland results were assessed using 33 waterbird species to detect nonlinear effects of network change across a diversity of life cycle and habitat needs. Pervasive loss of semi-permanent wetlands was an indicator of systemic functional decline. Shortened hydroperiods caused by excessive drying transitioned semi-permanent wetlands to seasonal and temporary hydrologies--a process that in part counterbalanced concurrent seasonal and temporary wetland losses. Expansion of seasonal and temporary wetlands associated with closed-basin lakes offset wetland declines on other public and private lands, including wildlife refuges. Diving ducks, black terns, and grebes exhibited the most significant risk of habitat decline due to semi-permanent wetland loss that overlapped important migration, breeding, molting, and wintering periods. Shorebirds and dabbling ducks were beneficiaries of stable agricultural practices and top-down processes of functional wetland declines that operated collectively to maintain habitat needs. Outcomes from this work provide a novel perspective of wetland ecosystem change affecting waterbirds and their migration networks. Understanding the complexity of these relationships will become increasingly important as water scarcity continues to restructure the timing and availability of wetland resources.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Recent meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 175 loci associated with CAD. The majority of these loci are in non-coding regions and are predicted to regulate gene expression. Given that vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) play critical roles in the development and progression of CAD, we hypothesized that a subset of the CAD GWAS risk loci are associated with the regulation of transcription in distinct SMC phenotypes. Here, we measured gene expression in SMCs isolated from the ascending aortas of 151 ethnically diverse heart transplant donors in quiescent or proliferative conditions and calculated the association of their expression and splicing with [~]6.3 million imputed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers across the genome. We identified 4,910 expression and 4,412 splice quantitative trait loci (sQTL) that represent regions of the genome associated with transcript abundance and splicing. 3,660 of the eQTLs had not been observed in the publicly available Genotype-Tissue Expression dataset. Further, 29 and 880 of the eQTLs were SMC- and sex-specific, respectively. To identify the effector transcript(s) regulated by CAD GWAS loci, we used four distinct colocalization approaches and identified 84 eQTL and 164 sQTLs that colocalized with CAD loci, highlighting the importance of genetic regulation of mRNA splicing as a molecular mechanism for CAD genetic risk. Notably, 20% and 35% of the eQTLs were unique to quiescent or proliferative SMCs, respectively. Two CAD loci colocalized with a SMC sex-specific eQTL (AL160313.1 and TERF2IP) and another locus colocalized with SMC-specific eQTL (ALKBH8). Also, 27% and 37% of the sQTLs were unique to quiescent or proliferative SMCs, respectively. The most significantly associated CAD locus, 9p21, was an sQTL for the long non-coding RNA CDKN2B-AS1, also known as ANRIL, in proliferative SMCs. Collectively, these results provide evidence for the molecular mechanisms of genetic susceptibility to CAD in distinct SMC phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a critical role in the regulation of protein catalytic activity, localization and protein-protein interactions. Attachment of PTMs onto proteins significantly diversifies their structure and function resulting in so-called proteoforms. However, the sole identification of post-translationally modified proteins, which are often cell type and disease specific, is still a highly challenging task. Sub-stoichiometric amounts and modification of low abundant proteins necessitate purification or enrichment of the modified proteins. Although the introduction of the mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomic strategies have enabled to screen protein PTMs with increased throughput, sample preparation has remained highly time consuming and tedious. Here, we report an optimized workflow for enrichment of PTM proteins in 96-well plate format which can be possible extended to robotic automatization. This platform allows to significantly lower the input of total protein, which opens up the opportunity to screen specialized and difficult to culture cell lines in high-throughput manner. The presented SP2E protocol is robust, time- and cost-effective as well as suitable for large-scale screening of proteoforms. Application of the SP2E protocol will thus enable the characterization of proteoforms in various processes such as neurodevelopment, neurodegeneration and cancer and may contribute to an overall acceleration of the recently launched Human Proteoform Project.",

    "abstract": "Magnetoelectric materials convert magnetic fields to electric fields and have applications in wireless data and power transmission, electronics, sensing, data storage, and biomedical technology. For example, magnetoelectrics could enable precisely timed remote stimulation of neural tissue, but the resonance frequencies where magnetoelectric effects are maximized are typically too high to stimulate neural activity. To overcome this challenge, we created the first self-rectifying magnetoelectric \"metamaterial.\" This metamaterial relies on nonlinear charge transport across semiconductor layers that allow the material to generate a steady bias voltage in the presence of an alternating magnetic field. This \"self-rectification\" allows us to generate arbitrary electrical pulse sequences that have a time-averaged voltage in excess of 1 V. As a result, we can use magnetoelectric nonlinear metamaterials (MNMs) to remotely stimulate peripheral nerves with repeatable latencies of less than 5 ms, which is more than 120 times faster than previous neural stimulation approaches based on magnetic materials. These short latencies enable this metamaterial to be used in applications where fast neural signal transduction is necessary such as in sensory or motor neuroprosthetics. As a proof of principle, we show wireless stimulation to restore a sensory reflex in an anesthetized rat model as well as using the MNM to restore signal propagation in a severed nerve. The rational design of nonlinearities in the magnetic-to-electric transduction pathway as described here opens the door to many potential designs of MNMs tailored to applications spanning electronics, biotechnology, and sensing.",

    "abstract": "Given the important role food plays in health and well-being, the past decades have seen considerable experimental efforts dedicated to mapping the chemical composition of food ingredients. As the composition of raw food is genetically predetermined, here we ask, to what degree can we rely on genome-associated metabolic annotations to predict the chemical composition of natural ingredients? To that end, we developed an approach to unveil the chemical composition of 75 edible plants genomes, finding that genome-associated functional annotations substantially increase the number of compounds linked to specific plants. To account for the gap between the metabolic potential represented by functional annotations and the compounds likely to be accumulated and detected experimentally, we employed a predictive thermodynamic feasibility approach to systematically identify compounds that are likely to accumulate in plants. To quantify the accuracy of our predictions, we performed untargeted metabolomics on 13 plants, allowing us to experimentally confirm the detectability of the predicted compounds. For example, we observed 59 potentially novel compounds predicted and experimentally detected in corn. Our study shows that the application of genome-associated functional annotations can lead to an integrated metabologenomics platform capable of unveiling the chemical composition of edible plants and the biochemical pathways responsible for the observed compounds.\n\nAuthor SummaryNutrition and well-being take a central role in todays high pace life, but how much do we really know about the food we eat? Here, we harness existing metabolic knowledge encrypted in staple food ingredients genome to help us explore the composition of raw edible plants. We first show the benefit and value of looking into genome-associated functional annotations on a wide scale. Next, we rely on new experimental data to develop a framework that helps us reveal new, potentially bioactive compounds in staple food ingredients. This has significance in, first, extending current food composition knowledge and second in discovering newly detected bioactive compounds, shedding light on the potential impacts of common food ingredients beyond their nutritional value as described in food labels. Finally, we show that staple foods that are already included in our daily diets might have the potential to contribute to our well-being.",

Since functional motifs mostly act in relation to each other as clusters, finding such clusters of blocks is an effective approach to identify functional groups and their function and structure, which represents the need for development of new corresponding tools.\n\nThe presented web application finds clusters of sequential blocks, with even altering sequences and located in varying distances from each other inside the subject sequences, simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by defective bone mineralization, is highly variable in its clinical phenotype. The disease occurs due to various loss-of-function mutations in ALPL, the gene encoding tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). In this work, a data-driven and biophysics-based approach for large-scale analysis of ALPL mutations - from nonpathogenic to severe HPPs is proposed. Allosteric molecular signatures of ALPL mutations were determined using an integrated pipeline of synergistic approaches including sequence and energetic-based analysis, structural topology network modeling and elastic network models. Statistical analysis of molecular features computed for the ALPL mutations showed a significant difference between the control and mild and severe HPP phenotypes, and the developed machine learning model suggested that the topological network parameters could serve as is a robust indicator for severe mutations. Molecular dynamics simulations coupled with protein structure network was employed to analyze the effect of single-residue variation on conformational dynamics of TNSALP dimers, and we found that severe disease-associated mutations have a significantly greater effect on allosteric communications. The results of this study suggested that ALPL mutations associated with mild and severe HPPs tend to have different effects on protein stability on local scale and long-range communications caused by network rewiring. By linking disease phenotypes with allosteric molecular signatures, the proposed integrative computational approach elucidates the complex sequence-structure-allostery relationships of ALPL mutations and dissects the role of allosteric effects in the pathogenesis of HPPs.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe understanding of mutational genotype- disease phenotype relationship is a fundamental step for enabling precision medicine. It remains a challenging task to assess the molecular principle of the genotype- phenotype relationship. By focusing on Hypophosphatasia, a rare inherited disorder, as an example, we performed comprehensive analysis of single-amino-acid mutations in the encoded protein of Tissue Nonspecific Alkaline Phosphatase associated in terms of their sequence, structure, and dynamics properties. We further developed a machine learning -based method to classify different disease phenotypes, and the interpretability of the classification model was addressed by the structural-functional analysis of network topological important mutations. Our results highlighted the allosteric propensity of severe mutations, and show the potential allosteric principle of genotype- phenotype relationship.",

Communication between these clocks is believed to control circadian homeostasis. Metabolism can be considered a form of inter- tissue communication language that results in temporal coordination of systemic metabolism between tissues. Here we characterize the extent to which clocks in different organs employ this means of communication, an area which remains largely unexplored. For this, we analysed the metabolome of serum from mice with tissue-specific expression of the clock gene Bmal1. Notably, having functional hepatic and muscle clocks can only drive a minority (13%) of the oscillating metabolites in circulation. Conversely, limiting Bmal1 expression to Syt10- expressing neurons (which are enriched in the suprachiasmatic nucleus [SCN], the master pacemaker that regulates circadian rhythms) restores rhythms to 57% of circulatory metabolites and 28% of liver transcripts, and rescues glucose intolerance. Importantly, these parameters were also restored in clock-less mice upon rhythmic feeding, indicating that the central clock mainly regulates metabolic rhythms via behavior. These findings explicate the circadian communication between tissues and highlight the importance of the central clock in governing those signals.",

Yet, the extent to which parasite load is related to intraspecific variation in performance traits within wild populations remains relatively unexplored. We used pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) and their endoparasites as a model system to explore the effects of infection load on host aerobic metabolism and escape performance. Metabolic traits (standard and maximum metabolic rates, aerobic scope) and fast-start escape responses following a simulated aerial attack by a predator (responsiveness, response latency, and escape distance) were measured in fish from across a gradient of visible (i.e. trematodes causing black spot disease counted on fish surfaces) and non-visible (i.e. cestodes in fish abdominal cavity counted post-mortem) endoparasite infection. We found that a higher infection load of non-visible endoparasites was related to lower standard and maximum metabolic rates, but not aerobic scope in fish. Non-visible endoparasite infection load was also related to decreased responsiveness of the host to a simulated aerial attack. Visible endoparasites were not related to changes in metabolic traits nor fast-start escape responses. Our results suggest that infection with parasites that are inconspicuous to researchers can result in intraspecific variation in physiological and behavioral performance in wild populations, highlighting the need to more explicitly acknowledge and account for the role played by natural infections in studies of wild animal performance.",

    "abstract": "Algal cells experience strong circadian rhythms under diurnal light, with regular changes in both biomass composition and transcriptomic environment. However, most metabolic models - critical tools for bioengineering organisms - assume a steady state. The conflict between these assumptions and the reality of the cellular environment make such models inappropriate for algal cells, creating a significant obstacle in engineering cells that are viable under natural light. By transforming a set of discreet transcriptomic measurements from synchronized Chlamydomonas cells grown in a 12/12 diel light regime (1) into continuous curves, we produced a complete representation of the cells transcriptome that can be interrogated at any arbitrary timepoint. We clustered these curves, in order to find genes that were expressed in similar patterns, and then also used it to build a metabolic model that can accumulate and catabolize different biomass components over the course of a day. This model predicts qualitative phenotypical outcomes for the sta6 mutant, including excess lipid accumulation (2) and a failure to thrive when grown diurnally in minimal media (3), representing a qualitative prediction of phenotype from genotype even under dynamic conditions. We also extended this approach to simulate all single-knockout mutants with genes represented in the model and identified potential targets for rational engineering efforts.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe have developed the first transient metabolic model for diurnal growth of algae based on experimental data and capable of predicting phenotype from genotype. This model enables us to evaluate the impact of genetic and environmental changes on the growth, biomass composition and intracellular fluxes of the model green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulation occurs through genomic contacts between enhancers and their cognate promoters, and most genes are transcribed in a bursty fashion. To understand the relationship between these two phenomena, we develop a general modeling framework in terms of the information transmission from upstream genomic organization to downstream transcriptional bursting. Importantly, we uncover fundamental theoretical principles of enhancer-promoter (E-P) spatial communication in the modulation of transcriptional burst size (BS) and burst frequency (BF). First, BS and BF obey their respective power-law dependences on the E-P communication strength and distinct scaling exponents. Second, the E-P spatial distance follows a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution rather than the previously assumed Gauss distribution. Third, the E-P genomic distance affects transcriptional outcomes biphasically (i.e., in an exponential decay for small E-P genomic distances but insensitively to large E-P genomic distances). Fourth, the E-P communication mainly modulates BF rather than BS. Finally, the mutual information between BS (or BF) and E-P spatial distance further reveals essential characteristics of the information transfer from the upstream to the downstream. Our predictions are experimentally verifiable, e.g., confirmed by experimental data on Drosophila. The overall analysis provides insights into the role of the E-P communication in the control of transcriptional bursting.\n\nSignificanceMeasurement technologies of chromatin conformations and genome-wide occupancy data of architectural proteins have revealed that genome topology is tightly intertwined with gene transcription. However, a long-standing question in transcriptional regulation is how the enhancer-promoter (E-P) spatial communication impacts transcriptional bursting kinetics. To address this issue, we develop a multiscale model that couples upstream chromatin dynamics to downstream transcriptional bursting. This model not only reveals fundamental principles of E-P communication in transcriptional bursting kinetics (e.g., burst size and frequency follow their own power-law behaviors) but also provides a general modeling framework toward the 4D nucleome project.",

    "abstract": "Mistuning of synaptic transmission has been proposed to underlie many psychiatric disorders, with decreased reuptake of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate as one contributing factor. Synaptic tuning occurs through several diverging and converging forms of plasticity. By recording evoked field postsynaptic potentials in the CA1 area in hippocampal slices, we found that inhibiting glutamate transporters using DL-TBOA causes retuning of synaptic transmission, resulting in a new steady state with reduced synaptic strength and a lower threshold for inducing long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). Moreover, we also found reduced threshold for LTP in a rat model of depression that has decreased levels of glutamate transporters. Most importantly, we found that the antidepressant ketamine counteracts the effects of increased glutamate on the various steps involved in synaptic retuning. We therefore propose that ketamines mechanism of action as an antidepressant is to restore adequate synaptic tuning.",

Recent work showed that excitatory and inhibitory neurons are equally selective for choice. However, functional consequences of inhibitory choice selectivity in decision-making circuits are unknown. We developed a circuit model of decision-making which accounts for the specificity of inputs to and outputs from inhibitory neurons. We found that selective inhibition expands the space of circuits supporting decision-making, allowing for weaker or stronger recurrent excitation when connected in a competitive or feedback motif. The specificity of inhibitory outputs sets the trade-off between speed and accuracy of decisions by altering the attractor dynamics in the circuit.

    "abstract": "Recent long-term optical imaging studies have demonstrated that the activity levels of hippocampal neurons in a familiar environment change on a daily to weekly basis. However, it is unclear whether there is any time-invariant property in the cells neural representations. In this study, using miniature fluorescence microscopy, we measured the neural activity of the mouse hippocampus in four different environments every 3 days. Although the activity level of hippocampal neurons fluctuated greatly in each environment across days, we found a significant correlation between the activity levels for different days, and the correlation was higher for averaged activity levels across multiple environments. When the number of environments used for averaging was increased, a higher activity correlation was observed. Furthermore, the number of environments in which a cell showed activity was preserved. Cells that showed place cell activity in many environments had greater spatial information content, and thus carried a higher amount of information about the current position. In contrast, cells that were active only in a small number of environments provided sparse representation for the environment. These results suggest that each cell has not only an inherent activity level but also play a characteristic role in the coding of space.\n\nSignificance StatementRecent studies have revealed that place cell activity in the hippocampal CA1 cells exhibit instability on a daily to weekly scale. However, it is unclear whether there is any invariant property in the activity of the cells. In this study, we found that, although the activity level of CA1 neurons fluctuated greatly in one environment, the mean activity level across multiple environments was more stable. Furthermore, the number of environments in which a cell showed activity was preserved over time. These results suggest that even though the spatial code changes dynamically, each cell has an inherent activity level and plays a characteristic role in spatial coding.",

    "abstract": "Together, Biological Soil Crust (BSC) and other cryptogamic groundcovers can contribute up to half of the global nitrogen (N) fixation. BSC also stabilizes the soil (reducing erosion and dust emissions), fixes carbon (C), retains moisture, and acts as a hotspot of microbial diversity and activity. Much of the knowledge about how climate change is affecting the composition and functioning of BSC comes from hot arid and semiarid regions. The comparatively smaller body of research on BSC from cold and mesic environments has been primarily observational, for example along chronosequences after a glacier retreat. Few studies have experimentally investigated the effects of the environment on BSC from high latitudes. Such experiments allow unraveling of relationships at a resolution that can only be achieved by controlling for confounding factors. We measured short-term (2-4 days) responses of a liverwort-based (Anthelia juratzkana) BSC from the south of Iceland to a range of temperature, moisture and light conditions. Warming increased N fixation rates, especially when moisture was at a saturation level, and only when light was not limiting. A correlation analysis suggests that increases in N fixation rates were linked to cyanobacterial abundance on the BSC surface and to the rates of their metabolic activity. Warming and moisture changes also induced compositional and structural modification of the bacterial community, with consequences at the functional level. In contrast to many observations on BSC from hot drylands, the BSC from our cold and mesic study site is more limited by low temperature and light than by moisture. Our findings show possible ways in which BSC from cold and mesic ecosystems can respond to short-term manifestations of climate change, such as increasingly frequent heat waves.",

    "abstract": "TrkA is a membrane receptor that upon ligand binding, induces autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain, and this process includes sites in the kinase activation loop (Y670, Y674, Y675) and two direct sites involved in downstream signaling pathways (Y490, Y785). At present, researchers cannot fully elucidate the regulatory mechanism of TrkA phosphorylation because TrkA signaling is a highly dynamic process, and a strategy with high temporal and spatial resolution will be beneficial to the mechanism research. Our previous study proposed a design scheme for photosensitive TrkA, which utilizes a new molecular light control technology to target TrkA-Y490 and three kinase domain sites (Y670, Y674, and Y675) through Genetic Code Expansion (GCE) technology combined with site-directed mutagenesis. We chose two light-controllable unnatural amino acids (UAAs) to introduce at the specific phosphorylation sites of the target protein TrkA. We focused on the regulation mechanism of these sites on the MAPK/ERK pathway downstream of TrkA. However, this method has not yet been validated for the TrkA-Y785 site. Therefore, this paper will continue to test the light-controlled method we established earlier in the Y785 site. We aim to improve further the experimental model of light-controlled phosphorylation of TrkA that we have established and finally lay the foundation for the comprehensive analysis of kinase-related pathways.",

    "abstract": "Lung development is precisely controlled by underlying Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN). Disruption of genes in the network can interrupt normal development and cause diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-a chronic lung disease in preterm infants with morbid and sometimes lethal consequences characterized by lung immaturity and reduced alveolarization.\n\nHere, we generated a transgenic mouse exhibiting a moderate severity BPD phenotype by blocking IGF1 signaling in secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMF) at the onset of alveologenesis. Using approaches mirroring the construction of the model GRN in sea urchins development, we constructed the IGF1 signaling network underlying alveologenesis using this mouse model that phenocopies BPD. The constructed GRN, consisting of 43 genes, provides a birds-eye view of how the genes downstream of IGF1 are regulatorily connected. The GRN also reveals a mechanistic interpretation of how the effects of IGF1 signaling are transduced within SCMF from its specification genes to its effector genes and then from SCMF to its neighboring alveolar epithelial cells with WNT5A and FGF10 signaling as the bridge. Consistently, blocking WNT5A signaling in mice phenocopies BPD as inferred by the network. A comparative study on human samples suggests that a GRN of similar components and wiring underlies human BPD.\n\nOur network view of alveologenesis is transforming our perspective to understand and treat BPD. This new perspective calls for the construction of the full signaling GRN underlying alveologenesis, upon which targeted therapies for this neonatal chronic lung disease can be viably developed.",

While most of the eQTLs are near the associated genes, some can be far away or on different chromosomes, with the regulatory mechanisms largely unknown. Here, we study cis- and trans-regulation of eQTLs across multiple tissues and cell types. Specifically, we constructed trios consisting of an eQTL, its cis-gene and trans-gene and inferred the regulatory relationships with causal network inference. We identify multiple types of regulatory networks for trios: across all the tissues, more than half of the trios are inferred to be conditionally independent, where the two genes are conditionally independent given the genotype of the eQTL (cis-gene [&lt;-] eQTL [-&gt;] trans-gene). Around 1.5% of the trios are inferred to be mediation (eQTL [-&gt;] mediator [-&gt;] target), around 1.3% fully connected among the three nodes, and just a handful v-structures (eQTL [-&gt;] gene 1 [&lt;-] gene 2). Unexpectedly, across the tissues, on average more than half of the mediation trios have the trans-gene as the mediator. Most of the mediators (cis and trans) are tissue specific. Furthermore, cis-gene mediators are significantly enriched for protein-coding genes compared with the genome average, whereas trans-gene mediators are significantly enriched for pseudogenes and depleted for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).",

    "abstract": "Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L. (Hibiscus, Malvaceae) is an ornamental species grown widely in amenity plantings. We collected leaves on an urban roadside pavement (sidewalk) near a market in Guangzhou which showed multiple symptoms of leaf rolling, deformation and chlorosis. Initial evaluation by electron microscopy using negative staining of drip preparations revealed the presence of tobamovirus-like particles. Total RNA was extracted, and, unusually, without any RNA selection based on sequence, was used for cDNA library construction and high-throughput survey sequencing. From the 814 Mb of clean sequence data (from 2,712,161 paired reads of 150 bp) reads representing chloroplast, ribosomal, and mitochondrial genes were filtered out, eliminating 79.1% of reads. 1,135,848 x 150 bp of the sequence was retained and screened for viral sequences. Assembly of these sequences detected nine virus species from seven virus genera comprising three tobamoviruses, namely, Tobacco mosaic virus, Tobacco mild green mosaic virus and Hibiscus latent Singapore virus, Turnip mosaic virus (Potyvirus), Potato virus M (Carlavirus), Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (Betacarmovirus), Fabavirus sp (Fabavirus), Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (Begomovirus) and a putative mitoviruses replicating in mitochondria, Chenopodium quinoa mitovirus 1. Mapping the reads to complete virus reference sequences showed high and uniform coverage of the genomes from 3,729 x coverage for Turnip mosaic virus to 22 x for Cotton leaf curl Multan virus. By comparison, nuclear reference genes actin showed 14 x coverage and polyubiquitin 27 x. Notable variants from reference sequences (SNPs) were identified. With the low cost of sequencing and potential for semi-automated bioinformatic pipelines, the whole-RNA approach has huge potential for identifying multiple undiagnosed viruses in ornamental plants, resulting in the ability to take preventive measures in production facilities against spread and to product quality for the mutual benefit of producers and consumers.",

Due to their cell-mimicking properties, GUVs have become a widespread experimental tool in synthetic biology to study membrane properties and cellular processes. In stark contrast to the experimental progress, quantitative analysis of GUV microscopy images has received much less attention. Currently, most analysis is performed either manually or with custom-made scripts, which makes analysis time-consuming and results difficult to compare across studies. To make quantitative GUV analysis accessible and fast, we present DisGUVery, an open-source, versatile software that encapsulates multiple algorithms for automated detection and analysis of GUVs in microscopy images. With a performance analysis, we demonstrate that DisGUVerys three vesicle detection modules successfully identify GUVs in images obtained with a wide range of imaging sources, in various typical GUV experiments. Multiple pre-defined analysis modules allow the user to extract properties such as membrane fluorescence, vesicle shape and internal fluorescence from large populations. A new membrane segmentation algorithm facilitates spatial fluorescence analysis of non-spherical vesicles. Altogether, DisGUVery provides an accessible tool to enable high-throughput automated analysis of GUVs, and thereby to promote quantitative data analysis in GUV research.",

The prominent deterioration of the milieu, derived from the destruction of spinal vascular system, not only activates innate immunity but also makes cells in the lesion lose nutrient supports. Limited endogenous angiogenesis happens after SCI, but the cell events at the lesion site underpinning this process have not been delineated so far. Here, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of tissues in the spinal lesion at different time points after rat SCI. After performing clustering and cell-type identification, we focused on the vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which play a pivot role in angiogenesis, and drew a comprehensive cellular and molecular atlas for endogenous angiogenesis after SCI. We found that microglia and macrophage promote endogenous angiogenesis by regulating EC subsets through SPP1 and IGF1 signal pathways. Our results indicated that immune cells promotes angiogenesis by the regulation of specific cell subsets of vascular ECs, which provides new clues for the development of interventions for SCI.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is becoming increasingly prevalent amongst bacterial pathogens and there is an urgent need to develop new types of antibiotics with novel modes of action. One promising strategy is to develop resistance-breaker compounds, which inhibit resistance mechanisms and thus re-sensitise bacteria to existing antibiotics. In the current study, we identify bacterial DNA double-strand break repair as a promising target for the development of resistance-breaking co-therapies. We examined genetic variants of Escherichia coli that combined antibiotic-resistance determinants with DNA repair defects. We observed that defects in the double-strand break repair pathway led to significant re-sensitisation towards five bactericidal antibiotics representing different functional classes. Effects ranged from partial to full re-sensitisation. For ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin, sensitisation manifested as a reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentration. For kanamycin and trimethoprim, sensitivity manifested through increased rates of killing at high antibiotic concentrations. For ampicillin, repair defects dramatically reduced antibiotic tolerance. Ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim induce the pro-mutagenic SOS response. Disruption of double-strand break repair strongly dampened the induction of SOS by these antibiotics. Our findings suggest that if break-repair inhibitors can be developed they could re-sensitise antibiotic-resistant bacteria to multiple classes of existing antibiotics and may supress the development of de novo antibiotic-resistance mutations.",

    "abstract": "Primates perceive detailed images in photopic (daylight) vision via a preferred-processing, high-acuity pathway, made up of a small photopic center (the fovea), and dedicated eye movements, whose function is to shift images of target objects to the fovea and keep them while foveal cones sense the image. Thus, the preferred processing pathway processes images serially, not in parallel. No such pathway is known for scotopic (night-light) vision or mesopic (twilight) vision - though details are informative in dim light, even vital; it remains unclear whether and how scotopic vision of details is accomplished. Here we show that primates do have a scotopic preferred-processing pathway. It consists of a  scotopic center, located on a  scotopic band, and eye movements that shift target images not to the fovea but directly to the scotopic center. In contrast to the stationary fovea, the scotopic center can relocate over the scotopic band. The scotopic center relocates to match changing visual conditions and contextual needs. Ambient light intensity is mapped monotonically onto the scotopic band, with mesopic vision at one end. The dimmer the light is, the more dorsal the scotopic center relocates on the scotopic band. Importantly, the scotopic center relocates (or  set) not only in passive response to ambient light but also actively, driven by internal factors. In near-threshold conditions the scotopic center relocates to a more dorsal band location than in salient conditions. That the same relocation of the scotopic center can be instigated both by dimming the ambient light and by reducing the detectability of targets indicates that, at the core, the longitudinal axis of the scotopic band encodes the level of perceptual uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "The rise of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the history of outbreaks caused by zoonotic coronaviruses point to the need for next-generation vaccines that confer protection against variant strains. Here, we combined analyses of diverse sequences and structures of coronavirus spikes with data from deep mutational scanning to design SARS-CoV-2 variant antigens containing the most significant mutations that may emerge. We trained a neural network to predict RBD expression and ACE2 binding from sequence, which allowed us to determine that these antigens are stable and bind to ACE2. Thus, they represent viable variants. We then used a computational model of affinity maturation (AM) to study the antibody response to immunization with different combinations of the designed antigens. The results suggest that immunization with a cocktail of the antigens is likely to promote evolution of higher titers of antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2 variants than immunization or infection with the wildtype virus alone. Finally, our analysis of 12 coronaviruses from different genera identified the S2 cleavage site and fusion peptide as potential pan-coronavirus vaccine targets.\n\nAuthor SummarySARS-CoV-2 variants have already emerged and future variants may pose greater threats to the efficacy of current vaccines. Rather than using a reactive approach to vaccine development that would lag behind the evolution of the virus, such as updating the sequence in the vaccine with a current variant, we sought to use a proactive approach that predicts some of the mutations that could arise that could evade current immune responses. Then, by including these mutations in a new vaccine antigen, we might be able to protect against those potential variants before they appear. Toward this end, we used various computational methods including sequence analysis and machine learning to design such antigens. We then used simulations of antibody development, and the results suggest that immunization with our designed antigens is likely to result in an antibody response that is better able to target SARS-CoV-2 variants than current vaccines. We also leveraged our sequence analysis to suggest that a particular site on the spike protein could serve as a useful target for a pan-coronavirus vaccine.",

    "abstract": "The amino acid (AA) mutations that characterise the different variants of concern (VOCs), which replaced the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate worldwide, provide biological advantages such as increased infectivity and partial escape from humoral immunity. Here we analysed the impact of these mutations on vaccination- and infection-induced Spike-specific T cells. We confirmed that, in the majority of infected or vaccinated individuals, different mutations present in a single VOC (Delta) or a combined mosaic of more than 30 AA substitutions and deletions found in Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron VOCs cause modest alteration in the global Spike-specific T cell response. However, distinct numerically dominant Spike-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells preferentially targeted regions affected by AA mutations and do not recognise the mutated peptides. Importantly, some of these mutations, such as N501Y (present in Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron) and L452R (present in Delta), known to provide biological advantage to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of infectivity also abolished CD8 T cell recognition.\n\nTaken together, our data show that while global mRNA vaccine- and infection-induced Spike-specific T cells largely tolerate the diverse mutations present in VOCs, single Spike-specific T cells might contribute to the natural selection of SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and several bat coronaviruses employ Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) as their functional receptors1-4. However, the receptor for NeoCoV, the closest MERS-CoV relative yet discovered in bats, remains enigmatic5. In this study, we unexpectedly found that NeoCoV and its close relative, PDF-2180-CoV, can efficiently use some types of bat Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and, less favorably, human ACE2 for entry. The two viruses use their spikes S1 subunit carboxyl-terminal domains (S1-CTD) for high-affinity and species-specific ACE2 binding. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis revealed a novel coronavirus-ACE2 binding interface and a protein-glycan interaction, distinct from other known ACE2-using viruses. We identified a molecular determinant close to the viral binding interface that restricts human ACE2 from supporting NeoCoV infection, especially around residue Asp338. Conversely, NeoCoV efficiently infects human ACE2 expressing cells after a T510F mutation on the receptor-binding motif (RBM). Notably, the infection could not be cross-neutralized by antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV. Our study demonstrates the first case of ACE2 usage in MERS-related viruses, shedding light on a potential bio-safety threat of the human emergence of an ACE2 using \"MERS-CoV-2\" with both high fatality and transmission rate.",

    "abstract": "The recent emergence of highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has debilitating effect on public health system of the affected countries worldwide. Currently India is facing third wave of COVID-19 pandemic and going through a severe crisis. Within short span of time, the variant has shown high transmissibility and capability of evading the immune response generated against natural infection and vaccination. The immune escape potential of Omicron is a serious concern and further needs to be explored. In the present study, we have assessed the IgG and neutralizing antibody (NAb) response in breakthrough individuals vaccinated with two doses ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (n=25), breakthrough individuals vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (n=8) and unvaccinated individuals (n=6). All these individuals were infected with Omicron variant. The IgG antibody activity in the sera of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 mRNA breakthrough individuals was comparable with S1-RBD, while it was lesser in BNT162b2 mRNA breakthrough individuals with N protein and inactivated whole antigen IgG ELISA. BNT162b2 mRNA breakthrough individuals showed moderate reduction in NAb GMTs compared to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against Alpha, Beta and Delta. However, 3-fold higher reduction was observed with omicron variant in BNT162b2 mRNA than ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Apparently, Alpha variant was modestly resistant to the sera of unvaccinated individuals than Beta, Delta and Omicron. Our study demonstrated substantial immune response in the individuals infected with Omicron. The neutralizing antibodies could effectively neutralize the Omicron and other VOCs including the most prevalent Delta variant.",

The interfaces between the subunits of the RdRp complex are highly conserved, facilitating the design of inhibitors with high affinity for the interaction hotspots of the complex. Here, we report development and application of a structural bioinformatics protocol to design peptides that can inhibit RdRp complex formation by targeting the interface of its core subunit nonstructural protein (nsp) 12 with accesory factor nsp7. We adopt a top-down approach for protein design by using interaction hotspots of the nsp7-nsp12 complex obtained from a long molecular dynamics trajectory as template. A large library of peptide sequences constructed from multiple hotspot motifs of nsp12 is screened in silico to determine peptide sequences with highest shape and interaction complementarity for the nsp7-nsp12 interface. Two lead designed peptide are extensively characterized using orthogonal bioanalytical methods to determine their suitability for inhibition of RdRp complexation and anti-viral activity. Their binding affinity to nsp7 (target), as determined from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay, is found to be comparable to that of the nsp7-nsp12 complex. Further, one of the designed peptides gives 46 % inhibition of nsp7-nsp12 complex at 10:1 peptide:nsp7 molar concentration (from ELISA assay). Further optimization of cell penetrability and target affinity of these designed peptides is expected to provide lead candidates with high anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Multisensory grasping movements (i.e., seeing and feeling a handheld object while grasping it with the contralateral hand) are superior to movements guided by each separate modality. This multisensory advantage might be driven by the integration of vision with either the haptic position only or with both position and size cues. To contrast these two hypotheses, we manipulated visual uncertainty (central vs. peripheral vision) and the availability of haptic cues during multisensory grasping. We showed a multisensory benefit irrespective of the degree of visual uncertainty suggesting that the integration process involved in multisensory grasping can be flexibly modulated by the contribution of each modality. Increasing visual uncertainty revealed the role of the distinct haptic cues. The haptic position cue was sufficient to promote multisensory benefits evidenced by faster actions with smaller grip apertures, whereas the haptic size was fundamental in fine-tuning the grip aperture scaling. These results support the hypothesis that, in multisensory grasping, vision is integrated with all haptic cues, with the haptic position cue playing the key part. Our findings highlight the important role of non-visual sensory inputs in sensorimotor control and hint at the potential contributions of the haptic modality in developing and maintaining visuomotor functions.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is being investigated as a therapeutic tool in several neuropsychiatric disorders, but its mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood and its effectiveness is highly variable from subject to subject. Some of this inter-subject variance is thought to stem from individual differences in head anatomy, which result in different electric field distributions across individuals for the same stimulation settings. In a recent block-randomized, sham-controlled pilot study, 18 older adults with mild-to-moderate motor and cognitive impairments underwent a 2-week, 10-session intervention of 2 mA bipolar tDCS with the anode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cathode over the right supraorbital region (anodal F3 vs. FP2 using sponge electrodes in the 10-20 EEG system). tDCS, compared to sham stimulation, improved average cognitive-motor performance over a two-week follow-up. For a subset of 12 participants from this cohort who underwent structural brain MRIs at baseline, we derived tDCS-induced electric field properties using MRI-derived realistic, individualized finite element modeling. We hypothesized that the electric field component orthogonal (En) to the cortex over the left DLPFC would correlate with observed cognitive-motor improvements. Across the 12 subjects the average tDCS-induced electric field over the target area was highly variable with a standard deviation of the surface average En over the left DLPFC of 21% of the mean. For those subjects who were randomized to tDCS intervention (n=6), those who exhibited greater improvement in cognitive-motor performance were exposed to greater normal component of the tDCS electric field averaged over the left DLPFC (r95 % [isin] [-0.99,-0.59]). In contrast, averaged over the right DLPFC, En was a poor predictor of outcome (r95 % [isin] [-0.08,0.97]), as was the amplitude of the current injected (a widely adopted dosing parameter). In light of these results, we conducted a retrospective modeling experiment using personalized montage optimization algorithms to achieve a desired En amplitude over the left DLPFC. The optimized montages induced an average En on the left DLPFC comparable to the bipolar montages, but with half the variability (standard deviation was 11% compared to 21% with bipolar montages). In addition, these results suggest that optimized multichannel montages afford more focal targeting, with lower \"spill-over\" of electric field onto other cortical areas. These proof-of-concept results, though based upon a small sample size, indicate that assessment of the E-field distribution is critical when evaluating the effects of tDCS intervention. They also reinforce the importance of controlled cortical electric field dosing in tDCS and the potential advantages of optimized multichannel stimulation.\n\nMain findings: O_LIThe lDPFC averaged normal component of the electric field correlated with cognitive-motor improvements following tDCS intervention.\nC_LIO_LIIn older adults, head and brain anatomical differences resulted in high inter-subject variability of tDCS-induced electric fields.\nC_LIO_LItDCS montages optimized from modeling and delivered via multichannel electrode arrays can control variance and maximize electric field on target, while minimizing effects elsewhere.\nC_LI",

Trichoderma isolates were identified based on molecular approaches and morphological characteristics followed by biodiversity analysis using different biodiversity indices. The antagonistic potential of Trichoderma isolates was evaluated against F. xylarioides using the dual confrontation technique and agar diffusion bioassays. A relatively high diversity of species was observed including 16 taxa and 11 undescribed isolates. Trichoderma asperellum, T. asperelloides and T. longibrachiatum were classified as abundant species, with dominance (Y) values of 0.062, 0.056 and 0.034, respectively. Trichoderma asperellum was the most abundant species (comprising 39.6% of all isolates) in all investigated coffee ecosystems. Shannons biodiversity index (H), the evenness (E), Simpsons biodiversity index (D), and the abundance index (J) were calculated for each coffee ecosystem, revealing that species diversity and evenness were highest in the Jimma zone (H =1.97, E = 0.76, D = 0.91, J = 2.73). The average diversity values for Trichoderma species originating from the coffee ecosystem were H = 1.77, D = 0.7, E = 0.75 and J = 2.4. In vitro confrontation experiments revealed that T. asperellum AU131 and T. longibrachiatum AU158 reduced the mycelial growth of F. xylarioides by over 80%. The potential use of these Trichoderma species for disease management of F. xylarioides and to reduce its impact on coffee cultivation is discussed in relation to Ethiopias ongoing coffee wilt disease crisis.",

    "abstract": "(S)-equol is an isoflavone with high estrogen-like activity and no toxic effects in the human body, and is only produced by some gut bacteria in vivo. It plays an important role in maintaining individual health, however, the dearth of resources associated with (S)-equol-producing bacteria has seriously restricted the production and application of (S)-equol. We report here a novel functional gene C1-07020 that was identified from a chick (S)-equol-producing bacterium (Clostridium C1). We found that recombinant protein of C1-07020 possessed similar function to daidzein reductase (DZNR), which can convert daidzein (DZN) into R/S-dihydrodaidzein (R/S-DHD). Interestingly, C1-07020 can reverse convert (R/S)-DHD (DHD oxidases) into DZN even without cofactors or anaerobic conditions. Additionally, high concentrations of (S)-equol can directly promote DHD oxidase but inhibit DZNR activity. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the amino acid Arg 75 was the active site of DHD oxidases. Subsequently, an engineered E. coli strain based on C1-07020 was constructed and showed higher yield of (S)-equol than the engineered bacteria from our previous work. Metagenomics analysis and PCR detection surprisingly revealed that C1-07020 and related bacteria may be prevalent in the gut of humans and animals and their (S)-equol production state may cause differed between (S)-equol producer and non-producer. Overall, a novel DZNR from Clostridium C1 was found and identified in this study, and its bidirectional enzyme activities and wide distribution in the gut of humans and animals provide alternative strategies for revealing the individual regulatory mechanisms of (S)-equol-producing bacteria.\n\nImportance(S)-equol is a final product of DZN that metabolized by some enteric bacteria. Although (S)-equol played very important roles in maintaining human health, larger differences in equol production varied between different populations. Here, a novel DZNR gene C1-07020, which related to (S)-equol production, was reported. The bidirectional enzyme functions and wide distribution of C1-07020 in human and animal gut provided additional insights into the metabolic regulation of (S)-equol. Additionally, C1-07020 can be used for improving the production of (S)-equol in vitro.",

We first developed a pipeline, using the Salmon pseudo-aligner and two different P. aeruginosa reference genomes (strains PAO1 and PA14), that transformed raw sequence data into a uniformly processed data in the form of sample-wise normalized counts. In this workflow, P. aeruginosa RNA-seq data are filtered using technically and biologically driven criteria with characteristics tailored to bacterial gene expression and that account for the effects of alignment to different reference genomes. The filtered data are then normalized to enable cross experiment comparisons. Finally, annotations are programmatically collected for those samples with sufficient meta-data and expression-based metrics are used to further enhance strain assignment for each sample. Our processing and quality control methods provide a scalable framework for taking full advantage of the troves of biological information hibernating in the depths of microbial gene expression data. The re-analysis of these data in aggregate is a powerful approach for hypothesis generation and testing, and this approach can be applied to transcriptome datasets in other species.\n\nSignificancePseudomonas aeruginosa causes a wide range of infections including chronic infections associated with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa infections are difficult to treat and people with CF-associated P. aeruginosa infections often have poor clinical outcomes. To aid the study of this important pathogen, we developed a methodology that facilitates analyses across experiments, strains, and conditions. We aligned, filtered for quality and normalized thousands of P. aeruginosa RNA-seq gene expression profiles that were publicly available via the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The workflow that we present can be efficiently scaled to incorporate new data and applied to the analysis of other species.",

    "abstract": "Accessibility to next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has enabled the profiling of microbial communities living in distinct habitats. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing is widely used for microbiota profiling with NGS technologies. Since most used NGS platforms generate short reads, sequencing the full-length 16S rRNA gene is impractical. Therefore, choosing which 16S rRNA hypervariable region to sequence is critical in microbiota profiling studies. All nine 16S rRNA hypervariable regions are taxonomically informative, but due to variability in profiling performance for specific clades, choosing the ideal 16S rRNA hypervariable region will depend on the bacterial composition of the habitat under study. Recently, NGS allowed the identification of microbes in the urinary tract, and urinary microbiota has become an active research area. However, there is no current study evaluating the performance of different 16S rRNA hypervariable regions for urinary microbiota profiling. We collected urine samples from male volunteers and profiled their urinary microbiota by sequencing a panel of six amplicons encompassing all nine 16S rRNA hypervariable regions. After systematically comparing their performance, we show that V1V2 hypervariable regions better assess the taxa commonly present in urine samples and V1V2 amplicon sequencing is more suitable for urinary microbiota profiling. We believe our results will be helpful to guide this crucial methodological choice in future urinary microbiota studies.",

    "abstract": "Presence of and selection for Listeria spp. and Listeria monocytogenes that are less effectively inactivated by quaternary ammonium compounds (such as benzalkonium chloride [BC]) is a food safety concern, including in fresh produce environments. An initial MIC assay on 67 produce-associated Listeria strains showed that strains carrying BC resistance genes bcrABC (n=10) and qacH (n=1) showed higher MIC (4-6 mg/L BC) compared to strains lacking these genes (MIC of 1-2 mg/L BC). Serial passaging experiments that exposed the 67 strains to increasing BC concentrations revealed that 62/67 strains showed growth in BC concentrations above their parent MIC (range of 4-20 mg/L). Two serially passaged isolates were obtained for each parent strain and substreaked onto BHI agar in the absence of BC for seven rounds; 105/134 substreaked isolates showed higher substreaked MIC (range of 4 - 6 mg/L) compared to parent MIC. These results suggested isolates acquired genetic adaptations that confer BC resistance. Substreaked isolates were characterized by a combination of whole genome sequencing and Sanger sequencing of fepR, a local repressor of the MATE family efflux pump FepA. These data identified nonsynonymous fepR mutations in 48/67 isolates including 24 missense, 16 nonsense, and 8 frameshift mutations. The mean inactivation of substreaked isolates after exposure to use level concentrations of BC (300 mg/L) was 4.48 log, which was not significantly different from inactivation observed in parent strains. Serial passage experiments performed on cocultures of Listeria strains containing bcrABC or qacH did not yield growth at higher BC concentrations than monoculture experiments.\n\nIMPORTANCEListeria resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds has been raised as a concern with regards to Listeria persistence in food environments, which can increase risk of product contamination, food recalls and foodborne illness outbreaks. Findings from our study show that individual Listeria strains can acquire genetic adaptations that confer resistance to low concentrations of benzalkonium chloride, but these genetic adaptations dont increase Listeria survival when exposed to concentrations of benzalkonium chloride used for food contact surface sanitation (300 mg/L). Our study also suggests that there is limited risk of benzalkonium chloride resistance genes bcrABC and qacH spreading through horizontal gene transfer and conferring enhanced resistance of L. monocytogenes to benzalkonium chloride. Overall, our study suggests that emergence of benzalkonium chloride resistant Listeria strains in food processing environments is of limited concern, as even strains adapted to gain higher MIC in vitro maintain full sensitivity to use level concentrations of benzalkonium chloride.",

    "abstract": "The pathways that impact longevity in the wake of dietary restriction (DR) pathway remain still ill-defined. Most studies have focused on nutrient limitation and perturbations of energy metabolism to explain the beneficial effects of DR. We showed that the essential amino acid L-threonine was elevated in Caenorhabditis elegans under DR, and that L-threonine supplementation increased its healthspan. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we conducted metabolic and transcriptomic profiling using LC-MS/MS and RNA-seq analyses in worms that were fed with RNAi to induce loss of function of key candidate mediators and evaluated healthspan. L-threonine supplementation and loss-of-threonine dehydrogenase, which govern L-threonine metabolism, increased the healthspan of C. elegans by attenuating ferroptosis in a ferritin-dependent manner. Tran-scriptomic analysis of C. elegans supplemented with L-threonine showed that FTN-1 encoding ferritin was elevated, implying FTN-1 is an essential mediator of longevity promotion through L-threonine. Organismal ferritin levels were positively correlated with chronological aging and L-thre-onine supplementation further increased ferritin levels, which protected against age-associated ferroptosis through the DAF-16 and HSF-1 pathways. Our investigation uncovered the role of a distinct and universal metabolite, L-threonine, in DR-mediated improvement in organismal healthspan, suggesting it could be an effective intervention for preventing senescence progression and age-induced ferroptosis.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity is a fundamental property of all natural systems existing in the field biology. It refers to the underlying heterogeneity at different levels of ecology, genetics and evolution. In case of plant systems, dramatic variability has been observed during the Anthropocene at different spatial scales. Environmental stress is one of the major influencing factors behind this plant biodiversity. Huge genetic diversity has been also demonstrated across varieties of important crop species like rice. Repetitive sequences which are a major contributor of genomic diversity in polyploidy plants have been found to occur ubiquitously in their genomes. To date diverse repeat types have been characterized in the plant genomes performing various functions starting from qualitative trait markers to genome evolution and stress management. With an objective to identify of plant stress associated genes using DNA repeat probes, a robust method has been developed. The method has been modularized into three distinct sections. First part is dedicated for identification of different types of repeats. Earlier review has suggested building a pipeline of multiples tools for capturing different types of repeats from the genome sequences. Specialized tools like TROLL, Tandem repeat finder (TRF), PHOBOS and database like REPBASE have been selected for performing this job. Second module is intended for screening of stress related genes from the published articles and databases and the last module has been designed for the association mining between genomic repetitive patterns with stress phenotypes. The method has been used to explore stress associated repeats from 9 Oryza species from different continents and other plants like Arabidopsis and Brachypodium. In case of Oryza species distribution repeats has been found to be significantly different between stress associated and housekeeping genes. More than 55% of the repeats are found to be in positive association (nPMI > 0) whereas 26% of the repeats are false-positives. These repetitive probes have been utilized in several applications. Firstly, using as molecular markers to identify stress related genes in different Oryza species where availability is limited. Secondly, using as a probe to reanalyzing the evolutionary lineage of Oryza species etc.",

    "abstract": "Backgrounds: Intrahepatic infiltration of neutrophils is a character of alcoholic acute-on-chronic liver failure (AACLF) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are an important strategy for neutrophils to fix and kill invading microorganisms. Intestinal bacteria and the gut-liver axis have been thought to play a key role in many liver diseases also including AACLF. However, whether NETs appear in AACLF and play a role in AACLF is still unsure. Methods: WT, NE KO, and TLR4 KO mice were used to build the AACLF model, and the intestinal bacteria were eliminated at the same time and LPS was given. Then the formation of NETs and AACLF related markers were detected. Results: The serum MPO-DNA and LPS concentration was increased in AACLF patients and a correlation was revealed between these two indexes. More intrahepatic NETs formed in AACLF mice by testing MPO-DNA, Cit H3, and NE. These markers decreased with gut detergent and restored markers with gut detergent plus LPS supplement. While NETs formation failed to change with gut microbiome or combine LPS supplement in TLR4 KO mice. As we tested AACLF related characters, liver injury, intrahepatic fat deposition, inflammation, and fibrosis alleviated with depletion of NE. These related marks were also attenuated with gut sterilization by antibiotics and recovered with combined treatment with antibiotics plus LPS. But the liver injury, intrahepatic fat, fibro deposition, and liver inflammation-related markers did show a significant difference in TLR4 KO mice when they received the same treatment. Conclusion: Intestinal-derived LPS promotes NETs formation in AACLF through the TLR4 pathway and further accelerates the AACLF process by NETs.",

Biological models at the single-cell level are intrinsically stochastic and nonlinear, creating formidable challenges for their statistical estimation which inevitably has to rely on approximations that trade accuracy for tractability. Despite intensive interest, a sweet spot in this trade off has not been found yet. We propose a flexible procedure for uncertainty quantification in a wide class of reaction networks describing stochastic gene expression including those with feedback. The method is based on creating a tractable coarse-graining of the model that is learned from simulations, a synthetic model, to approximate the likelihood function. We demonstrate that synthetic models can substantially outperform state-of-the-art approaches on a number of nontrivial systems and datasets, yielding an accurate and computationally viable solution to uncertainty quantification in stochastic models of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens, Diptera: Stratiomyidae) has been introduced across the globe, with numerous industry applications predicated on its tremendous growth during the larval stage. However, basic research on H. illucens biology (for example, studies of their central nervous system) are lacking. Despite their small brain volumes, insects are capable of complex behaviors; understanding how these behaviors are completed with such a small amount of neural tissue requires understanding processing power (e.g. number of cells) within the brain. Brain cell counts have been completed in only a few insect species (mostly Hymenoptera), and almost exclusively in adults. This limits the taxonomic breadth of comparative analyses, as well as any conclusions about how development and body size growth may impact brain cell populations. Here, we present the first images and cell counts of the H. illucens brain at four time points across development (early, mid, and late larval stages, and both male and female adults) using immunohistochemistry and isotropic fractionation. To assess sexual dimorphism in adults, we quantified the number of cells in the central brain vs. optic lobes of males and females separately. To assess if increases in body size during development might independently affect different regions of the CNS, we quantified the larval ventral nerve cord and central brain separately at all three stages. Together, these data provide the first description of the nervous system of a popular, farmed invertebrate and the first study of brain cell numbers using IF across developmental stages in any insect.",

    "abstract": "Cell differentiation involves profound changes in global gene expression that often have to occur in coordination with cell cycle exit. Because cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 reportedly regulates proliferation of neural progenitor cells in the subependymal neurogenic niche of the adult mouse brain, but can also have effects on gene expression, we decided to molecularly analyze its role in adult neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis. At the cell level, we show that p27 restricts residual cyclin-dependent kinase activity after mitogen withdrawal to antagonize cycling, but it is not essential for cell cycle exit. Contrasting gene expression with chromatin accessibility, we find that p27 is coincidentally necessary to globally repress many genes involved in the transit from multipotentiality to differentiation, including those coding for neural progenitor transcription factors SOX2, OLIG2, and ASCL1. Our data reveal both direct association of p27 with regulatory sequences in the three genes and an additional hierarchical relationship where p27 repression of the Sox2 gene leads to reduced levels of SOX2-downstream targets Olig2 and Ascl1. In vivo, p27 is also required for the regulation of the proper level of SOX2 necessary for neuroblasts and oligodendroglial progenitor cells to timely exit cell cycle in a lineage-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Neural activity has been shown to track hierarchical linguistic units in connected speech and these responses can be directly modulated by changes in speech intelligibility caused by spectral degradation. In the current study, we manipulate prior knowledge to increase the intelligibility of physically identical speech sentences and test the hypothesis that the tracking responses can be enhanced by this intelligibility improvement. Cortical magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses to intelligible speech followed by either the same (matched) or different (unmatched) unintelligible speech were measured in twenty-three normal hearing participants. Driven by prior knowledge, cortical coherence to \"abstract\" linguistic units with no accompanying acoustic cues (phrases and sentences) was enhanced relative to the unmatched condition, and was lateralized to the left hemisphere. In contrast, cortical responses coherent to word units, aligned with acoustic onsets, were bilateral and insensitive to contextual information changes. No such coherence changes were observed when prior experience was not available (unintelligible speech before intelligible speech). This dissociation suggests that cerebral responses to linguistic information are directly affected by intelligibility, which in turn are powerfully shaped by physical cues in speech. These results provide an objective and sensitive neural index of speech intelligibility, and explain why previous studies have reported no effect of prior knowledge on cortical entrainment.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to unfamiliar odorants induces an array of repetitive defensive and non-defensive behaviors in rodents which likely reflect adaptive stress responses to the uncertain valence of novel stimuli. Mice genetically deficient for dopamine {beta}-hydroxylase (Dbh-/-) lack the enzyme required to convert dopamine (DA) into norepinephrine (NE), resulting in globally undetectable NE and supranormal DA levels. Because catecholamines modulate novelty detection and reactivity, we investigated the effects of novel plant-derived odorants on repetitive behaviors in Dbh-/- mice and Dbh+/- littermate controls, which have catecholamine levels comparable to wild-type mice. Unlike Dbh+/- controls, which exhibited vigorous digging in response to novel odorants, Dbh-/- mice displayed excessive grooming. Drugs that block NE synthesis or neurotransmission suppressed odorant-induced digging in Dbh+/- mice, while a DA receptor antagonist attenuated grooming in Dbh-/- mice. The testing paradigm elicited high circulating levels of corticosterone regardless of Dbh genotype, indicating that NE is dispensable for this systemic stress response. Odorant exposure increased NE and DA abundance in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Dbh+/- mice, while Dbh-/- animals lacked NE and had elevated PFC DA levels that were unaffected by novel smells. Together, these findings suggest that novel odorant-induced increases in central NE tone contribute to repetitive digging and reflect psychological stress, while central DA signaling contributes to repetitive grooming. Further, we have established a simple method for repeated assessment of stress-induced repetitive behaviors in mice, which may be relevant for modeling neuropsychiatric disorders like Tourette syndrome or obsessive-compulsive disorder that are characterized by stress-induced exacerbation of compulsive symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to unfamiliar odorants induces an array of repetitive defensive and non-defensive behaviors in rodents which likely reflect adaptive stress responses to the uncertain valence of novel stimuli. Mice genetically deficient for dopamine {beta}-hydroxylase (Dbh-/-) lack the enzyme required to convert dopamine (DA) into norepinephrine (NE), resulting in globally undetectable NE and supranormal DA levels. Because catecholamines modulate novelty detection and reactivity, we investigated the effects of novel plant-derived odorants on repetitive behaviors in Dbh-/- mice and Dbh+/- littermate controls, which have catecholamine levels comparable to wild-type mice. Unlike Dbh+/- controls, which exhibited vigorous digging in response to novel odorants, Dbh-/- mice displayed excessive grooming. Drugs that block NE synthesis or neurotransmission suppressed odorant-induced digging in Dbh+/- mice, while a DA receptor antagonist attenuated grooming in Dbh-/- mice. The testing paradigm elicited high circulating levels of corticosterone regardless of Dbh genotype, indicating that NE is dispensable for this systemic stress response. Odorant exposure increased NE and DA abundance in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Dbh+/- mice, while Dbh-/- animals lacked NE and had elevated PFC DA levels that were unaffected by novel smells. Together, these findings suggest that novel odorant-induced increases in central NE tone contribute to repetitive digging and reflect psychological stress, while central DA signaling contributes to repetitive grooming. Further, we have established a simple method for repeated assessment of stress-induced repetitive behaviors in mice, which may be relevant for modeling neuropsychiatric disorders like Tourette syndrome or obsessive-compulsive disorder that are characterized by stress-induced exacerbation of compulsive symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Toxoplasma gondii is mainly due to tissue damage caused by the repeating lytic cycles of the parasite. Many proteins localized to the pellicle of the parasite, particularly kinases, have been identified as critical regulators of the Toxoplasma lytic cycle. However, little is known about the associated protein phosphatases. Phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL), a highly conserved tyrosine phosphatase, is an oncogene that plays pivotal roles in mammalian cells and typically associates with membranes via a conserved prenylation site. PRL in Toxoplasma has a predicted prenylation motif in the C-terminus like other homologs. We have determined that TgPRL localizes to the plasma membrane and that disruption of TgPRL results in a defect in the parasites ability to attach to host cells. This function is dependent both on TgPRLs membrane localization and phosphatase activity. Importantly, in vivo experiments have shown that while mice infected with parental strain parasites die within days of infection, those infected with parasites lacking TgPRL not only survive but also develop immunity that confers protection against subsequent infection with wild-type parasites. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the PRL-CNNM (Cyclin M) complex, which regulates intracellular Mg2+ homeostasis in mammalian cells, is also present in Toxoplasma. Consistent with this interaction, parasites lacking TgPRL had higher intracellular Mg2+ levels than the parental or complemented strains, suggesting TgPRL is involved in regulating intracellular Mg2+ homeostasis. Thus, TgPRL is a vital regulator of the Toxoplasma lytic cycle and virulence, showing its potential as a target of therapeutic intervention.\n\nIMPORTANCEInfection with Toxoplasma gondii can lead to severe and even life-threatening diseases in people with compromised or suppressed immune systems. Unfortunately, drugs to combat the parasite are limited, highly toxic, and ineffective against the chronic stage of the parasite. Consequently, there is a strong demand for the discovery of new treatments. A comprehensive understanding of how the parasite propagates in the host cells and which proteins contribute to the parasites virulence will facilitate the discovery of new drug targets. Our study meets this objective and adds new insights to understanding the lytic cycle regulation and virulence of Toxoplasma by determining that the protein phosphatase TgPRL plays a vital role in the parasites ability to attach to host cells and that it is essential for parasite virulence.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most prevalent inherited myopathy affecting children, caused by genetic loss of the gene encoding the dystrophin protein. There are currently four FDA-approved drugs for DMD that aim to restore expression of dystrophin by exon skipping using splice switching oligonucleotides. While these therapies require lifelong repeat administration, recent advancements in gene editing technologies have raised the possibility of achieving  permanent exon skipping, and thereby curing the disease with a single treatment. Here we have investigated the use of the Staphylococcus aureus CRISPR/Cas9 system and a double-cut strategy, delivered using a pair of AAV9 vectors, for dystrophin restoration in the severely-affected dystrophin/utrophin double knock-out (dKO) mouse. Single guide RNAs were designed to induce double-strand DNA breaks on either side of Dmd exon 23, such that the intervening exon 23 sequence is excised when the flanking intronic regions are joined via the non-homologous end joining repair pathway. Exon 23 deletion was confirmed at the DNA level by PCR and Sanger sequencing, and at the RNA level by RT-qPCR. Restoration of dystrophin protein expression was demonstrated by western blot and immunofluorescence staining in mice treated via either intraperitoneal or intravenous routes of delivery. Dystrophin restoration was most effective in the diaphragm, where a maximum of 5.7% of wild-type dystrophin expression was observed. CRISPR treatment was insufficient to extend lifespan in the dKO mouse, and dystrophin was expressed in a within-fiber patchy manner in skeletal muscle tissues. Further analysis revealed a plethora of non-productive DNA repair events, including AAV genome integration at the CRISPR cut sites. This study highlights potential challenges for the successful development of CRISPR therapies in the context of DMD.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a paediatric muscle-wasting disorder caused by genetic loss of the gene encoding the dystrophin protein. Therapies that restore dystrophin expression are presumed to correct the disease, with antisense-mediated exon skipping being the leading approach. In this study, we aimed to determine whether exon skipping using a peptide-phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PPMO) conjugate results in dose-dependent restoration of uniform dystrophin localization, together with correction of putative DMD serum and muscle biomarkers. To this end, dystrophin-deficient mdx mice were treated with a PPMO (Pip9b2-PMO) designed to induce Dmd exon 23 skipping and dystrophin rescue at single, ascending intravenous doses (3, 6, or 12 mg/kg) and sacrificed two weeks later. Dose-dependent exon skipping and dystrophin protein restoration were observed. Importantly, dystrophin expression was uniformly distributed at the sarcolemma of corrected myofibers at all doses. The abundance of serum microRNA biomarkers (i.e. miR-1a-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-206-3p, miR-483-3p) and creatinine kinase were restored towards wild-type levels after treatment in a dose-dependent manner. All biomarkers were strongly anti-correlated with both exon skipping level and dystrophin expression. Dystrophin rescue was also strongly positively correlated with muscle stiffness (i.e. Youngs modulus) as determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation assay. These data demonstrate that PPMO-mediated exon skipping generates myofibers with uniform dystrophin expression, and that both serum miRNA biomarkers and muscle AFM have potential utility as pharmacodynamic biomarkers of dystrophin restoration therapy in the context of DMD.",

The paper focuses on Raman imaging as a tool to explore apoptosis and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondrial dysfunctions. The Raman results demonstrate alterations in the oxidation-reduction pathways associated with cytochrome c. We found that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine downregulates the concentration of cytochrome c upon incubation with tumorous lung cells. Concentration of oxidized form of cytochrome c in mitochondria of lung cells decreases upon incubation the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Lower concentration of oxidized cytochrome c in mitochondria illustrates lower effectiveness of oxidative phosphorylation (respiration), reduced apoptosis and lessened ATP production. Moreover, mRNA vaccine increases significantly de novo lipids synthesis in lipid droplets up to 96 hours and alterations in biochemical composition. It seems that lipid composition of cells returns to the normal level for longer incubation time (14 days). In cell nucleus the mRNA vaccine does not produce statistically significant changes. The observed alterations in biochemical profiles upon incubation with mRNA vaccine in the specific organelles of the tumorous lung cells are similar to those we observe for other types of cancers, particularly brain glial cells.",

    "abstract": "A structural protein of SARS-CoV-2, nucleocapsid (N) protein is abundantly expressed during viral replication. The N protein is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 on the serine/arginine (SR) rich motif located in disordered regions. Although phosphorylation by GSK-3{beta} constitutes a critical event for viral replication, the molecular mechanism underlying N phosphorylation is not well understood. In this study, we found the putative alpha-helix L/FxxxL/AxxRL motif known as the GSK-3 interacting domain (GID), commonly found in many endogenous GSK-3{beta} binding proteins, such as Axins, FRATs, WWOX and GSKIP. Indeed, N interacts with GSK-3{beta} similarly to Axin, and Leu to Glu substitution of the GID abolished the interaction, with loss of N phosphorylation. Unlike with endogenous GID proteins, the N interaction neither disturbs endogenous GSK-3 activity nor regulates subsequent canonical Wnt activity and the Snail-EMT program. Notably, N abundance in SARS-CoV-2 is incomparably high compared to other coronaviruses, such as 229E, OC43 and HKU1. Compared to other coronaviruses, N harbors a CDK1 primed phosphorylation site and Gly-rich linker for enhanced phosphorylation by GSK-3{beta}. Furthermore, we found that the S202R mutant found in Delta and R203K/G204R mutant found in the Omicron variant allows increased abundance and hyper-phosphorylation of N. Our observations suggest that the emergence of GID and mutations for increased phosphorylation in N may have contributed to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and evolution of variants, respectively. Further study, especially in a BSL3-equipped facility, is required to elucidate the functional importance of GID and N phosphorylation in SARS-CoV-2 and variants.",

    "abstract": "Vegetation productivity is increasing across much of the U.S. Northern Great Plains but is decreasing in some nearby Northern Rocky Mountain grasslands due to increases in aridity. Mountain grasslands support critical ecosystem services that are under threat from ongoing land use and climate changes, and it is important to understand their function across all changing seasons. Observing the full range of montane ecosystem productivity is challenging because site access is often difficult during the \"shoulder seasons\" in spring and autumn if the snowpack is not fully developed or degrading. It is unclear if decreases to montane grassland productivity from drying autumns can be offset in part by late-season green-ups after precipitation events. These include the snowfall/snowmelt periods that often characterize the summer-to-winter transition in the Northern Rockies. Here, we quantify the ecosystem carbon uptake that occurs after snowfall and melt in climatological autumn (September, October, and November) in a montane grassland in Montana, USA using a combination of eddy covariance, phenological camera, and remote sensing analyses. Carbon dioxide flux follows a diurnal pattern after autumn snowmelt events despite overall ecosystem losses of C, suggesting that post-snowmelt photosynthesis helps dampen C loss during autumn and provides fresh photosynthate to support ecosystem functioning. Light-saturated photosynthesis after two snow events was not different than before snowfall ([~]6 {micro}mol CO2 m-2 s-1 in 2016 and [~]2.5 {micro}mol CO2 m-2 s-1 in 2017); observations are consistent with the notion that canopy photosynthesis is resistant, rather than resilient, to the first snow disturbances. MODIS observations also suggest that post-snowfall increases in NDVI can occur but do not happen every year, such that late-season photosynthesis is not a reliable source of fresh photosynthate. These late-season carbon uptake events likely play a small role in the annual ecosystem carbon balance but may be disproportionately important for organisms faced with dwindling late-season forage and regrowth in spring. Future efforts should seek to understand the community and ecosystem consequences of vegetation functioning during autumn as part of an expanded effort to understand phenological changes during this under-studied and changing time of year.",

    "abstract": "Enhancers are regulatory elements of genomes that determine spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression. The human genome contains a vast number of enhancers, which largely outnumber protein-coding genes. Classically, enhancers have been regarded as highly tissue-specific. However, recent evidence suggests that many enhancers are pleiotropic, with activity in multiple developmental contexts. Yet, the extent and impact of pleiotropy remain largely unexplored. In this study we predicted active enhancers across human organs based on the analysis of both eRNA transcription (FANTOM5 consortium datasets) and chromatin architecture (ENCODE consortium datasets). We show that pleiotropic enhancers are pervasive in the human genome and that most enhancers active in a particular organ are also active in other organs. In addition, our analysis suggests that the proportion of context-specific enhancers of a given organ is explained, at least in part, by the proportion of context-specific genes in that same organ. The notion that such a high proportion of human enhancers can be pleiotropic suggests that small regions of regulatory DNA contain abundant regulatory information and that these regions evolve under important evolutionary constraints.\n\nSignificance statementThe human genome contains a vast number of regulatory elements, named enhancers, that control the tempo and mode of gene expression. Classically, enhancers have been regarded as genetic elements that are active in a single organ, but recent evidence suggests that many enhancers in animal genomes are active in multiple organs (i.e., are pleiotropic). Here we shed light on the architecture of non-coding human DNA by showing that a large percentage of the enhancers of the human genome are pleiotropic and that the majority of enhancers active in a particular organ are pleiotropic. This suggests that small regions of regulatory DNA may contain abundant regulatory information and that these regions evolve under important evolutionary constraints.",

    "abstract": "The Million Veteran Program (MVP) participants represent 100 years of US history, including significant social and demographic change over time. Our study assessed two aspects of the MVP: (i) longitudinal changes in population diversity and (ii) how these changes can be accounted for in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The MVP was divided into five birth cohorts (N-range=123,888 [born from 1943-1947] to 136,699 [born from 1948-1953]). Groups of participants were defined by (i) HARE (harmonized ancestry and race/ethnicity) and (ii) a random-forest clustering approach using the 1000 Genomes Project and the Human Genome Diversity Project (1kGP+HGDP) reference panels (77 world populations representing six continental groups). In these groups, we performed GWASs of height, a trait potentially affected by population stratification. Birth cohorts demonstrate important trends in ancestry diversity over time. More recent HARE-assigned Europeans, Africans, and Hispanics had lower European ancestry proportions than older birth cohorts (0.010<Cohens d<0.259, p<7.80x10-4). Conversely, HARE-assigned East Asians showed an increase in European ancestry proportion over time. In GWAS of height using HARE assignments, genomic inflation due to population stratification was prevalent across all birth cohorts (linkage disequilibrium score regression intercept=1.08{+/-}0.042). The 1kGP+HGDP-based ancestry assignment significantly reduced the population stratification (mean intercept reduction=0.045{+/-}0.007, p<0.05) confounding in the GWAS statistics. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of ancestry diversity of the MVP cohort over time and highlights that more refined modeling of genetic diversity (e.g., the 1kGP+HGDP-based ancestry assignment) can more accurately capture the polygenic architecture of traits and diseases that could be affected by population stratification.",

Signs of progress have been achieved but are still limited. This paper intends to prove the existence of at least three genomic signature patterns and at least seven subtypes of COVID-19 driven by five critical genes (the smallest subset of genes). These signatures and subtypes provide crucial genomic information in COVID-19 diagnosis (including ICU patients), research focuses, and treatment methods. Unlike existing approaches focused on gene fold-changes and pathways, gene-gene nonlinear and competing interactions are the driving forces in finding the signature patterns and subtypes. Furthermore, the method leads to 100% accuracy, which shows biological and mathematical equivalences between COVID-19 status and the signature patterns and a methodological advantage over other existing methods that cannot lead to 100% accuracy. As a result, as new biomarkers, the new findings can be much more informative than other findings for interpreting biological mechanisms, developing the second (third) generation of vaccines, antiviral drugs, and treatment methods, and eventually bringing new hopes to an end of the pandemic.",

The introduction of mutation with ordered 630-loop induces structural changes toward S-G614 Cryo-EM structure. An ordered 630-loop weakens the stabilizing interactions of the anionic D614, suggesting its disorder in wild-type. The mutation allosterically alters the receptor binding domain (RBD) forming an asymmetric and mobile Down conformation, which facilitate Up transition. The loss of D614_K854 salt-bridge upon mutation, generally stabilize S-protein protomer, including the fusion peptide proximal region that mediates membrane fusion. Understanding of the molecular basis of D614G is crucial as it dominates in all variants of concern including Delta and Omicron.",

    "abstract": "The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had devastating impacts on our global health. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19, has continued to mutate and spread worldwide despite global vaccination efforts. In particular, the Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa in late November 2021, has now overtaken the Delta variant and become the dominant strain worldwide. Compared to the original strain identified in Wuhan, Omicron features 50 genetic mutations, with 15 mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, which binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for viral entry. However, it is not completely understood how these mutations alter the interaction and binding strength between the Omicron RBD and ACE2. In this study, we used a combined steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation and experimental microscale thermophoresis (MST) approach to quantify the interaction between Omicron RBD and ACE2. We report that the Omicron brings an enhanced RBD-ACE2 interface through N501Y, Q493K/R, and T478K mutations; the changes further lead to unique interaction patterns, reminiscing the features of previously dominated variants, Alpha (N501Y) and Delta (L452R and T478K). Our MST data confirmed that the Omicron mutations in RBD are associated with a five-fold higher binding affinity to ACE2 compared to the RBD of the original strain. In conclusion, our result could help explain the Omicron variants prevalence in human populations, as higher interaction forces or affinity for ACE2 likely promote greater viral binding and internalization, leading to increased infectivity.\n\nTOC GRAPHIC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=159 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/477633v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1997fcborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@951e96org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b3956org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e15ef9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to mutate and evolve with the emergence of omicron (B.1.1.529) as the new variant of concern. The rapid spread of this variant regionally and globally could be an allusion to increased infectivity, transmissibility, and antibody resistance. The omicron variant has a large set of mutations in its spike protein, specifically in the receptor binding domain (RBD), reflecting their significance in ACE2 interaction and antibody recognition. We have carried out the present study to understand how these mutations structurally impact the binding of the antibodies to their target epitope. We have computationally evaluated the binding of different classes of RBD targeted antibodies, namely, CB6 (etesevimab), REGN10933 (casirivimab), S309 (sotrovimab), and S2X259 to the omicron mutation-induced RBD. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations unveil the binding affinity and stability of the antibody-RBD complexes. All the four antibodies show reduced binding affinity towards the omicron RBD. The therapeutic antibody CB6 aka etesevimab was substantially affected due to numerous omicron mutations occurring in its target epitope. This study provides a structural insight into the reduced efficacy of RBD targeting antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant.",

    "abstract": "Summary paragraphIn sexually propagating organisms, genetic and epigenetic mutations are evolutionarily relevant only if they occur in the germline and provide inherited information to the next generation. In contrast to most animals, plants are thought to lack an early segregating germline, implying that somatic cells can contribute genetic information to the progeny. Here we demonstrate that two ARGONAUTE proteins, AGO5 and AGO9, mark an early-segregating germline. Both AGOs are loaded with dynamically changing populations of small RNAs derived from highly methylated, pericentromeric, long transposons. Sequencing single nuclei revealed that many of these transposons are co-expressed within an AGO5/9 expression domain of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). This indicates a host-parasite tug of war and specific silencing pathways along the plant germline throughout development. Our results open the path to investigate transposon biology and epigenome dynamics at cellular resolution in the SAM stem cell niche.",

    "abstract": "Inflammasomes integrate cytosolic evidence of infection or damage to mount inflammatory responses. The inflammasome sensor NLRP1 is expressed in human keratinocytes and coordinates inflammation in the skin. We found that diverse stress signals converge on the activation of p38 kinases to initiate human NLRP1 inflammasome assembly: UV irradiation and microbial molecules that initiate the ribotoxic stress response critically relied on the MAP3 kinase ZAK to activate p38 and ultimately human NLRP1. Infection with insect-transmitted alphaviruses, including Semliki Forest, Ross River, and Chikungunya virus, also activated NLRP1 in a p38-dependent manner. In the absence on ZAK, inflammasome assembly was maintained, although at reduced levels, indicating contribution of other upstream kinases. NLRP1 activation by direct nanobody-mediated ubiquitination was independent of p38 activity. Stimulation of p38 by overexpression of MAP2 kinases MKK3 or MKK6 is sufficient for NLRP1 activation, and NLRP1 is directly phosphorylated by p38. Taken together, we define p38 activation as a unifying signaling hub that controls NLRP1 inflammasome activation by integrating a variety of cellular stress signals relevant to the skin.",

We sought to broaden understanding of consortia members and interactions by combining multiple methods including analysis of natural and cultivated microbial communities. By analysing the microbial community composition and co-occurrence patterns of a lake time-series we were able to identify potential consortia involved in methane cycling. In combination with methane flux, we also analysed the community composition and co-occurrence patterns of reduced microbial model communities with inoculum from the same lake. While the network analyses confirmed many known associations, when combined with results from mixed cultures, we noted new players in methane cycling. Cultivated model communities were shown to be an effective method to explore the rarer but still important players in methane cycling and for identifying new putative members. Here we show that using multiple methods to approach the complex problem of methane cycling consortia yields not just insights into the known taxa but highlights potential new members creating new hypotheses to be tested.",

In contrast to gut-targeting administration of beneficial bacteria against respiratory viral disease, topical URT administration of probiotics is currently underexplored, especially for the prevention and/or treatment of viral infections. Here, we report the selection and formulation of a broad-acting throat spray with live lactobacilli which induce interferon regulatory pathways and are able to inhibit respiratory viruses. Rational selection of Lactobacillaceae strains was based on safety, applicability, and potential antiviral and immunostimulatory efficacy in the URT. Three strains, Lacticaseibacillus casei AMBR2, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum WCFS1 significantly reduced the cytopathogenic effects of RSV, influenza A/H1N1 and B viruses, and HCoV-229E coronavirus in co-culture models with bacteria, virus and host cells. Subsequently, these strains were formulated in a throat spray and human monocytes were employed to confirm the formulation process did not reduce the interferon regulatory pathway-inducing capacity. Administration of the throat spray in healthy volunteers revealed that the lactobacilli were capable of temporary colonization of the throat in a metabolically active form.",

    "abstract": "Alkaline fluids venting from chimneys of the Lost City hydrothermal field flow from a potentially vast microbial habitat within the seafloor where energy and organic molecules are released by chemical reactions within rocks uplifted from Earths mantle. In this study, we investigated hydrothermal fluids venting from Lost City chimneys as windows into subseafloor environments where the products of geochemical reactions, such as hydrogen (H2), formate, and methane, may be the only available sources of energy for biological activity. Our deep sequencing of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from these hydrothermal fluids revealed a few key species of archaea and bacteria that are likely to play critical roles in the subseafloor microbial ecosystem. We identified a population of Thermodesulfovibrionales (belonging to phylum Nitrospirae) as a prevalent sulfate-reducing bacterium that may be responsible for much of the consumption of H2 and sulfate in Lost City fluids. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) classified as Methanosarcinaceae and Candidatus Bipolaricaulota were also recovered from venting fluids and represent potential methanogenic and acetogenic members of the subseafloor ecosystem. These genomes share novel hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenase-like sequences that may be unique to hydrothermal and subsurface alkaline environments where hydrogen and formate are much more abundant than carbon dioxide. The results of this study include multiple examples of metabolic strategies that appear to be advantageous in hydrothermal and subsurface environments where energy and carbon are provided by geochemical reactions.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe Lost City hydrothermal field is an iconic example of a microbial ecosystem fueled by energy and carbon from Earths mantle. Uplift of mantle rocks into the seafloor can trigger a process known as serpentinization that releases hydrogen and creates unusual environmental conditions where simple organic carbon molecules are more stable than dissolved inorganic carbon. This study provides an initial glimpse into the kinds of microbes that live deep within the seafloor where serpentinization takes place, by sampling hydrothermal fluids exiting from the Lost City chimneys. The metabolic strategies that these microbes appear to be using are also shared by microbes that inhabit other sites of serpentinization, including continental subsurface environments and natural springs. Therefore, the results of this study contribute to a broader, interdisciplinary effort to understand the general principles and mechanisms by which serpentinization-associated processes can support life on Earth and perhaps other worlds.",

In microbiology this is known as the \"inoculum effect\". Its mechanistic basis is unclear with possible explanations ranging from the independent actions of individual cells, to collective actions of populations of cells. Progress requires precise measurement of lag time distributions while at the same time, experimentally controlling inoculum size. Here we use a millifluidic droplet device in which the growth dynamics of hundreds of populations founded by different numbers of Pseudomonas fluorescens cells, ranging from a single cell, to one thousand cells, were followed in real time. Our data show that lag phase decreases with inoculum size. The average decrease, variance across droplets, and distribution shapes, follow predictions of extreme value theory, where the inoculum lag time is determined by the minimum value sampled from the single-cell distribution. Our experimental results show that exit from lag phase depends on strong interactions among cells, consistent with a \"leader-cell\" triggering end of lag phase for the entire population.",

However, our understanding of LCMV and its interactions with human host factors remain incomplete. Here, host determinants affecting LCMV infection were investigated through a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in A549 cells, a human lung adenocarcinoma line. We identified and validated a variety of novel host factors that play a functional role in LCMV infection. Among these, knockout of the sialomucin CD164, a heavily glycosylated transmembrane protein, was found to ablate infection with multiple LCMV strains but not other hemorrhagic mammarenaviruses, in several cell types. Further characterization revealed a dependency of LCMV entry on the cysteine-rich domain of CD164, including a N-linked glycosylation site at residue 104 in that region. Given the documented role of LCMV with respect to transplacental human infections, CD164 expression was investigated in human placental tissue and placental cell lines. CD164 was found to be highly expressed in the cytotrophoblast cells, an initial contact site for pathogens within the placenta, and LCMV infection in placental cells was effectively blocked using a monoclonal antibody specific to the cysteine-rich domain of CD164. Together, this study identifies novel factors associated with LCMV infection of human tissues, and highlights the importance of CD164, a sialomucin that has previously not been associated with viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Genome complexity is largely linked to diversification and crop innovation. Examples of regions with duplicated genes with relevant roles in agricultural traits are found in many crops. In both duplicated and non-duplicated genes, much of the variability in agronomic traits is caused by large as well as small and middle scale structural variants (SVs), which highlights the relevance of the identification and characterization of complex variability between genomes for plant breeding. Here we improve and demonstrate the use of CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment combined with long-read sequencing technology to resolve the MYB10 region in the linkage group 3 (LG3) of Japanese plum (Prunus salicina), which has a length from 90 kb to 271 kb according to the P. salicina genomes available. We demonstrate the high complexity of this region, with homology levels between Japanese plum varieties comparable to those between Prunus species. We cleaved MYB10 genes in five plum varieties using the Cas9 enzyme guided by a pool of crRNAs. The barcoded fragments were then pooled and sequenced in a single MinION Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) run, yielding 194 Mb of sequence. The enrichment was confirmed by aligning the long reads to the plum reference genomes, with a mean read on-target value of 4.5% and a depth per sample of 11.9x. From the alignment, 3,261 SNPs and 287 SVs were called and phased. A de novo assembly was constructed for each variety, which also allowed detection, at the haplotype level, of the variability in this region. CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment is a versatile and powerful tool for long-read targeted sequencing even on highly duplicated and/or polymorphic genomic regions, being especially useful when a reference genome is not available. Potential uses of this methodology as well as its limitations are further discussed.",

Both proteins bind directly to U1 snRNA independently of canonical U1 snRNP specific proteins, and they are required for the selection and effective processing of weak 5SSs. Our results reveal that mammalian cells use non-canonical splicing factors bound directly to U1 snRNA to effectively select suboptimal 5SS sequences in hundreds of genes, promoting proper splice site choice and accurate pre-mRNA splicing.",

It was previously shown that shuttling of HNRNPK to the cytoplasm promotes cell proliferation and cancer metastasis. However, the mechanism of HNRNPK cytoplasmic localization, its cytoplasmic RNA ligands, and impact on posttranscriptional gene regulation remain uncharacterized. Here we show that the intermediate filament protein Keratin 19 (K19) directly interacts with HNRNPK and sequesters it in the cytoplasm. Correspondingly, in K19 knockout breast cancer cells, HNRNPK does not localize in the cytoplasm, resulting in reduced cell proliferation. We mapped cytoplasmic HNRNPK target mRNAs using PAR-CLIP where transcriptome data to show that, in the cytoplasm, HNRNPK stabilizes target mRNAs bound to the 3 untranslated region at the expected C-rich sequence elements. Furthermore, these mRNAs are typically involved in cancer progression and include the p53 signaling pathway that is dysregulated upon HNRNPK knockdown or K19 knockout. This study identifies how a cytoskeletal protein can directly regulate gene expression by controlling subcellular localization of RNA binding proteins to support pathways involved in cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "A proliferated and post-translationally modified microtubule network underlies cellular growth in cardiac hypertrophy and contributes to contractile dysfunction in heart failure. Yet how the heart achieves this modified network is poorly understood. Determining how the \"tubulin code\" - the permutations of tubulin isoforms and post-translational modifications - is rewritten upon cardiac stress may provide new targets to modulate cardiac remodeling. Further, while tubulin can autoregulate its own expression, it is unknown if autoregulation is operant in the heart or tuned in response to stress. Here we use heart failure patient samples and murine models of cardiac remodeling to interrogate transcriptional, autoregulatory, and post-translational mechanisms that contribute to microtubule network remodeling at different stages of heart disease. We find that autoregulation is operant across tubulin isoforms in the heart and leads to an apparent disconnect in tubulin mRNA and protein levels in heart failure. We also find that within 4 hours of a hypertrophic stimulus and prior to cardiac growth, microtubule detyrosination is rapidly induced to help stabilize the network. This occurs concomitant with rapid transcriptional and autoregulatory activation of specific tubulin isoforms and microtubule motors. Upon continued hypertrophic stimulation, there is an increase in post-translationally modified microtubule tracks and anterograde motors to support cardiac growth, while total tubulin content increases through progressive transcriptional and autoregulatory induction of tubulin isoforms. Our work provides a new model for how the tubulin code is rapidly rewritten to establish a proliferated, stable microtubule network that drives cardiac remodeling, and provides the first evidence of tunable tubulin autoregulation during pathological progression.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of RNA-binding proteins are often linked to a wide range of human disease in general, and particularly with neurological conditions. Gemin5 is a member of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) complex, a ribosome-binding protein and a translation reprogramming factor. Recently, pathogenic mutations in Gemin5 protein have been reported but the functional consequences of these variants remain elusive. Here we report functional and structural deficiencies associated with compound heterozygosity variants within the Gemin5 gene found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. These clinical variants are located in key domains of Gemin5, the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-like dimerization module and the non-canonical RNA-binding site 1 (RBS1). We show that the TPR-like variants disrupt protein dimerization while the RBS1 variant confers protein instability. All mutants are defective in the interaction with protein networks involved in translation and RNA-driven pathways. Importantly, the TPR-like variants fail to associate with native ribosomes, abolishing the cap-dependent and selective translation control of Gemin5, and establishing a functional difference with the wild type protein. Our study provides a molecular basis of disease associated with malfunction of Gemin5 protein.",

In extant biology, tRNAs are selectively aminoacylated by enzymes using high-energy intermediates, but how this might have been achieved prior to the advent of protein synthesis has been a largely unanswered question in prebiotic chemistry. We have now elucidated a novel, prebiotically plausible stereoselective aminoacyl-RNA synthesis which starts from RNA-amino acid phosphoramidates and proceeds via phosphoramidate-ester intermediates which subsequently undergo conversion to aminoacyl-esters by mild acid hydrolysis. The chemistry avoids the intermediacy of high-energy mixed carboxy-phosphate anhydrides and is greatly favored under eutectic conditions, which also potentially allow for the requisite pH fluctuation through the variable solubility of CO2 in solid/liquid water.",

    "abstract": "Medulloblastomas (MB), the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor and a leading cause of childhood mortality, are stratified into four primary subgroups. Deletions within chromosomal locus 17p13.3, which houses multiple tumor suppressor genes including miR-1253, characterize high-risk group 3 tumors. These aggressive tumors also enrich iron transport genes to satisfy their high proliferative need. MiR-1253 targets iron transport by inhibiting the mitochondrial Fe-S transporter, ABCB7. This study elucidated the impact of repressing ABCB7 on cisplatin cytotoxicity in group 3 MB and whether these effects were mediated by ferroptosis. In silico and in vitro analyses revealed specific enrichment of ABCB7 and GPX4, a critical regulator of ferroptosis, in group 3 MB cell lines and tumors. MiR-1253 overexpression (miR-1253OE) resulted in downregulation of both ABCB7 and GPX4, concurrently increasing mitochondrial iron overload, mitochondrial oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation, leading to cell death and abrogation of medullosphere formation; repressing ABCB7 (si-ABC7 and ABCB7KO) recapitulated these effects and abrogated GPX4 expression. Fractionation studies confirmed the inhibitory impact of ABCB7 repression on GPX4 expression. Seahorse studies further revealed mitochondrial dysfunction with ABCB7 repression. Cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent used in group 3 MB treatment, induces cell death by DNA crosslinking; it also inhibits GPX4 expression and may trigger ferroptosis. In ABCB7-repressed group 3 cancer cells, cisplatin IC50 was reduced 2-fold. Resultantly, cisplatin treatment augmented oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, depleted glutathione stores, and culminated in a higher index of cell death via ferroptosis. In an orthotopic group 3 tumor model, ABCB7KO potentiated cisplatin, prolonging survival and reducing tumor burden. Taken together, the current study illustrates how targeting iron transport can augment ferroptosis to potentiate cisplatin cytotoxicity in group 3 MB tumors.",

    "abstract": "Novel therapeutic approaches combining immune checkpoint inhibitors are needed to improve clinical outcomes for patients with cancer. Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) is an immune checkpoint molecule that inhibits T-cell activity and antitumor immune responses, acting through an independent mechanism from that of programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). Here, we describe the development and preclinical characterization of relatlimab, a human antibody that binds to human LAG-3 with high affinity and specificity to block the interaction of LAG-3 with the ligands MHC II and fibrinogen like protein-1, and to reverse LAG-3-mediated inhibition of T-cell function in vitro. Consistent with previous reports, in mouse models, the combined blockade of LAG-3 and PD-1 with surrogate antibodies resulted in enhanced anti-tumor activity greater than the individual blockade of either receptor. In toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, relatlimab was generally well tolerated when combined with nivolumab. These results are consistent with findings from the RELATIVITY-047 phase 2/3 trial showing that relatlimab combined with nivolumab is a well-tolerated regimen that demonstrated superior progression-free survival compared with nivolumab monotherapy in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nSynopsisPreclinical studies demonstrate that relatlimab specifically blocks the interaction between LAG-3 and its ligands, and provide a biological rationale for combining relatlimab with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab as an effective cancer immunotherapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "Human NLRP1 is a multifunctional inflammasome sensor predominantly expressed in skin and airway epithelium; however its function in skin-specific immunity and its mechanisms of activation are not fully understood. Here we report that human NLRP1 is specifically activated by the ZAK[a]- driven ribotoxic stress response pathway (RSR) induced by ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation or select microbial ribotoxins. Biochemically, RSR-triggered NLRP1 activation requires ZAK[a]- dependent hyperphosphorylation of a human-specific linker region of NLRP1 (NLRP1DR), leading to the  functional degradation of the auto-inhibitory NLRP1 N-terminal fragment. Additionally, we show that fusing NLRP1DR to the signaling domains of CARD8, which in itself is insensitive to RSR, creates a minimal inflammasome sensor for UVB and ribotoxins. In summary, these discoveries resolve the mechanisms of UVB sensing by human NLRP1, identify ZAK[a]-activating toxins as novel human NLRP1 activators, and establish NLRP1 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis as an integral component of the ribotoxic stress response in primary human cells.

However, the mechanisms underlying DI-mediated antiviral immunity have not been extensively explored. Here, we demonstrated interferon (IFN) independent protection conferred by influenza DI virus against homologous virus infection in mice deficient in type I and III IFN signaling. By integrating transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory data we identified unique host signatures in response to DI co-infection. DI-treated mice exhibited reduced viral transcription, less intense inflammatory and innate immune responses, and primed multiciliated cell differentiation in their lungs at an early stage of infection, even in the absence of type I or III IFNs. Overall, our study provides mechanistic insight into the protection mediated by DIs, implying a unifying theme involving inflammation and multiciliogenesis in maintaining respiratory homeostasis, and reveals their IFN-independent antiviral activity.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection is potently inhibited by human myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2/MxB), which binds to the viral capsid and blocks the nuclear import of viral DNA. We have recently shown that phosphorylation is a key regulator of MX2 antiviral activity, with phosphorylation of serine residues at positions 14, 17 and 18 repressing MX2 function. Here, we extend the study of MX2 post-translational modifications, and identify serine and threonine phosphorylation in all domains of MX2. By substituting these residues with aspartic acid or alanine, hence mimicking the presence or absence of a phosphate group, respectively, we identified key positions that control MX2 antiviral activity. Aspartic acid substitutions of residues Ser306 or Thr334 and alanine substitutions of Thr343 yielded proteins with substantially reduced antiviral activity, whereas the presence of aspartic acid at positions Ser28, Thr151 or Thr343 resulted in enhanced activity: referred to as hypermorphic mutants. In some cases, these hypermorphic mutations, particularly when paired with other MX2 mutations (e.g., S28D/T151D or T151D/T343A) acquired the capacity to inhibit HIV-1 Capsid mutants known to be insensitive to wild type MX2, such as P90A or T210K, as well as MX2-resistant retroviruses such as equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) and murine leukaemia virus (MLV). This work highlights the complexity and importance of MX2 phosphorylation in the regulation of antiviral activity, and in the selection of susceptible viral substrates.\n\nAuthor summaryProductive infection by human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) requires the import of viral replication complexes into the nuclei of infected cells. Myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2/MxB) blocks this step, halting nuclear accumulation of viral DNA and virus replication. We recently demonstrated how phosphorylation of a stretch of three serines in the amino-terminal domain of MX2 inhibits the antiviral activity. Here, we identify additional positions in MX2 whose phosphorylation status reduces or enhances antiviral function (hypomorphic and hypermorphic variants, respectively). Importantly, hypermorphic mutant proteins not only increased inhibitory activity against wild type HIV-1, but can also exhibit antiviral capabilities against HIV-1 Capsid mutant viruses that are resistant to wild type MX2. Furthermore, some of these proteins were also able to inhibit retroviruses that are insensitive to MX2. Therefore, we propose that phosphorylation comprises a major element of MX2 regulation and substrate determination.",

Tau condensates have been linked to both functional microtubule binding and pathological aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases. We find that molecular crowding and coacervation with RNA, likely coexisting in the cytosol, synergize to enable Tau condensation at physiological buffer conditions and produce condensates with a strong affinity to charged surfaces. During condensate-mediated microtubule polymerization, this synergy enhances bundling and spatially arranges microtubules. We further show that different Tau condensates efficiently induce pathological Tau in cells, including small accumulations at the nuclear envelope that correlate with nucleocytoplasmic transport deficits. Fluorescent lifetime imaging reveals different molecular packing densities of Tau in cellular accumulations, and a condensate-like density for nuclear envelope Tau. These findings suggest that a complex interplay between interaction partners, post-translational modifications, and molecular crowding regulates the formation and function of Tau condensates. Conditions leading to prolonged existence of Tau condensates may induce the formation of seeding-competent Tau and lead to distinct cellular Tau accumulations.",

How these gamma motor neurons acquire properties to function differently from the muscle force-producing alpha motor neurons remains unclear. Here, we found that upon selective loss of the orphan nuclear receptors Err2 and Err3 (Err2/3) in mice, gamma motor neurons acquire characteristic structural (e.g. synaptic wiring), but not functional (e.g. physiological firing rates) properties necessary for regulating muscle proprioception, thus disrupting gait and precision movements in vivo. Moreover, Err2/3 operate via transcriptional activation of neural activity modulators, one of which (Kcna10) promoted gamma motor neuron functional properties. Our work identifies a long-sought mechanism specifying gamma motor neuron properties necessary for proprioceptive movement control, which implies a  feature-specific terminal differentiation program implementing neuron subtype-specific functional but not structural properties.\n\nSummaryThe transcription factors Err2 and 3 promote functional properties in a subset of motor neurons necessary for executing precise movements.",

    "abstract": "The proper function of the nervous system is dependent on the appropriate timing of neuronal firing. Synapses continually undergo rapid activity-dependent modifications that require feedback mechanisms to maintain network activity within a window in which communication is energy efficient and meaningful. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) and homeostatic intrinsic plasticity (HIP) are such negative feedback mechanisms. Accumulating evidence implicates that Alzheimers disease (AD)-related amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its cleavage product amyloid-beta (A{beta}) play a role in the regulation of neuronal network activity, and in particular HSP. AD features impaired neuronal activity with regional early hyper-activity and A{beta}-dependent hyperexcitability has also been demonstrated in AD transgenic mice. We demonstrate similar hyper-activity in AD transgenic neurons in culture that have elevated levels of both human APP and A{beta}. To examine the individual roles of APP and A{beta} in promoting hyperexcitability we used an APP construct that does not generate A{beta}, or elevated A{beta} levels independently of APP. Increasing either APP or A{beta} in wild type (WT) neurons leads to increased frequency and amplitude of calcium transients. Since HSP/HIP mechanisms normally maintain a setpoint of activity, we examined whether homeostatic synaptic/intrinsic plasticity was altered in AD transgenic neurons. Using methods known to induce HSP/HIP, we demonstrate that APP protein levels are regulated by chronic modulation of activity and show that AD transgenic neurons have an impaired response to global changes in activity. Further, AD transgenic compared to WT neurons failed to adjust the length of their axon initial segments (AIS), an adaptation known to alter excitability. Thus, we present evidence that both APP and A{beta} influence neuronal activity and that mechanisms of HSP/HIP are disrupted in neuronal models of AD.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder associated with deficits in social communication and stereotypical behaviors. Numerous ASD-related genetic mutations have been identified and genome editing methods have been developed but successful genome editing in the whole-brain scale to alleviate autistic-like behaviors in animal models has not been achieved. Here we report the development of a new CRISPR-mediated cytidine base editor (CBE) system, which converts C{middle dot}G base pairs to T{middle dot}A. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this system by targeting an ASD-associated de novo mutation in the MEF2C gene (c.104T>C, p.L35P). We constructed a Mef2c L35P knock-in mouse and observed that Mef2c L35P heterozygous mice displayed autistic-like behaviors, including deficits in social behaviors and repetitive behaviors. We programmed the CBE to edit the C{middle dot}G base pairs of the mutated Mef2c gene (c.104T>C, p.L35P) to T{middle dot}A base pairs and delivered it via a single dose intravenous injection of blood brain barrier (BBB)-crossing AAV-PHP.eB vector into the mouse brain. This treatment restored MEF2C protein levels and reversed impairments in social interactions and repetitive behaviors in Mef2c L35P heterozygous mice. Together, this work presents an in vivo gene editing strategy in which correcting a single nucleotide mutation in the whole-brain scale could be successfully achieved, further providing a new therapeutic framework for neurodevelopmental disorders.",
