    "abstract": "Aedes spp. comprise the primary group of mosquitoes that transmit arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses to humans, and thus these insects pose a significant burden on public health worldwide. Advancements in next-generation sequencing and metagenomics have expanded our knowledge on the richness of RNA viruses harbored by arthropods such as Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus; increasing evidence suggests that vectorial competence can be modified by the microbiome (comprising both bacteriome and virome) of mosquitoes present in endemic zones. Using an RNA-seq-based metataxonomic approach, this study determined the virome structure of field-caught Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes in Medellin, Colombia, a municipality with a high incidence of mosquito-transmitted arboviruses. The two species are sympatric, but their core viromes differed considerably in richness, diversity, and abundance; the viromes were dominated by a few viruses. BLAST searches of assembled contigs suggested that at least 17 virus species (16 of which are insect-specific viruses [ISVs]) infect the Ae. aegypti population. Dengue virus 3 was detected in one sample. In Ae. albopictus, up to 11 ISVs and one plant virus were detected. Therefore, the virome composition was species-specific. The bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia was identified in all Ae. albopictus samples and in some Ae. aegypti samples collected after 2017. The presence of Wolbachia sp. in Ae. aegypti was not related to significant changes in the richness, diversity, or abundance of this mosquitos virome, although it was related to an increase in the abundance of Aedes aegypti To virus 2 (unclassified). The mitochondrial diversity of these mosquitoes suggested that the Ae. aegypti population underwent a change that started in the second half of 2017, which coincides with the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in Medellin, indicating that the population of wMel-infected mosquitoes has expanded. However, additional studies are required on the dispersal speed and intergenerational stability of wMel in Medellin and nearby areas as well as on the introgression of genetic variants in the native mosquito population.",

    "abstract": "WRKY transcription factor (TF) family regulates various developmental and physiological functions in plants. PAL genes encode enzymes which are involved in plant defense responses, but the direct regulation of PAL genes and phenylpropanoid pathway through WRKY TFs is not well characterized. In the present study, we have characterized an OscWRKY1 gene from O. sanctum which shows induced expression after methyl jasmonate (MeJA), salicylic acid (SA), and wounding. Recombinant OscWRKY1 protein binds to the W-box cis-element TTGAC[C/T] and activates the reporter gene in yeast. Overexpression of OscWRKY1 enhances Arabidopsis resistance towards Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato Pst DC3000. Upstream activator sequences of PAL and C4H have identified the conserved W-box cis-element (TTGACC) in both O. sanctum and Arabidopsis. OscWRKY1 was found to interact with W-box cis-element present in the PAL and C4H promoters. Silencing of OscWRKY1 using VIGS resulted in reduced expression of PAL, C4H, COMT, F5H and 4CL transcripts. OscWRKY1 silenced plants exhibit reduced PAL activity, whereas, the overexpression lines of OscWRKY1 in Arabidopsis exhibit increased PAL activity. These results revealed that OscWRKY1 positively regulates the phenylpropanoid pathway genes and enhances the resistance against bacterial pathogen in Arabidopsis.",

Striga hermonthica is an obligate, root-parasitic plant of cereal hosts in sub-Saharan Africa, causing devastating yield losses. Understanding the molecular nature and allelic variation of VFs in S. hermonthica is essential for breeding resistance and delaying the evolution of parasite virulence.\nC_LIO_LIWe assembled the S. hermonthica genome and identified secreted proteins by in silico prediction. Pooled sequencing of parasites growing on a susceptible and a strongly resistant rice host allowed us to scan for loci where selection imposed by the resistant host had elevated the frequency of alleles contributing to successful colonisation.\nC_LIO_LIThirty-eight putatively secreted VFs had extremely different allele frequencies with functions including host cell wall modification, protease inhibitors, oxidoreductase and kinase activities. These candidate loci had significantly higher Tajimas D than the genomic background, consistent with balancing selection.\nC_LIO_LIOur results reveal diverse strategies used by S. hermonthica to overcome different layers of host resistance. Understanding the maintenance of variation at virulence loci by balancing selection will be critical to managing the evolution of virulence as a part of a sustainable control strategy.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Information in speech and music is often conveyed through changes in fundamental frequency (f0), perceived by humans as \"relative pitch\". Relative pitch judgments are complicated by two facts. First, sounds can simultaneously vary in timbre due to filtering imposed by a vocal tract or instrument body. Second, relative pitch can be extracted in two ways: by measuring changes in constituent frequency components from one sound to another, or by estimating the f0 of each sound and comparing the estimates. We examined the effects of timbral differences on relative pitch judgments, and whether any invariance to timbre depends on whether judgments are based on constituent frequencies or their f0. Listeners performed up/down and interval discrimination tasks with pairs of spoken vowels, instrument notes, or synthetic tones, synthesized to be either harmonic or inharmonic. Inharmonic sounds lack a well-defined f0, such that relative pitch must be extracted from changes in individual frequencies. Pitch judgments were less accurate when vowels/instruments were different compared to when they were the same, and were biased by the associated timbre differences. However, this bias was similar for harmonic and inharmonic sounds, and was observed even in conditions where judgments of harmonic sounds were based on f0 representations. Relative pitch judgments are thus not invariant to timbre, even when timbral variation is naturalistic, and when such judgments are based on representations of f0.",

    "abstract": "Global biodiversity is organized into biogeographic regions that comprise distinct biotas. The contemporary factors maintaining differences in species composition between biogeographic regions are poorly understood. Given the evidence that populations with sufficient genetic variation can adapt to fill new habitats, it is surprising that we do not see more homogenization of species assemblages among regions. Theory suggests that the expansion of populations across biogeographic transition zones could be limited by environmental gradients that affect population demography in ways that could limit adaptive capacity, but this has not been empirically explored. Using three independently curated data sets describing continental patterns of mammalian demography and population genetics, we show that populations closer to biogeographic transition zones have lower effective population sizes and genetic diversity, and are more genetically differentiated. These patterns are consistent with reduced adaptive capacity near biogeographic transition zones. The consistency of these patterns across mammalian species suggests they are stable, predictable, and generalizable in their contribution to long-term limits on expansion and homogenization of biodiversity across biogeographic transition zones. Understanding the contemporary processes acting on populations that maintain differences in the composition of regional biotas is crucial for our basic understanding of the current and future organization of global biodiversity. The importance of contemporary, population-level processes on the maintenance of global biogeographic regions suggests that biogeographic boundaries are susceptible to environmental perturbation associated with human-caused global change.",

    "abstract": "Social behaviors such as cooperation are crucial for mammals. A deeper knowledge of the neuronal mechanisms underlying cooperation can be beneficial for people suffering from pathologies with impaired social behavior. Our aim was to study the brain activity when two animals synchronize their behavior to obtain a mutual reinforcement. In a previous work, we showed that the activity of the prelimbic cortex (PrL) was enhanced during cooperation in rats, especially in the ones leading most cooperative trials (leader rats). In this study, we investigated the specific cell type/s in the PrL contributing to cooperative behaviors. To this end, we collected rats brains at key moments of the learning process to analyze the levels of c-FOS expression in the main cellular groups of the PrL (glutamatergic cells containing D1 and D2 receptors and interneurons). Leader rats showed increased c-FOS activity in cells expressing D1 receptors during cooperation. In addition, we analyzed the levels of anxiety, dominance, and locomotor behavior, finding that leader rats are in general less anxious and less dominant than followers. We also recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the PrL, the nucleus accumbens septi (NAc), and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Spectral analysis showed that delta activity in PrL and NAc increased when rats cooperated, while BLA activity in delta and theta bands decreased considerably during cooperation. The PrL and NAc also increased their connectivity in the high theta band during cooperation. Thus, the present work identifies the specific PrL cell types engaged in this behavior, as well as its connectivity with subcortical brain regions (BLA, NAc) during cooperation.\n\nSignificance StatementBrain mechanisms underlying cooperative behaviors remain unknown. The present study identified specific neuronal types from the PrL cortex engaged in the acquisition of a cooperative task, as well as their connectivity with subcortical projection sites, such as the NAc and the BLA during cooperation. Rats leading the cooperation trials (designated leaders) presented an increased activation of D1-containing neurons in the PrL during cooperation. The PrL and NAc electrical activity increased when rats were cooperating, while the BLA activity increased before cooperation. The PrL and NAc showed increased functional connectivity at the moment of cooperation on the platform, whereas during the individual phase the highest connectivity was found before the animals climbed individually onto the platform.",
