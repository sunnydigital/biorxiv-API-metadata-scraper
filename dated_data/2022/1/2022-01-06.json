    "abstract": "Classical models of efficient coding in neurons assume simple mean responses-- tuning curves--such as bellshaped or monotonic functions of a stimulus feature. Real neurons, however, can be more complex: grid cells, for example, exhibit periodic responses which impart the neural population code with high accuracy. But do highly accurate codes require fine tuning of the response properties? We address this question with the use of a benchmark model: a neural network with random synaptic weights which result in output cells with irregular tuning curves. Irregularity enhances the local resolution of the code but gives rise to catastrophic, global errors. For optimal smoothness of the tuning curves, when local and global errors balance out, the neural network compresses information from a high-dimensional representation to a low-dimensional one, and the resulting distributed code achieves exponential accuracy. An analysis of recordings from monkey motor cortex points to such  compressed efficient coding. Efficient codes do not require a finely tuned design--they emerge robustly from irregularity or randomness.",

    "abstract": "fMRI studies that investigate somatotopic tactile representations in the human cortex typically use either block or phase-encoded stimulation designs. Event-related (ER) designs allow for more flexible and unpredictable stimulation sequences than the other methods, but they are less efficient. Here we compared an efficiency-optimized fast ER design (2.8s average intertrial interval, ITI) to a conventional slow ER design (8s average ITI) for mapping voxelwise fingertip tactile tuning properties in the sensorimotor cortex of 6 participants at 7 Tesla. The fast ER design yielded more reliable responses compared to the slow ER design, but with otherwise similar tuning properties. Concatenating the fast and slow ER data, we demonstrate in each individual brain the existence of two separate somatotopically-organized tactile representations of the fingertips, one in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) on the post-central gyrus, and the other shared across the motor and pre-motor cortices on the pre-central gyrus. In both S1 and motor representations, fingertip selectivity decreased progressively, from narrowly-tuned Brodmann areas 3b and 4a respectively, towards associative parietal and frontal regions that responded equally to all fingertips, suggesting increasing information integration along these two pathways. In addition, fingertip selectivity in S1 decreased from the cortical representation of the thumb to that of the pinky.\n\nSignificance StatementSensory and motor cortices in the human brain contain map-like representations of the body in which adjacent brain regions respond to adjacent body parts. The properties of these somatotopic maps provide important insight into how tactile and motor information is processed by the brain. Here, we describe an efficient mapping method using functional MRI to measure somatotopic maps and their tuning properties. We used a fast event-related sequence to map the five fingers of the left hand in six human participants, and show that this method is more efficient than a conventional, slower event-related design. Furthermore, we confirm previously-identified tuning properties of fingertip representations in somatosensory cortex, and reveal a hitherto unknown tactile fingertip map in the motor cortex.",

    "abstract": "Learning plays a key role in the function of many neural circuits. The cerebellum is considered a  learning machine essential for time interval estimation underlying motor coordination and other behaviors. Theoretical work has proposed that the cerebellums input recipient structure, the granule cell layer (GCL), performs pattern separation of inputs that facilitates learning in Purkinje cells (P-cells). However, the relationship between input reformatting and learning outcomes has remained debated, with roles emphasized for pattern separation features from sparsification to decorrelation. We took a novel approach by training a minimalist model of the cerebellar cortex to learn complex time-series data from naturalistic inputs, in contrast to traditional classification tasks. The model robustly produced temporal basis sets from naturalistic inputs, and the resultant GCL output supported learning of temporally complex target functions. Learning favored surprisingly dense granule cell activity, yet the key statistical features in GCL population activity that drove learning differed from those seen previously for classification tasks. Moreover, different cerebellar tasks were supported by diverse pattern separation features that matched the demands of the tasks. These findings advance testable hypotheses for mechanisms of temporal basis set formation and predict that population statistics of granule cell activity may differ across cerebellar regions to support distinct behaviors.",

    "abstract": "A rich repertoire of oscillatory signals is detected from human brains with electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). However, the principles underwriting coherent oscillations and their link with neural activity remain under debate. Here, we revisit the mechanistic hypothesis that transient brain rhythms are a signature of metastable synchronization, occurring at reduced collective frequencies due to delays between brain areas. We consider a system of damped oscillators in the presence of background noise - approximating the short-lived gamma-frequency oscillations generated within neuronal circuits - coupled according to the diffusion weighted tractography between brain areas. Varying the global coupling strength and conduction speed, we identify a critical regime where spatially and spectrally resolved metastable oscillatory modes (MOMs) emerge at sub-gamma frequencies, approximating the MEG power spectra from 89 healthy individuals at rest. Further, we demonstrate that the frequency, duration, and scale of MOMs - as well as the frequency-specific envelope functional connectivity - can be controlled by global parameters, while the connectome structure remains unchanged. Grounded in the physics of delay-coupled oscillators, these numerical analyses demonstrate how interactions between locally generated fast oscillations in the connectome spacetime structure can lead to the emergence of collective brain rhythms organized in space and time.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal alteration is at the centre of memory decline in the most common age-related neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimers disease (AD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). However, the subregional deterioration of the hippocampus differs between both diseases with more severe atrophy in the CA1 subfield of the AD patients. How AD and DLB-typical pathologies compose the various local microenvironment of the hippocampus across AD and DLB needs to be further explored to understand this process. Additionally, microglia responses could further impact the atrophy rate. Some studies suggest that microglia react differently according to the underlying neurodegenerative disorder. How microglia are transformed across hippocampal subfields in AD and DLB, and how their changes are associated with disease-typical pathologies remains to be determined. To these purposes, we performed a volumetric analysis of phospho-Tau (P-Tau), Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), and phospho--Synuclein (P-Syn) loads, quantified and classified microglia according to distinct morphological phenotypes using high-resolution confocal 3D microscopy of hippocampal CA1, CA3 and DG/CA4 subfields of late-onset AD (n=10) and DLB (n=8) as well as age-matched control samples (n=11).\n\nWe found that each of the Tau, A{beta} and Synuclein pathologies followed a specific subregional distribution, relatively preserved across AD and DLB. P-Tau, A{beta} and P-Syn burdens were significantly exacerbated in AD, with Tau pathology being particularly severe in the AD CA1. P-Tau and P-Syn burdens were highly correlated across subfields and conditions (R2Spear = 0.79; P < 0.001) and result from a local co-distribution of P-Tau and P-Syn inclusions in neighbouring neurons, with only a low proportion of double-positive cells.\n\nIn parallel, we assessed the changes of the microglia responses by measuring 16 morphological features of more than 35,000 individual microglial cells and classifying them into seven-distinct morphological clusters. We found microglia features- and clusters-variations subfield- and condition-dependent. Two of the seven morphological clusters, with more amoeboid and less branched forms, were identified as disease-enriched and found to be further increased in AD. Interestingly, some microglial features or clusters were associated with one but more often with a combination of two pathologies in a subfield-dependent manner.\n\nIn conclusion, our study shows a multimodal association of the hippocampal microglia responses with the co-occurrence, distribution and severity of AD and DLB pathologies. In DLB hippocampi, pathological imprint and microglia responses follow AD trends but with lesser severity. Our study suggests that the increased pathological burdens of P-Tau and P-Syn and associated microglia alterations are involved in a more severe deterioration of the CA1 in AD as compared to DLB.",

    "abstract": "Central autonomic cardiorespiratory dysfunction underlies sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Here we used single cell neuronal Ca2+ imaging and intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA)-induced chronic epilepsy in mice to investigate progressive changes in key cardiorespiratory brainstem circuits during chronic epilepsy. Following induction of status epilepticus (SE), adaptive ventilatory responses to hypercapnia were reduced in mice with chronic epilepsy for 5 weeks post-SE with partial recovery at week 7. These changes were paralleled by post-SE alterations in the chemosensory responses of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN). Neurons that displayed adapting responses to hypercapnia were less prevalent and exhibited smaller responses over weeks 3-5, whereas neurons that displayed graded responses to hypercapnia became more prevalent by week 7. Over the same period, chemosensory responses of the presympathetic rostral ventrolateral medullary neurons showed no change. Mice with chronic epilepsy showed enhanced sensitivity to seizures, which can invade the RTN and possibly impair further the chemosensory circuits. Our work suggests that assessment of respiratory chemosensitivity may have potential for identifying people at risk of SUDEP.",

    "abstract": "As a complex dynamic system, the brain exhibits spatially organized recurring patterns of activity over time. Coactivation patterns (CAPs), which analyzes data from each single frame, has been utilized to detect transient brain activity states recently. However, previous CAP analyses have been conducted at the group-level, which might neglect meaningful individual differences. Here, we estimate individual CAP states at both subject- and scan-level based on a densely-sampled dataset: Midnight Scan Club. We used differential identifiability, which measures the gap between intra- and intersubject similarity, to evaluate individual differences. We found individual CAPs at the subject-level achieved the best discrimination ability by maintaining high intra-subject similarity and enlarging inter-subject differences, and brain regions of association networks mainly contributed to the identifiability. On the other hand, scan-level CAP states were unstable across scans for the same participant. Expectedly, we found subject-specific CAPs became more reliable and discriminative with more data (i.e., longer duration). As the acquisition time of each participant is limited in practice, our results recommend a data collection strategy that collects more scans with appropriate duration (e.g., 12~15 mins/scan) to obtain more reliable subject-specific CAPs, when total acquisition time is fixed (e.g., 150 mins). Overall, this work has constructed reliable subject-specific CAP states with meaningful individual differences and provides a starting point for the subsequent applications of individual brain dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Imaging technologies are increasingly used to generate high-resolution reference maps of brain structure and function. Modern scientific discovery relies on making comparisons between new maps (e.g. task activations, group structural differences) and these reference maps. Although recent data sharing initiatives have increased the accessibility of such brain maps, data are often shared in disparate coordinate systems (or \"spaces\"), precluding systematic and accurate comparisons among them. Here we introduce the neuromaps toolbox, an open-access software package for accessing, transforming, and analyzing structural and functional brain annotations. We implement two registration frameworks to generate high-quality transformations between four standard coordinate systems commonly used in neuroimaging research. The initial release of the toolbox features >40 curated reference maps and biological ontologies of the human brain, including maps of gene expression, neurotransmitter receptors, metabolism, neurophysiological oscillations, developmental and evolutionary expansion, functional hierarchy, individual functional variability, and cognitive specialization. Robust quantitative assessment of map-to-map similarity is enabled via a suite of spatial autocorrelation-preserving null models. By combining open-access data with transparent functionality for standardizing and comparing brain maps, the neuromaps software package provides a systematic workflow for comprehensive structural and functional annotation enrichment analysis of the human brain.",

    "abstract": "The lysosome is a dynamic signaling organelle that is critical for cell functioning. It is a regulated calcium store that can contribute to Ca2+-regulated processes via both local calcium release and more globally by influencing ER Ca2+ release. Here, we provide evidence from studies of an authentic mouse model of the lysosomal storage disease Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) that has reduced lysosomal Ca2+ levels, and genetically modified mice in which the two-pore lysosomal Ca2+ release channel family are deleted that lysosomal Ca2+ signaling is required for normal pro-inflammatory responses. We demonstrate that production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1{beta} via the NLRP3 inflammasome is significantly reduced in murine Niemann-Pick Type C, the inhibition is selective because secretion of TNF is not diminished and it is a consequence of inefficient inflammasome priming. Synthesis of precursor ProIL-1{beta} is significantly reduced in macrophages genetically deficient in the lysosomal protein Npc1, which is mutated in most clinical cases of NPC, and in wild type cells in which Npc1 activity is pharmacologically inhibited. Comparable reductions in ProIL-1{beta} generation were measured in vitro and in vivo by macrophages (M{Phi}) genetically altered to lack expression of the two-pore lysosomal Ca2+ release channels Tpcn1 or Tpcn2. These data demonstrate a requirement for lysosome-dependent Ca2+ signaling in the generation of specific pro-inflammatory responses.",

We analysed population genomic data and tested for cryptic species in 160 Ae. albopictus sampled from 16 locations across this region. We found no evidence of cryptic Ae. albopictus but found multiple intraspecific COI haplotypes partitioned into groups representing three Asian lineages: East Asia, Southeast Asia and Indonesia. Papua New Guinea (PNG), Vanuatu and Christmas Island shared recent coancestry, and Indonesia and Timor-Leste were likely invaded from East Asia. We used a machine learning trained on morphologically sexed samples to classify sexes using multiple genetic features and then characterized the wAlbA and wAlbB Wolbachia infections in 664 other samples. The wAlbA and wAlbB infections as detected by qPCR showed markedly different patterns in the sexes. For females, most populations had a very high double infection incidence, with 67% being the lowest value (from Timor-Leste). For males, the incidence of double infections ranged from 100% (PNG) to 0% (Vanuatu). Only 6 females were infected solely by the wAlbA infection, while rare uninfected mosquitoes were found in both sexes. The wAlbA and wAlbB densities varied significantly among populations. For mosquitoes from Torres Strait and Vietnam, the wAlbB density was similar in single-infected and superinfected (wAlbA and wAlbB) mosquitoes. There was a positive association between wAlbA and wAlbB infection densities in superinfected Ae. albopictus. Our findings provide no evidence of cryptic species of Ae. albopictus in the region and suggest site-specific factors influencing the incidence of Wolbachia infections and their densities. We also demonstrate the usefulness of SNPs as sex-specific mosquito markers.

However, estimating the rates of state-switching can be difficult, because experimentally measuring a cells transcriptome often involves destroying the cell, so it can only be measured once. In this paper, we propose a computational method to estimate the rate of switching between expression states, given data from a Luria-Delbruck style fluctuation test that is experimentally simple and feasible.

    "abstract": "Automating dynamic fine root data collection in the field is a longstanding challenge with multiple applications for co-interpretation and synthesis for ecosystem understanding. High frequency root data are only achievable with paired automated sampling and processing. However, automatic minirhizotron (root camera) instruments are still rare and data is often not collected in natural soils nor analysed at high temporal resolution. Instruments must also be affordable for replication and robust under variable natural conditions.\n\nHere, we show a system built with off-the-shelf parts which samples at sub-daily resolution. We paired this with a neural network to analyse all images collected. We performed two mesocosm studies and two field trials alongside ancillary data collection (soil CO2 efflux, temperature and moisture content, and  PhenoCam-derived above-ground dynamics. We produce robust daily time-series of root dynamics under all conditions. Temporal root changes were a stronger driver than absolute biomass on soil CO2 efflux in mesocosm. Proximal sensed above ground dynamics and belowground from minirhizotron data were not synchronised. Root properties extracted were sensitive to soil moisture and occasionally to time of day (potentially relating to soil moisture). This may only affect high frequency imagery and should be considered in interpreting such data.\n\nHIGHLIGHTCompletely automatic root dynamics with method transferrable between field settings.",

    "abstract": "Morphology remains a primary source of phylogenetic information for many groups of organisms, and the only one for most fossil taxa. Organismal anatomy is not a collection of randomly assembled and independent  parts, but instead a set of dependent and hierarchically nested entities resulting from ontogeny and phylogeny. How do we make sense of these dependent and at times redundant characters? One promising approach is using ontologies--structured controlled vocabularies that summarize knowledge about different properties of anatomical entities, including developmental and structural dependencies. Here we assess whether the proximity of ontology-annotated characters within an ontology predicts evolutionary patterns. To do so, we measure phylogenetic information across characters and evaluate if it is hierarchically structured by ontological knowledge--in much the same way as phylogeny structures across-species diversity. We implement an approach to evaluate the Bayesian phylogenetic information (BPI) content and phylogenetic dissonance among ontology-annotated anatomical data subsets. We applied this to datasets representing two disparate animal groups: bees (Hexapoda: Hymenoptera: Apoidea, 209 chars) and characiform fishes (Actinopterygii: Ostariophysi: Characiformes, 463 chars). For bees, we find that BPI is not substantially structured by anatomy since dissonance is often high among morphologically related anatomical entities. For fishes, we find substantial information for two clusters of anatomical entities instantiating concepts from the jaws and branchial arch bones, but among-subset information decreases and dissonance increases substantially moving to higher level subsets in the ontology. We further applied our approach to address particular evolutionary hypotheses with an example of morphological evolution in miniature fishes. While we show that ontology does indeed structure phylogenetic information, additional relationships and processes, such as convergence, likely play a substantial role in explaining BPI and dissonance, and merit future investigation. Our work demonstrates how complex morphological datasets can be interrogated with ontologies by allowing one to access how information is spread hierarchically across anatomical concepts, how congruent this information is, and what sorts of processes may structure it: phylogeny, development, or convergence.",

Our knowledge on HGF relies on detection methods that exploit some of its signatures left on extant genomes. One of them is the effect of HGF on branch lengths of constructed phylogenies. This signature has been formalized in statistical tests for HGF detection, and used for example to detect massive adaptive gene flows in malaria vectors or to order evolutionary events involved in eukaryogenesis. However these studies rely on the assumption that ghost lineages (all unsampled extant and extinct taxa) have little influence. We demonstrate here with simulations and data re-analysis, that when considering the more realistic condition that unsampled taxa are legion compared to sampled ones, the conclusion of these studies become unfounded or even reversed. This illustrates the necessity to recognize the existence of ghosts in evolutionary studies.",

    "abstract": "Across vertebrates, live-bearing has evolved at least 150 times from the ancestral state of egg-laying into a diverse array of forms and degrees of prepartum maternal investment. A key question is how this diversity of reproductive modes arose and whether reproductive diversification underlies species diversification? To test these questions, we evaluate the most basal jawed vertebrates, Chondrichthyans, which have one of the greatest ranges of reproductive and ecological diversity among vertebrates. We reconstructed the sequence of reproductive mode evolution across a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of 610 chondrichthyans. We find that egg-laying is ancestral, and that live-bearing evolved at least seven times. Matrotrophy (i.e. additional maternal contributions) evolved at least 15 times, with evidence of one reversal. In sharks, transitions to live-bearing and matrotrophy are more prevalent in larger-bodied species in the tropics. Further, the evolution of live-bearing is associated with a near-doubling of the diversification rate, but, there is only a small increase in diversification associated with the appearance of matrotrophy. The chondrichthyan diversification and radiation, particularly throughout the shallow tropical shelf seas and oceanic pelagic habitats, appears to be associated with the evolution of live-bearing and the proliferation of a wide range of maternal investment in their developing offspring.",

Agos bind small RNAs (sRNAs) including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) to form the functional core of the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). The sRNA is used as a guide to target mRNAs containing either partially or fully complementary sequences, ultimately leading to down regulation of the corresponding proteins. It was previously shown that the kinase CK1 phosphorylates a cluster of residues in the eukaryotic insertion (EI) of Ago, leading to the alleviation of miRNA-mediated repression through an undetermined mechanism. We show that binding of miRNA-loaded human Ago2 to target RNA with complementarity to the seed and 3 supplemental regions of the miRNA primes the EI for hierarchical phosphorylation by CK1. The added negative charges electrostatically promote target release, freeing Ago to seek out additional targets once it is dephosphorylated. The high conservation of potential phosphosites in the EI suggests that such a regulatory strategy may be a shared mechanism for regulating miRNA-mediated repression.",

Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) is a promising strategy to map how amino acids contribute to protein structure and function and to advance clinical variant interpretation. Here, we introduce 7,429 single residue missense mutation into the Inward Rectifier K+ channel Kir2.1 and determine how this affects folding, assembly, and trafficking, as well as regulation by allosteric ligands and ion conduction. Our data provides high-resolution information on a cotranslationally{-}folded biogenic unit, trafficking and quality control signals, and segregated roles of different structural elements in fold-stability and function. We show that Kir2.1 trafficking mutants are underrepresented in variant effect databases, which has implications for clinical practice. By comparing fitness scores with expert-reviewed variant effects, we can predict the pathogenicity of  variants of unknown significance and disease mechanisms of know pathogenic mutations.

In 2015, L. sativae arrived on the Australian mainland and established on the Cape York Peninsula in the northeast of the country. Here, we assessed genetic variation in L. sativae based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated by double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) to uncover the potential origin(s) of this pest in Australia and contribute to reconstructing its global invasion history. Our principal component analyses (PCA) results suggested that Australian mainland populations were genetically close to populations from the Torres Strait and had connections to Bali and Papua New Guinea (PNG), whereas populations from Asia and Africa were more distantly related. Hawaii was genetically distinct from populations from Asia, Africa and Australia. Co-ancestry analyses pointed to signals of gene flow from the Torres Strait into the Australian mainland, while Indonesia/PNG were the likely sources of the initial invasion into the Torres Strait. Admixture analyses further revealed that L. sativae from the Torres Strait had genetic diversity originating from multiple sources, which has now spread to the Australian mainland. The L. sativae lineages from Asia/Africa appear closely related and may share co-ancestry. Isolation by distance (IBD) was found at a broad global scale, but not within small regions, suggesting human-mediated factors contribute to the local spread of this pest. Overall, our findings highlight the challenges in quarantine measures aimed at restricting the distribution of this global pest.",

The IP3 signalling pathway has been proposed as an atrial specific target for AF therapy, and atrial IP3 signalling has been linked to the activation of calcium sensitive adenylyl cyclases AC1 and AC8. Here we investigated the involvement of AC1 in the response of intact mouse atrial tissue and isolated guinea pig atrial and sinoatrial node (SAN) cells to the -adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE) using the selective AC1 inhibitor ST034307. The maximum rate change of spontaneously beating mouse right atrial tissue exposed to PE was reduced from 14.46 % to 8.17% (P = 0.005) in the presence of 1 M ST034307, whereas the increase in tension generated in paced left atrial tissue in the presence of PE was not inhibited by ST034307 (Control = 14.20 %, ST034307 = 16.32 %; P > 0.05). Experiments were performed using isolated guinea pig atrial and SAN cells loaded with Fluo-5F-AM to record changes in calcium transient amplitude (CaT) generated by 10M PE in the presence and absence of 1M ST034307. ST034307 significantly reduced the beating rate of SAN cells (0.34-fold decrease; P = 0.004), but did not result in an inhibition of CaT amplitude increase in response to PE in atrial cells.

    "abstract": "To maximise their reproductive success, flowering plants must correctly time their entry into and exit from the reproductive phase (flowering). While much is known about the mechanisms that regulate the initiation of flowering, the regulation of end-of-flowering remains largely uncharacterised. End-of-flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana consists of the quasi-synchronous arrest of individual inflorescences, but it is unclear how this arrest is correctly timed with respect to environmental stimuli and ongoing reproductive success. Here we show that Arabidopsis inflorescence arrest is a complex developmental phenomenon which includes a decline in size and cessation of activity in the inflorescence meristem (IM), coupled with a separable developmental arrest in all unopened floral primordia (floral arrest); these events occur well before the visible arrest of the inflorescence. We show that global removal of inflorescences can delay both IM arrest and floral arrest, but that local fruit removal only delays floral arrest, emphasising the separability of these processes. We test a role for cytokinin in regulating inflorescence arrest, and find that cytokinin treatment can delay arrest. We further show that gain-of-function cytokinin receptor hypersensitive mutants can delay floral arrest, and also IM arrest, depending on the expression pattern of the receptor; conversely, loss-of-function mutants prevent extension of flowering in response to inflorescence removal. Collectively, our data suggest that the dilution of cytokinin among an increasing number of sink organs leads to end-of-flowering in Arabidopsis by triggering IM and floral arrest, conversely meaning that a lack of reproductive success can homeostatically extend flowering in compensation.",

    "abstract": "Despite a long research history, we do not fully understand why plants are able to transport xylem sap under negative pressure without constant failure. Microbubble formation via direct gas entry is assumed to cause hydraulic failure, while the concentration of gas dissolved in xylem sap is traditionally supposed to be constant, following Henrys law. Here, the concentration of soluble gas in xylem sap was estimated in vivo using well-watered Citrus plants under varying levels of air temperature and photoperiodic exposure, and compared to modelled data. The gas concentration in xylem sap showed non-equilibrium curves, with a minimum over- or undersaturation of 5% compared to gas solubility based on Henrys law. A similar diurnal pattern was obtained from the gas concentration in the cut-open conduits and discharge tube, and oversolubility was strongly associated with decreasing xylem water potentials during transpiration. Although our model did not explain the daily changes in gas solubility for an anisobaric situation, oversolubility characterises nanoconfined liquids, such as sap inside cell walls. Thus, plants are able to transport sap under negative pressure with relatively high amounts of dissolved gas, providing them with a buffering capacity to prevent hydraulic failure, despite diurnal changes in pressure and temperature.",

    "abstract": "Viroids are circular RNAs of minimal complexity compelled to subvert plant-regulatory networks to accomplish their infectious process. Studies focused on the response to viroid infection have mostly addressed specific regulatory levels and considered a unique infection time. Thus, much remains to be done to understand the temporal evolution and complex nature of viroid-host interactions. Here we present an integrative analysis of the temporal evolution and intensity of the genome-wide alterations in cucumber plants infected with hop stunt viroid (HSVd) by integrating differential host transcriptome, sRNAnome and methylome. Our results support that HSVd promotes the redesign of the cucumber regulatory-pathways predominantly affecting specific regulatory layers at different infection-phases. The initial response was characterized by a reconfiguration of the host-transcriptome by differential exon usage, followed by a progressive transcriptional down-regulation modulated by epigenetic changes. Regarding endogenous small RNAs, the alterations were limited and mainly occur at the late stage. The most significant host-alterations were predominantly related to the down-regulation of transcripts involved in plant-defence mechanisms, the restriction of pathogen-movement and the systemic spreading of defence signals. Altogether our data evidence the existence of a dynamic and yet poorly known arms race between the host and the viroid. We expect that these data constituting the first comprehensive map of the plant responses to a viroid infection contribute to elucidate the molecular basis of this multifaceted defence and counter-defence layout.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical wounding occurs in plants during biotic (e.g., herbivore or pathogen attack) or abiotic (e.g., wind damage or freezing) stresses and is associated with the activation of multiple signaling pathways. These initiate many wound responses at the wounded tissues, as well as trigger long-distance signaling pathways that activate wound responses in tissues that were not affected by the initial wounding event (termed  systemic wound response). Among the different systemic signals activated by wounding are electric signals, calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) waves, and different plant hormones such as jasmonic acid. The release of glutamate from cells at the wounded tissues was recently proposed to trigger several different systemic signal transduction pathways via glutamate-like receptors (GLRs). However, the role of another important compound released from cells during wounding (i.e., extracellular ATP; eATP) in triggering systemic responses is not clear. Here we show that eATP that accumulates in wounded leaves and is sensed by the purinoreceptor kinase P2K is required for the activation of the ROS wave during wounding. Application of eATP to unwounded leaves triggered the ROS wave, and the activation of the ROS wave by wounding or eATP application was suppressed in mutants deficient in P2K (i.e., p2k1-3, p2k2, and p2k1-3p2k2). In addition, the expression of several systemic wound response transcripts was suppressed in mutants deficient in P2K during wounding. Our findings reveal that in addition to sensing glutamate via GLRs, eATP sensed by P2Ks is playing a key role in the triggering of systemic wound responses in plants.\n\nOne sentence summaryExtracellular ATP plays an important role in triggering the ROS wave and systemic transcriptomics responses during wounding.",

    "abstract": "Goal-directed behaviour is dependent upon the ability to detect errors and implement appropriate post-error adjustments. Accordingly, several studies have explored the neural activity underlying error-monitoring processes, identifying the insula cortex as crucial for error awareness and reporting mixed findings with respect to the anterior cingulate cortex. Variable patterns of activation have previously been attributed to insufficient statistical power. We therefore sought to clarify the neural correlates of error awareness in a large event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Four hundred and two healthy participants undertook the error awareness task, a motor Go/No-Go response inhibition paradigm in which participants were required to indicate their awareness of commission errors. Compared to unaware errors, aware errors were accompanied by significantly greater activity in a network of regions including the insula cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and midline structures such as the anterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area. Error awareness activity was related to indices of task performance and dimensional measures of psychopathology in selected regions including the insula, supramarginal gyrus and supplementary motor area. Taken together, we identified a robust and reliable neural network associated with error awareness.",

    "abstract": "We can easily perceive the spatial scale depicted in a picture, regardless of whether it is a small space (e.g., a close-up view of a chair) or a much larger space (e.g., an entire class room). How does the human visual system encode this continuous dimension? Here, we investigated the underlying neural coding of depicted spatial scale, by examining the voxel tuning and topographic organization of brain responses. We created naturalistic yet carefully-controlled stimuli by constructing virtual indoor environments, and rendered a series of snapshots to smoothly sample between a close-up view of the central object and far-scale view of the full environment (object-to-scene continuum). Human brain responses were measured to each position using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We did not find evidence for a smooth topographic mapping for the object-to-scene continuum on the cortex. Instead, we observed large swaths of cortex with opposing ramp-shaped profiles, with highest responses to one end of the object-to-scene continuum or the other, and a small region showing a weak tuning to intermediate scale views. Importantly, when we considered the multi-voxel patterns of the entire ventral occipito-temporal cortex, we found smooth and linear representation of the object-to-scene continuum. Thus, our results together suggest that depicted spatial scale is coded parametrically in large-scale population codes across the entire ventral occipito-temporal cortex.",

    "abstract": "The brains modular functional organization facilitates adaptability. Modularity has been linked with a wide range of cognitive abilities such as intelligence, memory, and learning. However, much of this work has (1) considered modularity while a participant is at rest rather than during tasks conditions and/or (2) relied primarily on lab-based cognitive assessments. Thus, the extent to which modularity can provide information about real-word behavior remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether functional modularity during resting-state and task-based fMRI was associated with academic learning (measured by GPA) and ability (measured by PSAT) in a large sample of high school students. Additional questions concerned the extent to which modularity differs between rest and task conditions, and across spatial scales. Results indicated that whole-brain modularity during task conditions was significantly associated with academic learning. In contrast to prior work, no such associations were observed for resting-state modularity. We further showed that differences in modularity between task conditions and resting-state varied across spatial scales. Taken together, the present findings inform how functional brain network modularity - during task conditions and while at rest - relate to a range of cognitive abilities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle degenerative disorder, culminating in a complete loss of ambulation, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a fatal cardiorespiratory failure.\n\nNecroptosis is the form of necrosis that is dependent upon the receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 3; it is involved in several inflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions. We previously identified RIPK3 as a key player in the acute myonecrosis affecting the hindlimb muscles of the dystrophic mouse model, mdx. Whether necroptosis also mediates respiratory and heart disorders in DMD is currently unknown.\n\nMethodsEvidence of activation of the necroptotic axis was examined in dystrophic tissues from Golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dogs and R-DMDdel52 rats. A functional assessment of the involvement of necroptosis in dystrophic animals was performed on mdx mice that were genetically depleted for RIPK3. Dystrophic mice aged from 12 to 18 months were analyzed by histology and molecular biology to compare the phenotype of muscles from mdxRipk3+/+ and mdxRipk3-/- mice. Heart function was also examined by echocardiography in 40-week-old mice.\n\nResultsQuantification of RIPK3 transcripts in sartorius and biceps femoris muscles from GRMD dogs positively correlated to myonecrosis levels (r=0.81; p=0.0076). RIPK3 was also found elevated in the diaphragm (p=0<0.05). In the slow progressing heart phenotype of GRMD dogs, the phosphorylated form of RIPK1 at the Serine 161 site was dramatically increased in cardiomyocytes. A similar p-RIPK1 upregulation characterized the cardiomyocytes of R-DMDdel52 rats, associated with a marked overexpression of Ripk1 (p=0.007) and Ripk3 (p=0.008), indicating primed activation of the necroptotic pathway in the dystrophic heart. MdxRipk3-/- mice displayed decreased compensatory hypertrophy of the heart (p=0.014), and echocardiography showed a 19% increase in the relative wall thickness (p<0.05) and 29% reduction in the left ventricle mass (p=0.0144). Besides, mdxRipk3-/- mice presented no evidence of a regenerative default or sarcopenia in skeletal muscles, moreover around 50% less affected by fibrosis (p<0.05).\n\nConclusionsOur data provide evidence of the activation of the necroptotic pathway in degenerative tissues from dystrophic animal models, including the diaphragm and the heart. The genetic inhibition of necroptosis in dystrophic mice improves both cardiac function and histological features of muscles, suggesting that prevention of necroptosis is susceptible to providing multiorgan beneficial effects for DMD.",

Here, we use dotplots and dimensionality reduction to systematically define LCR type/copy relationships and create a map of LCR sequence space capable of integrating LCR features and functions. By defining LCR relationships across the proteome, we provide insight into how LCR type and copy number contribute to higher order assemblies, such as the importance of K-rich LCR copy number for assembly of the nucleolar protein RPA43 in vivo and in vitro. With LCR maps, we reveal the underlying structure of LCR sequence space, and relate differential occupancy in this space to the conservation and emergence of higher order assemblies, including the metazoan extracellular matrix and plant cell wall. Together, LCR relationships and maps uncover and identify scaffold-client relationships among E-rich LCR-containing proteins in the nucleolus, and revealed previously undescribed regions of LCR sequence space with signatures of higher order assemblies, including a teleost-specific T/H-rich sequence space. Thus, this unified view of LCRs enables discovery of how LCRs encode higher order assemblies of organisms.",

Much less is known about posaconazole, a newer triazole. We conducted the first in vitro experimental evolution of replicates from eight diverse strains of C. albicans in a high level of the fungistatic drug posaconazole. Approximately half of the 132 evolved replicates survived 50 generations of evolution, biased towards some of the strain backgrounds. We found that although increases in drug resistance were rare, increases in drug tolerance (the slow growth of a subpopulation of cells in a level of drug above the resistance level) were common across strains. We also found that adaptation to posaconazole resulted in widespread cross-tolerance to other azole drugs. Widespread aneuploidy variation was also observed in evolved replicates from some strain backgrounds. Trisomy of chromosomes 3, 6, and R was identified in 11 of 12 whole-genome sequenced evolved SC5314 replicates. These findings document rampant evolved cross-tolerance among triazoles and highlight that increases in drug tolerance can evolve independently of drug resistance in a diversity of C. albicans strain backgrounds.",

Astyanax mexicanus is proving to be an interesting new model system for understanding metabolic adaptation. To further enhance the utility of this system, we developed liver-derived cell lines from both surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling morphotypes. In this study, we provide detailed methodology of the derivation process along with a comprehensive biochemical and molecular characterization of the cell lines, which reflects key metabolic traits of cavefish adaptation.

Improved varieties have been developed through conventional breeding approaches, but progress could be accelerated and gene discovery facilitated using modern genomic methods. Existing short-read based genome assemblies of the ~420 Megabase (Mb) genome are fragmented into >135,000 contigs with numerous errors in order and orientation within scaffolds, likely due to the biology of the plant which displays gametophytic self-incompatibility resulting in inherent high heterozygosity. A high-quality long-read based assembly of red clover is presented that reduces the number of contigs by more than 500-fold, improves the per-base quality, and increases the contig N50 statistic by three orders of magnitude. The 413.5 Mb assembly is nearly 20% longer than the 350 Mb short read assembly, closer to the predicted genome size. Quality measures are presented and full-length isoform sequence of RNA transcripts reported for use in assessing accuracy and for future annotation of the genome.

Existing algorithms are typically unsupervised, utilizing only measured features to generate manifolds, disregarding known biological labels such as cell type or experimental timepoint.

LDA identifies linear combinations of predictors that optimally separate a priori classes, enabling users to tailor visualizations to separate specific aspects of cellular heterogeneity. We implement feature selection by hybrid subset selection (HSS) and demonstrate that this flexible, computationally-efficient approach generates non-stochastic, interpretable axes amenable to diverse biological processes, such as differentiation over time and cell cycle.

Even within a species, big vessels cavitate before small ones.\n\nSome centrifuge methods for measuring vulnerability are prone to artifacts due to nano-particles seeding early embolism, as the particles are drawn into vessels during measurements. Both the Sperry and Cochard rotors are prone to early cavitation due to nano-particles drawn into long and wide vessels in Robinia pseudoacacia and Quercus acutissima, whereas extraction centrifuge methods produce vulnerability curves more resistant to cavitation.\n\nSufficient nano-particles pass through the stems to seed early embolism in all rotor designs. For several years, people have thought that early embolism is induced by nano-particles present in laboratory water. One new hypothesis is that the origin of nano-particles is from cut-open living cells but a much bigger study including many species is required to confirm this idea. This paper confirms the hypothesis in comparisons between short-vesselled Acer, and long-vesselled Robinia, and Quercus. Our new results and a review of old results justifies bigger study.\n\nHypothetical nano-particles might explain why different methods for measuring vulnerability curves cause different T50 = tensions causing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity.

    "abstract": "During meiosis, homologous chromosomes become associated side by side in a process known as homologous chromosome pairing. Pairing requires long range chromosome motion through a nucleus that is full of other chromosomes. It remains unclear how the cell manages to align each pair of chromosomes quickly while mitigating and resolving interlocks. Here, we use a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model to investigate how specific features of meiosis, including motor-driven telomere motion, nuclear envelope interactions, and increased nuclear size, affect the rate of pairing and the mitigation/resolution of interlocks. By creating in silico versions of three yeast strains and comparing the results of our model to experimental data, we find that a more distributed placement of pairing sites along the chromosome is necessary to replicate experimental findings. Active motion of the telomeric ends speeds up pairing only if binding sites are spread along the chromosome length. Adding a meiotic bouquet significantly speeds up pairing but does not significantly change the number of interlocks. An increase in nuclear size slows down pairing while greatly reducing the number of interlocks. Interestingly, active forces increase the number of interlocks, which raises the question: How do these interlocks resolve? Our model gives us detailed movies of interlock resolution events which we then analyze to build a step-by-step recipe for interlock resolution. In our model, interlocks must first translocate to the ends, where they are held in a quasi-stable state by a large number of paired sites on one side. To completely resolve an interlock, the telomeres of the involved chromosomes must come in close proximity so that the cooperativity of pairing coupled with random motion causes the telomeres to unwind. Together our results indicate that computational modeling of homolog pairing provides insight into the specific cell biological changes that occur during meiosis.\n\nAuthor SummaryEarly in meiosis, homologous chromosomes must find each other within the crowded nuclear space and become aligned along their entire length in a process known as homologous chromosome pairing. It remains unclear how the cell manages to align each pair of chromosomes quickly while mitigating and resolving interlocks. Here, we study this process by using a computational model. Our model attempts to capture the large-scale cell biological picture of meiotic pairing including the random initial 3D search, active motion of the chromosome ends, and meiosis specific constraints such as telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope. We use our model to study how these different features of meiosis affect the rate of pairing and the mitigation/resolution of interlocks. Importantly, our model gives us detailed movies of interlock resolution events, which we then analyze to build a step-by-step recipe for interlock resolution. We believe computational modeling of homolog pairing provides valuable insight into this complex biological process.",

    "abstract": "The ribosome CAR interaction surface behaves like an extension of the decoding center A site and has H-bond interactions with the +1 codon that is next in line to enter the A site. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the codon sequence specificity of this CAR-mRNA interaction and discovered a strong preference for GCN codons, suggesting that there may be a sequence-dependent layer of translational regulation dependent on the CAR interaction surface. Dissection of the CAR-mRNA interaction through nucleotide substitution experiments showed that the first nucleotide of the +1 codon dominates over the second nucleotide position, consistent with an energetically favorable zipper-like activity that emanates from the A site through the CAR-mRNA interface. The +1 codon/CAR interaction is also affected by the identity of nucleotide 3 of +1 GCN codons which influences the stacking of G and C. Clustering analysis suggests that the A site decoding center adopts different neighborhood substates that depend on the identity of the +1 codon.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between macrophages, cardiac cells and the extracellular matrix are crucial for cardiac repair following myocardial infarction (MI). The paracrine effects of cell-based treatments of MI might modulate these interactions and impact cardiac repair. The immunomodulatory capacity of the therapeutic cells is therefore of interest and could be modulated by the use of biomaterials. We first showed that bone marrow cells (BMC) associated with fibrin could treat MI. Then, we interrogated the influence of fibrin, as a biologically active scaffold, on the secretome of BMC and the impact of their association on macrophage fate and cardiomyoblast proliferation.\n\nMethodsIn vivo, two weeks post-MI, rats were treated with epicardial implantation of BMC and fibrin or sham-operated. High-resolution echocardiography was performed to evaluate the heart function and structure changes after 4 weeeks. Histology and immunostaining were performed on harvested hearts. In vitro, BMC were first primed with fibrin. Second, non-polarized macrophages were differentiated toward either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotypes and stimulated with the conditioned medium of fibrin-primed BMC (F-BMC). Proteomic, cytokine levels quantification, and RT-PCR were performed. EdU incorporation and real-time cell analysis assessed cell proliferation.\n\nResultsThe epicardial implantation of fibrin and BMC reduced the loss of cardiac function induced by MI, increased wall thickness and prevented the fibrotic scar expansion. After 4 and 12 weeks, the infarct content of CD68+ and CD206+ was similar in control and treated animals. In vitro, we showed that fibrin profoundly influenced the gene expression and the secretome of BMC, simultaneously upregulating both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, the conditioned medium from F-BMC significantly increased the proliferation of macrophages in a subsets dependent manner and modulated their gene expression and cytokines secretion. For instance, F-BMC significantly downregulated the expression of Nos2, Il6 and Ccl2/Mcp1 while Arg1, Tgfb and IL10 were upregulated. Interestingly, macrophages educated by F-BMC increased cardiomyoblast proliferation.\n\nIn conclusion, our study provides evidence that BMC/fibrin-based treatment lowered the infarct extent and improved cardiac function. The macrophage content was unmodified when measured at a chronic stage. Nevertheless, acutely and in vitro, the F-BMC secretome promotes an anti-inflammatory response that stimulates cardiac cell growth. Finally, our study emphases the acute impact of F-BMC educated macrophages on cardiac cell fate.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has become an important technique in both scientific and clinical practices, and yet our understanding of how the brain responds to TMS is still limited. Concurrent neuroimaging during TMS may bridge this gap, and emerging evidence suggests widespread that modulatory effects of TMS may be best captured through changes in functional connectivity between distributed networks, rather than local changes in cortical activity. However, the relationship between TMS stimulation parameters and evoked changes in functional connectivity is unknown. In this study, 24 healthy volunteers received concurrent TMS-fMRI while performing a dot-motion direction discrimination task. An MR-compatible coil was used to apply trains of three pulses at 10 Hz rTMS over the primary visual cortex (V1) at the onset of the dot stimuli with four levels of stimulation intensity (20%, 40%, 80%, and 120% of resting motor threshold, RMT). Behavioral results demonstrated impairment of motion discrimination at 80% RMT. FMRI results yielded three findings. First, functional connectivity between visual and non-visual areas increased as a function of rTMS intensity. Second, connectivity within the visual network was positively associated with motion accuracy, while the connectivity between visual and non-visual regions was negatively associated with motion accuracy. Lastly, we found that reductions in the similarity between functional and structural connectivity associated with increasing TMS intensity were constrained to the visual network. These findings demonstrate spatially dependent nonlinear effects of TMS intensity on brain functional connectivity that proceed beyond the site of stimulation and influence associated behavior.",

    "abstract": "Codon usage bias has long been appreciated to influence protein production. Yet, relatively few studies have analyzed the impacts of codon usage on tissue-specific mRNA and protein expression. Here, we use codon-modified reporters to perform an organism-wide screen in Drosophila melanogaster for distinct tissue responses to codon usage bias. These reporters reveal a cliff-like decline of protein expression near the limit of rare codon usage in endogenously expressed Drosophila genes. Near the edge of this limit, however, we find the testis and brain are uniquely capable of expressing rare codon-enriched reporters. We define a new metric of tissue-specific codon usage, the tissue-apparent Codon Adaptation Index, to reveal a conserved enrichment for rare codon usage in the endogenously expressed genes of both Drosophila and human testis. We further demonstrate a role for rare codons in restricting protein expression of an evolutionarily young gene, RpL10Aa, to the Drosophila testis. Rare codon-mediated restriction of this testis-specific protein is critical for female fertility. Our work highlights distinct responses to rarely used codons in select tissues, revealing a critical role for codon bias in tissue biology.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequencing in the clinic often allows patients to receive a molecular diagnosis. However, variants are most often evaluated for pathogenicity, neglecting potential \"treatability\", and thus often yielding limited clinical benefit. Several collaborative efforts now aim to provide a therapy based upon the genetic variants, even if the drug will benefit only a single patient. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies, among others, offer attractive \"programmable\" and relatively safe platforms for individualized therapy. The landscape of \"ASO-treatable\" variants is largely uncharted, with new developments emerging for loss-of-function (LOF), haploinsufficient, and gain-of-function (GOF) variants. ASOs can access the genome to target splice-gain variants, poison exons, untranslated/regulatory regions, and naturally-occurring antisense transcripts. Many of these approaches have yet to be proven clinically beneficial, and it is unclear if disease in some patients has progressed past the point where benefit could reasonably be expected. Here we mine public variant databases to identify potential future therapeutic targets. We found that the majority of human pathogenic genetic variants have one or more approaches that could be targeted therapeutically, advantaging the many ways that ASOs can regulate gene expression. The future might see medical teams considering \"treatability\" when interpreting genome sequencing results, to fully realize benefits for patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent studies in the area of transcriptomics performed on single-cell and population levels reveal noticeable variability in gene expression measurements provided by different RNA sequencing technologies. Due to increased noise and complexity of single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data over the bulk experiment, there is a substantial number of variably-expressed genes and so-called dropouts, challenging the subsequent computational analysis and potentially leading to false positive discoveries. In order to investigate factors affecting technical variability between RNA sequencing experiments of different technologies, we performed a systematic assessment of single-cell and bulk RNA-Seq data, which have undergone the same pre-processing and sample preparation procedures.\n\nResultsOur analysis indicates that variability between gene expression measurements as well as dropout events are not exclusively caused by biological variability, low expression levels, or random variation. Furthermore, we propose FAVSeq, a machine learning-assisted pipeline for detection of factors contributing to gene expression variability in matched RNA-Seq data provided by two technologies. Based on the analysis of the matched bulk and single-cell dataset, we found the 3-UTR and transcript lengths as the most relevant effectors of the observed variation between RNA-Seq experiments, while the same factors together with cellular compartments were shown to be associated with dropouts.\n\nConclusionsHere, we investigated the sources of variation in RNA-Seq profiles of matched single-cell and bulk experiments. In addition, we proposed the FAVSeq pipeline for analyzing multimodal RNA sequencing data, which allowed to identify factors affecting quantitative difference in gene expression measurements as well as the presence of dropouts. Hereby, the derived knowledge can be employed further in order to improve the interpretation of RNA-Seq data and identify genes that can be affected by assay-based deviations.

    "abstract": "Cancer mutations in Ras occur predominantly at three hotspots: Gly 12, Gly 13, and Gln 61. Previously, we reported that deep mutagenesis of H-Ras using a bacterial assay identified many other activating mutations (Bandaru et al. eLife, 2017). We now show that the results of saturation mutagenesis of H-Ras in mammalian Ba/F3 cells correlate well with results of bacterial experiments in which H-Ras or K-Ras are co-expressed with a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). The prominent cancer hotspots are not dominant in the Ba/F3 data. We used the bacterial system to mutagenize Ras constructs of different stabilities and discovered a feature that distinguishes the cancer hotspots. While mutations at the cancer hotspots activate Ras regardless of construct stability, mutations at lower-frequency sites (e.g., at Val 14 or Asp 119) can be activating or deleterious, depending on the stability of the Ras construct. We characterized the dynamics of three non-hotspot activating Ras mutants by using NMR to monitor hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX). These mutations result in global increases in HDX rates, consistent with the destabilization of Ras. An explanation for these observations is that mutations that destabilize Ras increase nucleotide dissociation rates, enabling activation by spontaneous nucleotide exchange. A further stability decrease can lead to insufficient levels of folded Ras - and subsequent loss of function. In contrast, the cancer hotspot mutations are mechanism-based activators of Ras that interfere directly with the action of GAPs. Our results demonstrate the importance of GAP surveillance and protein stability in determining the sensitivity of Ras to mutational activation.",

Many WGBS-based studies aim to identify biologically relevant loci that display differential methylation between genotypes, treatment groups, tissues, or developmental stages. Over the years, different tools have been developed to extract differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from whole-genome data. Often, such tools are built upon assumptions from mammalian data and do not consider the substantially more complex and variable nature of plant DNA methylation. Here, we present MethylScore, a pipeline to analyze WGBS data and to account for plant-specific DNA methylation properties. MethylScore processes data from genomic alignments to DMR output and is designed to be usable by novice and expert users alike. It uses an unsupervised machine learning approach to segment the genome by classification into states of high and low methylation, substantially reducing the number of necessary statistical tests while increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and the statistical power. We show how MethylScore can identify DMRs from hundreds of samples and how its data-driven approach can stratify associated samples without prior information. We identify DMRs in the A. thaliana 1001 Genomes dataset to unveil known and unknown genotype-epigenotype associations. MethylScore is an accessible pipeline for plant WGBS data, with unprecedented features for DMR calling in small- and large-scale datasets; it is built as a Nextflow pipeline and its source code is available at https://github.com/Computomics/MethylScore.",

A mutant screen uncovered residues and motifs in TmaR that are important for its condensation. Upon overexpression, TmaR undergoes irreversible liquid-to-solid transition, similar to the transition of disease-causing proteins in human, which impairs bacterial cell morphology and proliferation. Not only does RNA contribute to TmaR phase separation, but by ensuring polar localization and stability of flagella-related transcripts, TmaR enables cell motility and biofilm formation, thus providing a linkage between LLPS and major survival strategies in bacteria.",

By optimizing the individual elements, we have developed the Spliced TetO REpeAt, MS2 repeat, and INtein sandwiched reporter Gene tag (STREAMING-tag) system. Clusters of RNAPII and BRD4 were observed proximally to the TSS of Nanog when the gene was transcribed in mouse embryonic stem cells. In contrast, clusters of MED19 and MED22 Mediator subunits were constitutively located near the TSS. Thus, the STREAMING-tag system revealed the spatiotemporal relationships between transcriptional activity and protein clusters near the gene.

    "abstract": "Many individual proteins have been identified as having defined positions relative to cell polarity axes, raising the question of what fraction of all proteins may have polarized localizations. We took advantage of the giant ciliate Stentor coeruleus to quantify the extent of polarized localization proteome-wide. This trumpet-shaped unicellular organism shows a clear morphological anterior-posterior axis defined by a circular array of cilia known as a membranellar band at one end, and a holdfast at the other end. Because individual Stentor cells are over a millimeter in length, we were able to cut the cells into three pieces along the anterior-posterior axis, followed by proteomic analysis of proteins enriched in each piece. We find that approximately 30% of all detected proteins show a polarized location relative to the anterior-posterior cell axis. Proteins with polarized enrichment include centrin-like proteins, calcium-regulated kinases, orthologs of SFI1 and GAS2, and proteases. At the organelle level, nuclear and mitochondrial proteins are enriched in the anterior half of the cell body, but not in the membranellar band itself, while ribosome related proteins are apparently uniformly distributed. RNAi of signaling proteins enriched in the membranellar band, which is the anterior-most structure in the cell, revealed a protein phosphatase 2 subunit b ortholog required for closure of the membranellar band into the ring shape characteristic of Stentor. These results suggest that a large fraction of the Stentor proteome has a polarized localization, and provide a protein-level framework for future analysis of pattern formation and regeneration in Stentor as well as defining a general strategy for subcellular spatial proteomics based on physical dissection of cells.",

    "abstract": "Peptide-based drugs have emerged as highly selective and potent cancer therapy. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Multiple approaches have been developed towards cancer treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation, and hormonal therapy; however, such procedures non-specificity, toxicity, and inefficiency present a hurdle. In this study, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) model to detect the potential anticancer properties of novel peptides through scanning the American University in Cairo Red Sea metagenomics library. Further, we performed in silico studies on a novel 37-mer antimicrobial peptide mined from SVM pipeline analysis. This peptide was further modified to enhance its anticancer activity, analyzed for gene oncology, and subsequently synthesized. The anticancer properties of this 37-mer peptide were evaluated via cellular viability and cell morphology of SNU449, HepG2, SKOV3, and HeLa cells, using MTT assay. Furthermore, we assessed the migration capability of SNU449 and SKOV3 via scratch wound healing assay. Moreover, the targeted selectivity of the peptide for cancerous cells was assessed by testing its hemolytic activity on human erythrocytes. The peptide caused a significant reduction in cellular viability and critically affected the morphology of hepatocellular carcinoma (SNU449 and HepG2), ovarian cancer (SKOV3), and to a limited extent, cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa), in addition to decreasing viability of human fibroblast cell line (1Br-hTERT). Peptide treatment significantly affected the proliferation and migration ability of SNU449 and SKOV3 cells. Annexin V assay was used to evaluate induced cell death upon peptide treatment, attributing programmed cell death (Apoptosis) as the main cause of cell death in SNU449 cells. Finally, we established broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of the peptide on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Thus, these findings infer the novelty of the peptide as a potential anticancer and antimicrobial agent.",

    "abstract": "Kinetic models of metabolic networks relate metabolic fluxes, metabolite concentrations, and enzyme levels through well-defined mechanistic relations rendering them an essential tool for systems biology studies aiming to capture and understand the behavior of living organisms. However, due to the lack of information about the kinetic properties of enzymes and the uncertainties associated with available experimental data, traditional kinetic modeling approaches often yield only a few or no kinetic models with desirable dynamical properties making the computational analysis unreliable and computationally inefficient. We present REKINDLE (REconstruction of KINetic models using Deep LEarning), a deep-learning-based framework for efficiently generating large-scale kinetic models with dynamic properties matching the ones observed in living organisms. We showcase REKINDLEs efficiency and capabilities through three studies where we: (i) generate large populations of kinetic models that allow reliable in silico testing of hypotheses and systems biology designs, (ii) navigate the phenotypic space by leveraging the transfer learning capability of generative adversarial networks, demonstrating that the generators trained for one physiology can be fine-tuned for another physiology using a low amount of data, and (iii) expand upon existing datasets, making them amenable to thorough computational biology and data-science analyses. The results show that data-driven neural networks assimilate implicit kinetic knowledge and structure of metabolic networks and generate novel kinetic models with tailored properties and statistical diversity. We anticipate that our framework will advance our understanding of metabolism and accelerate future research in health, biotechnology, and systems and synthetic biology. REKINDLE is available as an open-access tool.",

    "abstract": "Cancer progression is a complex phenomenon that spans multiple scales from molecular to cellular and intercellular. Simulations can be used to perturb the underlying mechanisms of those systems and to generate hypotheses on novel therapies. We present a new version of PhysiBoSS, a multiscale modelling framework designed to cover multiple temporal and spatial scales, that improves its integration with PhysiCell, decoupling the cell agent simulations with the internal Boolean model in an easy-to-maintain computational framework. PhysiBoSS 2.0 is a redesign and reimplementation of PhysiBoSS, conceived as an add-on that expands the PhysiCell agent-based functionalities with intracellular cell signalling using MaBoSS having a decoupled, maintainable and model-agnostic design. PhysiBoSS 2.0 successfully reproduces simulations reported in the former version and expands its functionalities such as using user-defined models and cells specifications, having mechanistic submodels of substrate internalisation with ODEs and enabling the study of drug synergies. PhysiBoSS 2.0 is open-source and publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/PhysiBoSS/PhysiBoSS) under the BSD 3-clause license with several repositories of accompanying interoperable tools. Additionally, a nanoHUB tool has been set up to ease the use of PhysiBoSS 2.0 (https://nanohub.org/tools/pba4tnf/).",

    "abstract": "Spider morph ball pythons are a frequently bred design morph with striking alterations of the skin color pattern. We created high resolution {micro}CT-image series through the otical region of the skulls, used 3D-reconstruction software for rendering anatomical models, and compare the anatomy of the semicircular ducts, sacculus and ampullae of wildtype Python regius (ball python) with spider morph snakes. All spider morph snakes showed the wobble condition. We describe the inner ear structures in wild-type and spider-morph snakes and report a deviant morphology of semicircular canals, ampullae and sacculus in spider morph snakes. We also report about associated differences in the desmal skull bones of spider morph snakes. The spider morph snakes were characterized by wider semicircular canals, anatomically poorly defined ampulla, a deformed crus communis and a small sacculus, with a highly deviant x-ray morphology as compared to wildtype individuals. We observed considerable intra- and interindividual variability of these features. This deviant morphology of spider morph snakes can easily be associated with an impairment of sense of equilibrium and the observed neurological wobble condition. Limitations in sample size prevent statistical analyses, but the anatomical evidence is strong enough to support an association between the wobble condition in design bread spider morph snakes and a malformation of the inner ear structures. A link between artificially selected alterations in pattern and specific color design with neural-crest associated developmental malformations of the statoacoustic organ as known from other vertebrates is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Recombination is critical both for accelerating adaptation and for the purging of deleterious mutations. Chromosomal inversions can act as recombination modifiers that suppress local recombination and, thus, are predicted to accumulate such mutations. In this study, we investigated patterns of recombination, transposable element abundance and coding sequence evolution across the genomes of 1,445 individuals from three sunflower species, as well as within nine inversions segregating within species. We also analyzed the effects of inversion genotypes on 87 phenotypic traits to test for overdominance. We found significant negative correlations of long terminal repeat retrotransposon abundance and deleterious mutations with recombination rates across the genome in all three species. However, we failed to detect an increase in these features in the inversions, except for a modest increase in the proportion of stop codon mutations in several very large or rare inversions. Moreover, there was little evidence of phenotypic overdominance in inversion heterozygotes, consistent with observations of minimal deleterious load. On the other hand, significantly greater load was observed for inversions in populations polymorphic for a given inversion compared to populations monomorphic for one of the arrangements, suggesting that the local state of inversion polymorphism affects deleterious load. These seemingly contradictory results can be explained by the geographic structuring and consequent excess homozygosity of inversions in wild sunflowers. Inversions contributing to local adaptation often exhibit geographic structure; such inversions represent ideal recombination modifiers, acting to facilitate adaptive divergence with gene flow, while largely averting the accumulation of deleterious mutations due to recombination suppression.",
