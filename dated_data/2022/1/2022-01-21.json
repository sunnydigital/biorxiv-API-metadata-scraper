    "abstract": "Metastatic progression and treatment-resistance of breast cancer has been associated with epithelial-mesenchymal-transition including downregulation of E-cadherin (CDH1) expression, which can be initiated by inflammatory mediators such as COX-2. Recently, E-cadherin-mediated, cluster-based metastasis and treatment resistance has become more appreciated, though the mechanisms that maintain E-cadherin expression in this context are unknown. Through studies of inflammatory breast cancer and an in vitro tumor cell emboli culture paradigm, we identified a role for COX-2, a target gene of C/EBP{delta}, or its metabolite PGE2 in promoting protein stability of E-cadherin, {beta}-catenin and p120 catenin through inhibition of GSK3{beta}, without affecting CDH1 mRNA. The COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib downregulated E-cadherin complex proteins and caused cell death. Co-expression of E-cadherin and COX-2 was seen in breast cancer patients with poor outcome and, along with inhibitory GSK3{beta} phosphorylation, in patient-derived xenografts of triple negative breast cancer. Celecoxib alone decreased E-cadherin protein expression within xenograft tumors, reduced circulating tumor cells and clusters, and in combination with paclitaxel attenuated or regressed lung metastases. This study uncovered a mechanism by which metastatic breast cancer cells can maintain E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesions and cell survival, suggesting that patients with COX-2+/E-cadherin+ breast cancer may benefit from targeting of the PGE2 signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Twenty hybrids along with five parents evaluated in the study were mainly contemplated to find out the best cross combinations and the best general and specific combiners as well as to estimate the nature and magnitude of the gene action for different qualitative traits. Using Griffings and Haymans approach through a 5 x 5 full diallel cross fashion, an investigation on heterosis and combining ability in pumpkin was undertaken following RCBD design with three replications at the experimental field. Both positive and negative significant GCA and SCA variances were obtained from few parents and hybrids. Predominance of additive-additive gene action was noted for most of the characters except hollowness and dry matter content, where additive-dominance gene action was predominant; flesh thickness and brix (%), where dominance-dominance gene action were predominant. A single parent was not found as good combiner for more than two characters. The best specific combiners were IBD 40 X IBD 47 for beta carotene, total sugar and fruit yield; IBD23 X IBD40 for brix (%), hollowness and flesh thickness; IBD40 X IBD57 for fruit breadth; IBD47 X IBD50 for non reducing sugar; and IBD47 X IBD57 for reducing sugar. The Vr-Wr graphs exhibited complete, partial and over dominance effect of genes for different characters. Complete dominance was observed only for beta carotene whereas over dominance was noticed for hollowness and flesh thickness. Partial dominance was ensured for fruit breadth, dry matter, brix (%), reducing sugar, non-reducing sugar, total sugar and fruit yield. Significant heterosis of some crosses against mid parent and better parents were observed for some characters.",

    "abstract": "Several protein families play a role in the biogenesis and function of small RNAs (sRNAs) in plants. Those with primary roles include Dicer-like (DCL), RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RDR), and Argonaute (AGO) proteins. Protein families such as double-stranded RNA-binding (DRB), SERRATE (SE), and SUPPRESSION OF SILENCING 3 (SGS3) act as partners of DCL or RDR proteins. Here, we present curated annotations and phylogenetic analyses of seven sRNA pathway protein families performed on 196 species in the Viridiplantae (aka green plants) lineage. Our results suggest that the RDR3 proteins emerged earlier than RDR1/2/6. RDR6 is found in filamentous green algae and all land plants, suggesting that the evolution of RDR6 proteins coincides with the evolution of phased small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). We traced the origin of the 24-nt reproductive phased siRNA-associated DCL5 protein back to Acorus americanus, the earliest diverged, extant monocot species. Our analyses of AGOs identified multiple duplication events of AGO genes that were lost, retained or further duplicated in sub-groups, indicating that the evolution of AGOs is complex in monocots. The results also refine the evolution of several clades of AGO proteins, such as AGO4, AGO6, AGO17 and AGO18. Analyses of nuclear localization signal sequences and catalytic triads of AGO proteins provide insights into the regulatory roles of diverse AGOs. Collectively, this work generates a curated and evolutionarily coherent annotation for gene families involved in plant sRNA biogenesis/function and provides insights into the evolution of major sRNA pathways.",

    "abstract": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is required for many aspects of plant biology, including stress responses, immunity, and plant development including root and flower development. Our understanding of PCD regulation is incomplete, especially concerning regulators involved in multiple divergent processes. The botrytis-suscetible1 (bos1) mutant is one of the genotypes most susceptible to Botrytis cinerea (Botrytis) and has revealed the role of BOS1 in cell death propagation during plant responses to wounding. The bos1-1 allele harbours a T-DNA located in the 5UTR upstream from the start codon that results in elevated BOS1 transcript levels. Here, we resequenced the bos1-1 genome and found a MAS promoter at the ends of the T-DNAs. Expression of the BOS1 gene under control of the MAS promoter conferred the characteristic bos1-1 Botrytis- sensitivity and wounding phenotypes in wildtype plants. We used Crispr-Cas9 to create new bos1 alleles that disrupt exons. These lines lacked the typical bos1-1 wounding and Botrytis phenotypes, but exhibited reduced fertility, as previously observed in other bos1 T-DNA alleles. With multiple overexpression lines of BOS1, we demonstrate that BOS1 is involved in regulation of cell death propagation in a dosage dependent manner. Our data support that bos1-1 is a gain-of-function mutant and that BOS1 acts as a positive regulator of wounding and Botrytis-induced PCD. Taken together these finding suggest that BOS1 function in both fertility and Botrytis response could be unified under cell death control.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of chloride in biology can be accelerated through the application of fluorescent protein-based sensors in living cells. Laboratory-guided evolution can be used to diversify and identify sensors with specific properties. Recently, we established that the fluorescent proton-pumping rhodopsin wtGR from Gloeobacter violaceus can be converted into a fluorescent sensor for chloride. To unlock this non-natural function, a single point mutation at the Schiff counterion position from D121V was introduced into wtGR fused with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) resulting in GR1-CFP. Here, we have integrated coevolutionary analysis with directed evolution to understand how the rhodopsin sequence space can be explored and engineered to improve this starting point. We first show how evolutionary couplings are predictive of functional sites in the rhodopsin family and how a fitness metric based on sequence can be used to quantify known proton-pumping activities of GR-CFP variants. Then, we couple this ability to predict potential functional outcomes with a screening and selection assay in live Escherichia coli to reduce the mutational search space of five residues along the proton-pumping pathway in GR1-CFP. This iterative selection process results in GR2-CFP with four additional mutations, E132K, A84K, T125C, and V245I. Finally, bulk, and single fluorescence measurements in live E. coli reveal that GR2-CFP is a reversible, ratiometric fluorescent sensor for extracellular chloride with an improved dynamic range. We anticipate that our framework will be applicable to other systems, providing a more efficient methodology to engineer fluorescent-protein based sensors with desired properties.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=47 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/474067v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ddb801org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15b4a9corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7f497corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b19c5b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The spatial limits of sensory acquisition (its sensory horizon) is a fundamental property of any sensorimotor system. In the present study, we sought to determine the sensory horizon for the human haptic modality. At first blush, it seems obvious that the haptic system is bounded by the space where the body can interact with the environment (e.g., the arm span). However, the human somatosensory system is exquisitely tuned to sensing with tools--blind-cane navigation being a classic example of this. The horizon of haptic perception therefore extends beyond body space, but to what extent is unknown. We first used neuromechanical modelling to determine the theoretical horizon, which we pinpointed as six meters. We then used a psychophysical localization paradigm to behaviorally confirm that humans can haptically localize objects using a six-meter rod. This finding underscores the incredibly flexibility of the brains sensorimotor representations, as they can be adapted to sense with an object many times longer than the users own body.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke occurs with no warning, and therefore, very little is known about hemodynamic perturbations in the brain immediately after stroke onset. Here, functional ultrasound imaging was used to monitor variations in relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) compared to baseline. rCBV levels were analyzed brain-wide and continuously at high spatiotemporal resolution (100m, 2Hz) until 70mins after stroke onset in rats. We compared two stroke models, with either a permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAo) or a tandem occlusion of both the common carotid and middle cerebral arteries (CCAo+MCAo). We observed a typical hemodynamic pattern, including a quick drop of the rCBV after MCAo, followed by spontaneous reperfusion of several brain regions located in the vicinity of the ischemic core. The severity and location of the ischemia were highly variable between animals. Still, both parameters were, on average, in good agreement with the final ischemic lesion volume measured 24hrs after stroke onset for the MCAo but not the CCAo+MCAo model. For the latter, we observed that the infarct was extended to regions that were initially not ischemic and located rostrally of the ischemic core. These regions strongly colocalize with the origin of transient hemodynamic events associated with spreading depolarizations.",

    "abstract": "The multicontrast EPImix sequence generates 6 contrasts, including a T1-weighted scan, in [~]1 minute. EPImix shows comparable diagnostic performance to conventional scans under qualitative clinical evaluation, and similarities in simple quantitative measures including contrast intensity. However, EPImix scans have not yet been compared to standard MRI scans using established quantitative measures. In this study, we compared conventional and EPImix-derived T1-weighted scans of 64 healthy participants using tissue volume estimates and predicted brain-age. All scans were pre-processed using the SPM12 DARTEL pipeline, generating measures of grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid volume. Brain-age was predicted using brainageR, a Gaussian process regression model previously trained on a large sample of standard T1-weighted scans. Estimates of both global and voxel-wise tissue volume showed significantly similar results between standard and EPImix-derived T1-weighted scans. Brain-age estimates from both sequences were significantly correlated, although EPImix T1-weighted scans showed a systematic offset in predictions of chronological age. Supplementary analyses suggest that this is likely caused by the reduced field of view of EPImix scans, and the use of a brain-age model trained using conventional T1-weighted scans. However, this systematic error can be corrected using additional regression of T1-predicted brain-age onto EPImix-predicted brain-age. Finally, retest EPImix scans acquired for 10 participants demonstrated high test-retest reliability in all evaluated quantitative measurements. Quantitative analysis of EPImix scans holds potential to reduce scanning time, increasing participant comfort and reducing cost, as well as to support automation of scanning, utilising active learning for faster and individually-tailored (neuro)imaging.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we have identified an odorant receptor (OR) from the southern house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, CquiOR32, which responded to both odorants (agonists) and inhibitory compounds (antagonists). CquiOR32/CquiOrco-expressing oocytes responded to methyl salicylate and other odorants with inward (regular) currents but gave currents in the reverse direction when challenged with eucalyptol and other inhibitors. To determine whether hitherto unknown ORs show this intrareceptor inhibition, we have now examined two other receptors in the same cluster, CquiOR27 and CquiOR28. We cloned and tested four variants of CquiOR28, but none of the 250 compounds in our panel of odorants, including an Orco ligand candidate (OCL12), elicited inward or outward currents. By contrast, CquiOR27/CquiOrco-expressing oocytes gave robust, dose-dependent inward currents when challenged with {gamma}-octalactone and other odorants. On the other hand, octylamine and other phenolic compounds elicited dose-dependent currents in the reverse direction. When stimulatory and inhibitory compounds were presented in binary mixtures, {gamma}-octalactone-elicited inward currents were attenuated in a dose-dependent manner according to the concentration of octylamine. As part of our chemical ecology approach, we tested the repellency activity of the best ligands in the surface landing and feeding assay and a newly reported hand-in cage assay. Protection elicited by {gamma}-octalactone did not differ significantly from that of DEET at the same dose. In the hand-in cage assay, a cream formulation of {gamma}-octalactone showed 97.0 {+/-} 1.3% protection, with 47.6 {+/-} 8.3% and 1.4 {+/-} 0.7% landings per trial in the hands covered with a control and {gamma}-octalactone cream, respectively (N=8, p=0.0078, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test).",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in visual working memory capacity are related to slow-wave event-related potentials (ERPs) and suppression of alpha-band oscillatory power measured during the delay period of memory tasks using electroencephalography (EEG). However, recent evidence suggests that changes in the non-oscillatory, aperiodic features of the EEG signal may also contribute to working memory performance. We assessed several features of task-related changes in aperiodic activity including the spatial distribution, the effect of memory load, and the relationship between memory capacity, slow-wave ERPs, and alpha suppression. Eighty-four healthy individuals performed a continuous recall working memory task consisting of 2, 4 or 6 coloured squares while EEG was recorded. Aperiodic activity during a baseline and delay period was quantified by fitting a model to the background of the EEG power spectra using the FOOOF toolbox, which returned parameters describing the slope (exponent) and broadband offset of the spectra. The aperiodic exponent decreased (i.e., slope flattened) over lateral parieto-occipital electrodes but increased (i.e., slope steepened) over fronto-central electrodes during the delay period, whereas the offset decreased over parieto-occipital electrodes. These task-related changes in aperiodic activity were not altered by memory load. Larger increases in the aperiodic exponent were associated with higher working memory capacity measured from both the EEG task and a separate battery of complex span tasks, and this relationship was independent of slow-wave ERPs and alpha suppression. Our findings suggest that task-related changes in aperiodic activity during working memory are region specific and reflect an independent neural mechanism important for general working memory ability.",

Such immune related adverse events (IrAE) may lead to treatment interruption, permanent organ dysfunction, hospitalization and premature death. Thyroiditis is one of the most common IrAE, but the cause of thyroid IrAE remains unknown. Here we present a novel mouse model in which checkpoint inhibitor therapy leads to multi-organ autoimmune infiltrates and show that activation and infiltration of Type 3 immune cells including IL17A+ ROR{gamma}t+ CD4+ (T helper 17 or Th17) and gamma delta 17 ({gamma}{delta}T17) T cells promote thyroid IrAE development. IL-17A+ T cells were similarly found in thyroid specimens from cancer patients treated with ICI who developed thyroid IrAE. Furthermore, antibody-based inhibition of IL-17A, a clinically available therapy, significantly reduced thyroid IrAE development in ICI-treated mice. Finally, combination of IL-17A neutralization with ICI treatment in multiple tumor models did not reduce ICI anti-tumor efficacy. These studies suggest that targeting Th17 and {gamma}{delta}17 function may reduce IrAE without impairing ICI anti-tumor efficacy and may be a generalizable strategy to address IL17-mediated IrAE.",

    "abstract": "Availability of effective anti-tumor T cells is limited by cancer immunoediting, which depletes neoantigens, and central tolerance, which eliminates developing T cells with high-affinity T cell receptors (TCRs) against tumor self-antigens. Remaining tumor-reactive T cells are often exhausted after immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Whether endogenous T cells with high- affinity TCRs against tumor self-antigens can be generated to circumvent exhaustion and reject neoantigen-poor tumors is unclear. We show that transiently interrupting central tolerance through RANKL blockade unleashes T cells possessing TCRs with self-reactive features that enable ICB to reject poorly immunogenic tumors. Upon recognition of tumor self-antigens, these T cells exhibit enhanced TCR signaling, enrichment in NFAT/AP-1 genes, and lymph node priming. Consequently, memory-precursor T cells against tumor self-antigens are generated, avoid exhaustion, and become effector-memory cells with transcriptional features associated with clinical ICB response. Thus, interrupting central tolerance provides T cells with tumor- directed autoreactivity that avoid exhaustion and improve immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Genes encoding chemokines and extracellular matrix (ECM) play pivotal roles in chronic HBV infection (CHB), HBV related fibrosis (HBV-LF) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC). The landscape and potential of these genes in prognosis across diseases stages have not been fully and systemically understood. In this study, we defined an HBV-LF associated gene set comprised of chemokines and ECM related genes directly induced by initial HBV infection through GSVA algorithm that named as CLST (C stands for CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL19 and CCL20; L for LUM; S for SOX9 and SPP1; T for THBS1, THBS2) and evaluated its biomarker values in CHB and HBV-LF. Enrichment scores (ES) of CLST was subsequently observed synergized with activated CD4+T cells (aCD4) highly related to T helper cell 17 (TH17) associated genes and immune checkpoints and addressed as risk signals due to bearing harmful prognosis factors in tumor tissues of patients with HBV-HCC. Dual higher enrichment score (ES) of CLST and aCD4 in HBV-HCC patients exhibited worse overall survival (OS). Feature genes specific to these two gene sets showed promising clinical relevance in early-stage of HBV-HCC definition and OS prediction incorporating laboratory parameters via artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Finally, a novel mechanistic insight into the issue was proposed that PEG IFN- as an immunotherapy through modulating CLST signal in treatment responders and these immune signals down-regulation could be beneficial for HBV related diseases control and prevention. Together, our study provides GSVA and AI derived immunogenomic prognosis signatures and clinical utility of these signals will be benefit for HBV related diseases cure.",

    "abstract": "Age-related thymus involution results in decreased T-cell production, contributing to increased susceptibility to pathogens. Elucidating mechanisms underlying involution will inform strategies to restore thymopoiesis. The thymus is colonized by circulating bone marrow (BM)-derived thymus seeding progenitors (TSPs) that differentiate into early T-cell progenitors (ETPs). We find ETP cellularity declines as early as 3 months (3MO) in mice. This initial ETP reduction could reflect changes in pre-thymic progenitors and/or thymic stromal niches. We demonstrate that the number of functional TSP/ETP niches is not reduced with age. Instead, the number of pre-thymic BM and circulating lymphoid progenitors is substantially reduced by 3MO, although their intrinsic ability to seed and differentiate in the thymus is maintained. Additionally, Notch signaling in BM progenitors and ETPs declines by 3MO, indicating defective niche quality contributes to the reduction in ETPs. Together, these findings indicate that diminished BM lymphopoiesis and thymic stromal support contribute to the initial decline in ETPs, setting the stage for progressive thymus involution.\n\nSummary statementThe number of early T-cell progenitors declines by 3 months of age in mice. This decline reflects a sharp drop in circulating thymus seeding progenitors, fewer bone marrow lymphoid progenitors, and reduced Notch signaling in both bone marrow and thymus.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal is a critical factor in designing successful pest control measures as it determines the rate of movement across target control areas and influences the risk of human exposure to the species and its pathogens. Here we used a fine scale spatial population genomic approach to investigate the dispersal ecology and population structure of Aedes notoscriptus, an important disease transmitting mosquito, on the Mornington Peninsula near Melbourne, Australia. The species is suspected to be involved in the transmission of Mycobacterium ulcerans, the bacterium that causes Buruli ulcer, in this area. We sampled and reared Ae. notoscriptus eggs at two time points from 170 traps up to 5 km apart and generated genomic data from 240 individuals. We also produced a draft genome assembly from a laboratory colony established from mosquitoes sampled near the study area. We found low genetic structure (Fst) and high coancestry throughout the study region. Using genetic data to identify close kin dyads, we found that mosquitoes had moved distances of >1km within a generation, which is further than previously described for this species. A spatial autocorrelation analysis of genetic distances indicated genetic dissimilarity at >4 km separation, a fourfold higher distance than for a comparable population of the dengue mosquito, Ae. aegypti, from Cairns, Australia. These findings point to high mobility of Ae. notoscriptus, highlighting the challenges of localized intervention strategies targeting this species. Further sampling within the same area at two time points 6 and 12 months after initial sampling showed that egg counts were relatively consistent across time, and that spatial variation in egg counts covaried with spatial variation in Wrights neighbourhood size (NS). As NS increases linearly with population density, egg counts may be useful for estimating relative density in Ae. notoscriptus. The results highlight the importance of acquiring species-specific data when planning control measures.",

Analyzing spatial transcriptomic data is computationally challenging, as the data collected from various spatial transcriptomic technologies are often noisy and display substantial spatial correlation across tissue locations. Here, we develop a spatially-aware dimension reduction method, SpatialPCA, that can extract a low dimensional representation of the spatial transcriptomics data with enriched biological signal and preserved spatial correlation structure, thus unlocking many existing computational tools previously developed in single-cell RNAseq studies for tailored and novel analysis of spatial transcriptomics. We illustrate the benefits of SpatialPCA for spatial domain detection and explores its utility for trajectory inference on the tissue and for high-resolution spatial map construction. In the real data applications, SpatialPCA identifies key molecular and immunological signatures in a newly detected tumor surrounding microenvironment, including a tertiary lymphoid structure that shapes the gradual transcriptomic transition during tumorigenesis and metastasis. In addition, SpatialPCA detects the past neuronal developmental history that underlies the current transcriptomic landscape across tissue locations in the cortex.",

    "abstract": "Fungal spore-killers are a class of selfish genetic elements that positively bias their own inheritance by killing non-inheriting gametes following meiosis. As killing takes place specifically within the developing fungal ascus, a tissue which is experimentally difficult to isolate, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying spore killers are limited. In particular, how these loci kill other spores within the fungal ascus is largely unknown. Here we overcome these experimental barriers by developing model systems in two evolutionary distant organisms, Escherichia coli (bacterium) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). Using these systems, we show that the Podospora anserina spore killer protein Spok1 enacts killing through targeting DNA.\n\nSignificance StatementNatural gene drives have shaped the genomes of many eukaryotes and recently have been considered for applications to control undesirable species. In fungi these loci are called spore-killers. Despite their importance in evolutionary processes and possible applications our understanding of how they enact killing is limited. We show that the spore killer protein Spok1, which has homologues throughout the fungal tree of life, acts via DNA disruption. Spok1 is only the second spore killer locus in which the cellular target of killing has been identified and is the first known to target DNA. We also show that the DNA disrupting activity of Spok1 is functional in both bacteria and yeast suggesting a highly conserved mode of action.",

Though recent transcriptomic studies have been successful in revealing the circadian rhythmicity in gene expression, the power calculation for omics circadian analysis have not been fully explored. In this paper, we develop a statistical method, namely CircaPower, to perform power calculation for circadian pattern detection. Our theoretical framework is determined by three key factors in circadian gene detection: sample size, intrinsic effect size and sampling design. Via simulations, we systematically investigate the impact of these key factors on circadian power calculation. We not only demonstrate that CircaPower is fast and accurate, but also show its underlying cosinor model is robust against variety of violations of model assumptions. In real applications, we demonstrate the performance of CircaPower using mouse pan-tissue data and human post-mortem brain data, and illustrate how to perform circadian power calculation using mouse skeleton muscle RNA-Seq pilot as case study. Our method CircaPower has been implemented in an R package, which is made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/circaPower/circaPower).",

    "abstract": "The advent of the pan-genome era has unraveled previously unknown genetic variation existing within diverse crop plants including rice. This untapped genetic variation is believed to account for a major portion of phenotypic variation existing in crop plants and might be responsible for missing heritability. However, the use of conventional single reference-guided genotyping often fails to capture large portion of this genetic variation leading to a reference bias. This makes it difficult to identify and utilize novel population/cultivar-specific genes for crop improvement. To overcome this challenge, we developed a rice pan-genome genotyping array (RPGA) includes 80K genome-wide SNPs which provides simple, user-friendly and cost-effective solution for rapid pan-genome-based genotyping in rice. The GWAS conducted using RPGA-SNP genotyping data of a rice diversity panel detected total of 42 loci, including previously known as well as novel genomic loci regulating grain size/weight traits in rice. Eight of the identified trait-associated loci (dispensable loci) could not be detected with conventional single reference genome-based GWAS and found to be missing from the commonly used Nipponbare reference genome. WD repeat-containing PROTEIN 12 gene underlying one of such dispensable locus on chromosome 7 (qLWR7) along with few other non-dispensable loci was subsequently detected using high-resolution QTL mapping confirming authenticity of RPGA-led GWAS. This demonstrates the potential of RPGA-based genotyping to overcome reference bias. Besides GWAS, the application of RPGA-based genotyping for natural allelic diversity and population structure analysis, seed purity and hybridity testing, ultra-high-density genetic map construction and chromosome level genome assembly, and marker-assisted foreground/background selection was successfully demonstrated. Based on these salient outcomes, a web application (http://www.rpgaweb.com) was also developed to provide easy to use platform for imputation of RPGA-based genotyping data using 3K Rice Reference Panel and subsequent GWAS in order to drive genetic improvement of rice.",

    "abstract": "Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful strategy which enables global profiling of protein interactome with direct interaction interfaces in complex biological systems. The alkyne-tagged enrichable cross-linkers are preferred to improve the coverage of low-abundance cross-linked peptides, combined with click chemistry for biotin conjugation to allow the cross-linked peptides enrichment. However, a systematic evaluation on the efficiency of click approaches (protein-based or peptide-based) and diverse cleavable click chemistry ligands (acid, reduction, photo) for cross-linked peptides enrichment and release is lacking. Herein, together with in vivo chemical cross-linking by alkyne-tagged cross-linker, we explored the click chemistry-based enrichment approaches on protein and peptide level with three cleavable click chemistry ligands, respectively. By comparison, the approach of protein-based click chemistry conjugation with acid-cleavable tag was demonstrated to permit the most cross-linked peptides identification. The advancement of this strategy enhanced the proteome-wide cross-linking analysis, permitting a detection of 5,017 protein-protein interactions among 1,909 proteins across all subcellular compartments with wide abundance distribution in cell. Therefore, all these results demonstrated a guideline value of our work for efficient cross-linked peptides enrichment, thus facilitated the in-depth profiling of protein interactome for functional analysis.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=67 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/475819v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a7ae4forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a4d6d2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@113a0eborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a9c193_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMechanical ventilation (MV) is a lifesaving therapy used for patients with respiratory failure. Nevertheless, MV is associated with numerous complications and increased mortality. The aim of this study is to define the effects of MV on gene expression of direct and peripheral human tissues.\n\nMethodsClassification models were applied to Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) gene expression data of six representative tissues- liver, adipose, skin, nerve-tibial, muscle and lung, for performance comparison and feature analysis. We utilized 18 prediction models using the Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) decision tree and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) methods to classify ventilation and non-ventilation samples and to compare their prediction performance for the six tissues. In the model comparison, the AUC (area under receiver operating curve), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate the predictive performance of each model. We then conducted feature analysis per each tissue to detect MV marker genes followed by pathway enrichment analysis for these genes.\n\nResultsXGBoost outperformed the other methods and predicted samples had undergone MV with an average accuracy for the six tissues of 0.951 and average AUC of 0.945. The feature analysis detected a combination of MV marker genes per each tested tissue, some common across several tissues. MV marker genes were mainly related to inflammation and fibrosis as well as cell development and movement regulation. The MV marker genes were significantly enriched in inflammatory and viral pathways.\n\nConclusionThe XGBoost method demonstrated clear enhanced performance and feature analysis compared to the other models. XGBoost was helpful in detecting the tissue-specific marker genes for identifying transcriptomic changes related to MV. Our results show that MV is associated with reduced development and movement in the tissues and higher inflammation and injury not only in direct tissues such as the lungs but also in peripheral tissues and thus should be carefully considered before being implemented.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated expression of splicing factors has important roles in cancer development and progression. However, it remains a challenge to identify the cancer-specific splicing variants. Here we demonstrated that spliceosome component BUD31 is increased in ovarian cancer, and its higher expression predicts worse prognosis. We characterized the BUD31 binding motif and found that BUD31 preferentially binds exon-intron regions near splicing sites by CLIP-seq. Further analysis revealed that BUD31 inhibition results in extensive exon skipping and decreased abundance of long CDS isoforms. In particular, we identified BCL2L12, an anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member, as a functional splicing target of BUD31. BUD31 stimulates the inclusion of exon 3 to generate full-length BCL2L12 and promotes ovarian cancer progression. Knockdown of BUD31 or splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide treatment promotes exon 3 skipping and results in a truncated isoform of BCL2L12 that undergoes nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and the cells subsequently undergo apoptosis. Our findings reveal BUD31-regulated exon inclusion as a critical factor in ovarian cancer cell survival and progression.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy can eradicate a majority of cancer cells. However, a small population of tumor cells often survives drug treatments through genetic and/or non-genetic mechanisms, leading to tumor recurrence. Here we report a reversible chemoresistance phenotype regulated by the mTOR pathway. Through a genome-wide CRISPR knockout library screen in pancreatic cancer cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents, we have identified mTOR pathway as a prominent determinant of chemosensitivity. Pharmacological suppression of mTOR activity in cancer cells from diverse tissue origins leads to the persistence of a reversibly resistant population, which is otherwise eliminated by chemotherapeutic agents. Conversely, activation of mTOR pathway increases chemosensitivity in vitro and in vivo and predicts better survival among various human cancers. Persister cells display a senescence phenotype. Inhibition of mTOR does not induce cellular senescence per se, but rather promotes the survival of senescent cells through regulation of autophagy and G2/M cell cycle arrest, as revealed by a small molecule chemical library screen. Thus, mTOR plays a causal yet paradoxical role in regulating chemosensitivity; inhibition of the mTOR pathway, while suppressing tumor expansion, facilitates the development of a reversible drug-tolerant senescence state.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a heterogeneous disorder, but the factors that determine this heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction is causally linked to NAFLD since it causes intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) accumulation through increased hepatic lipid flow, due to insulin resistance (IR) and pro-inflammatory adipokines release. While many studies in NAFLD have looked at total adiposity (that is mainly subcutaneous fat, SC-AT), it is still unclear the impact of visceral fat (VF). Thus, we investigated how VF vs. SC-AT were related to NAFLD in lean, overweight, and obese individuals compared to lean controls.\n\nMethodsThirty-four non-diabetic NAFLD with liver biopsy and eight lean control individuals (CT) were enrolled in this study. We measured fat distribution (VF, SC-AT and IHTG) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), adiponectin concentration, free fatty acids (FFAs) and triglyceride (TAG) concentration and composition by mass spectrometry (MS), lipolysis and IR by tracer infusion.\n\nResultsIHTG was positively associated with lipolysis, adipose tissue IR, TG concentrations, and increased ratio of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids. VF was higher in NAFLD (including lean individuals) compared to controls, was increased with fibrosis stage and was associated with IR in liver, muscle and adipose tissue, increased lipolysis, and decreased adiponectin levels. Collectively, our results suggest that VF accumulation, given its location close to the liver, is one of the major risk factors for NAFLD.\n\nConclusionsThese findings propose VF as an early indicator of NAFLD independently of BMI, which may allow for evidence-based prevention and intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerve mapping tools with higher spatial resolution are needed to advance systems neuroscience, and potentially provide a closed-loop biomarker in neuromodulation applications. Two critical challenges of microscale neural interfaces are (i) how to apply them to small peripheral nerves, and (ii) how to minimize chronic reactivity. We developed a flexible microneedle nerve array (MINA), which is the first high-density penetrating electrode array made with axon-sized silicon microneedles embedded in low-modulus thin silicone. We present the design, fabrication, acute recording, and chronic reactivity to an implanted MINA. Distinctive units were identified in the rat peroneal nerve. We also demonstrate a long-term, cuff-free, and suture-free fixation manner using rose bengal as a light-activated adhesive for two timepoints. The tissue response at 1-week included a sham (N=5) and MINA-implanted (N=5) group, and the response at 6-week also included a sham (N=3) and MINA-implanted (N=4) group. These conditions were quantified in the left vagus nerve of rats using histomorphometry. Micro-CT was added to visualize and quantify tissue encapsulation around the implant. MINA demonstrated a reduction in encapsulation thickness over previously quantified interfascicular methods. Future challenges include techniques for precise insertion of the microneedle electrodes and demonstrating long-term recording.",

    "abstract": "The motor system adapts to changes in the body and the environment by learning from sensory prediction errors, the difference between predicted and actual visual feedback. This process is highly automatic and implicit, with the response to the visual feedback occurring even when the resultant change from the sensory prediction error worsens task performance. Given that informative and relevant feedback in the real world is often intertwined with distracting and irrelevant feedback, we asked how the relevancy of visual feedback impacts implicit adaptation. To tackle this question, we presented multiple cursors as visual feedback in a center-out reaching task and varied the task relevance of these cursors. In other words, participants were instructed to hit a target with a specific task-relevant cursor, while ignoring the other cursors. In Experiment 1, we found that reach aftereffects were attenuated by the mere presence of distracting cursors, compared to reach aftereffects in response to a single task-relevant cursor. The degree of attenuation did not depend on the position of the distracting cursors. In Experiment 2, we examined the interaction between task relevance and attention. Participants were asked to adapt to a task-relevant cursor/target pair, while ignoring the task-irrelevant cursor/target pair. Critically, we jittered the location of the relevant and irrelevant target in an uncorrelated manner, allowing us to index attention via how well participants tracked the position of target. As expected, participants who were better at tracking the task-relevant target/cursor pair showed greater aftereffects, and interestingly, the same correlation applied to the task-irrelevant target/cursor pair. Together, these results highlight the novel role of task relevancy on modulating implicit adaptation, perhaps by giving greater attention to informative sources of feedback, increasing the saliency of the sensory prediction error.",

    "abstract": "Many brain functions are difficult to localize, as they involve distributed networks that reconfigure themselves on short timescales. One example is the integration of oculomotor and visual signals that occurs with each eye movement: The brain must combine motor signals about the eye displacement with retinal signals, to infer the structure of the surrounding environment. Our understanding of this process comes primarily from single-neuron recordings, which are limited in spatial extent, or fMRI measurements, which have poor temporal resolution. We have therefore studied visual processing during eye movements, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), which affords high spatiotemporal resolution. Human subjects performed a task in which they reported the orientation of a visual stimulus while executing a saccade. After removal of eye movement artifacts, time-frequency analysis revealed a signal that propagated in the beta-frequency band from parietal cortex to visual cortex. This signal had the characteristics of perisaccadic \"remapping\", a neural signature of the integration of oculomotor and visual signals. These results reveal a novel mechanism of visual perception and demonstrate that MEG can provide a useful window into distributed brain functions.",

    "abstract": "Serotonergic hallucinogenic drugs potently affect human brain and behavior, and have recently emerged as potentially promising agents in psychopharmacotherapy. Complementing rodent studies, zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a powerful animal model for screening neuroactive drugs, including serotonergic agents. Here, we test ten different N-Benzyl-2-phenylethylamine (NBPEA) derivatives with the 2,4- and 3,4-dimethoxy substitutions in the phenethylamine moiety and the - OCH3, -OCF3, -F, -Cl and -Br substitutions in the ortho position of phenyl ring of N-benzyl fragment, assessing their behavioral and neurochemical effects in adult zebrafish. Overall, substitutions in N-benzyl fragment primarily affected zebrafish locomotion, and in phenethylamine moiety - anxiety-like behavior, also modulating brain serotonin and/or dopamine turnover. We also identified several behavioral clusters, including anxiogenic/hypolocomotor (24H-NBF, 24H-NBOMe and 34H-NBF), behaviorally inert (34H-NBBr, 34H-NBCl and 34H- NBOMe), anxiogenic/hallucinogenic-like (24H-NBBr, 24H-NBCl and 24H-NBOMe(F)), and anxiolytic/hallucinogenic-like (34H-NBOMe(F)) agents. The 24H-NBOMe(F) and 34H-NBOMe(F) also reduced despair-like behavior in zebrafish. The artificial intelligence-driven phenotyping supports association of multiple compounds with NMDA antagonists and/or MDMA, supporting their potential hallucinogenic-like properties, as well as other valuable psychoactive effects. In silico functional molecular activity modelling also supports existing of similarities between studied NBPEAs drugs, MDMA, and ketamine. Functional analysis implicates potential involvement of serotonin release stimulating activity, calcium channel (voltage-sensitive) activity, some serotonin receptors activity and variety of psychiatric and neurologic disorders treatments activities. Overall, we report potent neuroactive properties of several novel synthetic N-benzylphenylethylamines in an in vivo vertebrate model system (zebrafish), raising the possibility of their potential use in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Introducing altered visual feedback of the hand results in quick adaptation of reaching movements. And while this may be partly due to explicit strategies, our lab has shown that implicit changes like reach aftereffects and shift in estimates of the unseen hand, can also emerge and even saturate within a few training trials. The goal of the current study is to determine whether these rapid changes in unseen hand position that occur during classical visuomotor adaptation are diminished or slowed when feedback during training is reduced. We reduced feedback by either providing visual feedback only at the end of the reach (terminal feedback) or constraining hand movements to reduce efferent contribution (exposure). We measured changes as participants completed reaches with a 30{degrees} rotation, a -30{degrees} rotation and clamped visual feedback, with these two \"impoverished\" training conditions, along with classical visuomotor adaptation training, while continuously estimating their felt hand position. Classic continuous-cursor training produced exemplary learning curves and rapid and robust shifts in felt hand position. Training with terminal feedback slightly reduced the initial rate of change in overall adaptation and but not the magnitude of shifts in felt hand position. Finally using a robot to constrain and deviate hand movement direction, called exposure training, only delayed saturation of proprioceptive changes by a single trial and these changes were slightly smaller than those during classical training. Taken together, adaptation and shifts in felt hand position are a rapid and robust responses to sensory mismatches and are only slightly modulated when feedback is reduced. This means that, given a visuo-proprioceptive mismatch, the resulting shift in sense of limb position can contribute to movements from the start of adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Tree bark constitutes ideal habitat for microbial communities, because it is a stable substrate, rich in micro-niches. Bacteria, fungi, and terrestrial microalgae together form microbial communities, which in turn support more bark-associated organisms, such as mosses, lichens, and invertebrates, thus contributing to forest biodiversity. We have a limited understanding of the diversity and biotic interactions of the bark-associated microbiome, as investigations have mainly focussed on agriculturally relevant systems and on single taxonomic groups. Here we implemented a multi-kingdom metabarcoding approach to analyse diversity and community structure of the green algal, bacterial, and fungal components of the bark-associated microbial communities of beech, the most common broadleaved tree of Central European forests. We identified the most abundant taxa, hub taxa, and co-occurring taxa. We found that tree size (as a proxy for age) is an important driver of community assembly, suggesting that environmental filtering leads to less diverse fungal and algal communities over time. Conversely, forest management intensity had negligible effects on microbial communities on bark. Our study suggests the presence of undescribed, yet ecologically meaningful taxa, especially in the fungi, and highlights the importance of bark surfaces as a reservoir of microbial diversity. Our results constitute a first, essential step towards an integrated framework for understanding microbial community assembly processes on bark surfaces, an understudied habitat and neglected component of terrestrial biodiversity. Finally, we propose a cost-effective sampling strategy to study bark-associated microbial communities across large spatial or environmental scales.",

Here, we demonstrate a flower detection model from street-level photos, which can be the core function of a semi-automatic observation system to tackle those issues above. We detected cherry blossoms by this model from geotagged images with the observation date, obtained from Mapillary, which is one of social sensing data sources, and mapped dates of flowering in a study site, Aizuwakamatsu, Japan in April 2018. This approach enables us to collect floral phenology information semi-automatically as a data-driven approach.

    "abstract": "Human disturbance and climate change can impact populations by disrupting movement corridors and reducing important habitat. Characterizing how animals respond to such environmental changes is valuable for conservation as many species, especially habitat specialists, can experience reduced genetic diversity when deleterious habitat change occurs, leading to an increased likelihood of extirpation. Mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) exemplify this conservation challenge; their geographically isolated habitat can inhibit gene flow, making them susceptible to population declines in the face of anthropogenic-induced landscape change. To facilitate biologically informed population management of mountain goats in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska, we characterized the fine-scale genetic population structure and examined how future climate change could impact the population density of these mountain goats. We used DNA samples to estimate diversity and depict the genealogical history. Climate response models allowed us to simulate changes to suitable habitat and predict how this might influence future population structure. Our results indicated that three genetically distinct subpopulations exist in Glacier Bay and that the population structure is reflective of the historic landscape patterns. Climate modeling predicted that demographic productivity was likely to be reduced for all subpopulations; additionally, we found that climate change likely degrades the suitability of movement corridors that facilitate gene flow between subpopulations, ultimately increasing the cost of travel. Understanding such fine-scale patterns are key to managing subpopulations, particularly with impending changes to the landscape.",

    "abstract": "Broadscale environmental gradients exert selection pressures that can result in macroevolutionary patterns of phenotypic diversity. Bergmanns rule, one of the most studied ecogeographical patterns, states that among related species or populations, larger body sizes should occur at higher latitudes or colder climates given the efficacy of larger sizes to conserve heat. However, there is still much debate regarding the mechanisms that underlie the rule and whether they should be different between endotherms and ectotherms. Here we test for Bergmanns rule in Microlophus lizards, a genus distributed in western South America and the Galapagos Islands, and test for associations between body size and climatic variables. Our results indicate that mainland Microlophus species follow Bergmanns rule, meaning that larger species are found towards the southernmost latitudes encompassed by the genus distribution. This relationship was similar for males and females, suggesting that patterns of sexual size dimorphism are not driven by differing latitudinal gradients of body size between the sexes. We identified negative associations between body size and temperature, precipitation, and isothermality, meaning that larger species are found in colder, drier, and more thermally variable environments. We discuss the possible mechanisms behind this pattern, the implications of insularity and ecology for the evolution of body size in this genus, and emphasize the need for additional natural history information to allow for the elucidation of the mechanisms behind the patterns presented in this work.",

    "abstract": "Efficient computing techniques allow the estimation of variance components for virtually any traditional dataset. When genomic information is available, variance components can be estimated using genomic REML (GREML). If only a portion of the animals have genotypes, single-step GREML (ssGREML) is the method of choice. The genomic relationship matrix (G) used in both cases is dense, limiting computations depending on the number of genotyped animals. The algorithm for proven and young (APY) can be used to create a sparse inverse of G[Formula] with close to linear memory and computing requirements. In ssGREML, the inverse of the realized relationship matrix (H-1) also includes the inverse of the pedigree relationship matrix, which can be dense with long pedigree, but sparser with short. The main purpose of this study was to investigate whether costs of ssGREML can be reduced using APY with truncated pedigree and phenotypes. We also investigated the impact of truncation on variance components estimation when different numbers of core animals are used in APY. Simulations included 150K animals from 10 generations, with selection. Phenotypes (h2 = 0.3) were available for all animals in generations 1-9. A total of 30K animals in generations 8 and 9, and 15K validation animals in generation 10 were genotyped for 52,890 SNP. Average information REML and ssGREML with G-1 and [Formula] using 1K, 5K, 9K, and 14K core animals were compared. Variance components are impacted when the core group in APY represents the number of eigenvalues explaining a small fraction of the total variation in G. The most time-consuming operation was the inversion, with more than 50% of the total time. Next, numerical factorization consumed nearly 30% of the total computing time. On average, a 7% decrease in the computing time for ordering was observed by removing each generation of data. APY can be successfully applied to create the inverse of the genomic relationship matrix used in ssGREML for estimating variance components. To ensure reliable variance component estimation, it is important to use a core size that corresponds to the number of largest eigenvalues explaining around 98% of total variation in G. When APY is used, pedigrees can be truncated to increase the sparsity of H and slightly reduce computing time for ordering and symbolic factorization, with no impact on the estimates.\n\nLay SummaryThe estimation of variance components is computationally expensive under large-scale genetic evaluations due to several inversions of the coefficient matrix. Variance components are used as parameters for estimating breeding values in mixed model equations (MME). However, resulting breeding values are not Best Linear Unbiased Predictions (BLUP) unless the variance components approach the true parameters. The increasing availability of genomic data requires the development of new methods for improving the efficiency of variance component estimations. Therefore, this study aimed to reduce the costs of single-step genomic REML (ssGREML) with the Algorithm for Proven and Young (APY) for estimating variance components with truncated pedigree and phenotypes. In addition, we investigated the influence of truncation on variance components and genetic parameter estimates. Under APY, the size of the core group influences the similarity of breeding values and their reliability compared to the full genomic matrix. In this study, we found that to ensure reliable variance component estimation it is required to consider a core size that corresponds to the number of largest eigenvalues explaining around 98% of the total variation in G to avoid biased parameters. In terms of costs, the use of APY slightly decreased the time for ordering and symbolic factorization with no impact on estimations.\n\nTeaser TextEstimation of variance components is becoming computationally challenging due to the increasing size of genomic information. We investigated the impacts of using the algorithm for proven and young (APY) in genetic evaluations. The use of APY has no impact on variance components and genetic parameters estimation.",

While the detection of specific microbes using RNA sequencing offers good sensitivity and specificity, untargeted approaches suffer from very high false positive rates and a lack of sensitivity for lowly abundant organisms.\n\nResultsWe introduce Pathonoia, an algorithm that detects viruses and bacteria in RNA sequencing data with high precision and recall. Pathonoia first applies an established k-mer based method for species identification and then aggregates this evidence over all reads in a sample. In addition, we provide an easy-to-use analysis framework that highlights potential microbe-host cell interactions by correlating the microbial to host gene expression. Pathonoia outperforms competing algorithms in microbial detection specificity, both on in silico and real datasets. Lastly, we present two case studies in human liver and brain in which microbial infection might exacerbate disease.\n\nAvailabilityA Python package for Pathonoia sample analysis and a guided analysis Jupyter notebook for bulk RNAseq datasets are available on GitHub https://github.com/kepsi/Pathonoia.\n\nContactaliebho1@jhu.edu and s.bonn@uke.de\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=93 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/476681v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16775f2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17099f4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18b8dfeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@117498b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The advent of multi-modal single cell sequencing techniques have shed new light on molecular mechanisms by simultaneously inspecting transcriptomes, epigenomes and proteomes of the same cell. However, to date, the existing computational approaches for integration of multimodal single cell data are either computationally expensive, require the delineation of parameters or can only be applied to particular modalities.\n\nWe present a single cell multi-modal integration method, named MOJITOO (Multi-mOdal Joint IntegraTion of cOmpOnents). MOJITOO uses canonical correlation analysis for a fast and parameter free detection of a shared representation of cells from multimodal single cell data. Moreover, estimated canonical components can be used for interpretation, i.e. association of modality specific molecular features with the latent space. We evaluate MOJITOO using bi- and tri-modal single cell data sets and show that MOJITOO outperforms existing methods regarding computational requirements, preservation of original latent spaces and clustering.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients receive chemotherapy treatment, including doxorubicin, due to the lack of targeted therapies. Drug resistance is a major cause of treatment failure in TNBC and therefore, there is a need to identify biomarkers that determine effective drug response. Here, a pharmacometabolomics study was performed using TNBC patient-derived xenograft models to detect urinary metabolic biomarkers of doxorubicin effectiveness. Diacetylspermine was identified as a urine metabolite that robustly changed in response to effective doxorubicin treatment, which persisted after the final dose. Diacetylspermine was directly traced back to the tumor and correlated with tumor volume. Ex vivo tumor slices revealed that doxorubicin directly increases diacetylspermine production by increasing tumor spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 expression and activity, which was corroborated by elevated polyamine flux. In breast cancer patients, tumor diacetylspermine was elevated compared to matched non-cancerous tissue and increased in HER2+ and TNBC compared to ER+ subtypes. In addition, 12-hour urine diacetylspermine was associated with breast cancer tumor volume and poor tumor grade. This study describes a pharmacometabolomics strategy for identifying cancer metabolic biomarkers that indicate drug response. Our findings characterize urine diacetylspermine as a non-invasive biomarker of doxorubicin effectiveness in TNBC.",

Here, we characterised previously unknown endogenous RELA-GFP dynamics in PDAC cell lines by live single cell imaging, which revealed rapid, sustained and non-oscillatory nuclear RELA following TNF stimulation. Using Bayesian analysis of single cell datasets with variation in nuclear RELA, we computationally predicted that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics. By RNA-seq, we identified the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31 as transcriptionally regulated by RELA. In turn, NUAK2 or ARHGAP31 siRNA depletion downregulates TNF-stimulated RELA nuclear localisation in PDAC cells, establishing a novel negative feedback loop regulating RELA activation by TNF. We identify an additional actin-independent feedback loop involving RELB, which suppresses TNF-mediated RELA nuclear localisation following RELA mediated upregulation of RELB. Taken together, we provide computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC.",

Using prospective xeno-transplantation experiments, we demonstrate that myoepithelial-like cells act as progenitors of ductal-like cells. Using three-dimensional (3D) organoid cultures, we demonstrate that agonists of retinoic acid (RA) signaling promote differentiation of myoepithelial-like cells into ductal-like cells, while inhibitors of RA signaling selectively kill ductal-like cells.

    "abstract": "Fitness benefits from division of labor in microbial consortia are well documented, but the dependency of the benefits on environmental context is poorly understood. Two synthetic Escherichia coli consortia were built to test the relationships between exchanged organic acid, local environment, and opportunity costs of different metabolic strategies. Opportunity costs quantify benefits not realized due to selecting one phenotype over another. The consortia catabolized glucose and exchanged either acetic or lactic acid to create producer-consumer food webs. The organic acids had different inhibitory properties and different opportunity costs associated with their positions in central metabolism. The exchanged metabolites modulated different consortial dynamics. The acetic acid-exchanging (AAE) consortium had a  push interaction motif where acetic acid was secreted faster by the producer than the consumer imported it, while the lactic acid-exchanging (LAE) consortium had a  pull interaction motif where the consumer imported lactic acid at a comparable rate to its production. The LAE consortium outperformed wild type (WT) batch cultures under the environmental context of weakly buffered conditions, achieving a 55% increase in biomass titer, a 51% increase in biomass per proton yield, an 86% increase in substrate conversion, and the complete elimination of byproduct accumulation all relative to the WT. However, the LAE consortium had the tradeoff of a 42% lower specific growth rate. The AAE consortium did not outperform the WT in any considered fitness metric. Fitness advantages of the LAE consortium were sensitive to environment; increasing the medium buffering capacity negated the fitness advantages compared to WT.\n\nIMPORTANCEMost naturally occurring microorganisms persist in consortia where metabolic interactions are common and often essential to ecosystem function. This study uses synthetic ecology to test how different cellular interaction motifs influence fitness properties of consortia. Environmental context ultimately controlled the division of labor fitness as shifts from weakly buffered to highly buffered conditions negated the benefits of the strategy. Understanding the limits of division of labor advances our understanding of natural community functioning which is central to nutrient cycling and provides design rules for assembling consortia used in applied bioprocessing.",

So far, this form of LTP has been induced in O-LM cells by physiologically unrealistic protocols. We report here the induction of both synaptic and intrinsic potentiation in O-LM interneurons following stimulation of afferent glutamatergic inputs in the theta ({theta}) frequency range. LTP is induced by synaptic activation of CP-AMPAR whereas long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) results from the mGluR1-dependent down-regulation of Kv7 voltage-dependent potassium channel and hyperpolarization activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel through the depletion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bi-phosphate (PIP2). LTP and LTP-IE are reversible, demonstrating that both synaptic and intrinsic changes are bidirectional in O-LM cells.

    "abstract": "Animal tissues are comprised of diverse cell types. However, the mechanisms controlling the number of each cell type within tissue compartments remain poorly understood. Here, we report that different cell types utilize distinct strategies to control population numbers. Proliferation of fibroblasts, stromal cells important for tissue integrity, is limited by space availability. In contrast, proliferation of macrophages, innate immune cells involved in defense, repair, and homeostasis, is constrained by growth factor availability. Examination of density-dependent gene expression in fibroblasts revealed that Hippo and TGF-{beta} target genes are both regulated by cell density. We found YAP1, the transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo signaling pathway, directly regulates expression of Csf1, the lineage-specific growth factor for macrophages, through an enhancer of Csf1 that is specifically active in fibroblasts. Activation of YAP1 in fibroblasts elevates Csf1 expression and is sufficient to increase the number of macrophages at steady state. Our data also suggest that expression programs in fibroblasts that change with density may result from sensing of mechanical force through actin-dependent mechanisms. Altogether, we demonstrate that two different modes of population control are connected and coordinated to regulate cell numbers of distinct cell types. Sensing of the tissue environment may serve as a general strategy to control tissue composition.\n\nSignificance StatementCollections of distinct cell types constitute animal tissues. To perform their unique functions, each cell type must exist in the correct number and proportion in a given tissue compartment. However, many of the mechanisms regulating and coordinating cell population sizes remain enigmatic. Our study characterizes two different modes of population size control, utilized by two ubiquitous cell types, macrophages and fibroblasts. Macrophage populations are more sensitive to the presence of growth factors in the environment and fibroblasts are more sensitive to space limitations. Intriguingly, space-sensing mechanisms in fibroblasts directly control the production of growth factor for macrophages and thus macrophage numbers. This link suggests a mechanism by which macrophage compartment size is controlled by stromal cells according to the microenvironment.",

Soon after hatching, chicks can perform sophisticated numerical tasks. Nevertheless, the neural basis of their numerical abilities has remained unknown. Here, we describe for the first time number neurons in the caudal nidopallium (functionally equivalent to the mammalian prefrontal cortex) of young domestic chicks. Number neurons that we found in young chicks showed remarkable similarities to those in the prefrontal cortex and caudal nidopallium of adult animals. Thus, our results suggest that numerosity perception based on the labeled-line code provided by number neurons might be an inborn feature of the vertebrate brain.\n\nSignificanceNumerosity, i.e. the number of items in a set, is a significant aspect in the perception of the environment. Behavioural and in silico experiments suggest that number sense belongs to a core knowledge system and can be present already at birth. However, neurons sensitive to the number of visual items have been so far described only in the brain of adult animals. Therefore, it remained unknown to what extent their selectivity would depend on visual learning and experience. We found number neurons in the caudal nidopallium (a higher associative area with functional similarities to the mammalian prefrontal cortex) of very young, numerically naive domestic chicks.

In addition to hypophyseotropic cells, CRH is widely expressed in the CNS, however their involvement in organization of the stress response is not fully understood. In these experiments, we took the advantage of recently available Crh-IRES-Cre; Ai9 mouse line to study the recruitment of hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic CRH neurons in categorically distinct, acute stress reactions. Reporter mice were exposed to restraint, ether, high salt and lipopolisacharide stress. The induced activation of CRH neurons was detected by colocalization of immediate early gene c-Fos in Td tomato expressing cells. We found differential activation of CRH neurons in central amygdaloid nucleus (Ce), bed nucleus stria terminalis lateral division, ventral posterior (BSTLVP), medial preoptic nucleus (MPO), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), premammillary nucleus (PM) and prepositus hypoglossal nucleus (Pr) in response to physiological (ether, high salt and LPS) and psychological (restraint) stressors. CRH positive cells in Pa became activated, however in the Barringtons nucleus and locus coeruleus no actiovation could be observed due to most tested stressors. Furthermore no CRH neuron activation occured in dorsal (BSTLD) and posterior (BSTLP) region of lateral division of bed nucleus stria terminalis after restraint stress. In the inferior olive only ether exposition resulted in CRH neuron activation. These results confirm activation of CRH neurons in the Pa, reveals new subset of stress-related CRH cells through the mouse brain and disprove the recruitment of CRH cells in the SOL and in the Barringtons nucleus to acute psychological stress in mice.",

    "abstract": "Tree planting programs now need to consider climate change increasingly, therefore, the resistance to pests plays an essential role in enabling tree adaptation to new ranges through tree population movement. The weevil Pissodes strobi (Peck) is a major pest of spruces and substantially reduces lumber quality. We revisited a large Interior spruce provenance/progeny trial (2,964 genotypes, 42 families) of varying susceptibility, established in British Columbia. We employed multivariate mixed linear models to estimate covariances between, and genetic control of, juvenile height growth and resistance traits. We performed linear regressions and ordinal logistic regressions to test for impact of parental origin on growth and susceptibility to the pest, respectively. A significant environmental component affected the correlations between resistance and height, with outcomes dependent on families. Parents sourced from above 950 m a.s.l. elevation negatively influenced host resistance to attacks, probably due to higher P. engelmannii proportion. For the genetic contribution of parents sourced from above 1,200 m a.s.l., however, we found less attack severity, probably due to a marked mismatch in phenologies. This clearly highlights that hybrid status might be a good predictor for weevil attacks and delineates the boundaries of successful spruce population movement. Families resulting from crossing susceptible with resistant parents generally showed fast-growing trees were the least affected by weevil attacks. Such results indicate that these \"hybrids\" might be genetically better equipped with an optimized resource allocation between defence and growth and might provide the solution for concurrent improvement in resistance against weevil attacks, whilst maintaining tree productivity.",

    "abstract": "The Sicilian wolf represented the only population of wolves living on a Mediterranean island until the first half of the twentieth century (1930s-1960s) 1-7. Previous studies hypothesised that they remained isolated from mainland wolves from the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 8,9, until human persecutions led them to extinction 1-7.\n\nThere are only seven known Sicilian wolf specimens from the 19th and 20th century preserved in museums in Italy and recent morphometric analyses assigned them to the new subspecies Canis lupus cristaldii 10. To better understand the origins of the Sicilian wolf, and its relationship to other wolf populations, we sequenced four whole genomes (3.8x-11.6x) and five mitogenomes. We investigated the relationship between Sicilian wolves and other modern breeds to identify potential admixture. Furthermore, considering that the last land-bridge between Sicily and Italy disappeared after the LGM 11, around 17 kya, we explored the possibility that the Sicilian wolf retained ancestry from ancient wolf and dog lineages. Additionally, we explored whether the long-term isolation might have affected the genomic diversity, inbreeding levels and genetic load of the Sicilian wolf.\n\nOur findings show that the Sicilian wolves shared most ancestry with the modern Italian wolf population but are better modelled as admixed with European dog breeds, and shared traces of Eneolithic and Bronze age European dogs. We also find signatures of severe inbreeding and low genomic diversity at population and individual levels due to long-term isolation and drift, suggesting also low effective population size.",

    "abstract": "Numerous brain disorders demonstrate structural brain abnormalities, which are thought to arise from molecular perturbations or connectome miswiring. The unique and shared contributions of these molecular and connectomic vulnerabilities to brain disorders remain unknown, and has yet to be studied in a single multi-disorder framework. Using MRI morphometry from the ENIGMA consortium, we construct maps of cortical abnormalities for thirteen neurodevelopmental, neurological, and psychiatric disorders from N = 21 000 patients and N = 26 000 controls, collected using a harmonized processing protocol. We systematically compare cortical maps to multiple micro-architectural measures, including gene expression, neurotransmitter density, metabolism, and myelination (molecular vulnerability), as well as global connectomic measures including number of connections, centrality, and connection diversity (connectomic vulnerability). We find that regional molecular vulnerability and macroscale brain network architecture interact to drive the spatial patterning of cortical abnormalities in multiple disorders. Local attributes, particularly neurotransmitter receptor profiles, constitute the best predictors of both disorder-specific cortical morphology and cross-disorder similarity. Finally, we find that cross-disorder abnormalities are consistently subtended by a small subset of network epicentres in bilateral sensory-motor, medial temporal lobe, precuneus, and superior parietal cortex. Collectively, our results highlight how local biological attributes and global connectivity jointly shape cross-disorder cortical abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian gene Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is an essential mediator of brain assembly, development, and maturation which has been implicated in a variety of brain disorders such as neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. autism spectrum disorder), neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g. depression, PTSD, schizophrenia), and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Parkinsons). Loss of BDNF during early development is embryonic lethal, and depletion of BDNF during adolescence or adulthood can result in disease-related neuropathology across a broad range of model organisms. In order to better understand the role of BDNF in disease, we seek to provide an evolutionary context to BDNFs role within the brain by elucidating the molecular and genetic comparative history of BDNF across species. We conduct sequence alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction of the BDNF gene across a diverse selection of over 160 mammalian species spanning [~]177 million years of evolution. Selective evolutionary change was examined via several independent computational models of codon evolution including FEL, MEME, and BGM. We report strict purifying selection in the main functional domain of BDNF (NGF domain, essentially comprising the mature BDNF protein). Specifically, we discover 6 sites in our homologous alignment which are under episodic selection in the early regulatory region of BDNF (i.e. the prodomain) and 23 pairs of coevolving sites that are a part of complex spatial relationships that are distributed across the entire BDNF gene. Thus, we propose that our discovery of both local and distal sites of co-evolution within the pro- and mature-domains of BDNF that likely reflect the evolutionary fine-tuning of BDNFs unique and complex regulatory capacities whilst also retaining its core yet diverse ontogenic functionality within the central nervous system. This discovery consequently supports the idea that the BDNF prodomain is more prone to change than the mature domain, however the fact that this region has also been subject to negative purifying selection also highlights genetic sensitivity and thus partially explains the prodomains disease relevance (e.g. Val66Met and other variants) to numerous neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIWe extracted coding sequences for Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) from over 160 mammalian genomes that span approximately [~]177 million years of evolution.\nC_LIO_LIWe observe strict purifying selection in the main functional domain (NGF) of the BDNF gene in mammals.\nC_LIO_LIWe observe novel results with 6 sites in our homologous alignment which are under episodic selection in the early regulatory region of BDNF (i.e. the prodomain).\nC_LIO_LIWe observe 23 pairs of coevolving sites within BDNF. Many of which are a part of complex spatial relationships and are distributed across the entire BDNF gene.\nC_LIO_LIThese data define exactly how \"BDNF is highly conserved\" by defining exactly where and how the mammalian BDNF has evolved, confirming the widespread belief that the BDNF prodomain is more prone to change than the mature BDNF protein.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The perception of time is characterized by pronounced variability across individuals, with implications for a diverse array of psychological functions. The neurocognitive sources of this variability are poorly understood but accumulating evidence suggests a role for inter-individual differences in striatal dopamine levels. Here we present a pre-registered study that tested the predictions that spontaneous eye blink rates, which provide a proxy measure of striatal dopamine availability, would be associated with aberrant interval timing (lower temporal precision or overestimation bias). Neurotypical adults (N=69) underwent resting state eye tracking and completed visual psychophysical interval timing and control tasks. Elevated spontaneous eye blink rates were associated with poorer temporal precision but not with inter-individual differences in perceived duration or performance on the control task. These results signify a role for striatal dopamine in variability in human time perception and can help explain deficient temporal precision in psychiatric populations characterized by elevated dopamine levels.",

    "abstract": "The power and scope of disease modeling can be markedly enhanced through the incorporation of broad genetic diversity. In the the mouse, the introduction of pathogenic mutations into a single inbred strain sometimes fails to mimic human disease. We describe a cross-species precision disease modeling platform that exploits mouse genetic diversity to bridge cell-based modeling with whole organism analysis. We developed a universal protocol that permitted robust and reproducible neural differentiation of genetically diverse human and mouse pluripotent stem cell lines, then carried out a proof of concept study of the neurodevelopmental gene DYRK1A. The results in vitro reliably predicted the effects of genetic background on DYRK1A loss of function phenotypes and identified optimal mouse strains for in vivo disease modeling. Transcriptomic comparison of responsive and unresponsive strains identified novel molecular pathways conferring sensitivity or resilience to DYRK1A loss, and highlighted differential mRNA isoform usage as an important genetic determinant of response This cross-species strategy will be an powerful tool in the functional analysis of candidate disease variants identified through human genetic studies.\n\nTeaser: Genetically diverse mouse embryonic stem cells provide a rapid approach to precision modeling of human disease.",

    "abstract": "Xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) is a DNA helicase involved in transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair. Missense mutations in XPD are putative drivers in bladder cancer (BLCA) and are associated with a specific single base substitution mutational signature. However, the impact of XPD on the genome-wide distribution of somatic mutations remains unexplored. We analysed somatic mutation distribution in whole-genome sequenced (WGS) BLCA samples with (XPD mutant) and without XPD mutations (WT). XPD genotype had a large impact on the distribution of somatic mutations. XPD mutant samples had increased mutation density at open chromatin, including striking mutation hotspots at CTCF-cohesin binding sites (CBS). We validate these findings in additional WGS cohorts and BLCA exomes. Analysis of XPD occupancy and CBS hotspot mutations in other cancer types suggest that XPD protects CBS from DNA damage. Our study implicates XPD in genomic integrity maintenance at topologically-associating domain boundaries marked by CTCF-cohesin binding.",
