    "abstract": "The spatiotemporal structure of the human microbiome and metabolome reflects and determines regional intestinal physiology and may have implications for disease. Yet, we know little about the distribution of microbes and their products in the gut because of reliance on stool samples and limited access only to some regions of the gut using endoscopy in fasting or sedated individuals. To address these deficiencies, we developed and evaluated a safe, ingestible device that collects samples from multiple regions of the human intestinal tract during normal digestion. The collection of 240 intestinal samples from 15 healthy individuals using the device revealed significant differences between microbes and metabolites present in the intestines versus stool. Certain microbial taxa were differentially enriched, and bile acid profiles varied along the intestines and were highly distinct from those of stool. Correlations between gradients in bile acid concentrations and microbial abundance predicted species that altered the bile acid pool through deconjugation. Overall, we identified heterogeneous intestinal profiles of bacterial taxa and metabolites indicating that non-invasive multi-regional sampling of the intestinal tract under physiological conditions can help elucidate the roles of the gut microbiome and metabolome in human physiology and disease.",

    "abstract": "Viruses evade the innate immune response by suppressing the production or activity of cytokines such as type I interferons (IFNs). Here we report the discovery of a novel mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 virus co-opts an intrinsic cellular machinery to suppress the production of the key immunostimulatory cytokine IFN-{beta}. We reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 encoded Non-Structural Protein 2 (NSP2) directly interacts with the cellular GIGYF2 protein. This interaction enhances the binding of GIGYF2 to the mRNA cap-binding protein 4EHP, thereby repressing the translation of the Ifnb1 mRNA. Depletion of GIGYF2 or 4EHP significantly enhances IFN-{beta} production, leading to reduced viral infection. Our findings reveal a new target for rescuing the antiviral innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses.",

    "abstract": "The oncogenic GPCR Smoothened is a key transducer of the Hedgehog morphogen, which plays essential roles in the patterning of epithelial structures. Here, we examine how Hedgehog controls Smoothened subcellular localization and activity in a polarized epithelium using the Drosophila wing imaginal disc as a model. We provide evidence that Hedgehog promotes the stabilization of Smoothened by switching its fate after endocytosis toward recycling. This effect involves the sequential and additive action of Protein Kinase A, Casein Kinase I and the Fused kinase. Moreover, in the presence of very high levels of Hedgehog, a second effect of Fused leads to the local enrichment of Smoothened in the most basal domain of the cell membrane. Together, these results link the morphogenetic effects of Hedgehog to the apico-basal distribution of Smoothened and provide a novel mechanism for regulation of a GPCR by plasma membrane subcompartimentalisation.",

    "abstract": "How did cells of early metazoan organisms first organize themselves to form a body axis? The canonical Wnt pathway has been shown to be sufficient for induction of axis in Cnidaria, a sister group to Bilateria, and is important in bilaterian axis formation. Here, we provide experimental evidence that in cnidarian Hydra the Hippo pathway regulates the formation of a new axis during budding upstream of the Wnt pathway. The target of Hippo pathway, the transcriptional co-activator YAP, inhibits the initiation of budding in Hydra, and is regulated by Hydra LATS. In addition, we show functions of Hippo pathway in regulation of actin organization and cell proliferation in Hydra. We hypothesize that Hippo pathway served as a link between continuous cell division, cell density and axis formation early in metazoan evolution.",

    "abstract": "Selective interplay between microtubules and their regulatory proteins emerged as major regulator of neuronal circuit development. However, how microtubule posttranslational modifications influence this interplay to govern axon guidance and targeting remains elusive. Using loss-of-function and rescue experiments during zebrafish development, we show that the microtubule-severing enzyme p60-Katanin controls motor axon pathfinding and larval mobility in a dose-dependent manner, and plays non-overlapping roles with the related protein Spastin in these processes. Notably, we uncover the tubulin glutamylase TTLL6 as a selective and key regulator of p60-Katanin activity during axon navigation. In contrast, our study demonstrates that, although critical for motor circuit wiring, the highly similar glutamylase TTLL11 fails to influence p60-Katanin and to rescue the axon targeting errors associated with TTLL6 knockdown, which discloses the functional specificity of these long-chain glutamylases at a physiological level. Altogether, our work provides in vivo proofs of concept that the tubulin code acts in a highly selective manner to tune the activity of key microtubule-severers in neuronal circuit wiring of a vertebrate model.",

    "abstract": "As organs are remodelled by morphogenetic changes and pattern formation during development, their material properties may change. To address whether and how this occurs in the mouse neural tube, we combined highly resolved mosaic analysis, biophysical modelling and perturbation experiments. We found that at early developmental stages the neuroepithelium surprisingly maintains both high junctional tension and high fluidity. This is achieved via a previously unrecognized mechanism in which interkinetic nuclear movements generate cell area dynamics that drive extensive cell rearrangements. Over time, the proliferation rate declines, effectively solidifying the tissue. Thus, unlike well-studied jamming transitions, the solidification we uncovered resembles a glass transition that depends on the dynamics of stresses generated by proliferation and differentiation. This new link between epithelial fluidity, interkinetic movements and cell cycle dynamics has implications for the precision of pattern formation and could be relevant to multiple developing tissues.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are the digestive center of the cell and play important roles in human disease, including cancer. Previous work has suggested that late endosomes, also known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs), and lysosomes are essential for canonical Wnt pathway signaling. Sequestration of Glycogen Synthase 3 (GSK3) and of {beta}{square}catenin destruction complex components in MVBs is required for sustained canonical Wnt signaling. Little is known about the role of lysosomes during early development. In the Xenopus egg, a Wnt-like cytoplasmic determinant signal initiates formation of the body axis following a cortical rotation triggered by sperm entry. Here we report that cathepsin D was activated in lysosomes specifically on the dorsal marginal zone of the embryo at 64-cell stage, long before zygotic transcription starts. Expansion of the multivesicular body (MVB) compartment with low-dose Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) greatly potentiated the dorsalizing effects of the Wnt agonist Lithium chloride (LiCl) in embryos, and this effect required macropinocytosis. Formation of the dorsal axis required lysosomes, as indicated by brief treatments with the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) Bafilomycin A1 inhibitor at the 32-cell stage. Inhibiting the MVB-forming machinery with a dominant-negative point mutation in Vacuolar Protein Sorting 4 (Vps4-EQ) also interfered with the endogenous dorsal axis. The Wnt-like activity of the dorsal cytoplasmic determinant Huluwa (Hwa), and that of microinjected xWnt8 mRNA, also required lysosome acidification and the MVB-forming machinery. We conclude that lysosome function is essential for early dorsal axis development in Xenopus. The results highlight the intertwining between membrane trafficking, lysosomes, and vertebrate axis formation.\n\nSignificanceThe dorsal axis of the vertebrate Xenopus embryo is established by an early Wnt signal generated by a rotation of the cortex of the egg towards the opposite side of the sperm entry point. In this study, we report that lysosomal Cathepsin D becomes activated on the dorsal marginal zone of the embryo already at the 64-cell stage, and that this asymmetry is enhanced by increasing Wnt signaling levels. We present experiments showing that lysosome activity, macropinocytosis, and multivesicular body formation are required for the dorsal signal provided maternally in the egg, and for twinning by microinjected huluwa and Wnt8 mRNA. The results indicate that the cell biology of lysosomes plays a fundamental role in vertebrate development.",
