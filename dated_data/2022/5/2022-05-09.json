    "abstract": "Many deleterious behaviors, such as procrastinating on urgent matters or sustaining a toxic relationship, are irrational. But is irrational behavior the incidental outcome of biological constraints imposed on neural information processing? In particular, can those constraints alter decisions, even when people know the consequences of alternative actions? Recent studies indicate that orbitofrontal neurons encode decision value in relative terms, i.e. value signals in OFC neurons are normalized with respect to the context. Value-based decisions may thus exhibit irrational context-dependence effects. A candidate explanation is \"efficient coding\": OFC neurons may mitigate information loss by adapting their (bounded) output firing properties to the recent value range. This is seducing, because it suggests that relative value coding is the brains best attempt to produce rational behavior, given its own hard-wired biological constraints. However, whether the behavioral implications of this scenario are met, how it generalizes to realistic situations in which OFC neurons construct value from multiple decision-relevant attributes, and what its neurophysiological bases are, is unclear. Here, we address these issues by re-analyzing two open fMRI datasets from the OpenNeuro.org initiative, where people have to integrate prospective gains and losses to decide whether to gamble or not. First, we show that peoples risk attitudes critically depend on the range of gain prospects they are exposed to. Importantly, counter to simple efficient coding scenarios, differences in gain ranges induce progressive changes in peoples sensitivity to both gains and losses. Second, we use artificial neural network models to show that hebbian rewiring processes between attribute-specific and attribute-integration neurons predict (out-of-sample) both context-dependence effects in peoples risk attitude and multivariate patterns of fMRI activity in the OFC. Under mild conditions on distributed population codes for decision attributes, hebbian plasticity eventually translates the distribution of reweighted attribute signals towards the responsive range of integration neurons. In turn, integration units exhibit the known features of range adaptation, including (but not limited to), relative value coding. Our results demonstrate how hebbian plasticity within brain networks may result in range adaptation, eventually yielding complex though predictable irrational behavior.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCluster analysis is an integral part of precision medicine and systems biology, used to define groups of patients or biomolecules. Consensus clustering is an ensemble approach that is widely used in these areas, which combines the output from multiple runs of a non-deterministic clustering algorithm. Here we consider the application of consensus clustering to a broad class of heuristic clustering algorithms that can be derived from Bayesian mixture models (and extensions thereof) by adopting an early stopping criterion when performing sampling-based inference for these models. While the resulting approach is non-Bayesian, it inherits the usual benefits of consensus clustering, particularly in terms of computational scalability and providing assessments of clustering stability/robustness.\n\nIn simulation studies, we show that our approach can successfully uncover the target clustering structure, while also exploring different plausible clusterings of the data. We show that, when a parallel computation environment is available, our approach offers significant reductions in runtime compared to performing sampling-based Bayesian inference for the underlying model, while retaining many of the practical benefits of the Bayesian approach, such as exploring different numbers of clusters. We propose a heuristic to decide upon ensemble size and the early stopping criterion, and then apply consensus clustering to a clustering algorithm derived from a Bayesian integrative clustering method. We use the resulting approach to perform an integrative analysis of three  omics datasets for budding yeast and find clusters of co-expressed genes with shared regulatory proteins. We validate these clusters using data external to the analysis. These clusters can help assign likely function to understudied genes, for example GAS3 clusters with histones active in S-phase, suggesting a role in DNA replication.\n\nOur approach can be used as a wrapper for essentially any existing sampling-based Bayesian clustering implementation, and enables meaningful clustering analyses to be performed using such implementations, even when computational Bayesian inference is not feasible, e.g. due to poor exploration of the target density (often as a result of increasing numbers of features) or a limited computational budget that does not along sufficient samples to drawn from a single chain. This enables researchers to straightforwardly extend the applicability of existing software to much larger datasets, including implementations of sophisticated models such as those that jointly model multiple datasets.",

    "abstract": "Structural biology projects are highly dependent on the large-scale expression of soluble protein and, for this purpose, heterologous expression using bacteria or yeast as host systems is usually employed. In this scenario, some of the parameters to be optimized include (i) those related to the protein construct, such as the use of a fusion protein, the choice of an N-terminus fusion/tag or a C-terminus fusion/tag; (ii) those related to the expression stage, such as the concentration and selection of inducer agent and temperature expression and (iii) the choice of the host system, which includes the selection of a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell and the adoption of a strain. The optimization of some of the parameters related to protein expression, stage (ii), is straightforward. On the other hand, the determination of the most suitable parameters related to protein construction requires a new cycle of gene cloning, while the optimization of the host cell is less straightforward. Here, we evaluated a scalable approach for the screening of host cells for protein expression in a structural biology pipeline. We evaluated four Escherichia coli strains looking for the best yield of soluble heterologous protein expression using the same strategy for protein construction and gene cloning and comparing it to our standard strain, Rosetta 2 (DE3). Using a liquid handling device (robot), E. coli pT-GroE, Lemo21(DE3), Arctic Express (DE3), and Rosetta Gami 2 (DE3) strains were screened for the maximal yield of soluble heterologous protein recovery. For the genes used in this experiment, the Arctic Express (DE3) strain resulted in better yields of soluble heterologous proteins. We propose that screening of host cell/strain is feasible, even for smaller laboratories and the experiment as proposed can easily be scalable to a high-throughput approach.",

    "abstract": "Response inhibition is among the core constructs of cognitive control. It is notoriously difficult to quantify from overt behavior, since the outcome of successful inhibition is the lack of a behavioral response. Currently, the most common measure of action stopping, and by proxy response inhibition, is the model-based stop signal reaction time (SSRT) derived from the stop signal task. Recently, partial response electromyography (prEMG) has been introduced as a complementary physiological measure to capture individual stopping latencies. PrEMG refers to muscle activity initiated by the go signal that plummets after the stop signal before its accumulation to a full response. Whereas neither the SSRT nor the prEMG is an unambiguous marker for neural processes underlying response inhibition, our analysis indicates that the prEMG peak latency is better suited to investigate brain mechanisms of action stopping. This study is a methodological resource with a comprehensive overview of the psychometric properties of the prEMG in a stop signal task, and further provides practical tips for data collection and analysis.",

Expansion microscopy (ExM) is an attractive option for achieving this goal, but the expansion of whole vertebrates has not been demonstrated due to the difficulty of expanding hard body components. Here, we demonstrate whole-body ExM, which enables nanoscale resolution imaging of anatomical structures, proteins, and endogenous fluorescent proteins (FPs) of whole zebrafish larvae and mouse embryos by expanding them fourfold. We first show that post-digestion decalcification and digestion kinetics matching are critical steps in the expansion of whole vertebrates. Then, whole-body ExM is combined with the improved pan-protein labeling approach to demonstrate the three-dimensional super-resolution imaging of antibody- or FP-labeled structures and all major anatomical structures surrounding them. We also show that whole-body ExM enables visualization of the nanoscale details of neuronal structures across the entire body.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, continues to threaten global public health. Developing a vaccine that only requires single immunization but provides long-term protection for the prevention and control of COVID-19 is important. Here, we developed an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vaccine expressing a stable receptor-binding domain (SRBD) protein. The vaccine requires only a single shot but provides effective neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) over 598 days in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Importantly, our results showed that the NAbs were kept in high level and long lasting against authentic wild-type SARS-CoV-2, Beta, Delta and Omicron variants using plaque reduction neutralization test. Of note, although we detected pre-existing AAV2/9 antibodies before immunization, the vaccine still induced high and effective NAbs against COVID-19 in rhesus macaques. AAV-SRBD immune serum also efficiently inhibited the binding of ACE2 with RBD in the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1/P.2 (Gamma), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.617.1/3(Kappa), and C.37 (Lambda) variants. Thus, these data suggest that the vaccine has great potential to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) account for 40% of all hospital-acquired infections. Given that 20-50% of all hospitalized patients receive a catheter, CAUTIs are one of the most common hospital-acquired infections and a significant medical complication as they result in increased morbidity, mortality, and an estimated annual cost of $340-370 million. Candida spp. - specifically Candida albicans - are a major causative agent of CAUTIs (17.8%), making it the second most common CAUTI uropathogen. Despite this frequent occurrence, the cellular and molecular details of C. albicans infection in the CAUTI microenvironment are poorly understood. Here, we characterize fungal virulence mechanisms and fungal biofilm formation during CAUTI for the first time. We found that the catheterized bladder environment triggers Candida virulence programs and robust biofilm formation through Efg1-dependent hyphal morphogenesis and Als1, an Efg1-downstream effector. Additionally, we show that the adhesin Als1 is necessary for in vitro and in vivo C. albicans biofilm formation dependent on the presence of fibrinogen (Fg), a coagulation factor released in the bladder due to the mechanical damage caused by urinary catheterization. Furthermore, in the presence of Fg, overexpression of ALS1 in C. albicans led to enhanced colonization and dissemination, while deletion of ALS1 reduced both outcomes during CAUTIs. Our study ultimately unveils the mechanism that contributes to fungal CAUTI, which may provide more effective targets for future therapies to prevent these infections.",

    "abstract": "The neural basis of reading is highly consistent across many languages and scripts. Are there alternative neural routes to reading? How does the sensory modality of symbols (tactile vs. visual) influence their neural representations? We examined these questions by comparing reading of visual print (sighted group, n=19) and tactile Braille (congenitally blind group, n=19). Blind and sighted readers were presented with written (words, consonant strings, non-letter shapes) and spoken stimuli (words, backward speech) that varied in word-likeness. Consistent with prior work, the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOTC) was active during Braille and visual reading. A posterior/anterior vOTC word-form gradient was observed only in sighted readers with more anterior regions preferring larger orthographic units (words). No such gradient was observed in blind readers. Consistent with connectivity predictions, in blind compared to sighted readers, posterior parietal cortices were recruited to a greater degree and contained word-preferring patches. Lateralization of Braille in blind readers was predicted by laterality of spoken language and reading hand. The effect of spoken language increased along a cortical hierarchy, whereas effect of reading-hand waned. These results suggested that the neural basis of reading is influenced by symbol modality and spoken language and support connectivity-based views of cortical function.",

    "abstract": "Vestibular information modulates muscle activity during gait, presumably to contribute to stability. If this is the case, stronger effects of perturbing vestibular information on local dynamic stability of gait, a measure of the locomotor systems response to small, naturally occurring perturbations, can be expected for narrow-base walking (which needs more control) than for normal walking and smaller effects for wide-base walking (which needs less control). An important mechanism to stabilize gait is to coordinate foot placement to center of mass (CoM) state. Vestibular information most likely contributes to sensing this CoM state. We, therefore, expected that stochastic electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) would decrease the correlation between foot placement and CoM state during the preceding swing phase. In fourteen healthy participants, we measured the kinematics of the trunk (as a proxy of the CoM), and feet, while they walked on a treadmill in six conditions: control (usual step width), narrow-base, and wide-base, each with and without stochastic EVS (peak amplitude of 5 mA; RMS of ~ 1.2 mA; frequency band from 0 to 25 Hz). Stochastic EVS decreased local dynamic stability irrespective of step width. Foot placement correlated stronger with trunk motion during walking with EVS than without in the control condition. However, residual variance in foot placement was increased when walking with EVS, indicating less precise foot placement. Thus, a vestibular error signal leads to a decrease in gait stability and precision of foot placement but these effects are not consistently modulated by step width.",

However, there is a limited understanding of the consequences of releasing self-perpetuating transgenic organisms into the wild populations under complex ecological conditions. In this study, we analyze the impact of three such complexities, mate-choice, mating systems and spatial mating network, on the population dynamics for two distinct classes of modification gene drive systems. All three factors had a high impact on the modelling outcome. First, we demonstrate that distortion based gene drives appear to be more robust against the mate-choice than viability-based gene drives. Second, we find that gene drive spread is much faster for higher degrees of polygamy. Including a fitness cost, the drive is fastest for intermediate levels of polygamy. Finally, the spread of gene drive is faster and more effective when the individuals have fewer connections in a spatial mating network. Our results highlight the need to include mating complexities while modelling the properties of gene drives such as release thresholds, timescales and population-level consequences. This inclusion will enable a more confident prediction of the dynamics of engineered gene drives and possibly even inform on the origin and evolution of natural gene drives.",

    "abstract": "The erosion of functional diversity may foster the collapse of ecological systems. Functional diversity is ultimately determined by the distribution of species traits. As species traits are a legacy of species evolutionary history, one might expect that the mode of trait evolution influences community resistance under the loss of functional diversity. In this paper, we investigate the role of trait evolutionary dynamics on the robustness of mutualistic networks undergoing the following scenarios of species loss: i) random extinctions, ii) loss of functional distinctiveness and iii) extinctions biased towards larger sizes. We simulated networks defined by models of single trait complementary and evolutionary modes where traits can arise in recent diversification events with weak phylogenetic signal, in early diversification events with strong phylogenetic signal, or as a random walk through evolutionary time. Our simulations show that mutualistic networks are especially vulnerable to extinctions based on trait distinctiveness and more robust to random extinction dynamics. The networks show an intermediate level of robustness against size-based extinctions. Despite the small range of variation in network robustness, our results show that the mode of trait evolution matters for network robustness in all three scenarios. Networks with low phylogenetic signal are more robust than networks with high phylogenetic signal across all scenarios. As a consequence, our results predict that mutualistic networks based upon current adaptations are more likely to cope with extinction dynamics than those networks that are based upon conserved traits.",

    "abstract": "Accurate detection and segmentation of single cells in three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence timelapse images is essential for observing individual cell behaviors in large bacterial communities called biofilms. Recent progress in machine-learning-based image analysis is providing this capability with every increasing accuracy. Leveraging the capabilities of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we recently developed bacterial cell morphometry in 3D (BCM3D), an integrated image analysis pipeline that combines deep learning with conventional image analysis to detect and segment single biofilm-dwelling cells in 3D fluorescence images. While the first release of BCM3D (BCM3D 1.0) achieved state-of-the-art 3D bacterial cell segmentation accuracies, low signal-to-background ratios (SBRs) and images of very dense biofilms remained challenging. Here, we present BCM3D 2.0 to address this challenge. BCM3D 2.0 is entirely complementary to the approach utilized in BCM3D 1.0. Instead of training CNNs to perform voxel classification, we trained CNNs to translate 3D fluorescence images into intermediate 3D image representations that are, when combined appropriately, more amenable to conventional mathematical image processing than a single experimental image. Using this approach, improved segmentation results are obtained even for very low SBRs and/or high cell density biofilm images. The improved cell segmentation accuracies in turn enable improved accuracies of tracking individual cells through 3D space and time. This capability opens the door to investigating timedependent phenomena in bacterial biofilms at the cellular level.",

    "abstract": "People are biased towards seeing outcomes that they are motivated to see. For example, sports fans often perceive the same ambiguous foul in favor of the team they support. Here, we test the hypothesis that motivational biases in perceptual decision-making arise from amygdala-dependent biases in sensory processing. Human participants were rewarded for correctly categorizing an ambiguous image into one of two categories while undergoing fMRI. On each trial, we used a financial bonus to motivate participants to see one category over another. The reward maximizing strategy was to perform the categorizations accurately, but participants were biased towards categorizing the images as the category we motivated them to see. Heightened amygdala activity was associated with motivation consistent categorizations, and tracked trial-by-trial enhancement of neural activity in sensory cortices that was specific to the desirable category. Analyses using a drift diffusion model provide converging evidence that trial-by-trial amygdala activity was associated with stronger biases in the accumulation of sensory evidence. Prior work examining biases in perceptual decision-making have focused on the role of frontoparietal regions. Our work highlights an important contribution of the amygdala. When people are motivated to see one outcome over another, the amygdala biases perceptual decisions towards those outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Targeting the colchicine binding site of /{beta} tubulin microtubules can lead to suppression of microtubule dynamics, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, the development of microtubule (MT) inhibitors is considered a promising route to anticancer agents. Our approach to identify novel scaffolds as MT inhibitors depends on a 3D-structure-based pharmacophore approach and docking using three programs MOE, Autodock and BUDE (Bristol University Docking Engine) to screen a library of virtual compounds. From this work we identified the compound 7-(3-Hydroxy-4-methoxy-phenyl)-3-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-6,7-dihydro-3H-imidazo[4,5-b] pyridin-5-ol (6) as a novel inhibitor scaffold. This compound inhibited several types of cancer cell proliferation at low micromolar concentrations with low toxicity. Compound 6 caused cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and blocked tubulin polymerization at low micromolar concentration (IC50 = 6.1 {+/-}0.1 M), inducing apoptosis via activation of caspase 9, increasing the level of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and decreasing the level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. In summary, our approach identified a lead compound with potential antimitotic and antiproliferative activity.",

    "abstract": "In a way analogous to human vision, the fruit fly D. melanogaster and many other flying insects generate smooth and saccadic movements to stabilize and shift their gaze in flight, respectively. It has been hypothesized that this combination of continuous and discrete movements benefits both flight stability and performance, particularly at high frequencies or speeds [1]. Here we develop a hybrid control system model to explore the effects of saccades on the yaw stabilization reflex of D. melanogaster. Inspired from experimental data, the model includes a first order plant, a Proportional-Integral (PI) continuous controller, and a saccadic reset system that fires based on the integrated error of the continuous controller. We explore the gain, delay and switching threshold parameter space to quantify the optimum regions for stability and performance. We show that the addition of saccades to a continuous controller provides benefits to both stability and performance across a range of frequencies. Our model suggests that Drosophila operates near its optimal switching threshold for its experimental gain set. We also show that based on experimental data, D. melanogaster operates in a region that trades off performance and stability. This trade-off increases flight robustness to compensate for environmental uncertainties such as wing damage.",

    "abstract": "Non-covalent interactions in bio-macromolecules are individually weak but collectively important. How they take a concerted action in a complex biochemical reaction network to realize their thermal stability and activity is still challenging to study. Here graph theory was used to investigate how the temperature-dependent non-covalent interactions as identified in the structures of the thermo-gated capsaicin receptor TRPV1 could form a systemic fluidic grid-like mesh network with topological grids to maintain the 3D structure of TRPV1 and to govern heat-sensing. The results showed that the heat-evoked melting of the biggest grid may initiate a specific temperature threshold for both channel activation and inactivation. Meanwhile, a thermostable balance between an open state and a putatively inactivated state from the same pre-open closed state may account for heat efficacy and the use-dependent desensitization, which were further stabilized by smaller grids. Altogether, both the biggest and smaller grids may be necessary for the temperature sensitivity. Therefore, this grid thermodynamic model may be broadly significant for the structural thermostability and the functional thermoactivity of biological macromolecules.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThermo-driven cyclization or decyclization of a DNA hairpin and a network grid in protein was thermodynamically comparable\nC_LIO_LIThe temperature thresholds of TRPV1 for channel activation and inactivation were comparable theoretically and experimentally\nC_LIO_LIThe thermo-sensitivities of TRPV1 for channel activation and inactivation were comparable theoretically and experimentally\nC_LIO_LIThe grid-based systemic thermal instability of TRPV1 was useful to identify different gating states\nC_LIO_LIThe release of the phosphatidylinositol lipid from the vanilloid site was required for the heat-evoked activation of TRPV1\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The functional properties of the outermost retinal circuits involved in color discrimination are not well understood. Recent experimental work on zebrafish has elucidated the in-vivo activity of photoreceptors and horizontal cells as a function of the stimulus spectrum, highlighting the appearance of chromatic-opponent signals at the first synaptic connection between cones and horizontal cells. These findings, together with the observed lack of gap junctions, suggest that the mechanism yielding early color-opponency in zebrafish is dominated by inhibitory feedback. We discuss the observed neuronal activity in the context of efficient codification of chromatic information, hypothesizing that opponent chromatic signals provide optimal codification, minimizing signal redundancy. We examine whether these functional properties are general across species by studying the dynamic properties of dichromatic and trichromatic outer retinal networks. Our findings show that dominant inhibitory feedback mechanisms provide an unambiguous codification of chromatic stimuli, whereas this property is not guaranteed in networks with strong excitatory inter-cone connections, for example via gap junctions. This provides a plausible explanation for the absence of gap junctions observed in the outermost zebrafish retinal layers. In addition, our study suggests that the simplest zebrafish-like network with dominant inhibitory feedback capable of optimally codifying chromatic information requires at least two successive inhibitory feedback layers. Finally, we contrast the chromatic codification performance of zebrafish-inspired retinal networks with networks having different opsin combinations. We find that optimal combinations lead to a chromatic codification improvement of only 13% compared with zebrafish opsins, suggesting that the zebrafish retina performs nearly optimal codification of chromatic information in its habitat.\n\n2 Author summaryRecent experimental work has evidenced that outer neuronal circuits in the zebrafish retina use color-opponent mechanisms to codify and transmit chromatic information at the first synaptic contact between cones and horizontal cells. Inspired by these findings, we propose a data-driven model to study physiological and dynamical properties of outer retinal networks and their implications for color codification across vertebrate retinal circuits. We first study our model in a large parameter space, finding that the primary biological mechanism leading to color-opponent signals is mediated by dominant inhibitory feedback, e.g., via horizontal cell synaptic connections. In contrast, strong coupling among cones leads to ambiguous chromatic codification, undesirable in the outer retina. Then, we parameterize the model using zebrafish experimental data and quantify its chromatic codification performance. Our results suggest that trichromatic retinas with inhibitory feedback are highly efficient and capture most of the chromatic information variance typical from zebrafish environments. More specifically, a comparison among zebrafish-inspired retinal networks suggests that zebrafish retinal circuits are near-optimal chromatic codification of their natural chromatic information.",

This approach relies on only two or three pre-installed photolabile substituents followed by a simple covalent cyclization, which provides a robust synthesize approach in comparison to heavily modified gRNAs. In established cells stably expressing Cas9, the circular gRNA in coordination with light irradiation could direct a precise cleavage of GFP and VEGFA within a pre-defined cutting region. We have also achieved light-mediated MSTN gene editing in embryos, whereas a new bow-knot-type gRNA showed no background editing in the absence of light irradiation.

For understanding how the network is structured, processes information, and changes over time, comprehensive visualization of the architecture of living brain tissue with its cellular and molecular components would open up major opportunities. However, electron microscopy (EM) provides nanometre-scale resolution required for full in-silico reconstruction1-5, yet is limited to fixed specimens and static representations. Light microscopy allows live observation, with super-resolution approaches6-12 facilitating nanoscale visualization, but comprehensive 3D-reconstruction of living brain tissue has been hindered by tissue photo-burden, photobleaching, insufficient 3D-resolution, and inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here we demonstrate saturated reconstruction of living brain tissue. We developed an integrated imaging and analysis technology, adapting stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy6,13 in extracellularly labelled tissue14 for high SNR and near-isotropic resolution. Centrally, a two-stage deep-learning approach leveraged previously obtained information on sample structure to drastically reduce photo-burden and enable automated volumetric reconstruction down to single synapse level. Live reconstruction provides unbiased analysis of tissue architecture across time in relation to functional activity and targeted activation, and contextual understanding of molecular labelling. This adoptable technology will facilitate novel insights into the dynamic functional architecture of living brain tissue.",

By simultaneously deploying specific and nonspecific receptors, cells achieve a more accurate and robust inference. We explore these ideas in the patterning of Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal disc by Wingless morphogen signalling, where multiple endocytic pathways participate in decoding the morphogen gradient.

However, little is known about the strains that are circulating worldwide due to the fastidious nature of the bacteria and its difficulty to be culture isolated. In addition, the paucity of bacteria in blood and other clinical samples has proven to be a considerable challenge for directly genotyping the agent of leptospirosis directly from patient material.\n\nHere, to elucidate the genomic diversity of Leptospira circulating strains, hybridization capture followed by Illumina sequencing of the core genome was performed directly from 20 biological samples that were PCR positive for pathogenic Leptospira. A set of samples subjected to capture with RNA probes covering the L. interrogans core genome resulted in 72 to 13,000-fold increase in pathogen reads when compared to standard sequencing without capture. A SNP analysis of the genomes sequenced from the biological samples using 273 Leptospira reference genome was then performed in order to determine the genotype of the infecting strain. For samples with sufficent coverage (19/20 samples with coverage >8X), we could unambigously identify L. interrogans sv Icterohaemorrhagiae (14 samples), L. kirschneri sv Grippotyphosa (4 samples) and L. interrogans sv Pyrogenes (1 sample) as the infecting strain.\n\nIn conclusion, we obtained for most of our biological samples high quality genomic data at suitable coverage for confident core genome genotyping of the agent of leptospirosis.

Thus, dauer state plays a critical role in its adaptive fitness and survival. ATP-independent endoribonuclease activity of XRN-2 has been implicated in dauer microRNA metabolism, perturbation of which causes their collapse within a very short span of time. Here, we present a detailed comparative analyses of dauer transcriptomes from a conditional mutant strain for the endoribonuclease activity of XRN-2, maintained under control and experimental conditions. We observed that even a limited disruption of microRNA homeostasis in experimental dauers results in deregulation of a large number of mRNA targets. Our bioinformatic analyses, supported by morphological, physiological, and behavioral evidence further demonstrate critical changes in metabolism leading to a state unsupportive of dauer maintenance, alongside potential defects in multiple neuronal activities, which might have caused an overall disruption of dauer plasticity. We explore a possible role of this endoribonuclease activity towards the maintenance of chromatin architecture and transposon expression that in turn might affect the transcriptional program critically required for the maintenance of non-aging, long-lived dauers. Finally, we also demonstrate that perturbation of the endoribonuclease activity during the dauer state exerts drastic adverse effects on the continuity of life cycle after dauer-exit. They not only fail to recapitulate the wild type events of germline development and embryogenesis, but also present traits of very old worms and formation of  tumor-like structures in the proximal gonad.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive acts take place over a large range of temporal scales. Numerous corresponding gradients in neurodynamic timescales and long-range cortical interactions are believed to provide organizational constraints to the brain and influence neural populations roles in cognition. However, it is unclear if gradients in various types of neural timescales and functional connectivity arise from related or distinct neurophysiological processes and if they influence behavior. Here, intracranial recordings from 4,090 electrode contacts in 35 individuals were used to systematically map gradients of multiple aspects of neurodynamics, neural timescales, and functional connectivity, and assess their interactions along category-selective ventral temporal cortex. Opposing functional connectivity gradients, with decreasing connectivity to visually responsive regions and increasing connectivity to regions that were not visually responsive, were observed along the ventral visual hierarchy. Endogenous neural timescales were correlated with functional connectivity to visually responsive regions after removing the effects of shared anatomical gradients, suggesting that these properties influence one another. Different stimulus evoked and endogenous timescales exhibited gradients with longer dynamics along the ventral visual hierarchy, but none of these timescales were significantly correlated with one another. This suggests that local neural timescales depend on neural and cognitive context and different timescales may arise through distinct neurophysiological processes. Furthermore, activity from neural populations with faster endogenous timescales and stronger functional connectivity to visually responsive regions was more predictive of perceptual behavior during a visual repeat detection task. These results reveal interrelationships and key distinctions among neural timescale and functional connectivity gradients that together can influence behavior.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen isotope ({delta}15N) analysis of animal tissue is widely used in archaeology and palaeoecology to investigate diet and ecological niche. Data interpretations require an understanding of nitrogen isotope compositions at the base of the food web (baseline {delta}15N). Significant variation in animal {delta}15N has been recognised at various spatiotemporal scales and linked to changes both in baseline {delta}15N and animal ecology. Isoscapes (models of isotope spatial variation) have proved a useful tool for investigating spatial variability in biogeochemical cycles in present-day marine and terrestrial ecosystems, but so far, their application to palaeo-data has been limited. Here, we present time-sliced nitrogen isoscapes for late Pleistocene and early Holocene Europe (c. 50,000 to 10,000 years BP) using herbivore collagen {delta}15N data. This period covers the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition, during which significant variation in the terrestrial nitrogen cycle occurred. Our results show clear changes in spatial gradients of {delta}15N through time. Prediction of the lowest faunal {delta}15N values in northern latitudes after, rather than during, the Last Glacial Maximum is consistent with the Late Glacial Nitrogen Excursion (LGNE). We consider the potential of incorporating climatic covariate data into isoscape models but find their inclusion does not improve model performance. These findings have implications for investigating the drivers of the LGNE, which has been linked to increased landscape moisture and permafrost thaw, and for understanding changing isotopic baselines, which are fundamental for studies investigating diets, niche partitioning, and migration of higher trophic level animals.",

    "abstract": "Biotic interactions are known to play an important role in shaping species geographic distributions and diversity patterns. However, the role of mutualistic interactions in shaping global diversity patterns remains poorly quantified, particularly with respect to interactions with invertebrates. Moreover, it is unclear how the nature of different mutualisms interacts with abiotic drivers and affects diversity patterns of mutualistic organisms. Here, we present a global-scale biogeographic analysis of three different ant-plant mutualisms, differentiating between plants bearing domatia, extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), and elaiosomes, based on comprehensive geographic distributions of [~]15,000 flowering plants and [~]13,000 ant species. Domatia and extrafloral nectaries involve indirect plant defenses provided by ants, while elaiosomes attract ants to disperse seeds. Our results show distinct biogeographic patterns of different ant-plant mutualisms, with domatium- and EFN-bearing plant richness decreasing sharply from the equator towards the poles, while elaiosome-bearing plants prevail at mid-latitudes. Contemporary climate, especially mean annual temperature and precipitation, emerge as the most important predictor of ant-associated plant diversity. In hot and moist regions, typically the tropics, domatium- and EFN-bearing plant richness increases with related ant guild richness, while in warm regions plants with elaiosomes are strongly linked to interacting ants. Our results suggest that ant richness in combination with climate drives the spatial variation of plants bearing domatia, extrafloral nectaries, and elaiosomes, highlighting the importance of mutualistic interactions for understanding plant biogeography and its response to global change.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of human population history in deep time has been assisted by fitting \"admixture graphs\" to data: models that specify the ordering of population splits and mixtures which is the only information needed to capture the patterns of allele frequency correlation among populations. Not needing to specify population size changes, split times, or whether admixture events were sudden or drawn out simplifies the space of models that need to be searched. However, the space of possible admixture graphs relating populations is vast and cannot be sampled fully, and thus most published studies have identified fitting admixture graphs through a manual process driven by prior hypotheses, leaving the vast majority of alternative models unexplored. Here, we develop a method for systematically searching the space of all admixture graphs that can incorporate non-genetic information in the form of topology constraints. We implement this findGraphs tool within a software package, ADMIXTOOLS 2, which is a reimplementation of the ADMIXTOOLS software with new features and large performance gains. We apply this methodology to identify alternative models to admixture graphs that played key roles in eight published studies and find that graphs modeling more than six populations and two or three admixture events are often not unique, with many alternative models fitting nominally or significantly better than the published one. Our results suggest that strong claims about population history from admixture graphs should only be made when all well-fitting and temporally plausible models share common topological features. Our re-evaluation of published data also provides insight into the population histories of humans, dogs, and horses, identifying features that are stable across the models we explored, as well as scenarios of populations relationships that differ in important ways from models that have been highlighted in the literature, that fit the allele frequency correlation data, and that are not obviously wrong.",

Current theory suggests that the hippocampus is pivotal for reshaping the connectivity. Here we identify that a different set of spontaneous networks and their hubs are instrumental in consolidating memory during post-learning rest. We found that two types of spatial memory training invoke distinct functional connections, but a network of the sensory cortex and subcortical areas is common for both tasks. Furthermore, learning increased brain-wide network integration, with the prefrontal, striatal and thalamic areas being influential for this network-level reconfiguration. Chemogenetic suppression of each hub identified after learning resulted in retrograde amnesia, confirming the behavioral significance. These results demonstrate the causal and functional roles of resting-state network hubs in memory consolidation and suggest a distributed network beyond the hippocampus subserving this process.",

The discovery of these missed sequences is crucial for exploring the genomic diversity of populations and understanding the genetic basis of human diseases. However, various DNA lengths of reads generated from different sequencing technologies can significantly affect the results of novel sequences. In this work, we designed an Assembly-Free Novel Sequence (AF-NS) approach to identify novel sequences from Oxford Nanopore Technology long reads. Among the newly detected sequences using AF-NS, more than 95% were omitted from those using long-read assemblers, and 85% were not present in short reads of Illumina. We identified the common novel sequences among all the samples and revealed their association with the binding motifs of transcription factors. Regarding the placements of the novel sequences, we found about 70% enriched in repeat regions and generated 430 for one specific subpopulation that might be related to their evolution. Our study demonstrates the advance of the Assembly-Free approach to capture more novel sequences over other assembler based methods. Combining the long-read data with powerful analytical methods can be a robust way to improve the completeness of novel sequences.",

    "abstract": "Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) represent individual genomes recovered from metagenomic data. MAGs are extremely useful to analyse uncultured microbial genomic diversity, as well as to characterize associated functional and metabolic potential in natural environments. Recent computational developments have considerably improved MAGs reconstruction but also emphasized several limitations, such as the non-binning of sequence regions with repetitions or distinct nucleotidic composition. Different assembly and binning strategies are often used, however, it still remains unclear which assembly strategy in combination with which binning approach, offers the best performance for MAGs recovery. Several workflows have been proposed in order to reconstruct MAGs, but users are usually limited to single-metagenome assembly or need to manually define sets of metagenomes to co-assemble prior to genome binning. Here, we present MAGNETO, an automated workflow dedicated to MAGs reconstruction, which includes a fully-automated co-assembly step informed by optimal clustering of metagenomic distances, and implements complementary genome binning strategies, for improving MAGs recovery. MAGNETO is implemented as a Snakemake workflow and is available at: https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/bird_pipeline_registry/magneto.\n\nIMPORTANCEGenome-resolved metagenomics has led to the discovery of previously untapped biodiversity within the microbial world. As the development of computational methods for the recovery of genomes from metagenomes continues, existing strategies need to be evaluated and compared to eventually lead to standardized computational workflows. In this study, we compared commonly used assembly and binning strategies and assessed their performance using both simulated and real metagenomic datasets. We propose a novel approach to automate co-assembly, avoiding the requirement for a priori knowledge to combine metagenomic information. The comparison against a previous co-assembly approach demonstrates a strong impact of this step on genome binning results, but also the benefits of informing co-assembly for improving the quality of recovered genomes. MAGNETO integrates complementary assembly-binning strategies to optimize genome reconstruction and provides a complete reads-to-genomes workflow for the growing microbiome research community.",

These gas-filled cellular nanocompartments are formed by up to micrometers long protein shells that are permeable only to gas. The molecular basis of their unique properties and mechanism of assembly remains unknown. Here, we solve the 3.2 [A] cryo-EM structure of the B.megaterium gas vesicle shell made from the structural protein GvpA that self-assembles into hollow helical cylinders closed off by cone-shaped tips. Remarkably, the unique fold adopted by GvpA generates a corrugated cylinder surface typically found in force-bearing thin-walled structures. We identified pores in the vesicle wall that enable gas molecules to freely diffuse in and out of the GV shell, while the exceptionally hydrophobic interior surface effectively repels water. Our results show that gas vesicles consist of two helical half-shells connected through a unique arrangement of GvpA monomers, suggesting a mechanism of gas vesicle biogenesis. Comparative structural analysis confirms the evolutionary conservation of gas vesicle assemblies and reveals molecular details of how the secondary structural protein GvpC reinforces the GvpA shell. Our findings provide a structural framework that will further research into the biology of gas vesicles, and enable rational molecular engineering to harness their unique properties for acoustic imaging (2, 3).",

    "abstract": "Network models of communication, e.g. shortest paths, diffusion, navigation, have become useful tools for studying structure-function relationships in the brain. These models generate estimates of communication efficiency between all pairs of brain regions, which can then be linked to the correlation structure of recorded activity, i.e. functional connectivity (FC). At present, however, communication models have a number of limitations, including difficulty adjudicating between models and the absence of a generic framework for modeling multiple interacting communication policies at the regional level. Here, we present a framework that allows us to incorporate multiple region-specific policies and fit them to empirical estimates of FC. Briefly, we show that many communication policies, including shortest paths and greedy navigation, can be modeled as biased random walks, enabling these policies to be incorporated into the same multi-policy communication model alongside unbiased processes, e.g. diffusion. We show that these multi-policy models outperform existing communication measures while yielding neurobiologically interpretable regional preferences. Further, we show that these models explain the majority of variance in time-varying patterns of FC. Collectively, our framework represents an advance in network-based communication models and establishes a strong link between these patterns and FC. Our findings open up many new avenues for future inquiries and present a flexible framework for modeling anatomically-constrained communication.",

Despite intense interest of cuttlefish, much of our knowledge of its neuroanatomy and links to behaviour and ecology comes from one temperate species, the European common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis. Here we present the first detailed comparison of neuroanatomical features between the tropical cuttlefish and squid and describe differences in basic brain and wiring anatomy using MRI-based techniques and conventional histology. Furthermore, comparisons amongst nocturnal and diurnal cuttlefish species suggest that the characteristic neuroanatomical features infer interspecific variation in visual capabilities, the importance of vision relative to the less utilised chemosensory system and clear links with life modes (e.g. diurnal vs nocturnal), ecological factors (e.g. living depth and ambient light condition) as well as to an extent, phylogeny.

    "abstract": "Wolbachia is an extremely widespread endocellular symbiont which causes reproductive manipulation on various arthropod hosts. Male progenies are killed in Wolbachia-infected lineages of the Japanese Ostrinia moth population. While the mechanism of male killing and the evolutionary interaction between host and symbiont are significant concerns for this system, the absence of Wolbachia genomic information has limited approaches to these issues. We determined the complete genome sequences of wFur and wSca, the male-killing Wolbachia of O. furnacalis and O. scapulalis. The two genomes shared an extremely high degree of homology, with over 95% of the predicted protein sequences being identical. A comparison of these two genomes revealed nearly minimal genome evolution, with a strong emphasis on the frequent genome rearrangements and the rapid evolution of ankyrin repeat-containing proteins. Additionally, we determined the mitochondrial genomes of both species infected lineages and performed phylogenetic analyses to deduce the evolutionary dynamics of Wolbachia infection in the Ostrinia clade. According to the inferred phylogenetic relationship, Wolbachia infection was established in the Ostrinia clade prior to the speciation of related species such as O. furnacalis and O. scapulalis. Simultaneously, the relatively high homology of mitochondrial genomes suggested recent Wolbachia introgression between infected Ostrinia species. The findings of this study collectively shed light on the host-symbiont interaction from an evolutionary standpoint.\n\nSignificanceDespite the growing number of publicly available Wolbachia genome sequences, only a few high-quality male-killer genomes exist, particularly those found in lepidopteran hosts. The complete genomes of two male-killing Wolbachia of Ostrinia moth hosts were determined in this study. The genomic data obtained here will be used to elucidate the mechanism of reproductive manipulation and the origins of this endosymbionts extraordinary diversity. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of mitochondria and Wolbachia revealed the evolutionary history of Ostrinia hosts and Wolbachia. The inferred dynamic pattern of infection adds to our understanding of evolution and ecology of Wolbachia endosymbiont, a promising agent for biological pest control.",

In batch culture four SB strains, S06B (B. japonicum, S06B-Bj), S10J (B. japonicum, S10J-Bj), USDA 122 (B. diazoefficiens, USDA 122-Bd), and USDA 76T (B. elkanii, USDA 76-Be), spontaneously (without apparent exogenous chemical or physical induction) produced phages throughout the growth cycle; for three strains, phage concentrations exceeded cell numbers by ca. 3-fold after 48 h incubation. Observed spontaneously produced phages (SPP) were tailed. Phage terminase large-subunit protein phylogeny revealed possible differences in phage packaging and replication mechanisms. Bioinformatic analyses predicted multiple prophage regions within each SB genome preventing accurate identification of SPP genomes. A DNA sequencing approach was developed that accurately delineated the boundaries of four SPP genomes within three of the SB chromosomes. Read mapping suggested that the SPP are capable of transduction. In addition to the phages, bacterial strains S06B-Bj and USDA 76-Be were rich in mobile elements consisting of insertion sequences (IS) and large, conjugable, broad host range plasmids. The prevalence of SPP along with IS and plasmids indicate that horizontal gene transfer likely plays an outsized role in SB ecology and may subsequently impact soybean productivity.\n\nImportancePrevious studies have shown that IS and plasmids mediate horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of symbiotic nodulation (nod) genes in SB; however, these events require close cell to cell contact which could be limited in soil environments. Bacteriophage assisted gene transduction through spontaneously produced prophages could provide stable means of HGT not limited by the constraints of proximal cell to cell contact. Phage mediated HGT events could be important in SB population ecology with concomitant impacts on soybean agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Limb girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD), caused by mutations in 29 different genes, are the fourth most prevalent group of genetic muscle diseases, leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of the skeletal muscles. Although the link between LGMD and their genetic origins has been determined, LGMD still represent an unmet medical need. In this paper, we describe a platform for modeling LGMD based on the use of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). Thanks to the self-renewing and pluripotency properties of hiPSC, this platform provides an alternative and renewable source of skeletal muscle cells (skMC) to primary, immortalized or overexpressing cells. We report that skMC derived from hiPSC express the majority of the genes and proteins causing LGMD. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the importance of this cellular model for studying LGMDR9 by evaluating disease-specific phenotypes in skMC derived from hiPSC obtained from four patients.",

    "abstract": "Type II DNA topoisomerases regulate topology by double-stranded DNA cleavage and ligation. The TopoVI family of DNA topoisomerase, first identified and biochemically characterized in Archaea, represents, with TopoVIII and mini-A, the type IIB family. TopoVI has several intriguing features in terms of function and evolution. TopoVI has been identified in some eucaryotes, and a global view is lacking to understand its evolutionary pattern. In addition, in eucaryotes, the two TopoVI subunits (TopoVIA and TopoVIB) have duplicated and evolved to give rise to Spo11 and TopoVIBL, forming TopoVI-like (TopoVIL), a complex essential for generating DNA breaks that initiation homologous recombination during meiosis. TopoVIL is essential for sexual reproduction. How the TopoVI subunits have evolved to ensure this meiotic function is unclear. Here, we investigated the phylogenetic conservation of TopoVI and TopoVIL. We demonstrate that BIN4 and RHL1, potentially interacting with TopoVIB, have co-evolved with TopoVI. Based on model structures, this observation supports the hypothesis for a role of TopoVI in decatenation of replicated chromatids and predicts that in eucaryotes the TopoVI catalytic complex includes BIN4 and RHL1. For TopoVIL, the phylogenetic analysis of Spo11, which is highly conserved among Eukarya, highlighted a eukaryal-specific N-terminal domain that may be important for its regulation. Conversely, TopoVIBL was poorly conserved and rapidly evolving, giving rise to ATP hydrolysis-mutated or -truncated protein variants, or was undetected in some species. This remarkable plasticity of TopoVIBL provides important information for the activity and function of TopoVIL during meiosis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundColletotrichum graminicola, the causal agent of maize anthracnose, is an important crop disease worldwide. Understanding the genetic diversity and mechanisms underlying genetic variation in pathogen populations is crucial to the development of effective control strategies. The genus Colletotrichum is largely recognized as asexual, but several species have been reported to have a sexual cycle. Here, we employed a population genomics approach to investigate the genetic diversity and reproductive biology of C. graminicola isolates infecting maize. We sequenced 108 isolates of C. graminicola collected in 14 countries using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS).\n\nResultsClustering analyses based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed populational differentiation at a global scale, with three genetic groups delimited by continental origin, compatible with short-dispersal of the pathogen, and geographic subdivision. Distinct levels of genetic diversity were observed between these clades, suggesting different evolutionary histories. Intra and inter-continental migration was predicted between Europe and South America, likely associated with the movement of contaminated germplasm. Low clonality and evidence of genetic recombination were detected from the analysis of linkage disequilibrium and the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test for clonality. We show evidence that even if rare (possibly due to losses of sex and meiosis-associated genes) C. graminicola can undergo sexual recombination based on lab assays and genomic analyses.\n\nConclusionsOur results support hypotheses of intra and intercontinental pathogen migration and genetic recombination with great impact on C. graminicola population structure.",

To address this challenge, we analyzed metastatic sites from patients enrolled on a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03951831), in which men were treated with standard-of-care chemo-hormonal therapy with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, at the single cell level. Longitudinal protein activity-based analysis of TME subpopulations identified immune subpopulations conserved across multiple metastatic sites, their dynamic, treatment-mediated evolution, and associated clinical response features. Our study revealed a therapy-resistant, transcriptionally distinct tumor subpopulation, which comprises an increasing number of cells in treatment-refractory patients, and identified several druggable targets in both tumor and immune cells as candidates to advance treatment and improve outcomes for patients with mCSPC.",

    "abstract": "During development, the enteric nervous system (ENS) arises from neural crest cells that emerge from the neural tube, migrate to and along the gut, and colonize the entire intestinal tract. While much of the ENS arises from vagal neural crest cells that originate from the caudal hindbrain, there is a second contribution from the sacral neural crest that migrates from the caudal end of the spinal cord to populate the post-umbilical gut. By coupling single cell transcriptomics with axial-level specific lineage tracing in avian embryos, we compared the contributions between embryonic vagal and sacral neural crest cells to the ENS. The results show that the two neural crest populations form partially overlapping but also complementary subsets of neurons and glia in distinct ganglionic units. In particular, the sacral neural crest cells appear to be the major source of adrenergic/dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, melanocytes and Schwann cells in the post-umbilical gut. In addition to neurons and glia, the results also reveal sacral neural crest contributions to connective tissue and mesenchymal cells of the gut. These findings highlight the specific properties of the sacral neural crest population in the hindgut and have potential implications for understanding development of the complex nervous system in the hindgut environment that may influence congenital neuropathies.",

How spectrin is delivered to this structure to scale its size to that of the growing axon is unknown.

Unlike other cytoskeletal proteins, whose apparent slow movement consists of intermittent bouts of fast movements, spectrin moves slowly and processively. We identified a pair of coiled coil proteins that mediate this slow movement and the expansion of the lattice by linking spectrin to kinesin-1.

    "abstract": "All tissue development and replenishment relies upon the breaking of symmetries leading to the morphological and operational differentiation of progenitor cells into more specialized cells. One of the main engines driving this process is the Notch signal transduction pathway, a ubiquitous signalling system found in the vast majority of metazoan cell types characterized to date. Broadly speaking, Notch receptor activity is governed by a balance between two processes: 1) intercellular Notch transactivation triggered via interactions between receptors and ligands expressed in neighbouring cells; 2) intracellular cis inhibition caused by ligands binding to receptors within the same cell. Additionally, recent reports have also unveiled evidence of cis activation. Whilst context-dependent Notch receptor clustering has been hypothesized, to date, Notch signalling has been assumed to involve an interplay between receptor and ligand monomers. In this study, we demonstrate biochemically, through a mutational analysis of DLL4, both in vitro and in tissue culture cells, that Notch ligands can efficiently self-associate. We found that the membrane proximal EGF-like repeat of DLL4 was necessary and sufficient to promote oligomerization/dimerization. Mechanistically, our experimental evidence supports the view that DLL4 ligand dimerization is specifically required for cis-inhibition of Notch receptor activity. To further substantiate these findings, we have adapted and extended existing ordinary differential equation-based models of Notch signalling to take account of the ligand dimerization-dependent cis-inhibition reported here. Our new model faithfully recapitulates our experimental data and improves predictions based upon published data. Collectively, our work favours a model in which net output following Notch receptor/ligand binding results from ligand monomer-driven Notch receptor transactivation (and cis activation) counterposed by ligand dimer-mediated cis-inhibition.\n\nAuthor summaryThe growth and maintenance of tissues is a fundamental characteristic of metazoan life, controlled by a highly conserved core of cell signal transduction networks. One such pathway, the Notch signalling system, plays a unique role in these phenomena by orchestrating the generation of the phenotypic and genetic asymmetries which underlie tissue development and remodeling. At the molecular level, it achieves this via two specific types of receptor/ligand interaction: intercellular binding of receptors and ligands expressed in neighbouring cells, which triggers receptor activation (transactivation); intracellular receptor/ligand binding within the same cell which blocks receptor activation (cis inhibition). Together, these counterposed mechanisms determine the strength, the direction and the specificity of Notch signalling output. Whilst, the basic mechanisms of receptor transactivation have been delineated in some detail, the precise nature of cis inhibition has remained enigmatic. Through a combination of experimental approaches and computational modelling, in this study, we present a new model of Notch signalling in which ligand monomers promote Notch receptor transactivation, whereas cis inhibition is induced optimally via ligand dimers. This is the first model to include a concrete molecular distinction, in terms of ligand configuration, between the main branches of Notch signalling. Our model faithfully recapitulates both our presented experimental results as well as the recently published work of others, and provides a novel perspective for understanding Notch-regulated biological processes such as embryo development and angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Capturing mitochondrias intricate and dynamic structure poses a daunting challenge for optical nanoscopy. Different labeling strategies have been demonstrated for live-cell stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy of mitochondria, but orthogonal strategies are yet to be established, and image acquisition has suffered either from photodamage to the organelles or from rapid photobleaching. Therefore, live-cell nanoscopy of mitochondria has been largely restricted to 2D single-color recordings of cancer cells. Here, by conjugation of cyclooctatetraene to a benzo-fused cyanine dye, we report a mitochondrial inner-membrane (IM) fluorescent marker, PK Mito Orange (PKMO), featuring efficient STED at 775 nm, strong photostability and markedly reduced phototoxicity. PKMO enables super-resolution recordings of inner-membrane dynamics for extended periods in immortalized mammalian cell lines, primary cells, and organoids. Photostability and reduced phototoxicity of PKMO open the door to live-cell 3D STED nanoscopy of mitochondria for three-dimensional analysis of the convoluted IM. PKMO is optically orthogonal with green and far-red markers allowing multiplexed recordings of mitochondria using commercial STED microscopes. Using multi-color STED, we demonstrate that imaging with PKMO can capture the sub-mitochondrial localization of proteins, or interactions of mitochondria with different cellular components, such as the ER or the cytoskeleton at sub-100 nm resolution. Thereby, this work offers a versatile tool for studying mitochondrial inner-membrane architecture and dynamics in a multiplexed manner.",

    "abstract": "New highly-multiplexed imaging technologies have enabled the study of tissues in unprecedented detail. These methods are increasingly being applied to understand how cancer cells and immune response change during tumor development, progression, and metastasis, as well as following treatment. Yet, existing analysis approaches focus on investigating small tissue samples on a per-cell basis, not taking into account the spatial proximity of cells, which indicates cell-cell interaction and specific biological processes in the larger cancer microenvironment. We present Visinity, a scalable visual analytics system to analyze cell interaction patterns across cohorts of whole-slide multiplexed tissue images. Our approach is based on a fast regional neighborhood computation, leveraging unsupervised learning to quantify, compare, and group cells by their surrounding cellular neighborhood. These neighborhoods can be visually analyzed in an exploratory and confirmatory workflow. Users can explore spatial patterns present across tissues through a scalable image viewer and coordinated views highlighting the neighborhood composition and spatial arrangements of cells. To verify or refine existing hypotheses, users can query for specific patterns to determine their presence and statistical significance. Findings can be interactively annotated, ranked, and compared in the form of small multiples. In two case studies with biomedical experts, we demonstrate that Visinity can identify common biological processes within a human tonsil and uncover novel white-blood cell networks and immune-tumor interactions.",

    "abstract": "Adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) respond directly to inflammation and infection, resulting in both acute and persistent changes to quiescence, mobilization, and differentiation. Here we show that fetal HSPCs respond to prenatal inflammation in utero, and that the fetal response shapes postnatal hematopoiesis and immunity. Heterogenous fetal HSPCs showed divergent responses to maternal immune activation (MIA), including changes in quiescence, expansion, and lineage-biased output. Single cell transcriptomic analysis of fetal HSPCs in response to MIA revealed specific upregulation of inflammatory gene profiles in discrete, transient HSC populations, that propagated expansion of lymphoid-biased progenitors. Beyond fetal development, MIA caused the inappropriate expansion and persistence of fetal lymphoid-biased progenitors postnatally, concomitant with increased cellularity and hyperresponsiveness of fetal-derived innate-like lymphocytes. Our investigation demonstrates how inflammation in utero can direct the trajectory of output and function of fetal-derived immune cells by reshaping fetal HSC establishment.",

However, off-target covalent labeling and the lack of molecules with sufficient specificity limit more widespread applications. We describe the first example of a crosslinking platform that uses a synthetic peptide epitope and a single domain antibody (or nanobody) pair to form a covalent linkage rapidly and specifically. The rate of the crosslinking reaction between peptide and nanobody is faster than most other biocompatible crosslinking reactions, and it can be used to label live cells expressing receptor-nanobody fusions. The rapid kinetics of this system allowed us to probe the consequences on signaling for ligand crosslinking to the A2A-adenosine receptor. Our method may be generally useful to site-specifically link synthetic molecules to receptors on mammalian cell surfaces.",

Previous studies investigate face-value patterns of richness, with only qualitative assessment of potential biases acting on the Palaeozoic actinopterygian fossil record. Here, we investigate palaeogeographic trends and apply richness estimation techniques to a recently-assembled occurrence database for Palaeozoic ray-finned fishes. We reconstruct patterns of local richness of Palaeozoic actinopterygians, alongside sampling standardised estimates of  global diversity. We identify substantial fossil record biases, such as geographic bias in the sampling of actinopterygian occurrences centred around Europe and North America. Similarly, estimates of diversity are skewed by extreme unevenness in the abundance distributions of occurrences, reflecting past taxonomic practices and historical biases in sampling. Increasing sampling of poorly represented regions and expanding sampling beyond the literature to include museum collection data will be critical in obtaining accurate estimates of Palaeozoic actinopterygian diversity. In conjunction, applying diversity estimation techniques to well-sampled regional subsets of the  global dataset may identify accurate local diversity trends.",

    "abstract": "Centrosome amplification (CA) is a prominent feature of human cancers linked to genomic instability and tumourigenesis in vivo. CA is observed as early as pre-malignant metaplasia, with CA incidence increasing as the disease progresses from dysplasia to neoplasia. However, the mechanistic contributions of CA to tumourigenesis (tumour architecture and remodelling) are poorly understood.\n\nUsing non-tumourigenic breast cells (MCF10A), we demonstrate that CA induction (by CDK1 inhibition or PLK4 overexpression) alone increased both cell migration, invasion and Extracellular Matrix (ECM) remodeling. Mechanistically, CA induction activated small GTPase Rap-1. We demonstrated the key role of Rap-1 mediated signalling in CA induced tumourigenesis through Rap-1 inhibition (using GGTI-298) which blocked CA-induced migration, invasion and ECM attachment.\n\nCA induction in a long-term MCF10A cell culture system disrupted epithelial cell-cell junction integrity, via dysregulation of expression and subcellular localisation of cell junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, JAM-A & {beta}-catenin). At the ultrastructural level, CA significantly inhibited apical junctional complex formation, as visualized by transmission electron microscopy. CA induction in the luminal A breast cancer cell line MCF7 revealed similar trends in cell junction disruption. Furthermore, CA induction in MCF10A elevated expression of integrin {beta}-3, matrix metalloprotease MMP1 and MMP13 facilitating the observed ECM attachment, degradation and cell invasion phenotype.\n\nIn vivo validation using a Chicken Embryo xenograft model, showed CA positive (CA+) MCF10A cells invaded into the chicken mesodermal layer, characterised by inflammatory cell infiltration and a marked focal reaction between chorioallantoic membrane and cell graft. This reaction was inhibited by pre-treatment of CA+ MCF10A cells with GGTI-298. Interestingly, in metastatic breast cancer cells with high levels of endogenous CA (triple negative cell line MDA-MB-231) inhibition of this CA-signalling pathway (using PLK4 inhibitor Centrinone B) abrogated their metastatic capacity in vitro. This demonstrates dual roles for CA signalling, for initiating and maintaining the CA-induced metastatic phenotype.\n\nHere, we demonstrated that CA induction in normal non-tumourigenic cells acts through Rap-1-dependent signaling to confer early pro-tumourigenic changes promoting tumour progression, mediated by ECM disruption, and altered cell-cell contacts. These insights reveal that in normal cells, CA induction alone (without additional pro-tumorigenic alterations) is sufficient to induce tumourigenesis and CA-mediated signaling supports a metastatic phenotype.\n\nStatementCentrosome amplification alone drives early tumourigenic change in normal breast epithelial cells",

However, the persistence of non-sporulated bacteria (Spo-) was reported during infection in Bacillus thuringiensis, an entomopathogenic sporulating Gram-positive bacterium. In this study, we investigated the behavior of a bacterial population in the late stages of an infection as well as the characteristics of the Spo- bacteria in the B. thuringiensis/Galleria mellonella infection model. Using fluorescent reporters coupled to flow cytometry as well as molecular markers, we demonstrated that the Spo- cells constitute about half of the population two weeks post-infection (pi) and that these bacteria present vitality signs. However, a protein synthesis and a growth recovery assay indicated that they are in a metabolically slowed-down state. Interestingly, they were extremely resistant to the cadaver environment which proved deadly for in vitro-grown vegetative cells and, strikingly, did not support spore germination. A transcriptomic analysis of this subpopulation at 7 days pi revealed a signature profile of this state. The expression analysis of individual genes at the cell level suggests that iron homeostasis is important at all stages of the infection, whereas the oxidative stress response seems of particular importance as the survival time increases. Altogether, these data show that non-sporulated bacteria are able to survive for a prolonged period of time and indicate that they engage in a profound adaptation process that leads to their persistence in the host cadaver.",

    "abstract": "High temperature growth/survival was revealed in a phylogenetic relative (strain SMMA_5) of the mesophilic Paracoccus isolated from the 78-85{degrees}C water of a Trans- Himalayan sulfur-borax spring. After 12 h at 50{degrees}C, or 45 minutes at 70{degrees}C, in mineral salts thiosulfate (MST) medium, SMMA_5 retained [~]2% colony-forming units (CFUs), whereas comparator Paracoccus had 1.5% and 0% CFU left at 50{degrees}C and 70{degrees}C respectively. After 12 h at 50{degrees}C, the thermally-conditioned sibling SMMA_5_TC exhibited [~]1.5 time increase in CFU-count; after 45 minutes at 70{degrees}C, SMMA_5_TC had 7% of the initial CFU-count intact. 1000-times diluted Reasoners 2A medium, and MST supplemented with lithium, boron or glycine-betaine (solutes typical of the SMMA_5 habitat), supported higher CFU-retention/CFU-growth than MST. With or without lithium/boron/glycine-betaine in MST, a higher percentage of cells always remained viable (cytometry data), compared with what percentage remained capable of forming single colonies (CFU data). SMMA_5, compared with other Paracoccus, contained 335 unique genes, mostly for DNA replication/recombination/repair, transcription, secondary metabolites biosynthesis/transport/catabolism, and inorganic ion transport/metabolism. Its also exclusively enriched in cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, and amino acid metabolism, genes. SMMA_5 and SMMA_5_TC mutually possessed 43 nucleotide polymorphisms, of which 18 were in protein-coding genes with 13 nonsynonymous and seven radical amino acid replacements. Such biochemical and biophysical mechanisms could be involved in thermal stress mitigation which streamline the cells energy and resources towards system-maintenance and macromolecule-stabilization, thereby relinquishing cell-division for cell-viability. Thermal conditioning apparently helped memorize those potential metabolic states which are crucial for cell-system maintenance, while environmental solutes augmented the indigenous stability-conferring mechanisms.\n\nIMPORTANCEFor a holistic understanding of microbial lifes high-temperature adaptation it is imperative to explore the biology of the phylogenetic relatives of mesophilic bacteria which get stochastically introduced to geographically and geologically diverse hot spring systems by local geodynamic forces. Here, in vitro endurance of high heat up to the extent of growth under special (habitat-inspired) conditions was discovered in a hot- spring-dwelling phylogenetic relative of the mesophilic Paracoccus species. Thermal conditioning, extreme oligotrophy, metabolic deceleration, presence of certain habitat- specific inorganic/organic solutes, and typical genomic specializations were found to be the major enablers of this conditional (acquired) thermophilicity. Feasibility of such phenomena across the taxonomic spectrum can well be paradigm-changing for the established scopes of microbial adaptation to the physicochemical extremes. Applications of conditional thermophilicity in microbial process biotechnology may be far reaching and multi-faceted.",

The surfaces of each cell in cell pairs of interest were efficiently decorated with sortase A (SrtA) and triglycine peptide that were lipidated with PEG-lipid, respectively. In the mixture of the two cell populations, the triglycine-modified cells were enzymatically labeled with a fluorescent labeling reagent by contacting with the SrtA-modified cells both on the substrate and in cell suspensions. Such selective labeling of the contacting cells was confirmed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry.

    "abstract": "How do growing bacterial colonies get their shapes? While colony morphogenesis is well-studied in 2D, many bacteria grow as large colonies in 3D environments, such as gels and tissues in the body, or soils, sediments, and subsurface porous media. Here, we describe a morphological instability exhibited by large colonies of bacteria growing in 3D. Using experiments in transparent 3D granular hydrogel matrices, we show that dense colonies of four different species of bacteria--Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans--generically roughen as they consume nutrients and grow beyond a critical size, eventually adopting a characteristic branched, broccoli-like, self-affine morphology independent of variations in the cell type and environmental conditions. This behavior reflects a key difference between 2D and 3D colonies: while a 2D colony may access the nutrients needed for growth from the third dimension, a 3D colony inevitably becomes nutrient-limited in its interior, driving a transition to rough growth at its surface. We elucidate the onset of roughening using linear stability analysis and numerical simulations of a continuum model that treats the colony as an  active fluid whose dynamics are driven by nutrient-dependent cellular growth. We find that when all dimensions of the growing colony substantially exceed the nutrient penetration length, nutrient-limited growth drives a 3D morphological instability that recapitulates essential features of the experimental observations. Our work thus provides a framework to predict and control the organization of growing colonies--as well as other forms of growing active matter, such as tumors and engineered living materials--in 3D environments.",

    "abstract": "Point spread function (PSF) engineering is an important technique to encode the properties (e.g., 3D positions, color, and orientation) of single molecule in the shape of the PSF, often with the help of a programmable phase modulator. Deformable mirror (DM) is currently the most widely used phase modulator for fluorescence detection as it shows negligible photon loss. However, it relies on careful calibration for precise wavefront control. Therefore, design of an optimal PSF not only relies on the theoretical calculation of maximum information content, but also the physical behavior of the phase modulator, which is often ignored during the optimization process. Here, we developed a framework of PSF engineering which could generate a device specific optimal PSF for 3D super-resolution imaging using DM. We used our method to generate two types of PSFs with depths of field comparable to the widely used astigmatism and Tetrapod PSFs, respectively. We demonstrated the superior performance of the DM specific optimal PSF over the conventional astigmatism and Tetrapod PSF both theoretically and experimentally.",

TGF-{beta} homodimers signal by assembling a heterotetrameric complex comprised of two type I receptor (T{beta}RI):type II receptor (T{beta}RII) pairs. TGF-{beta}1 and TGF-{beta}3 signal with high potency due to their high affinity for T{beta}RII, which engenders high affinity binding of T{beta}RI through a composite TGF-{beta}:T{beta}RII binding interface. However, TGF-{beta}2 binds T{beta}RII 200-500 more weakly than T{beta}RII and signals with lower potency compared to TGF-{beta}1 and -{beta}3. Remarkably, potency of TGF-{beta}2 is increased to that of TGF-{beta}1 and -{beta}3 in the presence of an additional membrane-bound co-receptor, known as betaglycan (BG), even though betaglycan does not directly participate in the signaling mechanism and is displaced as the signaling receptors, T{beta}RI and T{beta}RII, bind. To determine the role of betaglycan in the potentiation of TGF-{beta}2 signaling, we developed deterministic computational models with different modes of betaglycan binding and varying cooperativity between receptor subtypes. The models, which were developed using published kinetic rate constants for known quantities and optimization to determine unknown quantities, identified conditions for selective enhancement of TGF-{beta}2 signaling. The models provide support for additional receptor binding cooperativity that has been hypothesized, but not evaluated in the literature. The models further showed that betaglycan binding to TGF-{beta}2 ligand through two domains provides an effective mechanism for transfer to the signaling receptors that has been tuned to efficiently promote assembly of the TGF-{beta}2(T{beta}RII)2(T{beta}RI)2 signaling complex.",

    "abstract": "Stability constrains evolution. While much is known about constraints on destabilizing mutations, less is known about the constraints on stabilizing mutations. We recently identified a mutation in the innate immune protein S100A9 that provides insight into such constraints. When introduced into human S100A9, M63F simultaneously increases the stability of the protein and disrupts its natural ability to activate Toll-like receptor 4. Using chemical denaturation, we found that M63F stabilizes a calcium-bound conformation of hS100A9. We then used NMR to solve the structure of the mutant protein, revealing that the mutation distorts the hydrophobic binding surface of hS100A9, explaining its deleterious effect on function. Hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) experiments revealed stabilization of the region around M63F in the structure, notably Phe37. In the structure of the M63F mutant, the Phe37 and Phe63 sidechains are in contact, plausibly forming an edge-face {nu}-stack. Mutating Phe37 to Leu abolished the stabilizing effect of M63F as probed by both chemical denaturation and HDX. It also restored the biological activity of S100A9 disrupted by M63F. These findings reveal that Phe63 creates a \"molecular staple\" with Phe37 that stabilizes a non-functional conformation of the protein, thus disrupting function. Using a bioinformatic analysis, we found that S100A9 proteins from different organisms rarely have Phe at both positions 37 and 63, suggesting that avoiding a pathological stabilizing interaction indeed constrains S100A9 evolution. This work highlights an important evolutionary constraint on stabilizing mutations: they must avoid inappropriately stabilizing non-functional protein conformations.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTProtein stability constrains protein evolution. While much is known about evolutionary constraints on destabilizing mutations, less is known about the constraints on stabilizing mutations. We recently found a mutation to an innate immune protein that increases its stability but disrupts its function. Here we show, through careful biophysical and functional studies, that this mutation stabilizes a nonfunctional form of the protein through a direct interaction with another amino acid. We find that specific amino acids can be tolerated at each of the interacting positions individually, but not at both simultaneously. This pattern has been conserved over millions of years of evolution. Our work highlights an underappreciated evolutionary constraint on stabilizing mutations: they must avoid inappropriately stabilizing non-functional protein conformations.",

    "abstract": "Although the interaction of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms is critical for the functioning of ecosystems, knowledge of the processes driving microbial interactions within communities is in its infancy. We previously reported that the soil bacterium Streptomyces iranensis specifically triggers the production of natural products in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Here, we discovered that arginine-derived polyketides serve as the bacterial signals for this induction. Arginine-derived polyketide-producing bacteria occur world wide. These producer bacteria and the fungi that decode and respond to this signal can be co-isolated from the same soil sample. Arginine-derived polyketides impact surrounding microorganisms both directly as well as indirectly, by inducing the production of natural products in fungi that further influence the composition of microbial consortia.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryUbiquitous bacterial polyketides are universal components of the chemical network for microbial communication",

    "abstract": "Polymicrobial biofilms are present in many environments particularly in the human oral cavity where they can prevent or facilitate the onset of disease. While recent advances have provided a clear picture of both the constituents and their biogeographical arrangement, it is still unclear what mechanisms of interaction occur between individual species in close proximity within these communities. In this study we investigated two mechanisms of interaction between the highly abundant supragingival plaque (SUPP) commensal Corynebacterium matruchotii and Streptococcus mitis which are directly adjacent in vivo. We discovered that C. matruchotii enhanced the fitness of streptococci dependent on its ability to detoxify streptococcal-produced hydrogen peroxide and its ability to oxidize lactate also produced by streptococci. We demonstrate that the fitness of adjacent streptococci was linked to that of C. matruchotii and that these mechanisms support the previously described \"corncob\" arrangement between these species but that this is favorable only in aerobic conditions. Further we utilized scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to quantify lactate production and consumption between individual bacterial cells for the 1st time, revealing that lactate oxidation provides a fitness benefit to S. mitis and not pH mitigation. This study describes mechanistic interactions between two highly abundant human commensals that can explain their observed in vivo spatial arrangements and suggest a way by which they may help preserve a healthy oral bacterial community.",

    "abstract": "The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is known to be activated by the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 12 (PTP-PEST) under hypoxic conditions. This activation is mediated by tyrosine dephosphorylation of the AMPK subunit. However, the identity of the phosphotyrosine residues remains unknown. In this study we first predicted the structure of the complex of the AMPK2 subunit and PTP-PEST catalytic domain using bioinformatics tools and further confirm the stability of the complex using molecular dynamics simulations. Evaluation of the protein-protein interfaces indicates that residue Tyr232 is the most likely site of dephosphorylation on AMPK2. In addition, we explored the effect of phosphorylation of PTP-PEST residue Tyr64 on the stability of the complex. The phosphorylation of Tyr64, an interface residue, enhances the stability of the complex via the rearrangement of a network of electrostatic interactions in conjunction with conformational changes in the catalytic WPD loop. Our findings present a plausible structural basis of AMPK regulation mediated by PTP-PEST and shows how phosphorylation of PTP-PEST could be involved in its activation.",

Here, nanodisc-embedded spike protein was investigated by cryo-electron microscopy and molecular-dynamics simulations, revealing spontaneous ectodomain tilting that creates vulnerability for HIV-1. While each MPER protomer radiates centrally towards the three-fold axis contributing to a membrane-associated tripod structure that is occluded in the upright spike, tilting provides access to the opposing MPER. Structures of spike proteins with bound 4E10 bnAb Fabs reveal that the antibody binds exposed MPER, thereby altering MPER dynamics, modifying average ectodomain tilt, and imposing strain on the viral membrane and the spikes transmembrane segments, resulting in the abrogation of membrane fusion and informing future vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "Babesia species are tick-transmitted apicomplexan pathogens and the causative agents of babesiosis, a malaria-like disease of major medical and veterinary importance. Of the different species of Babesia reported so far, Babesia duncani causes severe to lethal infection in patients. Despite the highly virulent nature of this parasite and the risk it may pose as an emerging pathogen, little is known about its biology, metabolic requirements, and pathogenesis. B. duncani is unique among apicomplexan parasites that infect red blood cells in that it can be continuously cultured in vitro in human erythrocytes but can also infect mice leading to fulminant babesiosis infection and death. Here we have taken advantage of the recent advances in the propagation of this parasite in vitro and in vivo to conduct detailed molecular, genomic and transcriptomic analyses and to gain insights into its biology. We report the assembly, 3D structure, and annotation of the nuclear genome of this parasite as well as its transcriptomic profile and an atlas of its metabolism during its intraerythrocytic life cycle. Detailed examination of the B. duncani genome and comparative genomic analyses identified new classes of candidate virulence factors, suitable antigens for diagnosis of active infection, and several attractive drug targets. Translational analyses and efficacy studies identified highly potent inhibitors of B. duncani thus enriching the pipeline of small molecules that could be developed as effective therapies for the treatment of human babesiosis.",

    "abstract": "Identification and characterization of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the last decade has attained great attention because of their importance in gene regulatory functions in response to various plant stresses. Rising temperature is a potential threat to the agriculture world. Banana being an important economic crop, identification and characterization of genes and RNAs that regulate high temperature stress is imperative. As the prediction of lncRNAs in response to heat stress in banana is largely unknown, the present study was focused to identify the heat stress responsive lncRNA in banana (DH Pahang). Perl script was written to identify the novel transcripts, using the work flow. StringTie and CPC softwares were used and a total of 363 novel HS-lncRNA were identified in banana. Further, lncRNA were classified as 288 lincRNAs, 71 antisense LncRNA, 5 sense lncRNAs. The functional classification was done and transcripts were broadly classified into molecular function, cellular components and biological processes. Differential expression of lncRNA showed the varied patterns at different stages of heat stress. Finally, qPCR results confirmed DGE expression pattern of lncRNAs. Further, the Cytoscape analysis was performed which showed protein coding genes involved in membrane integrity and other signal transduction pathways. Taken together, these findings expand our understanding of lncRNAs as ubiquitous regulators under heat stress conditions in banana.",

    "abstract": "Feline upper respiratory tract disease (FURTD), often caused by infections etiologies, is a multifactorial syndrome affecting feline populations worldwide. Because of its highly transmissible nature, infectious FURTD is most prevalent anywhere cats are housed in groups such as animal shelters, and is associated with negative consequences such as decreasing adoption rates, intensifying care costs, and increasing euthanasia rates. Understanding the etiology and pathophysiology of FURTD is thus essential to best mitigate the negative consequences of this disease. Clinical signs of FURTD include acute respiratory disease, with a small fraction of cats developing chronic sequelae. It is thought that nasal mucosal microbiome changes play an active role in the development of acute clinical signs, but it remains unknown if the microbiome may play a role in the development and progression of chronic clinical disease. To address the knowledge gap surrounding how microbiomes link to chronic FURTD, we asked if microbial community structure of upper respiratory and gut microbiomes differed between cats with chronic FURTD signs and clinically normal cats. We selected 8 households with at least one cat exhibiting chronic clinical FURTD, and simultaneously collected samples from cohabitating clinically normal cats. Microbial community structure was assessed via 16S rDNA sequencing of both gut and nasal microbiome communities. Using a previously described ecophylogenetic method, we identified 37 and 27 microbial lineages within gut and nasal microbiomes respectively that significantly associated with presence of active FURTD clinical signs in cats with a history of chronic signs. Overall, we find that nasal and gut microbial communities may contribute to the development of chronic clinical course, but more research is needed to confirm our observations.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference systems depend on the synthesis of small RNA precursors whose sequences define the target spectrum of these silencing pathways. The Drosophila Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) variant Rhino permits transcription of PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) precursors within transposon-rich heterochromatic loci in germline cells. Current models propose that Rhinos specific chromatin occupancy at piRNA source loci is determined by histone marks and maternally inherited piRNAs, but also imply the existence of other, undiscovered specificity cues. Here, we identify a member of the diverse family of zinc finger associated domain (ZAD)-C2H2 proteins, Kipferl, as critical Rhino cofactor in ovaries. By binding to guanosine-rich DNA motifs and interacting with the Rhino chromodomain, Kipferl recruits Rhino to specific loci and stabilizes it on chromatin. In kipferl mutant flies, Rhino is lost from most of its target chromatin loci and instead accumulates on pericentromeric satellite arrays, resulting in decreased levels of transposon targeting piRNAs and impaired fertility. Our findings reveal that DNA sequence, in addition to the H3K9me3 mark, determines the identity of piRNA source loci and provide insight into how Rhino might be caught in the crossfire of genetic conflicts.",
