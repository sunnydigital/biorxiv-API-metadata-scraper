    "abstract": "Neurons in the brain have rich and adaptive input-output properties. Features such as heterogeneous f-I curves and spike frequency adaptation are known to place single neurons in optimal coding regimes when facing changing stimuli. Yet, it is still unclear how brain circuits exploit single-neuron flexibility, and how network-level requirements may have shaped such cellular function. To answer this question, a multi-scaled approach is needed where the computations of single neurons and neural circuits must be considered as a complete system. In this work, we use artificial neural networks to systematically investigate single-neuron input-output adaptive mechanisms, optimized in an end-to-end fashion. Throughout the optimization process, each neuron has the liberty to modify its nonlinear activation function, parametrized to mimic f-I curves of biological neurons, and to learn adaptation strategies to modify activation functions in real-time during a task. We find that such networks show much-improved robustness to noise and changes in input statistics. Importantly, we find that this procedure recovers precise coding strategies found in biological neurons, such as gain scaling and fractional order differentiation/integration. Using tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyze the role of these emergent single-neuron properties and argue that neural diversity and adaptation play an active regularization role, enabling neural circuits to optimally propagate information across time.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging nosocomial, opportunistic pathogen with growing clinical significance globally. A. baumannii has an exceptional ability to rapidly develop drug resistance. It is frequently responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia in clinical settings and inflammation resulting in severe sepsis. The inflammatory response is mediated by host pattern-recognition receptors and the inflammasomes. Inflammasome activation triggers inflammatory responses, including the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta} and IL-18, the recruitment of innate immune effectors against A. baumannii infection, and the induction programmed cell death by pyroptosis. An important knowledge gap is how variation among clinical isolates affects the hosts innate response and activation of the inflammasome during A. baumannii infection. In this study, we compared nine A. baumannii strains, including clinical locally-acquired isolates, in their ability to induce activation of the inflammasome and programmed cell death pathway in primary macrophages and mice. We found a striking variability in survival outcomes of mice and bacterial dissemination in organs among three ATCC A. baumannii strains, likely due to the differences in virulence between strains. Interestingly, we found a stark contrast in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, the non-canonical caspase-11 pathway, plasmatic secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta} and IL-18 between A. baumannii strains. Our study highlights the importance of utilising multiple bacterial strains and clinical isolates with differential virulence to investigate the innate immune response to A. baumannii infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plasticity is a central mechanism in cardiovascular health and disease. We aimed at providing deep cellular phenotyping, epigenomic and proteomic depiction of SMCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and evaluating their potential as cellular models in the context of complex genetic arterial diseases.\n\nMethodsWe differentiated 3 human iPSC lines using either RepSox (R-SMCs) or PDGF-BB and TGF-{beta} (TP-SMCs), during the second half of a 24-days-long protocol. In addition to cellular assays, we performed RNA-Seq and assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC)-Seq at 6 time-points of differentiation. The extracellular matrix content (matrisome) generated by iPSCs derived SMCs was analyzed using mass spectrometry.\n\nResultsBoth iPSCs differentiation protocols generated SMCs with positive expression of SMC markers. TP-SMCs exhibited greater capacity of proliferation, migration and lower calcium release in response to contractile stimuli compared to R-SMCs. RNA-Seq data showed that genes involved in the contractile function of arteries were highly expressed in R-SMCs compared to TP-SMCs or primary SMCs. Matrisome analyses supported an overexpression of proteins involved in wound repair in TP-SMCs and a higher secretion of basal membrane constituents by R-SMCs. Open chromatin regions of R-SMCs and TP-SMCs were significantly enriched for variants associated with coronary artery disease and blood pressure, while only TP-SMCs were enriched for variants associated with peripheral artery disease.\n\nConclusionsOur study portrayed two iPSCs derived SMCs models presenting complementary cellular phenotypes of high relevance to SMC plasticity. In combination with genome-editing tools, our data supports high relevance of the use of these cellular models to the study of complex regulatory mechanisms at genetic risk loci involved in several arterial diseases.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=179 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/490058v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f1002corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1426fa7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b05b56org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3c6e88_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Hybridization generates inter-genomic interactions, which may result in unique traits not seen in either parent species. Here we explore the genetic basis of both carotenoid and anthocyanin floral pigmentation in hybrids between monkeyflower species Mimulus cupreus and M. luteus var. variegatus. Mimulus cupreus has abundant yellow carotenoid pigmentation in its petal lobes, while M. l. variegatus has a derived reduction in carotenoid intensity. Thus, as expected, carotenoid intensity segregates in an F2 hybrid population. More surprisingly, both species appear to have petal lobes solidly and identically covered in magenta anthocyanin pigment (which, when overlaid on the bright yellow carotenoid background, leads to an orange color in M. cupreus), yet F1 and F2 hybrids exhibit novel and complex spatial patterns of anthocyanin spotting. A rare yellow morph of M. cupreus, which lacks petal anthocyanins, also generates spatially patterned offspring when hybridized with M. l. variegatus. We use this cross, together with newly developed high-quality genome assembly of M. l. luteus and image analysis tools, to investigate the genetic architecture of color and pattern variation in an F2 hybrid population. We report a single QTL, containing the Beta-carotene hydroxylase (BCH) gene, associated with the non-patterned carotenoid reduction in M. l. variegatus. HPLC shows that relative beta-carotene abundance differs between dark yellow and light yellow petals, supporting a causal role for BCH. The presence versus absence of petal lobe anthocyanin segregates in a 3:1 ratio, and we report (as expected) an associated QTL encompassing the anthocyanin activator MYB5a/NEGAN which has previously been shown to be both necessary and sufficient to activate petal lobe anthocyanins in M. l. variegatus. Anthocyanin patterning was more complex, with seven QTLs associated with five quantitative patterning traits on the upper petals; 11 on the lower petals; and three qualitative whole-flower patterning traits. Although power was too limited to effectively test for epistatic interactions in this cross, the QTLs provide candidate genomic regions for further investigating the molecular mechanisms of spatially complex floral color patterning, and multiple candidate genes are identified including anthocyanin activators and an anthocyanin repressor.",

    "abstract": "High cholesterol levels have been associated with cardiovascular diseases, and lowering them has been a key focus in the treatment of such diseases. Statins are drugs used with that aim, and can be divided in the lipophilic Simvastatin and the hydrophilic Rosuvastatin. Regardless of the statin type, a high proportion ([~]70%) of patients stop using statins due to suffering from side effects on skeletal muscle, such as myalgia, and muscle cramps. Thus, there has been a considerable effort in understanding how statins contribute to these side effects. A catalogue of genes and molecular pathways that change upon statin treatment has been recently published, allowing further understanding how the side effects occur. However, Transposable Elements (TEs) were not studied. TEs can move within a genome, and they are highly repetitive, representing about half of the human genome. Currently, most TEs in the human genome are inactive, but it has been shown that TEs can still transcribe, and that either via their transposition or their transcriptional activity, can influence gene expression. Here, using novel computational tools to accurately estimate TE expression, we studied their activity and predicted their potential impact on gene expression. We developed a catalogue of TEs expressed upon statin treatment, and the putative genes whose expression might be influenced by TEs. Overall, we speculate that based on our findings, TEs might be a key target in order to understand statin-mediated side effects.",

    "abstract": "VcINDY, the sodium-dependent dicarboxylate transporter from Vibrio cholerae, is responsible for C4- and C5-carboxylate uptake into cells. The molecular mechanism of how VcINDY physically moves substrates across the membrane, and does so in an energetically efficient manner, is unclear. Here, we use single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments to directly observe the individual mechanistic steps that VcINDY takes to translocate substrates across a lipid bilayer, and then test key predictions of transport cycle mechanistic models. Our data provide the first direct evidence that VcINDY undergoes stochastic, elevator-type conformational motions that enable substrate translocation. Kinetic analysis suggests that the two protomers of the VcINDY homodimer undergo those motions in a non-cooperative manner, and thus catalyze two independent transport reactions. The relative substrate independence of those motions supports the notion that the VcINDY transport cycle maintains strict co-substrate coupling using a cooperative binding mechanism. Finally, thermodynamic modeling provides insight into how such a cooperative binding mechanism provides a generalized approach to optimizing transport for many secondary active transporters.",

    "abstract": "Increasing the confidence in using in vitro and in silico model-based data to aid the chemical risk assessment process is one, if not the most, important challenge currently facing regulatory authorities. A particularly crucial concern is to fully take advantage of scientifically valid Physiologically-Based Kinetic (PBK) models. Nevertheless, risk assessors remain still unwilling in employing PBK models within their daily work. Indeed, PBK models are not often included in current official guidance documents. In addition, most users have limited experience in using modelling in general. So, the complexity of PBK models, together with a lack to evaluation methods of their performances, certainly contributes to their under-use in practical risk assessment.\n\nThis paper proposes an innovative and unified modelling framework, in both the writing of PBK equations as matrix ordinary differential equations (ODE), and in its exact solving simply expressed with matrix products. This generic PBK solution allows to consider as many as state-variables as needed to quantify chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion processes within living organisms when exposed to chemical substances. This generic PBK model makes possible any compartmentalisation to be considered, as well as all appropriate inter-connections between compartments and with the external medium.\n\nWe first introduce our PBK modelling framework, with all intermediate steps from the matrix ODE to the exact solution. Then we apply this framework to bioaccumulation testing, before illustrating its concrete use through complementary case studies in terms of species, compounds and model complexity.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Cells can sense and interpret mechanical stimuli from their environments and neighbors, but the ability to engineer customized mechanosensing capabilities has remained a synthetic and mechanobiology challenge. Here, we introduce tension-tuned synthetic Notch (SynNotch) receptors that can be used to convert extracellular and intercellular forces into specifiable gene expression changes. By elevating the tension requirements of SynNotch activation, in combination with structure-guided mutagenesis, we designed a set of receptors with mechanical sensitivities spanning the physiologically relevant picoNewton (pN) range. Cells expressing these receptors can distinguish between varying tensile forces and respond by enacting customizable transcriptional programs. The synthetic utility of these tools is demonstrated by designing a decision-making circuit, through which fibroblasts can be made to differentiate into myoblasts upon stimulation with distinct tension magnitudes. Mechanobiological utility is also demonstrated by characterizing cell-generated forces transmitted between cells during Notch signaling. Overall, this work provides insight regarding how mechanically induced changes in protein structure can be used to transduce physical forces into biochemical signals. The system should facilitate the further programming and dissection of force-related phenomena in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests distinct functional contributions of the anterior and posterior hippocampus to autobiographical memory retrieval, but how these subregions function under different retrieval demands as memories age is not yet understood. Specifically, autobiographical memory retrieval is not a homogenous process, rather, it is thought to consist of multiple stages: an early stage of memory construction and a later stage of detailed elaboration, which may differently engage the hippocampus over time. In the present study, we analyzed data from 40 participants who constructed and overtly elaborated upon recent and remote memories in response to picture cues in the fMRI scanner. We previously reported a temporal gradient in the posterior hippocampus during the elaboration period of autobiographical retrieval, with posterior hippocampal activation observed for recent but not remote timepoints. Here, we consider the previously unanalyzed construction stage of retrieval, where participants searched for and selected a memory. We found no evidence of a temporal gradient during memory construction, instead observing strong anterior hippocampus activity regardless of memory remoteness. Our findings suggest a unique contribution of the anterior hippocampus to the construction process of autobiographical retrieval over time. These findings highlight that retrieval processes, which have yet to be considered in current models of systems consolidation, offer novel insights to hippocampal subregion function over time.",

We previously showed that IGH loci of wild-derived mouse strains representing the major mouse subspecies contained 247 germline IGHV sequences not curated in the international ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) information system, which is the most commonly used database that curates the germline repertoires used for sequence alignment in AIRR-seq analysis. Despite containing levels of polymorphism similar to the IGH locus, the germline gene content and diversity of the light chain loci have not been comprehensively cataloged. To explore the extent of germline light chain repertoire diversity across mouse strains commonly used in the biomedical sciences, we performed AIRR-seq analysis and germline gene inference for 18 inbred mouse strains, including the four wild-derived strains with diverse sub-species origins. We inferred 1582 IGKV and 63 IGLV sequences, representing 459 and 22 unique IGKV and IGLV sequences. Of the unique inferred germline IGKV and IGLV sequences, 67.8% and 59%, respectively, were undocumented in IMGT. Across strains we observed germline IGKV sequences shared by three distinct IGK haplotypes and a more conserved IGLV germline repertoire. In addition, J gene inference indicated a novel IGK2 allele shared between PWD/PhJ and MSM/MsJ and a novel IGLJ1 allele for LEWES/EiJ and IGLJ2 allele for MSM/MsJ. Finally, a combined IGHV, IGKV, and IGLV phylogenetic analysis of wild-derived germline repertoires displayed reduced germline diversity for the light chain repertoire compared to the heavy chain repertoire, suggesting potential evolutionary differences between the two chains.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing need to move beyond evaluating the effect of land use on stream communities by only studying local variables, and instead incorporate a metacommunity perspective which integrates environmental and spatial factors across larger spatial scales. The use of molecular tools (DNA metabarcoding) to identify bioindicator groups, such as aquatic macroinvertebrates, can provide greater taxonomic resolution to explore patterns in stream metacommunities. In this study, we collected aquatic macroinvertebrates from streams in southern Ontario which spanned a gradient of agricultural disturbance and used DNA metabarcoding to identify the species composition from these samples. We address a significant knowledge gap in previous stream aquatic macroinvertebrate metacommunity studies by incorporating molecular identification as well as a temporal component. We observed that a combination of local habitat conditions, regional agricultural land use, and spatial position influenced aquatic macroinvertebrate community composition, suggesting there is an interaction between environmental filtering and dispersal processes that structures these communities. However, aquatic macroinvertebrate communities were also highly dissimilar between streams and composed of many rare species, and a large percentage of unexplained variation suggests that there is a strong stochastic component to community assembly. We also observed that there is a seasonal component to metacommunity dynamics, with different water quality variables being significant to community composition in each sampling month. While we expected that an increased percentage of surrounding agricultural land use would result in more homogenous macroinvertebrate communities, we only detected this relationship in May and found evidence that a larger riparian buffer width can mitigate the effects of agricultural land use. We demonstrate the utility of DNA metabarcoding for revealing patterns in metacommunity dynamics that may not be detectable using coarse taxonomic identifications, and reveal the importance of incorporating a seasonal component when evaluating the influence of land use on community composition.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes and in archaea late steps of translation initiation involve the two initiation factors e/aIF5B and e/aIF1A. In eukaryotes, the role of eIF5B in ribosomal subunit joining is established and structural data showing eIF5B bound to the full ribosome were obtained. To achieve its function, eIF5B collaborates with eIF1A. However, structural data illustrating how these two factors interact on the small ribosomal subunit have long been awaited. The role of the archaeal counterparts, aIF5B and aIF1A, remains to be extensively addressed. Here, we study the late steps of Pyrococcus abyssi translation initiation. Using in vitro reconstituted initiation complexes and light scattering, we show that aIF5B bound to GTP accelerates subunit joining without the need for GTP hydrolysis. We report the crystallographic structures of aIF5B bound to GDP and GTP and analyze domain movements associated to these two nucleotide states. Finally, we present the cryo-EM structure of an initiation complex containing 30S bound to mRNA, Met-tRNAiMet, aIF5B and aIF1A at 2.7 [A] resolution. Structural data shows how archaeal 5B and 1A factors cooperate to induce a conformation of the initiator tRNA favorable to subunit joining. Archaeal and eukaryotic features of late steps of translation initiation are discussed.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs that play essential roles in gene expression regulation. While miRNAs offer a promising source for developing potent cancer biomarkers, the progress towards clinical utilities remains largely limited, due in part to the long-standing challenge in sensitive, specific, and robust detection of miRNAs in human biofluids. Emerging next-generation molecular technologies, such as the CRISPR-based methods, promise to transform nucleic acid testing. The prevailing strategy used in existing CRISPR-based methods is to hyphenate two separate reactions for pre-amplification, e.g., rolling circle amplification (RCA), and amplicon detection by Cas12a/13a trans-cleavage in tandem. Thus, existing CRISPR-based miRNA assays require multiple manual steps and lack the analytical performance of the gold standard, RT-qPCR. Radically deviating from the existing strategies, we developed a one-step, one-pot isothermal miRNA assay termed \"Endonucleolytically eXponenTiated Rolling circle Amplification with the dual-functional CRISPR-Cas12a\" (EXTRA-CRISPR) to afford RT-PCR-like performance for miRNA detection. We demonstrated the superior analytical performance of our EXTRA-CRISPR assay to detect miRNAs (miR-21, miR-196a, miR-451a, and miR-1246) in plasma extracellular vesicles, which allowed us to define a potent EV miRNA signature for detection of pancreatic cancer. The analytical and diagnostic performance of our one-pot assay were shown to be comparable with that of the commercial RT-qPCR assays, while greatly simplifying and expediting the analysis workflow. Therefore, we envision that our technology provides a promising tool to advance miRNA analysis and clinical marker development for liquid biopsy-based cancer diagnosis and prognosis.",

    "abstract": "The microbiome modulates host immunity and aids in maintenance of tolerance in the gut, where microbial and food-derived antigens are abundant. Modern lifestyle practices, including diet and antibiotic use, have depleted beneficial taxa, specifically butyrate-producing Clostridia. This depletion is associated with the rising incidence of food allergy, inflammatory bowel diseases, and other noncommunicable chronic diseases. Although butyrate is known to play important roles in regulating gut immunity and maintaining epithelial barrier function, its clinical translation is challenging due to its offensive odor and quick absorption in the upper gut. Here, we have developed two polymeric micelle systems, one with a neutral charge (NtL-ButM) and one with a negative charge (Neg-ButM) that release butyrate from their polymeric core in different regions of the gastrointestinal tract when administered intragastrically to mice. We show that these butyrate-containing micelles, used in combination, restore a barrier-protective response in mice treated with either dextran sodium sulfate or antibiotics. Moreover, butyrate micelle treatment protects peanut-allergic dysbiotic mice from an anaphylactic reaction to peanut challenge and rescues their antibiotic-induced dysbiosis by increasing the abundance of Clostridium Cluster XIVa. Butyrate micelle treatment also reduces the severity of colitis in a murine model. By restoring microbial and mucosal homeostasis, these butyrate-prodrug polymeric micelles may function as a new, antigen-agnostic approach for the treatment of allergic and inflammatory disease.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveLithium carbonate (LiCO) is a mainstay therapeutic for the prevention of mood-episode recurrences in bipolar disorder (BD). Unfortunately, its narrow therapeutic index is associated with complications that may lead to treatment non-compliance. Intriguingly, lithium orotate (LiOr) is suggested to possess uptake properties that would allow for reduced dosing and mitigation of toxicity concerns. We hypothesized that due to differences in pharmacokinetics, LiOr is more potent with reduced adverse effects.\n\nMethodsDose responses were established for LiOr and LiCO in male and female mice using an amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion (AIH) model; AIH captures manic elements of BD and is sensitive to a dose-dependent lithium blockade. Next, the relative toxicities of LiOr and LiCO were contrasted after 14 consecutive daily administrations.\n\nResultsLiCO maintained a partial block of AIH at doses of 15 mg/kg or greater in males and 20 mg/kg or greater in females. In contrast, LiOr elicited a near complete blockade at concentrations of just 1.5 mg/kg in both sexes, indicating improved efficacy and potency. Prior application of an organic-anion transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2) inhibitor completely blocked the effects of LiOr on AIH while sparing LiCO, suggesting differences in transport between the two compounds. LiCO, but not LiOr, elicited polydipsia in both sexes, elevated serum creatinine levels in males, and increased serum TSH expression in females.\n\nConclusionsLiOr demonstrates superior efficacy, potency, and tolerability to LiCO in both male and female mice as a result of select transport-mediated uptake.",

The first, Impatiens banen, appears to be restricted to an open seepage microhabitat on granitic inselbergs in the lowland-submontane forest zone of the Ebo Forest in Littoral Region and is provisionally assessed using the 2012 IUCN standard as Vulnerable. Sharing characters with Impatiens burtonii and I. mannii, it differs from both, and appears to be unique in Cameroon inter alia 1) in the bicolored united lateral petals, the upper petals being white, while the lower petals are an intense pink-purple, 2) the hairy, filamentous spur, purple with a white apex, is curved along its length (through nearly 360{degrees}), almost describing a circle. Inselberg-specific species are unusual in Impatiens.\n\nThe second species, Impatiens etugei, of the I. macroptera aggregate, is restricted to rocks in the Mutel River of the Kom Wum Forest Reserve of NorthWest Region and is assessed as Critically Endangered. Having similarities with I. mackeyana and I. letouzeyi, it differs from other species in the aggregate inter alia by having opposite leaves (vs always alternate), flower exterior white (vs pink or pink-purple), and in the dorsal petal having a pair of lateral projections (vs projections absent).",

In lieu of physical compartments, bacterial proteins are often recruited to macromolecular scaffolds at specific subcellular locations to carry out their functions. Consequently, the ability to modulate a proteins subcellular location with high precision and speed bears the potential to manipulate its corresponding cellular functions. Here we demonstrate that the CRY2/CIB1 system from Arabidopsis thaliana can be used to rapidly direct proteins to different subcellular locations inside live E. coli cells including the nucleoid, the cell pole, membrane, and the midcell division plane. We further show that such light-induced re-localization can be used to rapidly inhibit cytokinesis in actively dividing E. coli cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the CRY2/CIBN binding kinetics can be modulated by green light, adding a new dimension of control to the system.",

Here, we report that nearly 200 distinct neurons in the Drosophila visual system can each be defined by unique combinations of [~]10 transcription factors that are continuously expressed by them. We show that targeted modifications of this  selector code induce predictable conversions of cell fates between neurons in vivo. These conversions appear morphologically and transcriptionally complete, arguing for a conserved gene regulatory program that jointly instructs both the type-specific development and the terminal features of neurons. Cis-regulatory sequence analysis of open chromatin links one of these selectors to an upstream patterning gene in stem cells that specifies neuronal fates. Experimentally validated network models show that selectors interact with ecdysone signaling to regulate downstream effectors controlling brain wiring. Our results provide a generalizable framework of how specific fates are initiated and maintained in postmitotic neurons.",

While extensive efforts have focused on potentiating cell-mediated immunity to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, less effort has been invested in exploiting the humoral immune system to combat Mtb. Emerging data point to a role for antibodies in microbial control of Mtb, however the precise mechanism(s) of this control remain incompletely understood. Here we took an antibody Fc-engineering approach to determine whether Fc-modifications could improve the ability of antibodies to restrict Mtb, and to define Fc-mediated mechanism(s) antibodies leverage for this restriction. Using an antibody specific to the capsular polysaccharide -glucan, we engineer a panel of Fc variants to augment or dampen select antibody effector functions, rationally building antibodies with enhanced capacity to promote Mtb restriction in a human whole blood model of infection. Surprisingly, restrictive Fc-engineered antibodies drive Mtb control in a neutrophil, not monocyte, dependent manner. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we show that restrictive antibodies promote neutrophil survival and expression of cell intrinsic antimicrobial programs. These data provide a roadmap for exploiting Fc-engineered antibodies as a novel class of TB therapeutics able to harness the protective functions of neutrophils to achieve disease control.",

DNA sequence variants lead to phenotypic differences among individuals, while within an individual, RNA dynamically confers cell identity and responds to cellular and environmental signals. To provide regulation for different cell types and conditions, the nucleotides of RNA are modified by hundreds of chemical reactions, and RNA folds into innumerable shapes. To decipher the RNA regulatory code is to understand how RNA sequence and structure respond to cellular needs. Here, we deciphered one part of the RNA code where RNA abasic sites in R-loops regulate transcription by pausing RNA polymerase II. We uncovered an enhancer RNA, AANCR, that regulates the transcription and expression of APOE. When AANCR is folded into an R-loop, which is then modified by N6-adenine methylation and N-glycosidic cleavage, it is a partially transcribed nonfunctional enhancer and APOE is not expressed. In contrast, in some cell types and under stress, AANCR does not form a stable R-loop as its sequence is not modified, so it is transcribed into a full-length enhancer that promotes APOE expression. By genetic analysis, we confirmed that AANCR regulates APOE expression. DNA sequence variants in AANCR are associated with APOE expression and also with Alzheimers disease. Our data show that DNA and RNA sequence and structure jointly regulate gene expression that influence disease risk.\n\nHighlightsO_LIm6A, RNA abasic sites and R-loops jointly regulate transcription by pausing RNA Polymerase II.\nC_LIO_LIAn enhancer RNA regulates APOE expression.\nC_LIO_LIEnhancer RNA of APOE modifies susceptibility to Alzheimers disease.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Currently, detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in cancer patient blood samples relies on immunostaining, which does not provide access to live CTCs, limiting the breadth of CTC-based applications. As a first step to address this limitation, here, we demonstrate staining-free enumeration of tumor cells spiked into lysed blood samples using digital holographic microscopy (DHM), microfluidics and machine learning (ML). A 3D-printed module for laser assembly was developed to simplify the optical set up for holographic imaging of cells flowing through a sheath-based microfluidic device. Computational reconstruction of the holograms was performed to localize the cells in 3D and obtain the plane of best focus images to train deep learning models. First, we evaluated the classification performance of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs): ResNet-50 and a custom-designed shallow Network dubbed s-Net. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of these networks were found to range from 97.08% and 99.32%. Upon selecting the s-Net due to its simple architecture and low computational burden, we formulated a decision gating strategy to significantly lower the false positive rate (FPR). By applying an optimized decision threshold to mixed samples prepared in silico, the FPR was reduced from 1x10-2 to 2.77x10-4. Finally, the developed DHM-ML framework was successfully applied to enumerate spiked MCF-7 breast cancer cells from lysed blood samples containing a background of white blood cells (WBCs). We conclude by discussing the advances that need to be made to translate the DHM-ML approach to staining-free enumeration of CTCs in cancer patient blood samples.",

    "abstract": "The identification of drug/compound-target interactions (DTIs) constitutes the basis of drug discovery, for which computational predictive approaches have been applied. As a relatively new data-driven paradigm, proteochemometric (PCM) modeling utilizes both protein and compound properties as a pair at the input level and processes them via statistical/machine learning. The representation of input samples (i.e., proteins and their ligands) in the form of quantitative feature vectors is crucial for the extraction of interaction-related properties during the artificial learning and subsequent prediction of DTIs. Lately, the representation learning approach, in which input samples are automatically featurized via training and applying a machine/deep learning model, has been utilized in biomedical sciences. In this study, we performed a comprehensive investigation of different computational approaches/techniques for protein featurization (including both conventional approaches and the novel learned embeddings), data preparation and exploration, machine learning-based modeling, and performance evaluation with the aim of achieving better data representations and more successful learning in DTI prediction. For this, we first constructed realistic and challenging benchmark datasets on small, medium, and large scales to be used as reliable gold standards for specific DTI modeling tasks. We developed and applied a network analysis-based splitting strategy to divide datasets into structurally different training and test folds. Using these datasets together with various featurization methods, we trained and tested DTI prediction models and evaluated their performance from different angles. Our main findings can be summarized under 3 items: (i) random splitting of datasets into train and test folds lead to near-complete data memorization and produce highly over-optimistic results, as a result, it should be avoided, (ii) learned protein sequence embeddings work well in DTI prediction and offer high potential, even though no information related to protein structures, interactions or biochemical properties is utilized during their generation, and (iii) PCM models tend to learn from compound features and leave out protein features, mostly due to the natural bias in DTI data, indicating the requirement for new and unbiased datasets. We hope this study will aid researchers in designing robust and high-performing data-driven DTI prediction systems that have real-world translational value in drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Actin networks polymerize and depolymerize to construct highly organized structures, thereby, endowing the mechanical phenotypes found in a cell. It is generally believed that the amount of filamentous actin and actin network architecture determine cytoplasmic viscosity and elasticity of the whole cell. However, the intrinsic complexity of a cell and numerous other endogenous cellular components make it difficult to study the differential role of distinct actin networks in regulating cell mechanics. Here, we model a cell by using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) encapsulating actin filaments and networks assembled by various actin crosslinker proteins. Perturbation of these cytoskeletal vesicles using AC electric fields revealed that deformability depends on lumenal viscosity and actin network architecture. While actin-free vesicles exhibited large electromechanical deformations, deformations of GUVs encapsulating actin filaments were significantly dampened. The suppression of electrodeformation of actin-GUVs can be similarly recapitulated by using aqueous PEG 8000 solutions at different concentrations to modulate viscosity. Furthermore, alpha actinin-crosslinked actin networks resulted in decreased GUV deformability in comparison to actin filament-encapsulating GUVs, and membrane-associated actin networks through the formation of dendritic actin cortex greatly dampened electrodeformation of GUVs. These results highlight the organization of actin networks regulates the mechanics of GUVs and shed insights into the origin of differential deformability of cells.",

    "abstract": "Post-mating immunosuppression has been widely accepted as a female trait in Drosophila melanogaster. Our results challenge this notion by presenting a mating-immunity trade-off in males as well as in females. When inoculated with the fungal pathogen, Beauveria bassiana, both males and females die faster compared to inoculated virgins, and survival is lower when inoculated flies are continuously mated compared to a single day of mating. Past studies with Beauveria bassiana have shown females to be more susceptible to infection than males. Our results challenge this finding as well, showing that the direction of sexual dimorphism in immune defense depends on mating status, specific Beauveria bassiana strain, and fly genotype. Moreover, we show that survival after fungal infection is largely influenced by diet, and that post-infection dietary improvements can help enhance survival. Post-mating suppression in Drosophila survival of B. bassiana infection presents study opportunities with potential applications for biological control of insect vectors of human disease and insect crop pests.",
