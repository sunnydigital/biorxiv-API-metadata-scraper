    "abstract": "Within the cell cargo is transported via motor proteins walking along microtubules. The affinity of motor proteins for microtubules is controlled by various layers of regulation like tubulin isoforms, post- translational modifications and microtubule associated proteins. Recently, the conformation of the microtubule lattice has also emerged as a potential regulatory factor, but to what extent it acts as an additional layer of regulation has remained unclear. In this study, we used cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy to study microtubule lattices inside cells. We find that, while most microtubules have a compacted lattice ([~]41 [A]), a significant proportion of the microtubule cores have expanded lattice spacings and that these lattice spacings could be modulated by the microtubule stabilizing drug Taxol. Furthermore, kinesin-1 predominantly binds microtubules with a more expanded lattice spacing ([~]41.6 [A]). The different lattice spacings present in the cell can thus act as an additional factor that modulates the binding of motor proteins to specific microtubule subsets.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication is normally coupled with centriole duplication in the cell cycle. Trophoblast giant cells (TGCs) of the placenta undergo endocycles resulting in polyploidy but their centriole state is not known. We used a cell culture model for TGC differentiation to examine centriole and centrosome number and properties. Prior to differentiation, trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) have either two centrioles before duplication, or four centrioles after. We find that average nuclear area increases approximately 8-fold over differentiation, but most TGCs do not have more than four centrioles. However, these centrioles become disengaged, acquire centrosome proteins, and can nucleate microtubules. In addition, some TGCs undergo further duplication and disengagement of centrioles, resulting in substantially higher numbers. Live imaging revealed that disengagement and separation are centriole autonomous and can occur asynchronously. Centriole amplification, when present, occurs by the standard mechanism of one centriole generating one procentriole. PLK4 inihibition blocks centriole formation in differentiating TGCs but does not affect endocycle progression. In summary, centrioles in TGC endocycles undergo disengagement and conversion to centrosomes. This increases centrosome number, but to a limited extent compared with DNA reduplication.",

    "abstract": "Cells trigger the assembly of stress granules (SGs) under various stress conditions. Among the many proteins recruited to SGs are RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and regulators of transcription. Here, we report the translocation of hCdc73, a component of the PAF1 transcription complex, to cytosolic SGs in response to sodium arsenite, MG132, thapsigargin (TG) or heat treatment. The hCdc73 protein possesses a long intrinsically disordered region (IDR) from amino acids 256-416, the presence of which is required and essential for the translocation of hCdc73 to cytosolic SGs. The purified hCdc73 IDR formed droplets in vitro, and the light-activated assembly of hCdc73 IDR-Cry2 was also verified. Alone, the hCdc73 IDR, however, was not sufficient for the translocation of hCdc73 to SGs, as physical interactions with the scaffold proteins of SGs, such as FMR1, were needed. Selective sequestration of cytosolic hCdc73 into SGs coincided with the dissociation of p53 mRNA from the hCdc73/Ski8/eEF1B{gamma} complex, resulting in a transient rise in p53 mRNA at the posttranscriptional level. In conclusion, we propose that in addition to the storage of nontranslating mRNAs, SGs also function to control the availability of mRNAs for stress response genes by restraining their negative regulators within SGs.",

    "abstract": "In the early C. elegans embryo, cell polarization and cytokinesis are interrelated yet distinct processes. Here, we sought to understand a poorly understood aspect of cleavage furrow positioning. Early C. elegans embryos deficient in the cytokinetic regulator centralspindlin form furrows, due to an inhibitory activity that depends on aster positioning relative to the polar cortices. Here, we show polar relaxation is associated with depletion of cortical ECT-2, a RhoGEF, specifically at the posterior cortex. Asymmetric ECT-2 accumulation requires intact centrosomes, Aurora A (AIR-1), and myosin-dependent cortical flows. Within a localization competent ECT-2 fragment, we identified three putative phospho-acceptor sites in the PH domain of ECT-2 that render ECT-2 responsive to inhibition by AIR-1. During both polarization and cytokinesis, our results suggest that centrosomal AIR-1 breaks symmetry via ECT-2 phosphorylation; this local inhibition of ECT-2 is amplified by myosin-driven flows that generate regional ECT-2 asymmetry. Together, these mechanisms cooperate to induce polarized assembly of cortical myosin, contributing to both embryo polarization and cytokinesis.",

    "abstract": "Peptides and protein hydrolysates are promising alternatives to substitute chemical additives as functional food ingredients. In this study, we present a novel approach for producing a potato protein hydrolysate with improved emulsifying and foaming properties by data-driven, targeted hydrolysis. Based on previous studies, we selected 15 emulsifier peptides derived from abundant potato proteins, which were clustered based on sequence identity. Through in silico analysis, we determined that from a range of industrial proteases (Neutrase (Neut), Alcalase (Alc), Flavorzyme (Flav) and Trypsin (Tryp)), Tryp was found more likely to release peptides resembling the target peptides. After applying all proteases individually, hydrolysates were assayed for in vitro emulsifying and foaming properties. No direct correlation between degree of hydrolysis and interfacial properties was found. Tryp produced a hydrolysate (DH=5.4%) with the highest (P<0.05) emulsifying and foaming abilities, good stabilities, and high aqueous solubility. Using LC-MS/MS, we identified >10,000 peptides in each hydrolysate. Through peptide mapping, we show that random overlapping with known peptide emulsifiers is not sufficient to quantitatively describe hydrolysate functionality. While Neut hydrolysates had the highest proportion of peptides with target overlap, they showed inferior interfacial activity. In contrast, Tryp was able to release specifically targeted peptides, explaining the high surface activity observed. While modest yields and residual unhydrolyzed protein indicate room for process improvement, this work shows that data-driven, targeted hydrolysis is a viable, interdisciplinary approach to facilitate hydrolysis design for production of functional hydrolysates from alternative protein sources.",

    "abstract": "Biogenesis of the large ribosomal (60S) subunit involves the assembly of three rRNAs and 46 proteins, a process requiring approximately 70 ribosome biogenesis factors (RBFs) that bind and release the pre-60S at specific steps along the assembly pathway. The methyltransferase Spb1 and the K-loop GTPase Nog2 are essential RBFs that engage the rRNA A-loop during sequential steps in 60S maturation. Spb1 methylates the A-loop nucleotide G2922 and a catalytically deficient mutant strain (spb1D52A) has a severe 60S biogenesis defect. However, the assembly function of this modification is currently unknown. Here, we present cryo-EM reconstructions that reveal that unmethylated G2922 leads to the premature activation of Nog2 GTPase activity and capture a Nog2-GDP-AlF4- transition state structure that shows the direct involvement of unmodified G2922 in Nog2 GTPase activation. Intragenic and dosage suppressors indicate that the biogenesis defect in the spb1D52A strain is caused by reduced initial recruitment of Nog2 to early nucleoplasmic 60S intermediates. We propose that G2922 methylation levels regulate Nog2 stability on the pre-60S near the nucleolar/nucleoplasmic phase boundary, forming a kinetic checkpoint to regulate 60S production. Because multiple K-loop GTPases are involved in the assembly of ribosomes and other RNPs, our findings provide a template to study the role of RNA trans factors in modulating the regulatory functions of this important family of enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsChronic inflammation in the colon is a predisposing factor for colon cancer. We previously reported that colon epithelial cell silencing of Smad4, the central downstream mediator of TGF{beta} family signaling, increased epithelial expression of inflammatory genes, including the chemokine CCL20, and increased susceptibility to colitis-associated cancer. Here, we examine the role of the chemokine/receptor pair CCL20/CCR6 in mediating colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis induced by SMAD4 loss.\n\nMethodsMice with conditional, epithelial-specific Smad4 loss with and without germline deletion of the Ccr6 gene were subjected to three rounds of dextran sodium sulfate and followed for up to 3 months. Tumors were quantified histologically, and immune cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunostaining.\n\nResultsIn humans, SMAD4 expression inversely correlated with CCL20 expression. Smad4 loss in mouse colon epithelium led to enlarged gut-associated lymphoid tissues and recruitment of specific immune cell subsets to the mouse colon epithelium and underlying stroma, particularly Treg, Th17, and dendritic cells. Loss of CCR6 abrogated these immune responses and significantly reduced the incidence of colitis-associated tumors observed with loss of SMAD4 alone.\n\nConclusionsRegulation of mucosal inflammation is a critical role of SMAD4 signaling within the colon epithelium and central to its tumor suppressor function in the colon. A key downstream node in this regulation is suppression of CCL20 signaling by the epithelium to CCR6 in immune cells. Loss of SMAD4 in the colon epithelium increases CCL20 expression and chemoattraction of CCR6+ immune cells, contributing to greater susceptibility to colon cancer.",

We investigated metabolic parameters in mice harbouring a missense mutation in Zfhx3 (Zfhx3Sci/+) and looked for altered in situ expression of transcripts that are associated with energy balance in the hypothalamus to understand how ZFHX3 may influence growth and metabolic effects. One year old male and female Zfhx3Sci/+ mice weighed less, had shorter body length, reduced fat mass, smaller mesenteric fat depots, and lower circulating insulin, leptin, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) concentrations than Zfhx3+/+ littermates. In a second cohort of 9 - 20-week-old males and females, Zfhx3Sci/+ mice ate less than wildtype controls, in proportion to body weight. In a third cohort of female-only Zfhx3Sci/+ and Zfhx3+/+ mice that underwent metabolic phenotyping from 6 - 14 weeks old, Zfhx3Sci/+ mice weighed less and had lower lean mass and energy expenditure, but fat mass didnt differ. We detected increased expression of somatostatin, and decreased expression of growth hormone-releasing hormone and growth hormone-receptor mRNAs in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Similarly, ARC expression of orexigenic neuropeptide Y was decreased and ventricular ependymal expression of orphan G protein-coupled receptor Gpr50 was decreased.

    "abstract": "Construction of successful synthetic microbial consortia will harbour a new era in the field of agriculture, bioremediation, and human health. Engineering communities is a complex, multi-dimensional problem with several considerations ranging from the choice of consortia members and spatial factors to genetic circuit performances. There has been a growing number of computational strategies to aid in synthetic microbial consortia design, but a framework to optimize communities for two essential properties, evenness and stability, is missing. We investigated how the structure of different social interactions (cooperation, competition, and predation) in quorum-sensing based circuits impacts robustness of synthetic microbial communities and specifically affected evenness and stability. Our proposed work predicts engineering targets and computes their operating ranges to maximize the probability of synthetic microbial consortia to have high evenness and high stability. Our exhaustive pipeline for rapid and thorough analysis of large and complex parametric spaces further allowed us to dissect the relationship between evenness and stability for different social interactions. Our results showed that in cooperation, the speed at which species stabilizes is unrelated to evenness, however the region of stability increases with evenness. The opposite effect was noted for competition, where evenness and stable regions are negatively correlated. In both competition and predation, the system takes significantly longer to stabilize following a perturbation in uneven microbial conditions. We believe our study takes us one step closer to resolving the pivotal debate of evenness-stability relationship in ecology and has contributed to computational design of synthetic microbial communities by optimizing for previously unaddressed properties allowing for more accurate and streamlined ecological engineering.",

    "abstract": "Placing a patient in a state of anaesthesia is crucial for modern surgical practice. However, the mechanisms by which anaesthetic drugs, such as propofol, impart their effects on consciousness remain poorly understood. Propofol potentiates GABAergic transmission, which purportedly has direct actions on cortex as well as indirect actions via ascending neuromodulatory systems. Functional imaging studies to date have been limited in their ability to unravel how these effects on neurotransmission impact system-level dynamics of the brain. Here, we leveraged advances in multi-modal imaging, Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets (REACT), to investigate how different levels of propofol-induced sedation alters neurotransmission-related functional connectivity (FC), both at rest and when individuals are exposed to naturalistic auditory stimulation. Propofol increased GABA-A- and noradrenaline transporter-enriched FC within occipital and somatosensory regions respectively. Additionally, during auditory stimulation, the network related to the vesicular acetylcholine transporter showed reduced FC within the right superior temporal gyrus, regardless of level of anaesthesia, and a spatial configuration correlating with a broad range of meta-analytic measures of audition- and emotion-related cognition. In bringing together these micro- and macro-scale systems, we provide support for both direct GABAergic and indirect noradrenergic-related network changes under anaesthesia and describe a cognition-related reconfiguration of the cholinergic network, highlighting the utility of REACT to explore the molecular substrates consciousness and cognition.",

    "abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of innate immunity that defends the host from microbial infections. However, its aberrant activation contributes to the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta} and IL-18, and pyroptotic cell death. NLRP3 contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain at its C-terminus. Although posttranslational modifications in this LRR domain have been shown to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation, the role of the entire LRR domain in NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains controversial. Here, we generated mouse macrophages that express an endogenous NLRP3 mutant lacking the LRR domain. Deletion of the LRR domain destabilized endogenous NLRP3 protein and abolished NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. Furthermore, using NLRP3-deficient macrophages that are reconstituted with NLRP3 mutants lacking the LRR domain, we found that deletion of the LRR domain inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, deletion of the LRR domain abolished NLRP3 self-association, oligomerization, and interaction with the essential regulator NEK7. Our results demonstrate a critical role for the LRR domain in NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

    "abstract": "Background and ObjectivesPreviously, we showed proof-of-concept in a mouse model that oral administration of cholestyramine prevented enrichment of daptomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract during daptomycin therapy. Cholestyramine binds daptomycin in the gut, which removes daptomycin selection pressure and so prevents the enrichment of resistant clones. Here, we investigated two open questions related to this approach: 1) can cholestyramine prevent the enrichment of diverse daptomycin mutations emerging de novo in the gut? 2) how does the timing of cholestyramine administration impact its ability to suppress resistance?\n\nMethodologyMice with GI E. faecium were treated with daptomycin with or without cholestyramine, and E. faecium was cultured from feces to measure changes in daptomycin susceptibility. A subset of clones was sequenced to investigate the genomic basis of daptomycin resistance.\n\nResultsCholestyramine prevented the enrichment of diverse resistance mutations that emerged de novo in daptomycin-treated mice. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that resistance emerged through multiple genetic pathways, with most candidate resistance mutations observed in the clsA gene. Additionally, we observed that cholestyramine was most effective when administration started prior to the first dose of daptomycin. However, beginning cholestyramine after the first daptomycin dose reduced the frequency of resistant E. faecium compared to not using cholestyramine at all.\n\nConclusions and ImplicationsCholestyramine prevented the enrichment of diverse daptomycin-resistance mutations in intestinal E. faecium populations during daptomycin treatment, and it is a promising tool for managing transmission of daptomycin-resistant E. faecium.",

    "abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites cause persistent mortality and morbidity worldwide through diseases including malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis. Ca2+ signaling pathways have been repurposed in these eukaryotic pathogens to regulate parasite-specific cellular processes governing the transition between the replicative and lytic phases of the infectious cycle. Despite the presence of conserved Ca2+-responsive proteins, little is known about how specific signaling elements interact to impact pathogenesis. We mapped the Ca2+-responsive proteome of the model apicomplexan T. gondii via time-resolved phosphoproteomics and thermal proteome profiling. The waves of phosphoregulation following PKG activation and stimulated Ca2+ release corroborate known physiological changes but identify specific proteins operating in these pathways. Thermal profiling of parasite extracts identified many expected Ca2+-responsive proteins, such as parasite Ca2+-dependent protein kinases. Our approach also identified numerous Ca2+-responsive proteins that are not predicted to bind Ca2+, yet are critical components of the parasite signaling network. We characterized protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) as a Ca2+-responsive enzyme that relocalized to the parasite apex upon Ca2+ store release. Conditional depletion of PP1 revealed that the phosphatase regulates Ca2+ uptake to promote parasite motility. PP1 may thus be partly responsible for Ca2+-regulated serine/threonine phosphatase activity in apicomplexan parasites.",

    "abstract": "A plethora of studies have focused on improvements of xylitol production. The challenges of establishing a biotechnological route for the industrial production of this sugar have been explored using different microorganisms and renewable feedstock. Nevertheless, sugarcane biomass has been neglected as the pentose source for xylitol production using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Therefore, here we investigate the use of an industrial S. cerevisiae strain for xylitol production in batch fermentation of non-detoxified sugarcane straw hydrolysate, envisioning the diversification of the current infrastructure used for second-generation bioethanol production from the same lignocellulosic material. In order to optimize the xylose conversion in a non-fed cultivation system, guidelines in cell inoculum and medium supplementation are suggested, as well as the first attempt to use electro-fermentation for this purpose. Accordingly, our results show that the increase in initial cell density and hydrolysate supplementation allows a xylitol production of 19.24 {+/-} 0.68 g/L, representing 0,132 g/L.h productivity.",

    "abstract": "Despite being predicted to lack coding potential, cytoplasmic long non-coding (lnc)RNAs can associate with ribosomes, which may result in the production of functional peptides. However, the landscape and biological relevance of lncRNAs translation remains poorly studied. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cytoplasmic Xrn1-sensitive lncRNAs (XUTs) are targeted by the Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD), suggesting a translation-dependent degradation process. Here, we report that XUTs are translated, which impacts their abundance. We show that XUTs globally accumulate upon translation elongation inhibition, but not when initial ribosome loading is impaired. Translation also affects XUTs independently of NMD, in some cases interfering with their decapping. Ribo-Seq confirmed ribosomes binding to XUTs and identified actively translated small ORFs in their 5-proximal region. Mechanistic analyses revealed that their NMD-sensitivity mainly depends on the 3-untranslated region length. Finally, we detected the peptide derived from the translation of an NMD-sensitive XUT reporter in NMD-competent cells. Our work highlights the role of translation in the post-transcriptional metabolism of XUTs, acting as a modulator of their expression. We propose that XUT-derived peptides could be exposed to the natural selection, while NMD restricts XUTs levels.",

    "abstract": "Influenza virus-induced autophagy frequently accompanies apoptosis and results in cell death in cells infected with the virus. Autophagy has been well-known to be modulated by the mTOR/PI3K/Akt pathway, which plays an important role in response to the presence of energy sources and external stimulants. This pathway can also be modulated by MUC1, which has extracellular and intracellular components, and playing an important role in metastasis and chemotherapeutic resistance. In this study, the aim is to observe the changes in MUC1 expressions, which is known to have sialic acid residues within MUC1, therefore serving as a receptor for influenza viruses, and consequent changes in autophagy markers such as mTOR and LC3b, after inoculation of cancer cells with influenza virus.\n\nFluorescence was detected for LC3b, mTOR and MUC1 in all influenza-positive cell lines (MCF-7, He-La, A-549) except for RD in immunofluorescence studies. In influenza-negative MCF-7, HeLa, RD and A-549 cells no fluorescence was detected. In the supernatant of all influenza-positive cells, except for RD cells, positive results were obtained for MUC1, MAP1LC3B and MTOR genes (Ct 20,01-32,04) in RT-qPCR, respectively encoding for MUC1, LC3b, and mTOR. In RT-qPCR, in cell lines without influenza inoculation, only in the A-549 cells, the gene expressions were found to be negative. In other cell lines, positive results were obtained (Ct 21,98-23,78). In RD cells, which have not been inoculated with the virus, all pathways were positive.\n\nIn cells with adenocarcinoma structure, the alterations and presence of autophagy pathways and MUC1 expressions activated via influenza viruses were confirmed. However, this has not been proved using nucleic acid assays. The reason why might be the detection of only gene expressions and mRNA presence via the tests used in the study. In future studies, expressions of these genes in protein level should be detected using more advanced tests.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a homeostatic degradative process for cell components that enables stress resilience and can determine cellular fate and function. However, lipid sources for the rapid membrane expansions of autophagosomes, the workhorses of autophagy, are poorly understood. Here, we identify de novo lipogenesis (DNL) as a critical source of fatty acids (FA) to fuel autophagosome dynamics in adipocytes. Adipocyte fatty acid synthase (Fasn) deficiency markedly impairs autophagy, evident by autophagosome accumulation, and severely compromises degradation of the autophagic substrate p62. Autophagy dependence on FA produced by Fasn is not fully alleviated by exogenous FA in cultured adipocytes even though lipid droplet size is restored. Imaging studies reveal that Fasn colocalizes with nascent autophagosomes, while loss of Fasn decreases certain membrane phosphoinositides known to be required for autophagosome assembly. Together, our studies highlight a newly appreciated function for adipocyte DNL in autophagosome membrane formation and provide evidence that localized FA synthesis contributes to autophagosome dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The germ line provides an excellent in vivo system to study the regulation and function of RNP granules. Germ granules are conserved germ line-specific RNP granules that are positioned in the C. elegans adult gonad to function in RNA maintenance, regulation, and surveillance. In C. elegans, when oogenesis undergoes an extended meiotic arrest, germ granule proteins and other RNA binding proteins assemble into much larger RNP granules whose hypothesized function is to regulate RNA metabolism and maintain oocyte quality. To gain insight into the function of oocyte RNP granules, in this report we characterize distinct phases for four protein components of RNP granules in arrested oocytes. We find the RNA binding protein PGL-1 is dynamic and has liquid-like properties, while the intrinsically disordered protein MEG-3 has gel-like properties, similar to the properties of the two proteins in small germ granules of embryos. We find that MEX-3 exhibits several gel-like properties but is more dynamic than MEG-3, while CGH-1 is dynamic but does not consistently exhibit liquid-like characteristics and may be an intermediate phase within RNP granules. These distinct phases of RNA binding proteins correspond to, and may underlie, differential responses to stress. Interestingly, in oocyte RNP granules MEG-3 is not required for the condensation of PGL-1 or other RNA binding proteins, which differs from the role of MEG-3 in small, embryonic germ granules. Lastly, we show the PUF-5 translational repressor appears to promote MEX-3 and MEG-3 condensation into large RNP granules; however, this role may be associated with regulation of oogenesis.",

Currently, described methods for measuring DNA integration in edited cells rely on short read based technologies. Due to the repetitive nature of the human genome, short read based methods can potentially overlook insertion events in repetitive regions. We modelled the impact of read length in resolving insertion sites, which suggested a significant drop in insertion site detection with shorter read length. Based on that, we developed a method that combines targeted amplification of integrated DNA, UMI-based correction of PCR bias and Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing for robust analysis of DNA integration in a genome. This method, called INSERT-seq, is capable of detecting events occurring at a frequency of up to 0.1%. INSERT-seq presents a complete handling of all insertions independently of repeat size. The experimental pipeline improves the number mappable insertions at repetitive regions by 7.3% and repeats larger than the long read sequencing size are processed computationally to perform a peak calling in a repeat database. INSERT-seq is a simple, cheap and robust method to quantitatively characterise DNA integration in diverse ex-vivo and in-vivo samples.",

    "abstract": "Definition of MHC class I ligands of rhesus macaque KIRs is fundamental to NK cell biology in this species as an animal model for infectious diseases, reproductive biology, and transplantation. To provide a more complete foundation for studying NK cell responses, rhesus macaque KIRs representing common allotypes of lineage II KIR genes were tested for interactions with MHC class I molecules representing diverse Mamu-A, -B, -E, -F, -I and -AG alleles. KIR-MHC class I interactions were identified by co-incubating reporter cell lines bearing chimeric KIR-CD3{zeta} receptors with target cells expressing individual MHC class I molecules and were corroborated by staining with KIR IgG-Fc fusion proteins. Ligands for 11 KIRs of previously unknown specificity were identified that fell into two general categories: interactions with multiple Mamu-Bw4 molecules or with Mamu-A-related molecules, including several allotypes of Mamu-AG and the hybrid Mamu-B*045:03 molecule. Although both groups include inhibitory and activating receptors, the majority of KIRs found to interact with Mamu-Bw4 are inhibitory, whereas most of the KIRs that interact with Mamu-AG are activating. We also identified Mamu-A1*012:01 as a ligand for KIR3DLw03*002, which belongs to a phylogenetically distinct group of macaque KIRs with a three amino acid deletion in D0 that is also present in human KIR3DL1/S1 and KIR3DL2. This study more than doubles the number of rhesus macaque KIRs with defined MHC class I ligands and identifies novel interactions with Mamu-AG, -B*045, and -A1*012. These findings support overlapping, but nonredundant, patterns of ligand recognition that reflects extensive functional diversification of these receptors.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a leading cause of skin and soft tissue infections and (hospital-acquired) systemic infections. Wall teichoic acids (WTAs) are cell wall-anchored glycopolymers that are important for S. aureus nasal colonization, endocarditis, and antibiotic resistance. WTAs consist of a polymerized ribitol phosphate (RboP) chain that can be glycosylated with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) by three glycosyltransferases: TarS, TarM, and TarP. TarS and TarP modify WTA with {beta}-linked GlcNAc on the C-4 ({beta}1,4-GlcNAc) and the C-3 position ({beta}1,3-GlcNAc) of the RboP subunit, respectively, whereas TarM modifies WTA with -linked GlcNAc at the C-4 position (1,4-GlcNAc). Importantly, these WTA glycosylation patterns impact immune recognition and clearance of S. aureus. Previous studies suggest that tarS is near-universally expressed within the S. aureus population, whereas a smaller proportion co-express either tarM or tarP. To gain more insight in the presence and genetic variation of tarS, tarM, and tarP in the S. aureus population, we analyzed a collection of 25,652 S. aureus genomes within the PubMLST database. Over 99% of isolates contained tarS. Co-expression of tarS/tarM or tarS/tarP occurred in 37% and 7% of isolates, respectively, and was associated to specific S. aureus clonal complexes. We also identified 26 isolates (0.1%) that contained all three glycosyltransferase genes. At sequence level, we identified tar alleles with amino acid substitutions in critical enzymatic residues or with premature stop codons. Several tar variants were expressed in a S. aureus tar-negative strain. Analysis using specific monoclonal antibodies and human langerin showed that WTA glycosylation was severely attenuated or absent. Overall, our data provide a broad overview of the genetic diversity of the three WTA glycosyltransferases in the S. aureus population and the functional consequences for immune recognition.",

    "abstract": "Heme can serve as iron source in many environments, including the iron-poor animal host environment. The fungal pathobiont Candida albicans expresses a family of extracellular CFEM hemophores that capture heme from host proteins and transfer it across the cell wall to the cell membrane, to be endocytosed and utilized as heme or iron source. Here we identified Frp1 and Frp2, two ferric reductase (FRE)-related proteins that lack an extracellular N-terminal substrate-binding domain, as being required for hemoglobin heme utilization and for sensitivity to toxic heme analogs. Frp1/2 redistribute from the ER to the plasma membrane in the presence of hemoglobin, consistent with a direct role in heme trafficking. Expression of Frp1 with the CFEM hemophore Pga7 can promote heme utilization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well, confirming the functional interaction between these proteins. Sequence and structure comparison reveals that the CFEM hemophores are related to the FRE substrate-binding domain that is missing in Frp1/2. We conclude that Frp1/2 and the CFEM hemophores form a functional complex that evolved from ferric reductases to enable extracellular heme uptake.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota plays important roles in the bioecology of insects, including host plant adaptation and speciation. Spodoptera frugiperda has two well-established host-adapted strains with marked differences at the genetic and host plant utilization levels. We investigated whether differences in the gut microbiota would occur between the \"corn\" (CS) and \"rice\" (RS) strains of S. frugiperda when feeding on different crops. The gut microbiota of larvae fed on corn and millet was predominantly represented by Firmicutes followed by Proteobacteria, with an opposite pattern in larvae fed on cotton. No differences were observed between the CS and RS using PERMANOVA. PCoA analyses resulted in distinct bacterial clusters based on the host plant. Comparisons of strains gut microbiota at the phylum level resulted in differences only for larvae fed on cotton, but differences in the relative abundance of minor representatives at the genus level between strains were observed regardless of the food source used. We also found differences in the potential functional contribution of bacteria between the strains. In conclusion the gut microbiota of S. frugiperda is strongly modulated by the host plant while strains seemed to play a minor role in changing the abundance of members of the gut bacterial community.",

    "abstract": "objectiveThis study intends to explore the role of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in the effect of Puerarin on the proliferation, activity, and function of osteoclasts from the perspective of antioxidation.\n\nMethodsRAW264. 7 cells were divided into control group, induction group treated with 20ng/mL M-CSF and 50ng/mL RANKL, puerarin group treated with 20ng/mL M-CSF, 50ng/mL RANKL, and 50mol/L puerarin. The staining of osteoclasts before and after puerarin intervention was measured by TRAP staining and cell count. The changes of related molecules before and after puerarin intervention in osteoclasts were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and Western Blot, including TRAP, MMP-9, Cathepsin K, NFATc1, PTEN, Catalase, PI3K, AKT, P-AKT(ser473), FoxO1, P-FoxO1.\n\nResultsTRAP staining showed that puerarin inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of RAW264.7 cells into osteoclasts. The results of qRT-PCR and WB showed that compared with the control group, the gene expression of TRAP, MMP-9, cathepsin K and NFATc1 in the induction group was up-regulated, while the gene expression of Catalase was down-regulated. PTEN gene had no significant changes before and after puerarin intervention. The expression of P-AKT (ser473) and NFATc1 protein was up-regulated, while the expression of PI3K and AKT protein had no change. Compared with the induction group, the gene expression of TRAP, MMP-9, Cathepsin K, and NFATc1 in the puerarin group decreased, the gene expression of Catalase increased, the protein expression of PI3K and AKT remained unchanged, the protein expression of P-AKT (ser473), P-FoxO1 and NFATc1 decreased, and the protein expression of FoxO1 and Catalase increased.\n\nConclusionPuerarin may promote the transcriptional activity of FoxO1, increase the expression of catalase protein and exert its antioxidant activity by regulating the PI3K-AKT signal pathway, so as to inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of osteoclasts.",

    "abstract": "The excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance hypothesis posits that an imbalance between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission contributes to autism symptomatology. Whether this is due to altered GABAergic or glutamatergic functioning, or both, remains largely unknown. We integrated genetic, brain structure and brain chemistry data to investigate the relationship between E/I genetic variation and expression, glutamate concentrations and cortical thickness (CT). Participants (60 autism and 104 neurotypical controls, aged 8-13 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy for glutamate quantification in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left dorsal striatum. Genetic involvement in these regional glutamate concentration levels was investigated using competitive gene-set association and polygenic scores (PGS). Further, glutamate as well as GABA gene-set expression profiles were investigated in relation to CT. Aggregated genetic variation in the glutamate gene-set was associated with ACC but not striatal glutamate concentrations. PGS analysis, however, showed a genome-wide PGS for autism to be predictive of striatal but not ACC glutamate levels. Expression profiles of GABAergic-but not glutamatergic genes were associated with differences in cortical thickness between groups. This study showed differential involvement of aggregated glutamatergic and GABAergic genetic variation in brain structure and chemistry in autism, which suggests regional variability in E/I imbalance.",

    "abstract": "Whether the neural control of manual behaviours differs between the dominant and non-dominant hand is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine whether the level of common synaptic input to motor neurons innervating the same or different muscles differs between the dominant and the non-dominant hand. Seventeen participants performed two motor tasks with distinct mechanical requirements: an isometric pinch and an isometric rotation of a pinched dial. Each task was performed at 30% of maximum effort and was repeated with the dominant and non-dominant hand. Motor units were identified from two intrinsic (flexor digitorum interosseous and thenar) and one extrinsic muscle (flexor digitorum superficialis) from high-density surface electromyography recordings. Two complementary approaches were used to estimate common synaptic inputs. First, we calculated the coherence between groups of motor neurons from the same and from different muscles. Then, we estimated the common input for all pairs of motor neurons by correlating the low-frequency oscillations of their discharge rate. Both analyses led to the same conclusion, indicating less common synaptic input between motor neurons innervating different muscles in the dominant hand than in the non-dominant hand, which was only observed during the isometric rotation task. No differences in common input were observed between motor neurons of the same muscle. This lower level of common input could confer higher flexibility in the recruitment of motor units, and therefore, in mechanical outputs. Whether this difference between the dominant and non-dominant arm is the cause or the consequence of handedness remains to be determined.\n\nKey points- How the neural control of manual behaviours differs between the dominant and non-dominant hand remains poorly understood.\n- We decoded the spiking activities of spinal motor neurons innervating one extrinsic and two intrinsic hand muscles during isometric tasks.\n- We estimated the common synaptic input to motor neurons innervating the same or different muscles.\n- There is less common synaptic input between motor neurons innervating different muscles in the dominant than in the non-dominant hand during isometric rotation tasks.\n- No differences in common input were observed between motor neurons of the same muscle.\n- Lower level of common input could confer higher flexibility in the recruitment of motor units.",

    "abstract": "Light touch sensation begins with activation of low-threshold mechanoreceptor (LTMR) endings in the skin and propagation of their signals to the spinal cord and brainstem. We found that the clustered protocadherin gamma (Pcdhg) gene locus, which encodes 22 cell-surface homophilic binding proteins, is required in somatosensory neurons for normal behavioral reactivity to a range of tactile stimuli. Developmentally, distinct Pcdhg isoforms mediate LTMR synapse formation through neuron-neuron interactions and peripheral axonal branching through neuron-glia interactions. The Pcdhgc3 isoform mediates homophilic interactions between sensory axons and spinal cord neurons to promote synapse formation in vivo, and is sufficient to induce postsynaptic specializations in vitro. Moreover, loss of Pcdhgs and somatosensory synaptic inputs to the dorsal horn lead to fewer corticospinal synapses onto dorsal horn neurons. These findings reveal essential roles for Pcdhg isoform diversity in somatosensory neuron synapse formation, peripheral axonal branching, and step-wise assembly of central mechanosensory circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal inversions are an important form of structural variation that can affect recombination, chromosome structure and fitness. However, because inversions can be challenging to detect, the prevalence and hence significance of inversions segregating within species remains largely unknown, especially in natural populations of mammals. Here, by combining population-genomic and long-read sequencing analyses in a single, widespread species of deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), we identified 21 polymorphic inversions, which are large (1.5-43.8 Mb) and cause near complete suppression of recombination when heterozygous (0-0.03 cM/Mb). We found that inversion breakpoints frequently occur in centromeric and telomeric regions and are often flanked by long inverted repeats (0.5-50 kb), suggesting that they likely arose via ectopic recombination. By genotyping the inversions in populations across the species range, we found that the inversions are often widespread, do not harbor deleterious mutational loads, and many are likely maintained as polymorphisms by divergent selection. Comparisons of forest and prairie ecotypes of deer mice revealed 13 inversions that contribute to differentiation between populations, of which five exhibit significant associations with traits implicated in local adaptation. Together, we found that inversion polymorphisms have a significant impact on recombination, genome structure and genetic diversity in deer mice, and likely facilitate local adaptation across this species widespread range.",

    "abstract": "The  social complexity hypothesis posits that complex social systems (that entail high uncertainty) require complex communicative systems (with high vocal flexibility). In species with fission-fusion dynamics, where the fluid composition of temporary subgroups increases the uncertainty with which group members must manage their social relationships, vocal communication must be particularly flexible. This study assessed whether contact call rates vary with caller and audience characteristics in free-living spider monkeys, as well as with fission and fusion events. Adult females and immature individuals called more when in small audience settings, while audience size did not influence adult males. Adults called more when in the presence of the opposite sex, whereas immatures vocalized more in subgroups composed only by females. Females also called more when with their mature sons. We found higher call rates in periods during which fission and fusion events took place than in periods with more stable compositions and when the composition after a fission or fusion event changed from one sex to two sexes. A flexible use of contact calls allows individuals to identify themselves when they join others, particularly if they are members of the opposite sex. This socio-spatial cohesion function reduces the uncertainty about subgroup composition.",
