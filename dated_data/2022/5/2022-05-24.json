    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy in both American men and women. Most of the deaths attributed to CRC are a result of metastatic spread to the liver. In this study, colon cancer cells that highly metastasized to liver in vivo were compared to less metastatic parental cells to investigate the role for long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in CRC metastasis. The highly metastatic daughter cells (LS-3B) were found to be 63-fold more metastatic than the parental cell line (LS-PAR) in vivo. A lncRNA microarray comparing LS-PAR and LS-3B cells revealed that 104 lncRNAs had fold changes > 2.0 and an FDR < 0.05. Real time PCR mediated validation revealed many lncRNAs exhibited high fold changes such as a 60-fold increase in LOC101448202, a 20-fold increase in MRPL23-AS1 and 50-fold decreases in GNAS-AS1 and LOC101928131. In vivo metastasis differences could be recapitulated in vitro as LS-3B cells closed wounds faster than their parental LS-PAR cells. However, intestinal epithelial cancer cells with robust downregulation of MRPL23-AS1, C1QTNF1-AS1, GNAS-AS1, LINCR-0002 and LOC101448202 failed to display differences in comparison to controls in in vitro migration assays. Three of the five lncRNAs with microarray probes for currently available GEO-datasets were significantly altered in liver CRC-associated tumor biopsies as compared to the primary tumor of non-metastatic CRC. Further studies on the lncRNAs identified will better define their roles in metastasis and how they might be useful if targeted therapeutically.",

    "abstract": "The antimicrobial effect of TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) has been reliably established. However, the mechanism of this action remains unclear. Currently, according to the dominant hypothesis, it is assumed that the key destructive mechanism is the photocatalytic oxidation of cell components, and the key antimicrobial factor is the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed on the surface of TiO2 NPs as a result of photocatalysis. In this communication, for the first time, the influence of the electric field created by cationic TiO2 NPs is suggested as a key killing factor, and the key antimicrobial mechanism - the electrical breakdown of the cell membranes and the destruction of the DNA molecule under the action of this field. Here, it was shown by mathematical calculation that TiO2 NPs are able to generate an electric field with a strength sufficient for an electrical breakdown of bilayer lipid membranes, which can lead to a violation of the structure and vital functions of the cytoplasmic membrane (CPM) and to collapse of DNA molecule.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairments appear at or before motor signs in about one third of patients with Parkinsons disease (PD) and have a cumulative prevalence of roughly 80% overall. These deficits exact an unrelenting toll on patients quality and activities of daily life due in part to a lack of available treatments to ameliorate them. This study used three well-validated novel object recognition-based paradigms to explore the suitability of rats with knockout of the PTEN-induced putative kinase1 gene (Pink1) for investigating factors that induce cognitive decline in PD and for testing new ways to mitigate them. Longitudinal testing of rats from three to nine months of age revealed significant impairments in male Pink1-/- rats compared to wild type controls in Novel Object Recognition, Novel Object Location and Object-in-Place tasks. Task-specific differences in the progression of object discrimination/memory deficits across age were also seen. Finally, testing using an elevated plus maze, a tapered balance beam and a grip strength gauge showed that in all cases recognition memory deficits preceded potentially confounding impacts of gene knockout on affect or motor function. Taken together, these findings suggest that knockout of the Pink1 gene negatively impacts the brain circuits and/or neurochemical systems that support performance in object recognition tasks. Further investigations using Pink1-/-rats and object recognition memory tasks should provide new insights into the neural underpinnings of the visual recognition memory and visuospatial information processing deficits that are often seen in PD patients and accelerate the pace of discovery of better ways to treat them.",

A growing body of research has focused on using AO and MI simultaneously, termed  combined action observation and motor imagery (AOMI). The current paper includes two meta-analyses that quantify changes in corticospinal excitability and motor skill performance for AOMI compared to AO, MI and control conditions. Specifically, the first meta-analysis collated and synthesized existing motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude data from transcranial magnetic stimulation studies and the second meta-analysis collated and synthesized existing movement outcome data from behavioral studies. AOMI had a positive effect compared to control and AO but not MI conditions for both MEP amplitudes and movement outcomes. No methodological factors moderated the effects of AOMI, indicating a robust effect of AOMI across the two outcome variables. The results of the meta-analyses are discussed in relation to existing literature on motor simulation and skill acquisition, before providing viable directions for future research on this topic.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMotor imagery (MI) and action observation (AO) can be combined (AOMI)\nC_LIO_LIThis paper synthesizes neurophysiological and behavioral evidence for AOMI\nC_LIO_LIAOMI had increased corticospinal excitability compared to AO and control but not MI\nC_LIO_LIAOMI led to improved movement outcomes compared to AO and control but not MI\nC_LIO_LIThe reported effects of AOMI were maintained across all moderators\nC_LI",

It also plays an important role in the cognitive control involved in memory, supporting processes like the binding of single items into a memory representation or encoding contextual information. In the current study, we explored the link between midfrontal theta and error-related memory. To this end, we recorded EEG from 31 participants while they performed a modified Flanker task. Their memory for the errors made during the task was assessed after each experimental block, and its relationship with error-related midfrontal theta effects was investigated. We have replicated the error-related increase in midfrontal theta power, reported in previous literature. However, this error-related theta effect could not predict subsequent memory of the committed errors. Our findings add to a growing literature on the prefrontal cortex-guided control process in error monitoring and episodic memory.",

    "abstract": "To interpret the sensory environment, the brain combines ambiguous sensory measurements with context-specific prior experience. But environmental contexts can change abruptly and unpredictably, resulting in uncertainty about the current context. Here we address two questions: how should context-specific prior knowledge optimally guide the interpretation of sensory stimuli in changing environments, and do human decision-making strategies resemble this optimum? We probe these questions with a task in which subjects report the orientation of ambiguous visual stimuli that were drawn from three dynamically switching distributions, representing different environmental contexts. We derive predictions for an ideal Bayesian observer that leverages the statistical structure of the task to maximize decision accuracy and show that its decisions are biased by task context. The magnitude of this decision bias is not a fixed property of the sensory measurement but depends on the observers belief about the current context. The model therefore predicts that decision bias will grow with the reliability of the context cue, the stability of the environment, and with the number of trials since the last context switch. Analysis of human choice data validates all three predictions, providing evidence that the brain continuously updates probabilistic representations of the environment to best interpret an uncertain, ever-changing world.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe brain relies on prior knowledge to make perceptual inferences when sensory information is ambiguous. However, when the environmental context changes, the appropriate prior knowledge often changes with it. Here, we develop a Bayesian observer model to investigate how to make optimal perceptual inferences when sensory information and environmental context are both uncertain. The behavioral signature of this strategy is a context-appropriate decision bias whose strength grows with the reliability of the context cue, the stability of the environment, and with the number of decisions since the most recent change in context. We identified exactly this pattern in the behavior of human subjects performing a dynamic orientation discrimination task. Together, our results suggest that the brain continuously updates probabilistic representations of the environment to make perceptual decisions in the face of uncertainty over both sensory and contextual information.",

Here we identify a series of novel enhancers (NEs) that collaborate to configure the locus, determine transcriptional potential in over a hundred functional VH genes and their usage in V(D)J recombination. NE1 engages in a network of long-range interactions that interconnect the subTADs and the recombination center at the DHJH gene cluster. Deletion of NE1 alters discrete chromatin loops, higher order locus conformation, locus-wide VH gene transcription and regional V gene utilization that is linked to a greatly reduced splenic B1 B cell compartment. NE1 blocks long-range loop extrusion that in turn contributes to locus contraction and determines the proximity of distant VH genes to the recombination center. NE1 is a critical architectural element that coordinates chromatin conformational states that favor VH gene transcription or V(D)J rearrangement.",

    "abstract": "Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is a minimally invasive therapy for heart arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation (A-fib), which creates lesions using an electric current to isolate the heart from abnormal electrical signals. However, conventional RF procedures do not involve intraoperative monitoring of the area and extent of ablation-induced necrosis, making the assessment of the procedure completeness challenging. Previous studies have suggested that spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) imaging is capable of differentiating ablated tissue from its non-ablated counterpart based on PA spectrum variation. Here, we aim to demonstrate the applicability of sPA imaging in an in vivo environment, where the cardiac motion presents, and introduce a framework for mapping the necrotic lesion using cardiac-gated sPA imaging. We computed the degree of necrosis, or necrotic extent (NE), by dividing the quantified ablated tissue contrast by the total contrast from both ablated and non-ablated tissues, visualizing it as continuous colormap to highlight the necrotic area and extent. To compensate for tissue motion during the cardiac cycle, we applied the cardiac-gating on sPA data, based on the image similarity. The in vivo validation of the concept was conducted in a swine model. As a result, the ablation-induced necrotic lesion at the surface of the beating heart was successfully depicted throughout the cardiac cycle through cardiac-gated sPA (CG-sPA) imaging. The results suggest that the introduced CG-sPA imaging system has great potential to be incorporated into clinical workflow to guide ablation procedures intraoperatively.",

    "abstract": "There is significant long-term morbidity and mortality associated with the treatment of childhood cancer, and the risk of these effects continues to increase years after completion of therapy. Among childhood cancer survivors the cumulative incidence of a chronic health condition is 99% within 50 years of the original cancer diagnosis. There is a high risk for severe, disabling, or life-threatening chronic condition caused by the chemotherapy used to treat the initial malignancy. Current standards for determining chemotherapy dosage to treat solid tumor malignancies of pediatric patients is based on several factors, including the patients surface area, age, weight, and height. To reduce the long-term effects of chemotherapy in pediatric patients our group is focused on developing novel local drug delivery systems to treat solid tumors and minimize systemic effects. The aim of the current study is to develop an in vitro method to quantify drug diffusion through tumor tissue that will allow us to optimize the dose required to treat solid tumor malignancies in vivo. We hope by modeling the significant parameters that influence drug penetration of chemotherapy drugs, we can facilitate the development of innovative drug delivery methods and more effective administration of anticancer agents to better treat pediatric malignancies and improve both short-term and long-term outcomes for childhood cancer.",

    "abstract": "Changes in vocal acoustic patterns are known to correlate with the occurrence of several diseases and syndromes, many of which do not directly affect the structures or processes that control voice production. In such cases, it is difficult to support the existence of correlated changes in voice. This paper presents a methodology for identifying potential genomic bases for such correlations, by finding links between specific genes involved in the conditions under study, and those involved in voice, speech or language generation. Syndromes associated with chromosomal microdeletions are examined as an illustrative case, with focus on their linkage to the FOXP2 gene which has been strongly implicated in speech and language disorders. A novel path-finding graph algorithm to detect pathway chains that connect the the former to the latter is proposed. Statistical analysis of ensembles of \"voice\" chains detected by this algorithm indicates that they are predictive of speech phenotypes for the syndromes. Algorithmic findings are validated against clinical findings in the literature pertaining to the actual speech phenotypes that have been found to be associated with these syndromes. This methodology may also potentially be used to predict the existence of voice biomarkers in naive cases where the existence of voice biomarkers has not already been established.",

EPCOT is the first framework proposed to predict all of these genomic modalities and performs well in individual modality prediction, which is also generalizable to new cell and tissue types. EPCOT also maps from DNA sequence and chromatin accessibility profiles to generic representations which are generalizable across different modalities. Interpreting EPCOT model also provides biological insights including mapping between different genomic modalities, identifying TF sequence binding patterns, and analyzing cell-type specific TF impacts on enhancer activity.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the consequences of protein coding mutations is important for many applications in biology and medicine. The vast number of possible mutations across species makes comprehensive experimental characterisation impossible, even with recent high-throughput techniques, which means computationally predicting the consequences of variation is essential for many analyses. Previous variant effect prediction (VEP) tools, generally based on evolutionary conservation and protein structure, are often computationally intensive, making them difficult to scale and limiting potential applications. Recent developments in deep learning techniques, including protein language models, and biological data scale have led to a new generation of predictors. These models have improved prediction performance but are still often intensive to run because of slow training steps, hardware requirements and large model sizes. In this work we introduce a new highly scalable deep learning architecture, Sequence UNET, that classifies and predicts variant frequency directly from protein sequence. This model learns to build representations of protein sequence features at a range of scales using a fully convolutional U-shaped compression/expansion architecture. We show that it can generalise to pathogenicity prediction, achieving comparable performance on ClinVar to methods including EVE and ESM-1b at greatly reduced computational cost. We further demonstrate its scalability by analysing the consequences of 8.3 billion variants in 904,134 proteins detected in a large-scale proteomics analysis, showing a link between conservation and protein abundance. Sequence UNET can be run on modest hardware through an easy to use Python package.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies have shown clinical success in the treatment of a number of neurological illnesses, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and Parkinsons disease. An emerging strategy for increasing the efficacy of DBS therapies is to develop closed-loop, adaptive DBS systems that can sense biomarkers associated with particular symptoms and in response, adjust DBS parameters in realtime. The development of such systems requires extensive analysis of the underlying neural signals while DBS is on, so that candidate biomarkers can be identified and the effects of varying the DBS parameters can be better understood. However, DBS creates high amplitude, high frequency stimulation artifacts that prevent the underlying neural signals and thus the biological mechanisms underlying DBS from being analyzed. Additionally, DBS devices often require low sampling rates, which alias the artifact frequency, and rely on wireless data transmission methods that can create signal recordings with missing data of unknown length. Thus, traditional artifact removal methods cannot be applied to this setting. We present a novel periodic artifact removal algorithm for DBS applications that can accurately remove stimulation artifacts in the presence of missing data and in some cases where the stimulation frequency exceeds the Nyquist frequency. The numerical examples suggest that, if implemented on dedicated hardware, this algorithm has the potential to be used in embedded closed-loop DBS therapies to remove DBS stimulation artifacts and hence, to aid in the discovery of candidate biomarkers in real-time. Code for our proposed algorithm is publicly available on Github.",

    "abstract": "The interferential current (IFC) therapy is a noninvasive electrical neurostimulation technique intended to activate deep neurons using surface electrodes. In IFC, two independent kilohertz-frequency currents purportedly intersect where an interference field is generated. However, the effects of IFC on neurons within and outside the interference field are not completely understood, and it is unclear whether this technique can reliable activate deep target neurons without side effects. In recent years, realistic computational models of IFC have been introduced to quantify the effects of IFC on brain cells, but they are often complex and computationally costly. Here, we introduce a simplified model of IFC based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model of a neuron. By considering a modified averaging method, we obtain a non-autonomous approximated system, with explicit representation of relevant IFC parameters. For this approximated system we determine conditions under which it reliably approximates the complete FHN system under IFC stimulation, and we mathematically prove its ability to predict nonspiking states. In addition, we perform numerical simulations that show that the interference effect is observed only for a narrow set of IFC parameters and, in particular, for a beat frequency no higher than about 100 [Hz]. Our novel model tailored to the IFC technique contributes to the understanding of neurostimulation modalities using this type of signals, and can have implications in the design of noninvasive electrical stimulation therapies.",

This approach uncovered cell subpopulation-specific dysregulation in COVID-19 across disease course and severity and identified a severity-associated activation of the receptor for advanced glycation endproduct (RAGE) pathway in monocytes. In vitro experiments confirmed that monocytes bind the SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD via RAGE and that RAGE-Spike interactions drive monocyte infection.

In many biomedical applications, such as in the study of infectious diseases, cell development, and tumorgenesis, several distinct populations share evolutionary history and therefore become dependent. The inference of such dependence is a highly important, yet a challenging problem. With advances in sequencing technologies, we are well positioned to exploit the wealth of high-resolution biological data for tackling this problem. Here, we present a novel probabilistic model that relies on jointly distributed Markov random fields. We use this model to estimate past population dynamics of dependent populations and to quantify their degree of dependence. An essential feature of our approach is the ability to track the time-varying association between the populations while making minimal assumptions on their functional shapes via Markov random field priors. We provide nonparametric estimators, extensions of our base model that integrate multiple data sources, and fast scalable inference algorithms. We test our method using simulated data under various dependent population histories and demonstrate the utility of our model in shedding light on evolutionary histories of different variants of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The nucleocapsid (N) protein of coronaviruses is responsible for compaction of the [~]30-kb RNA genome in the [~]100-nm virion. Cryo-electron tomography suggests that each virion contains 35-40 viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes, or ribonucleosomes, arrayed along the genome. There is, however, little mechanistic understanding of the vRNP complex. Here, we show that N protein, when combined with viral RNA fragments in vitro, forms cylindrical 15-nm particles similar to the vRNP structures observed within coronavirus virions. These vRNPs form in the presence of stem-loop-containing RNA and depend on regions of N protein that promote protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation of N protein in its disordered serine/arginine (SR) region weakens these interactions and disrupts vRNP assembly. We propose that unmodified N binds stem-loop-rich regions in genomic RNA to form compact vRNP complexes within the nucleocapsid, while phosphorylated N maintains uncompacted viral RNA to promote the proteins transcriptional function.",

Unfortunately, a significant portion of these proteins are considered \"undruggable\" by standard small molecule-based approaches, largely due to their disordered nature and instability. Designing functional peptides to undruggable targets, either as standalone binders or fusions to effector domains, thus presents a unique opportunity for therapeutic intervention. In this work, we adapt recent models for contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to devise a unified, sequence-based framework to design target-specific peptides. Furthermore, by leveraging known experimental binding proteins as scaffolds, we create a streamlined inference pipeline, termed Cut&CLIP, that efficiently selects peptides for downstream screening. Finally, we experimentally fuse candidate peptides to E3 ubiquitin ligase domains and demonstrate robust intracellular degradation of pathogenic protein targets in human cells, motivating further development of our technology for future clinical translation.",

To identify molecular and cellular mechanisms while retaining the appropriate genetic background, we generated induced excitatory glutamatergic neurons (iN) from iPSCs derived from four AUD-diagnosed subjects with KCNJ6 variants ( Affected: AF) and four control subjects without variants ( Unaffected: UN). Neurons were analyzed for changes in gene expression, morphology, excitability and physiological properties. Single cell RNA sequencing suggests that KCNJ6 AF variant neurons have altered patterns of synaptic transmission and cell projection morphogenesis. Results confirm that AF neurons express lower levels of GIRK2, have greater neurite area, and elevated excitability. Interestingly, exposure to intoxicating concentrations of ethanol induces GIRK2 expression and reverses functional effects in AF neurons. Ectopic overexpression of GIRK2 alone mimics the effect of ethanol to normalize induced excitability. We conclude that KCNJ6 variants decrease GIRK2 expression and increase excitability and that this effect can be minimized or reduced with ethanol.",

These pathogens can form persister cells, which are transiently tolerant to bactericidal antibiotics, making them extremely dangerous. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of proton motive force (PMF) inhibitors at killing bacterial cells; however, whether these agents can launch a new treatment strategy to eliminate persister cells mandates further investigation. Here, using known PMF inhibitors and two different MRSA isolates, we showed that antipersister potency of PMF inhibitors seemed to correlate with their ability to disrupt PMF and permeabilize cell membranes. By screening a small chemical library to verify this correlation, we identified a subset of chemicals (including nordihydroguaiaretic acid, gossypol, trifluoperazine, and amitriptyline) that strongly disrupted PMF in MRSA cells by dissipating either the transmembrane electric potential ({Delta}{Psi}) or the proton gradient ({Delta}pH). These drugs robustly permeabilized cell membranes and reduced persister levels below the limit of detection. Overall, our study further highlights the importance of cellular PMF as a target for designing new antipersister therapeutics.",

Epidemiological studies have revealed extensive disparities in the incidence and severity of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) between males and females. It is recently hypothesized that there might also be a nasal microbiome axis contributing to the observed sex disparities, but without evidence. In this work, we study the nasal microbiome of healthy young adults in, as of today, the largest cohort based on deep shot-gun metagenomic sequencing. We mainly focus on the bacteriome, but also integrate the mycobiome to get a more holistic perspective. De novo assembly is performed to catalog the nasal bacterial colonizers/residents, which also identify and therefore account for uncharacterized components of the community. The bacteriome is then profiled based on the non-redundant metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) catalog constructed therefrom. Unsupervised clustering reveals clearly separable structural patterns in the nasal microbiome between the two sexes. Following this link, we systematically evaluate sex differences for the first time and reveal extensive sex-specific features in the nasal microbiome composition. More importantly, through network analyses, we capture markedly higher ecological stability and antagonistic potentials in the nasal microbiome of females than that of males. The analysis of the keystone bacteria of the communities reveal that the sex-dependent evolutionary characteristics might have contributed to this difference.\n\nHighlightsThe non-redundant nasal bacterial MAGs catalog constructed from ultra-deeply sequenced metagenomic data provides a valuable resource.\n\nIntegrating nasal bacteriome and mycobiome data provides a more holistic perspective for the understudied human nasal microbiome.\n\nUnsupervised clustering helps uncover extensive sex differences in the nasal microbiome compositions.\n\nNetwork analyses capture markedly higher ecological stability and antagonistic potentials in the nasal microbiome of females than that of males.\n\nSex-dependent genetic evolutionary forces play a role in the shaping of keystones in the nasal microbial community.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA is regularly found in the blood of patients with EBV associated diseases and occasionally in healthy individuals. However, EBV infected primary B-lymphocytes have not yet been detected using scRNA seq. Here, we screened the viral transcriptome in single cell RNA sequencing datasets from peripheral blood to identify virus infected cells. Whereas EBV RNA was detected in an immunocompromised patient, EBV associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma and multiple sclerosis samples did not display any levels of circulating EBV RNA. We further screened whole-blood samples from a cohort of immunosuppressed patients for viral transcripts using a custom enhanced RT-qPCR panel and detected latency programs dominated by noncoding RNAs (EBERs and RPMS1). To explore the interplay between the EBV and the host-cell transcriptome profile, we used enriched B-lymphocytes from a splenectomy patient with 30% EBER positivity estimated by in situ hybridization and performed 5 single-cell RNA sequencing with paired VDJ profiling. The EBV expression pattern of the patients B-lymphocytes confirmed the RT-qPCR assay with RPMS1 and LMP-1/BNLF2a/b significantly dominating the sequenced EBV polyadenylated RNA. A comparison between the expression profile of EBV positive B-lymphocytes and healthy controls B-lymphocytes revealed the upregulation in genes involved in cell population proliferation when infected with EBV. This is further supported by a measurable polyclonal expansion in the patient, as compared to a control, emphasizing EBVs role in a host-cells tendency for cellular expansion. However, when contrasting to cells that have undergone malignant transformation, the primary EBV infected cells display a rather dissimilar expression profile, even to cells that are supposed to simulate primary EBV infection (I.e. Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines). This implies that during primary infection of EBV, the host-cell enters a state of premalignancy rather than a complete oncogenic transformation at the initial time of infection",

    "abstract": "Bacterial regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) have been implicated in the regulation of numerous metabolic pathways. In most of these studies, sRNA-dependent regulation of mRNAs or proteins of enzymes in metabolic pathways has been predicted to affect the metabolism of these bacteria. However, only in very few cases has the role in metabolism been demonstrated. We performed here a combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis to define the regulon of the sibling sRNAs NgncR_162 and NgncR_163 and their impact on the metabolism of the major human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae. These sRNA have previously been shown to control genes of the citric acid and methylcitrate cycle by post-transcriptional negative regulation. By transcriptome analysis we expand the NgncR_162/163 regulon by several new members and provide evidence that the sibling sRNAs act as both negative and positive regulators of target gene expression. Newly identified NgncR_162/163 targets are mostly involved in transport processes, especially the uptake of glycine, branched chain amino acids and phenylalanine. NgncR_162/163 also play key roles in the control of serine-glycine metabolism and hence probably affect biosynthesis of nucleotides, vitamins and other amino acids via the supply of C1-units. Metabolic flux analysis demonstrated a bipartite metabolism with glucose degradation providing intermediates for anabolic pathways, while energy metabolism via the citric acid cycle is mainly driven by amino acids, which feed into the cycle. Thus, by combined RNA-seq and metabolomics we significantly extended the regulon of NgncR_162/163 and demonstrate their role in the regulation of central metabolic pathways of the gonococcus.\n\nImportanceNeisseria gonorrhoeae is a major human pathogen which infects more than 100 million people every year. An alarming development is the emergence of gonococcal strains resistant against virtually all of the antibiotics used for their treatment. Despite the medical importance and the vanishing treatment options of gonococcal infections, the bacterial metabolism and its regulation is only ill defined until today. We investigate here the regulation of the gonococcal metabolism by two previously studied sRNAs, NgncR_162/163 using RNA-seq and metabolomics. The results provided in this study demonstrate the regulation of transport processes and metabolic pathways involved in the biosynthesis of nucleotides, vitamins and amino acids by NgncR_162/163. Combined transcriptome and metabolome analyses provide a thus far unreached depth in the regulation of metabolic pathways by the neisserial sibling sRNAs and may therefore also be suitable for functional analysis of a growing number of other bacterial metabolic sRNA regulators.",

    "abstract": "The ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is a conserved but highly unstable multi-gene locus that codes for the RNA components of the ribosome (rRNA). Despite being essential for protein translation and survival, rRNA gene-copy numbers fluctuate frequently. Here, we describe a novel rDNA intermediate that may be involved in these copy-number changes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two-dimensional gel analyses revealed a structure that includes a large single-stranded tail and arises from the promoter of the 35S rRNA gene. Formation of this intermediate is unaffected by reduced 35S transcription but relies on topoisomerase I (Top1). Unexpectedly, intermediate formation is also independent of S phase or the rDNA-instability factor Fob1, even though Fob1 is mediates the major peak of Top1 cleavage complexes in the rDNA. Indeed, we find that the known rDNA instability phenotypes of top1 mutants, including increased formation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles, elevated genetic marker loss, and instability of critically short rDNA arrays, are also largely independent of Fob1. We therefore speculate that failure to form this intermediate leads to rDNA instability in top1 mutants.",

    "abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a modified nucleotide found in mRNA, ribosome RNA (rRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). m6A in mRNA has important roles in regulating mRNA stability, splicing, and other processes. Numerous studies have described m6A as a dynamic modification using mass spectrometry-based quantification of m6A in mRNA samples prepared from different cellular conditions. However, these results have been questioned based on the finding that the mRNA purification protocols often result in varying levels of rRNA contamination. Additionally, mRNA purification protocols disproportionately enrich for the 3 ends of mRNA, a region that is enriched in m6A. To address these problems, we developed the Phospho-tag m6A assay, a highly efficient method for quantifying m6A specifically from mRNA. In this assay, a series of selective RNase digestion steps is performed, which results in m6A from rRNA and snRNA being liberated as m6A monophosphate, while m6A from mRNA is mostly liberated as m6A nucleoside. m6A levels are normalized to transcript levels, using m7G monophosphate liberated by yDcpS decapping enzyme as a surrogate for mRNA levels. Notably, this approach uses total cellular RNA, rather than purified mRNA, which simplifies the steps for m6A detection and overcomes the 3-end biases associated with mRNA purification. Overall, the Phospho-tag m6A provides a simple and efficient method for quantification of mRNA-derived m6A from total RNA samples.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionSkeletal muscle wasting is a common complication of chronic kidney disease which leads to a loss of muscle function. The pathogenesis of skeletal muscle wasting is incompletely understood, which is preventing the development of targeted therapeutics. Recent evidence implicates miRNAs in the of skeletal muscle wasting. Our aim was to firstly examine miRNA profiles of CKD human skeletal muscle for the identification of aberrant expression patterns compared to a healthy control (HC) cohort, and secondly, investigate the role these miRNAs may play in inducing or promoting skeletal muscle atrophy using a novel human primary skeletal muscle cell model of CKD skeletal muscle.\n\nMethodsFor the comparison between CKD and HC populations, skeletal muscle biopsies were collected from the vastus lateralis of n=15 non-dialysis dependent CKD patients stage 3b-5 CKD patients, and n=15 healthy controls matched for age, gender and physical activity. n=5 biopsies from each group underwent next generation sequencing to obtain complete microRNA profiles in CKD vs HC cohorts, which were then validated in a separate cohort by PCR (N=10 in each group). A causative role in muscle wasting was determined by transfection of key microRNAs into a primary culture model of CKD skeletal muscle and changes in protein degradation determined by L-[3H]- phenylalanine release into the media.\n\nResultsNext Generation Sequencing identified differential expression of 16 miRNAs in skeletal muscle of CKD patients versus controls, and PCR validation confirmed miRNA-148a-3p expression was significantly decreased in CKD patients. The reduced miRNA-148a-3p expression was also maintained in the primary culture model. Upon overexpression of miRNA-148a-3p in CKD myotubes, protein degradation rates were decreased non-significantly (p=0.28) by 16.3% compared to un-transfected CKD cells.\n\nConclusionCKD was associated with a significant reduction in miRNA-148a-3p expression in skeletal muscle compared to non-CKD controls which was retained in our in vitro model. Overexpression of miRNA-148a-3p in primary skeletal myotubes non-significantly decreased muscle protein degradation by 16.3%. In order to determine the importance of miRNA-148a-regulation of protein degradation, a deeper understanding of miRNA-148a-3p targets and their associated pathways with respect to those dysregulated in skeletal muscle wasting is required.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing is an RNA processing used by the cell to increase its protein diversity and genome plasticity through generation of several transcripts from the same gene. It affects the vast majority of biological processes, from stem cell differentiation to cell metabolism. However, tools to properly study the role of a specific splice variant are still missing. With the discovery of the bacterial CRISPR system, a new era in nucleic acid editing has emerged. RNA-directed CRISPR/Cas13 RNAses were recently shown to efficiently target the RNA with higher specificity than Cas9 to the DNA. In this work, we are taking advantage of the catalytic dead mutant dCas13 family member dCasRx to edit alternative splicing patterns in a physiological context. Thanks to our new strategy, isoform-switching splicing changes are easily obtained at endogenous genes without impacting overall gene expression levels. Moreover, we propose a new application for this dCasRx splicing editing system to identify the key regulatory elements involved in the alternative splicing of a given gene. This new approach will increase the RNA toolkit to properly understand the biological impact and regulatory mechanisms of alternative splicing in a given biological process or pathological scenario.",

Although various models of regulation have been proposed (e.g., loop extrusion), how cohesin and related factors collectively or individually regulate the hierarchical chromatin structure and gene expression remains unclear. In this study, we have depleted cohesin and related factors and then conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the resulting 3D genome, transcriptome and epigenome data. We observed substantial variation in depletion effects among factors at topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries and on interTAD interactions, which were partly related to epigenomic status. Gene expression changes were highly correlated with direct cohesin binding and gain of TAD boundaries than with the loss of boundaries. Our results suggested that cohesin positively regulates gene expression, whereas other mechanisms (e.g., cohesin turnover and acetylation) add to the diversity of this pattern of dysregulation. Moreover, cohesin was broadly enriched in active compartment A, but not in compartment B, which were retained even after CTCF depletion. Our rich dataset and the subsequent data-driven analysis support the context-specific regulation of chromatin folding by cohesin and related factors.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase is best known for its role in the maintenance of telomere length and its implications for ageing and cancer. The mechanisms, kinetics and tissue-specificity underlying the protective or deleterious mechanisms of telomerase, however, remain largely unknown. Here, we sought to determine the telomerase-dependent and -independent transcriptomic changes with ageing, in the gut and brain, as examples of high and low proliferative tissues, respectively. We hypothesised this could shed light on common telomerase-dependent and -independent therapeutic targets aimed at preventing or ameliorating age-associated dysfunction in both tissues. For this, we used the zebrafish model which, similarly to humans, depends on telomerase for health-and lifespan. We performed whole tissue RNA sequencing of gut and brain, in naturally aged zebrafish alongside prematurely aged telomerase null mutants (tert-/-), throughout their lifespan. Our study highlights stem cell exhaustion as the first main hallmark of ageing to be de-regulated in WT zebrafish gut and brain. Towards the end of life, altered intercellular communication becomes the main hallmark of ageing de-regulated in both gut and brain, and this is accelerated in both tissues, in the absence of telomerase. Finally, we identify 7 key gene changes common between the gut and brain at the early stages of ageing, highlighting potential early intervention therapeutic targets for preventing age-associated dysfunction in both tissues.",

    "abstract": "The TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factor forms a transcription co-activation complex with the key downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, YAP/TAZ. TEAD-YAP controls the expression of Hippo-responsive genes involved in cell proliferation, development, and tumorigenesis. Hyperactivation of TEAD-YAP activities is observed in many human cancers, and is associated with cancer cell proliferation, survival and immune evasion. Therefore, targeting the TEAD-YAP complex has emerged as an attractive therapeutic approach. We previously reported that the mammalian TEAD transcription factors (TEAD1-4) possess auto-palmitoylation activities and contain an evolutionarily conserved palmitate-binding pocket (PBP), which allows small molecule modulation. Since then, several reversible and irreversible inhibitors have been reported by binding to PBP. Here, we report a new class of TEAD inhibitors with a novel binding mode. Representative analog TM2 shows potent inhibition of TEAD auto-palmitoylation both in vitro and in cells. Surprisingly, the co-crystal structure of the human TEAD2 YAP-binding domain (YBD) in complex with TM2 reveals that TM2 adopts an unexpected binding mode by occupying not only the hydrophobic PBP, but also a new side binding pocket formed by hydrophilic residues. RNA-seq analysis shows that TM2 potently and specifically suppresses TEAD-YAP transcriptional activities. Consistently, TM2 exhibits strong anti-proliferation effects as a single agent or in combination with a MEK inhibitor in YAP-dependent cancer cells. These findings establish TM2 as a promising small molecule inhibitor against TEAD-YAP activities and provide new insights for designing novel TEAD inhibitors with enhanced selectivity and potency.",

In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanism of porcine placenta extract-induced ceramide synthase 3 upregulation. PPE enhanced the expression of ceramide synthase 3 at both the mRNA and protein levels in HaCaT cells. Moreover, porcine placenta extract-induced ceramide synthase3 upregulation was suppressed by the Akt inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of Akt in the underlying mechanism. As the PI3K inhibitor did not affect porcine placenta extract-induced ceramide synthase 3 upregulation, the factors upstream of Akt were estimated. Inhibition and small interfering RNA experiments demonstrated that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors {delta} (PPAR {delta}) and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) are involved in the phosphorylation of Akt. Next, we explored the factors downstream of Akt and found that porcine placenta extract induced phosphorylation of the STAT3 while porcine placenta extract-induced upregulation of ceramide synthase 3 was significantly suppressed by the inhibitor of the mTOR, suggesting that the mTOR/STAT3 pathway is involved in the downstream of Akt.

This activity dependence was shared between Cyclin A- and Cyclin B-CDK1. Cks1 has a proteome-wide role as an enhancer of multisite CDK1 phosphorylation.

    "abstract": "Detecting temperature is crucial for the survival of living organisms. Though the thermo transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) channels, such as TRPV1 or TRPM8, have been identified as prototypic heat or cold sensors, respectively, how they detect temperature remains elusive. Here we first identified groups of clustered residues in these channels that undergo burial/exposure conformational rearrangements during temperature activation by analyzing available protein structures or hydroxyl radical footprinting-mass spectroscopy (HRF-MS). By systematically perturbing water-protein interactions at these residues, we found that the temperature sensitivity in these channels were modulated in accordance with the sidechain hydrophobicity. The changes in energy associated with changes in water-protein interactions were sufficient for thermo activation. Therefore, our study has established that the water-protein interactions as a common mechanism underlying temperature sensing in TRPM8 and TRPV1.",

    "abstract": "New therapies that allow natural healing processes are required. Such as the endogenous peptide called Angiotensin-(1-7), a safe and eff e drug, which is able to re-balance the Renin-Angiotensin system affected during several pathologies, including the new COVID-19; cardiovascular, renal, and pulmonary disease; diabetes; neuropathic pain; Alzheimer and cancer. However, one of the limiting factors for its application is its unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile. In this work, we propose the coupling of Angiotensin-(1-7) to PAMAM dendrimers in order to evaluate the capacity of the nanocarrier to improve isolated peptide features and to gain insight into the structural as well as the energetic basis of its molecular binding. The In Silico tests were performed in acidic and neutral pH conditions as well as amino-terminated and hydroxyl-terminated PAMAM dendrimers. High-rigor computational approaches, such as molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations were used. We found that, at neutral pH, PAMAM dendrimers with both terminal types are able to interact stably with 3 Angioteinsin-(1-7) peptides through ASP1, TYR4 and PRO7 key aminoacids, however, there are some differences in the binding sites of the peptides. In general, they bind on the surface in the case of the hydroxyl-terminated compact dendrimer and in the internal zone in the case of the amino-terminated open dendrimer. At acidic pH, PAMAM dendrimers with both terminal groups are still able to interact with peptides either internalized or in its periphery, however, the number of contacts, the percentage of coverage and the number of HBs are lesser than at neutral pH, suggesting a state for peptide release. In summary, amino-terminated PAMAM dendrimer showed slightly better features to bind, load and protect Angiotensin-(1-7) peptides.",

Here we describe the analysis of [~]400 {micro}s all-atom ensemble molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the TMEM16F dimer that revealed an allosteric mechanism leading to an open-groove state of the protein that is competent for lipid scrambling. The grove opens into a continuous hydrophilic conduit that is highly similar in structure to that seen in other activated scramblases. The allosteric pathway connects this opening to an observed destabilization of the Ca2+ ion bound at the distal site near the dimer interface, to the dynamics of specific protein regions that produces the open-groove state seen in our MD simulations to scramble phospholipids.",

    "abstract": "1.BackgroundIncreased waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is associated with increased mortality and risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The TBX15-WARS2 locus has consistently been associated with increased WHR. Previous study of the hypomorphic Wars2V117L/V117L mouse model found phenotypes including severely reduced fat mass, and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning, suggesting Wars2 could be a potential modulator of fat distribution and WAT browning.\n\nMethodsTo test for differences in browning induction across different adipose depots of Wars2V117L/V117L mice, we measured multiple browning markers of a 4-month old chow-fed cohort in subcutaneous and visceral WAT and brown adipose tissue (BAT). To explain previously observed fat mass loss, we also tested for the upregulation of plasma mitokines FGF21 and GDF15 and for differences in food intake in the same cohort. Finally, to test for diet-associated differences in fat distribution, we placed Wars2V117L/V117L mice on low-fat or high-fat diet (LFD, HFD) and assessed their body composition by Echo-MRI and compared terminal adipose depot weights at 6 months of age.\n\nResultsThe chow-fed Wars2V117L/V117L mice showed more changes in WAT browning marker gene expression in the subcutaneous inguinal WAT depot (iWAT) than in the visceral gonadal WAT depot (gWAT). These mice also demonstrated reduced food intake and elevated plasma FGF21 and GDF15, and mRNA from heart and BAT. When exposed to HFD, the Wars2V117L/V117L mice showed resistance to diet-induced obesity and a male and HFD-specific reduction of gWAT : iWAT ratio.\n\nConclusionSevere reduction of Wars2 gene function causes a systemic phenotype which leads to upregulation of FGF21 and GDF15, resulting in reduced food intake and depot-specific changes in browning and fat mass.",

    "abstract": "The hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) is critical to breathing and thus oxygen supply to the body and is primarily mediated by the carotid bodies. Here we reveal that carotid body afferent discharge during hypoxia and hypercapnia is determined by the expression of Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1), the principal kinase that activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) during metabolic stresses. Conversely, conditional deletion in catecholaminergic cells of AMPK had no effect on carotid body responses to hypoxia or hypercapnia. By contrast, the HVR was attenuated by LKB1 and AMPK deletion. However, in LKB1 knockouts hypoxia evoked hypoventilation, apnoea and Cheyne-Stokes-like breathing, while only hypoventilation and apnoea were observed after AMPK deletion. We therefore identify LKB1 as an essential regulator of carotid body chemosensing and uncover a divergence in dependency on LKB1 and AMPK between the carotid body on one hand and the HVR on the other.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages kill bacteria by osmotic lysis towards the end of the lytic cycle. In the case of Gram-positive bacteria, peptidoglycan-degrading endolysins released at the end of infection cycle cause explosive cell lysis not only of the infected host, but can also attack non-infected bystander cells. Here, we show that in osmotically stabilized environments, Listeria monocytogenes can evade phage predation by transient conversion to a cell wall-deficient L-form state. This L-form escape is triggered by endolysins disintegrating the cell wall from without, leading to turgor-driven extrusion of wall-deficient, yet viable L-form cells. Remarkably, in absence of phage predation, we show that L-forms can quickly revert to the walled state. These findings suggest that L-form conversion represents a population-level persistence mechanism to evade complete eradication by phage attack. Importantly, we also demonstrate phage-mediated L-form switching of the urinary tract pathogen Enterococcus faecalis in human urine, which underscores that this escape route may be widespread and has important implications for phage- and endolysin-based therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "The neutral amino acid glutamine plays a central role in TGF-{beta}-induced myofibroblast activation and differentiation. Cells take up glutamine mainly through a transporter expressed on the cell surface known as solute carrier SLC1A5. In this current work, we demonstrated that profibrotic actions of TGF-{beta} are mediated, at least in part, through a metabolic maladaptation of SLC1A5 and targeting SLC1A5 abrogates multiple facets of fibroblast activation. This approach could thus represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat fibroproliferative diseases. We found that SLC1A5 was highly expressed in fibrotic lung fibroblasts and fibroblasts isolated from IPF lungs. The expression of profibrotic targets, cell migration, and anchorage independent growth by TGF-{beta} required the activity of SLC1A5. Loss or inhibition of SLC1A5 function enhanced fibroblast susceptibility to autophagy, suppressed mTOR, HIF, Myc signaling, and impaired mitochondrial function, ATP production and glycolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of SLC1A5 by small molecule inhibitor V-9302 shifted fibroblast transcriptional profiles from profibrotic to fibrosis resolving, and attenuated fibrosis in a bleomycin treated mouse model of lung fibrosis. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate the utility of a pharmacological inhibitor of glutamine transport in fibrosis, laying a framework for new paradigm-shifting therapies targeting cellular metabolism for this devastating disease.",

Yet, past brain-wide association studies, particularly using large developmental samples, limit their focus to the coarse connectome to understand the neural underpinnings of individual differences in cognition. We examine resting-state fMRI (n=1,115 children, 389 twin pairs) and use hyperalignment to access reliable information in the fine-scale connectome. Though individual differences in the fine-scale connectome are more reliable than those in the coarse-scale, they are less heritable. Further, the alignment and scale of connectomes influence their ability to predict behavior: both scales equally predict more heritable cognitive traits, but the fine-scale connectome predicts less heritable traits significantly better than the coarse-scale.",

However, MSN subtype-specific signaling mechanisms that mediate mGluR5-dependent adaptations underlying excessive grooming are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the MSN subtype-specific roles of the striatal signaling hub protein, spinophilin, in mediating repetitive motor dysfunction associated with mGluR5 function.\n\nMethodsQuantitative proteomics and immunoblotting were utilized to identify how spinophilin impacts mGluR5 phosphorylation and protein interaction changes. Plasticity and repetitive motor dysfunction associated with mGluR5 action was measured using our novel conditional spinophilin mouse model that had spinophilin knocked out from striatal dMSNs or/and iMSNs.\n\nResultsLoss of spinophilin only in iMSNs decreased performance of a novel motor repertoire, but loss of spinophilin in either MSN subtype abrogated striatal plasticity associated with mGluR5 function and prevented excessive grooming caused by SAPAP3 knockout mice and treatment with the mGluR5-specific positive allosteric modulator (VU0360172) without impacting locomotion-relevant behavior. Biochemically, we determined spinophilins protein interaction correlates with grooming behavior and loss of spinophilin shifts mGluR5 interactions from lipid-raft associated proteins toward postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins implicated in psychiatric disorders.\n\nConclusionsThese results identify spinophilin as a novel striatal signaling hub molecule in MSNs that cell subtype-specifically mediates behavioral, functional, and molecular adaptations associated with repetitive motor dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases represent a serious and ongoing threat to humans. Most emerging viruses are maintained in stable relationships with other species of animals, and emergence within the human population results from cross-species transmission. Therefore, if we want to be prepared for the next emerging virus, we need to broadly characterize the diversity and ecology of viruses currently infecting other animals (i.e., the animal virosphere). High-throughput metagenomic sequencing has accelerated the pace of virus discovery. However, molecular assays can only detect active viral infections and only if virus is present within the sampled fluid or tissue at the time of collection. In contrast, serological assays measure long-lived antibody responses to infections, which can be detected within the blood, regardless of the infected tissues. Therefore, serological assays can provide a complementary approach to understanding the circulation of viruses, and while serological assays have historically been limited in scope, recent advancements allow 1000s to 100,000s of antigens to be assessed simultaneously using <1 l of blood (i.e., highly-multiplexed serology). Application of highly-multiplexed serology for characterization of the animal virosphere is dependent on the availability of reagents that can be used to capture or label antibodies of interest. Here, we demonstrate the potential for commercial immunoglobulin-binding proteins (protein A and protein G) to enable highly-multiplexed serology in 25 species of non-human mammals and we describe a competitive FLISA assay that can be used as an initial screen for choosing the most appropriate capture protein for a given host species.\n\nImportanceAntibodies are generated in response to infections with viruses and other pathogens and they help protect against future exposures. Mature antibodies are long-lived, highly specific, and can bind to their protein targets with high affinity. Thus, antibodies can also provide information about an individuals history of viral exposures, which has important applications in understanding the epidemiology and etiology of disease. In recent years, there have been large advances in the available methods for broadly characterizing antibody binding profiles, but thus far, these have primarily been utilized only with human samples. Here, we demonstrate that commercial antibody-binding reagents can facilitate modern antibody assays for a wide variety of mammalian species, and we describe a cheap and fast approach for choosing the best reagent for each animal species. By studying antibody-binding profiles in captive and wild animals, we can better understand the distribution and prevalence of viruses that could spillover into humans.",

Associated Par3/Baz-Par6-aPKC protein complexes are also well known for their role in the establishment of apical/basal cell polarity in epithelial cells. Here we define a novel, positive function of Baz/Par3 in the Notch pathway. Using Drosophila wing and eye development, we demonstrate that Baz is required for Notch signaling activity and optimal transcriptional activation of Notch target genes. Baz appears to act independently of aPKC in these contexts, as knockdown of aPKC does not cause Notch loss-of-function phenotypes. Using transgenic Notch constructs, our data positions Baz activity downstream of activating Notch cleavage steps and upstream of Su(H)/CSL transcription factor complex activity on Notch target genes. We demonstrate a biochemical interaction between NICD and Baz, suggesting that Baz is required for NICD activity before NICD binds to Su(H). Taken together, our data define a novel role of the polarity protein Baz/Par3, as a positive and direct regulator of Notch signaling through its interaction with NICD.",
