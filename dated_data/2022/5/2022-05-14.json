    "abstract": "During mammalian development, the left and right ventricles arise from early populations of cardiac progenitors known as the first and second heart fields, respectively. While these populations have been extensively studied in non-human model systems, their identification and study in vivo human tissues have been limited due to the ethical and technical limitations of accessing gastrulation stage human embryos. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) present an exciting alternative for modeling early human embryogenesis due to their well-established ability to differentiate into all embryonic germ layers. Here, we describe the development of a TBX5/MYL2 lineage tracing reporter system that allows for the identification of FHF-progenitors and their descendants including left ventricular cardiomyocytes.\n\nFurthermore, using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with oligonucleotide-based sample multiplexing, we extensively profiled differentiating hiPSCs across 12 timepoints in two independent iPSC lines. Surprisingly, our reporter system and scRNA-seq analysis revealed a predominance of FHF differentiation using the small molecule Wnt-based 2D differentiation protocol. We compared this data with existing murine and 3D cardiac organoid scRNA-seq data and confirmed the dominance of left ventricular cardiomyocytes (>90%) in our hiPSC-derived progeny. Together, our work provides the scientific community with a powerful new genetic lineage tracing approach as well as a single cell transcriptomic atlas of hiPSCs undergoing cardiac differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Cochlear implants are neuroprosthetic devices that can restore hearing in people with severe to profound hearing loss by electrically stimulating the auditory nerve. Because of physical limitations on the precision of this stimulation, the acoustic information delivered by a cochlear implant does not convey the same level of acoustic detail as that conveyed by normal hearing. As a result, speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants is typically poorer and more effortful than in listeners with normal hearing. The brain networks supporting speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants are not well understood, partly due to difficulties obtaining functional neuroimaging data in this population. In the current study, we assessed the brain regions supporting spoken word understanding in adult listeners with right unilateral cochlear implants (n=20) and matched controls (n=18) using high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), a quiet and non-invasive imaging modality with spatial resolution comparable to that of functional MRI. We found that while listening to spoken words in quiet, listeners with cochlear implants showed greater activity in left prefrontal cortex than listeners with normal hearing, specifically in a region engaged in a separate spatial working memory task. These results suggest that listeners with cochlear implants require greater cognitive processing during speech understanding than listeners with normal hearing, supported by compensatory recruitment of left prefrontal cortex.",

PDBspheres uses the LGA structure alignment algorithm as the main engine for detecting structure similarities between the protein of interest and template spheres from the library, which currently contains more than 2 million spheres. To assess confidence in structural matches an all-atom-based similarity metric takes sidechain placement into account.

Rho1 signaling is activated by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling at the cell surface. During Drosophila embryonic salivary gland (SG) invagination, the GPCR ligand Folded gastrulation (Fog) activates Rho1 signaling to drive apical constriction. The SG receptor that transduces the Fog signal into Rho1-dependent myosin activation has not been identified. Here, we reveal that the Smog GPCR transduces Fog signal to regulate Rho kinase accumulation and myosin activation in the medioapical region of cells to control apical constriction during SG invagination. We also report on unexpected Fog-independent roles for Smog in maintaining epithelial integrity and organizing cortical actin. Our data supports a model wherein Smog regulates distinct myosin pools and actin cytoskeleton in a ligand-dependent manner during epithelial tube formation.",

    "abstract": "A prominent electrophysiological feature of compulsive behaviours is striatal hyperactivity, yet, its underlying regulatory processes still need to be characterised. Within the striatum, parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVI) exert a powerful feed-forward inhibition essential for the regulation of striatal activity and are implied in the suppression of prepotent inappropriate actions. To investigate the potential role of striatal PVI in regulating striatal activity and compulsive behaviours, we used the Sapap3 knockout mice (Sapap3-KO), which exhibit compulsive-like self-grooming. We first showed that the number of compulsive-like events in Sapap3-KO mice was reduced to normal levels by continuous optogenetic activation of striatal PVI in the centromedial striatum. To narrow down the critical time window of striatal PVI recruitment for regulating compulsive-like grooming, we then developed a novel closed-loop optogenetic stimulation pipeline. Upon a predictive biomarker of grooming onsets, characterised by a transient power increase of 1-4 Hz frequency band in the orbitofrontal cortex, we provided real-time closed-loop stimulation of striatal PVI. This targeted closed-loop optogenetics approach reduced grooming events as efficiently as continuous recruitment of striatal PVI with a reduction of stimulation time of 87%. Together, these results demonstrated that recruitment of striatal PVI at the initiation of the compulsive events is sufficient to drastically reduce compulsive-like behaviours and pave the way for targeted closed-loop therapeutic protocols.",

    "abstract": "Cancer genomes harbor a catalog of somatic mutations. The type and genomic context of these mutations depend on their causes, and allow their attribution to particular mutational signatures. Previous work has shown that mutational signature activities change over the course of tumor development, but investigations of genomic region variability in mutational signatures have been limited. Here, we expand upon this work by constructing regional profiles of mutational signature activities over 2,203 whole genomes across 25 tumor types, using data aggregated by the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium. We present GenomeTrackSig as an extension to the TrackSig R package to construct regional signature profiles using optimal segmentation and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We find that 426 genomes from 20 tumor types display at least one change in mutational signature activities (changepoint), and 257 genomes contain at least one of 54 recurrent changepoints shared by seven or more genomes of the same tumor type. Five recurrent changepoint locations are shared by multiple tumor types. Within these regions, the particular signature changes are often consistent across samples of the same type and some, but not all, are characterized by signatures associated with subclonal expansion. The changepoints we found cannot strictly be explained by gene density, mutation density, or cell-of-origin chromatin state. We hypothesize that they reflect a confluence of factors including evolutionary timing of mutational processes, regional differences in somatic mutation rate, large-scale changes in chromatin state that may be tissue type-specific, and changes in chromatin accessibility during subclonal expansion. These results provide insight into the regional effects of DNA damage and repair processes, and may help us localize genomic and epigenomic changes that occur during cancer development.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying animal behavior is important for many branches of biological research. Current computational tools for behavioral quantification typically rely on a few pre-defined, simplified features to identify a behavior. However, such an approach restricts the information used and the tools applicability to a limited range of behavior types or species. Here we report a new tool, LabGym, for quantifying animal behaviors without such limitations. Combining a novel approach for effective evaluation of animal motion with customizable convolutional recurrent networks for capturing spatiotemporal details, LabGym provides holistic behavioral assessment and accurately identify user-defined animal behaviors without restrictions on behavior types or animal species. It then provides quantitative measurements of each behavior, which quantify the behavior intensity and the body kinematics during the behavior. LabGym requires neither any intermediate step for processing features that causes information loss nor programming knowledge from users for post-hoc analysis. It tracks multiple animals simultaneously in various experimental settings for high-throughput and versatile analysis. It also provides users a way to generate visualizable behavioral datasets that are valuable resources for the research community. We demonstrate its efficacy in capturing subtle behavioral changes in animals ranging from soft-bodied invertebrates to mammals.",

Upon contact with Langerhans cells, pathogens are captured by the C-type lectin langerin and internalized into a structurally unique vesicle known as a Birbeck granule. Although the immunological role of Langerhans cells and Birbeck granules have been extensively studied, the mechanism by which the characteristic zippered membrane structure of Birbeck granules is formed remains elusive. In this study, we observed isolated Birbeck granules using cryo-electron tomography and reconstructed the 3D structure of the repeating unit of the honeycomb lattice of langerin at 6.4 [A] resolution. We found that the interaction between the two langerin trimers was mediated by docking the flexible loop at residues 258-263 into the secondary carbohydrate-binding cleft. Mutations within the loop inhibited Birbeck granule formation and the internalization of HIV pseudovirus. These findings suggest a molecular mechanism for membrane zippering during Birbeck granule biogenesis and provide insight into the role of langerin in the defense against viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Visual neuroprostheses are a promising approach to restore basic sight in visually impaired people. A major challenge is to condense the sensory information contained in a complex environment into meaningful stimulation patterns at low spatial and temporal resolution. Previous approaches considered task-agnostic feature extractors such as edge detectors or semantic segmentation, which are likely suboptimal for specific tasks in complex dynamic environments. As an alternative approach, we propose to optimize stimulation patterns by end-to-end training of a feature extractor using deep reinforcement learning agents in virtual environments. We present a task-oriented evaluation framework to compare different stimulus generation mechanisms, such as static edge-based and adaptive end-to-end approaches like the one introduced here. Our experiments in Atari games show that stimulation patterns obtained via task-dependent end-to-end optimized reinforcement learning result in equivalent or improved performance compared to fixed feature extractors on high difficulty levels. These findings signify the relevance of adaptive reinforcement learning for neuroprosthetic vision in complex environments.",

    "abstract": "Collateral circulation in the circle of Willis (CoW), closely associated with disease mechanisms and treatment outcomes, can be effectively investigated using one-dimensional-zero-dimensional hemodynamic simulations. As the entire cardiovascular system is considered in the simulation, it captures the systemic effects of local arterial changes, thus reproducing collateral circulation that reflects biological phenomena. The simulation facilitates rapid assessment of clinically relevant hemodynamic quantities under patient-specific conditions by incorporating clinical data. During patient-specific simulations, the impact of clinical data uncertainty on the simulated quantities should be quantified to obtain reliable results. However, as uncertainty quantification (UQ) is time-consuming and computationally expensive, its implementation in time-sensitive clinical applications is considered impractical. Therefore, we constructed a surrogate model based on machine learning using simulation data. The model accurately predicts the flow rate and pressure in the CoW in a few milliseconds. This reduced computation time enables the UQ execution with 100 000 predictions in a few minutes on a single CPU core and in less than a minute on a GPU. We performed UQ to predict the risk of cerebral hyperperfusion (CH), a life-threatening condition that can occur after carotid artery stenosis surgery if collateral circulation fails to function appropriately. We predicted the statistics of the postoperative flow rate increase in the CoW, which is a measure of CH, considering the uncertainties of arterial diameters, stenosis parameters, and flow rates measured using the patients clinical data. A sensitivity analysis was performed to clarify the impact of each uncertain parameter on the flow rate increase. Results indicated that CH occurred when two conditions were satisfied simultaneously: severe stenosis and when arteries of small diameter serve as the collateral pathway to the cerebral artery on the stenosis side. These findings elucidate the biological aspects of cerebral circulation in terms of the relationship between collateral flow and CH.\n\nAuthor summaryCerebral arteries generate a ring-like network that provides alternative routes for blood supply in the case of carotid artery stenosis. This collateral circulation is closely associated with the potential risk of stroke and treatment outcomes in patients with stenosis. In this study, we propose a method to elucidate the cerebral circulation of individual patients using a blood flow simulation that incorporates the patients clinical data. A key feature of our approach is its capability to obtain the probability of the different outputs using simulation, considering the uncertainty of patient conditions. Although this capability is essential for obtaining reliable results, the process is time-consuming and requires numerous computer resources. We solved this problem by combining the blood flow simulation with machine learning to perform predictions 43 000 times faster than conventional simulations. We applied the proposed method to predict cerebral circulation following surgery in three patients with stenosis and verified that the method can assess the surgical risk almost in real-time, even on a desktop computer. Additionally, extensive prediction results (100 000 cases for each patient) obtained using this method clarify the relationship between collateral circulation and life-threatening surgical outcomes.",

By combining stable isotope probing (SIP), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal Raman microspectroscopy (Raman), and nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), we illustrate how individual cells can be thoroughly interrogated to obtain information about their taxonomic identity, structure, physiology, and metabolic activity. Analysis of an artificial microbial community demonstrated that our correlative approach was able to resolve the activity of single cells using heavy water SIP in conjunction with Raman and/or NanoSIMS and establish their taxonomy and morphology using FISH and SEM. This workflow was then applied to a sample of yet uncultured multicellular magnetotactic bacteria (MMB). In addition to establishing their identity and activity, backscatter electron microscopy (BSE), NanoSIMS, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to characterize the magnetosomes within the cells.

    "abstract": "Next generation sequencing has revolutionized entomological study, rendering it possible to analyze the genomes and transcriptomes of non-model insects. However, use of this technology is often limited to obtaining nucleotide sequences of target or related genes, with many of the acquired sequences remaining unused because other available sequences are not sufficiently annotated. To address this issue, we have developed a functional annotation workflow for transcriptome-sequenced insects to determine transcript descriptions, which represents a significant improvement over the previous method (functional annotation pipeline for insects). The developed workflow attempts to annotate not only the protein sequences obtained from transcriptome analysis but also the ncRNA sequences obtained simultaneously. In addition, the workflow integrates the expression level information obtained from transcriptome sequencing for application as functional annotation information. Using the workflow, functional annotation was performed on the sequences obtained from transcriptome sequencing of stick insect (Entoria okinawaensis) and silkworm (Bombyx mori), yielding richer functional annotation information than that obtained in our previous study. The improved workflow allows more comprehensive exploitation of transcriptome data and is applicable to other insects because the workflow has been openly developed on GitHub.\n\nSimple SummaryThe function of all genes encoded in the genome should be studied for genome editing. The genome editing technology can speeds up insect research for functional analysis of genes. Our knowledge about the functional information of genes is still incomplete currently while genome sequencing of an organism can be completed. The functional information has been annotated based solely on the information that has been obtained from the result of previous biological research. However, this information will be important in determining the target genes for genome editing. In particular, it is very important that this information is in machine-readable form because computer programs mainly parse this information for the understanding of biological systems. In this paper, we describe a workflow-based method for annotating gene functions in insects that make use of transcribed sequence information as well as reference genome and protein sequence databases. Using the developed workflow, we annotated functional information of Japanese stick insect and silkworm, including gene expression as well as sequence analysis. The functional annotation information obtained by the workflow will greatly expand the possibilities of entomological research using genome editing.",

    "abstract": "Reduced susceptibility to ART, the first-line treatment against malaria, is common in South East Asia (SEA). It is caused by point mutations, mostly in kelch13 (k13) but also in other genes, like upb1. K13 and its compartment neighbors (KICs), including UBP1, are involved in endocytosis of host cell cytosol. We tested 135 mutations in KICs but none conferred ART resistance. Double mutations of k13C580Y with k13R539T or k13C580Y with ubp1R3138H, did also not increase resistance. In contrast, k13C580Y parasites subjected to consecutive RSAs did, but the k13 sequence was not altered. Using isogenic parasites with different k13 mutations, we found correlations between K13 protein amount, resistance and fitness cost. Titration of K13 and KIC7 indicated that the cellular levels of these proteins determined resistance through the rate of endocytosis. While fitness cost of k13 mutations correlated with ART resistance, ubp1R3138H caused a disproportionately higher fitness cost.\n\nSignificanceART resistance is only a partial resistance with a proportion of ring stages surviving physiological ART levels. The correlation of resistance with fitness cost in isogenic lines indicates that fitness cost likely prevents resistance levels permitting survival of all ring stages under physiological ART concentrations. We also found no indication that double mutations in k13, including the two most common resistance mutations in SEA, or with non-k13 genes, are a threat to lead to higher resistance. However, repeated ART exposure increased resistance by mechanisms not altering k13 gene sequence, indicating changes in the background of these parasites. The disproportionally high fitness cost of ubp1R3138H may explain why kic mutations affecting resistance are rare and highlights the unique property of K13 to influence endocytosis only in ring stages.",

    "abstract": "The L1 cell adhesion molecule NrCAM (Neuron-glia related cell adhesion molecule) functions as a co-receptor for secreted class 3 Semaphorins to prune subpopulations of dendritic spines on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the developing mouse neocortex. The developing spine cytoskeleton is enriched in actin filaments but a small number of microtubules have been shown to enter the spine apparently trafficking vesicles to the membrane. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is a member of the Doublecortin (DCX) family of microtubule-binding proteins with serine/threonine kinase activity. To determine if DCLK1 plays a role in spine remodeling, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse line (Nex1Cre-ERT2: DCLK1flox/flox : RCE) to delete microtubule binding isoforms of DCLK1 from pyramidal neurons during postnatal stages of spine development. Homozygous DCLK1 conditional mutant mice exhibited decreased spine density on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex (layer 2/3). Mature mushroom spines were selectively decreased upon DCLK1 deletion but dendritic arborization was unaltered. Mutagenesis and binding studies revealed that DCLK1 bound NrCAM at the conserved FIGQY1231 motif in the NrCAM cytoplasmic domain, a known interaction site for the actin-spectrin adaptor Ankyrin. These findings demonstrate that DCLK1 facilitates spine growth and maturation on cortical pyramidal neurons in the mouse prefrontal cortex potentially through microtubule and NrCAM interactions.",

The subiculum, as the hippocampal output structure, ensures that hippocampal memory representations are transferred correctly to the consolidating neocortical regions. Because patients with temporal lobe epilepsy often develop memory deficits, we hypothesized that epileptic networks may disrupt subicular SWRs. We therefore investigated the impact of experimentally induced status epilepticus (SE) on subicular SWRs and contributing pyramidal neurons using electrophysiological recordings in mouse hippocampal slices. Subicular SWRs expressed hyperexcitable features post-SE, including increased ripple and unit activity. While regular firing neurons normally remain silent during SWRs, selective disinhibition recruited more regular firing neurons for action potential generation during SWRs post-SE. By contrast, burster neurons generated fewer action potential bursts during SWRs post-SE. Furthermore, altered timing of postsynaptic and action potentials suggested distorted neuronal recruitment during SWRs. Distorted subicular SWRs may therefore impair information processing and memory consolidation in epilepsy.",

We hypothesized this difference reflects an important functional division between dorsal (executive) and ventral (episodic) PCC. To test this, we utilized human intracranial recordings of population and single unit activity targeting dorsal PCC during an alternated executive/episodic processing task. Dorsal PCC population responses were significantly enhanced for executive, compared to episodic, task conditions, consistent with the CCN. Single unit recordings, however, revealed four distinct functional types with unique executive (CCN) or episodic (DMN) response profiles. Our findings provide critical electrophysiological data from human PCC, bridging incongruent views within and across species, furthering our understanding of PCC function.",

    "abstract": "Despite the power of antibiotics, bacterial infections remain a major killer, due to antibiotic resistance and hosts with dysregulated immune systems. We and others have been developing drug-loaded nanoparticles that home to the sites of infection and inflammation via engineered tropism for neutrophils, the first-responder leukocytes in bacterial infections. Here, we examined how a member of a broad class of neutrophil-tropic nanoparticles affects neutrophil behavior, specifically questioning whether the nanoparticles attenuate an important function, bacterial phagocytosis. We found these nanoparticles actually augment phagocytosis of non-opsonized bacteria, increasing it by ~50%. We showed this augmentation of phagocytosis is likely co-opting an evolved response, as opsonized bacteria also augment phagocytosis of non-opsonized bacteria. Enhancing phagocytosis of non-opsonized bacteria may prove particularly beneficial in two clinical situations: in hypocomplementemic patients (meaning low levels of the main bacterial opsonins, complement proteins, seen in conditions such as neonatal sepsis and liver failure) or for bacteria that are largely resistant to complement opsonization (e.g., Neisseria). Additionally, we observe that; a) prior treatment with bacteria augments neutrophil uptake of neutrophil-tropic nanoparticles; b) neutrophil-tropic nanoparticles colocalize with bacteria inside of neutrophils. The observation that neutrophil-tropic nanoparticles enhance neutrophil phagocytosis and localize with bacteria inside neutrophils suggests that these nanoparticles will serve as useful carriers for drugs to ameliorate bacterial diseases.",

How codon-usage bias is resolved by tRNA post-transcriptional modifications is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the N1-methylation of guanosine at position 37 (m1G37) on the 3-side of the anticodon, while not directly responsible for reading of codons, is a neutralizer that resolves differential decoding of proline codons. A genome-wide suppressor screen of a non-viable E. coli strain, m1G37-lacking, identifies proS suppressor mutations, indicating a coupling of methylation with tRNA prolyl-aminoacylation that sets the limit of cell viability. Using these suppressors, where prolyl-aminoacylation is decoupled from tRNA methylation, we show that m1G37 neutralizes differential translation of proline codons by the major isoacceptor. Lacking of m1G37 inactivates this neutralization and exposes the need for a minor isoacceptor for cell viability. This work has medical implications for bacterial genomes that exclusively use the major isoacceptor for survival.",

    "abstract": "The intracellular pathogen Chlamydia temporally regulates the expression of its genes but the upstream signals that control transcription are not known. The best studied regulatory pathway is a partner switching mechanism that involves an anti-sigma factor RsbW, which inhibits transcription by binding and sequestering the sigma subunit of RNA polymerase. RsbW is itself regulated by an anti-anti-sigma factor RsbV whose phosyphorylation state is controlled by the phosphatase RsbU. In this study, we showed that Chlamydia trachomatis RsbU requires manganese or magnesium as a cofactor and dephosphorylates RsbV1 and RsbV2, which are the two chlamydial paralogs of RsbV. The gene for RsbU is adjacent to the enolase gene in a number of Chlamydia genomes, and we showed that eno and rsbU are co-transcribed from the same operon. In other bacteria, there is no known functional connection between the Rsb pathway and enolase, which is an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. We found, however, that Chlamydia RsbU phosphatase activity was inhibited by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), the product of the enolase reaction, but not by 2-phosphoglycerate (2PGA), which is the substrate. These findings suggest that the enolase reaction, and more generally glucose metabolism, may provide an upstream signal that regulates transcription in Chlamydia through the RsbW pathway.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe RsbW pathway is a phosphorelay that regulates gene expression in Chlamydia but its upsteam signal has not been identified. We showed that RsbU, a phosphatase in this pathway is inhibited by phosphoenolpyruvate, which is the product of the enolase reaction. As enolase is an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, these results reveal an unrecognized link between glucose metabolism and gene regulation in chlamydiae. Moreover, as these intracellular bacteria acquire gluose from the infected host cell, our findings suggest that glucose availability may be an external signal that controls chlamydial gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa type IV pili (TFP) are important for twitching motility and biofilm formation. TFP have been implicated in surface sensing, a process whereby surface-engaged cells up-regulate synthesis of the second messenger cAMP to propagate a signaling cascade leading to biofilm initiation and repression of motility. Here we show that mutations in PilA impairing proteolytic processing of the prepilin into mature pilin as well as the disruption of essential TFP components, including the PilC platform protein and PilB assembly motor protein, fail to induce surface-dependent cAMP signaling. We show that TFP retraction by surface-engaged cells is required to induce signaling, and that the retractile motor PilT is both necessary and sufficient to power surface-specific induction of cAMP. The PilU retraction motor, in contrast, is unable to support full signaling in the absence of PilT. Finally, while we have confirmed that PilA and PilJ interact by bacterial two-hybrid analysis, our data do not support the current model that PilJ-PilA interaction drives cAMP signaling.\n\nImportanceSurface sensing by P. aeruginosa requires TFP. TFP play a critical role in the induction of the second messenger cAMP upon surface contact; this second messenger is part of a larger cascade involved in the transition from a planktonic to biofilm lifestyle. Here we show that TFP must be deployed and actively retracted by the PilT motor for the full induction of cAMP signaling. Furthermore, the mechanism whereby TFP retraction triggers cAMP induction is not well understood, and our data argues against one of the current models in the field proposed to address this knowledge gap.",

    "abstract": "PurposeMyofibroblasts are associated with scleral remodeling in myopia and glaucoma. We showed reduced myofibroblast alignment with topographic cues in sclera can be modeled by cyclic strain exposure of aligned myofibroblasts in vitro. Here, we characterize the scleral myofibroblast response to cyclic mechanical strain.\n\nMethodsHuman peripapillary scleral (PPS) fibroblasts were cultured on topographically aligned grooves to promote cell alignment, exposed to TGF{beta} (2 ng/ml) in the presence of vehicle or kinase inhibitors, and exposed to uniaxial strain (1 Hz, 5%, 12-24 hours). Alignment with grooves was determined at baseline, immediately following strain, and 24 hours after strain cessation with 0{degrees} being completely aligned and 90{degrees} being perpendicular to grooves. A wound healing assay was developed to investigate further fibroblast migration across topographic cues. Transcriptional profiling of myofibroblasts with or without strain was performed by RT-PCR and pERK, pSMAD2, and pSMAD3 levels were measured by immunoblot.\n\nResultsPre-strain alignment (6.2{+/-}1.5{degrees}) was reduced after strain (21.7{+/-}5.3{degrees}, p<0.0001) and restored 24 hours after cessation (9.5{+/-}2.6{degrees}). ERK, FAK, and ALK5 inhibition preserved alignment following strain; however, alignment reduction was not inhibited by ROCK, YAP, or SMAD3 inhibition. TGF{beta}-induced myofibroblast markers were reduced by strain. While TGF{beta}-induced phosphorylation of ERK and SMAD2 was unaffected by strain, SMAD3 phosphorylation was reduced (p=0.0004). Wound healing across grooves was enhanced by ROCK and SMAD3 inhibition but not ERK or TGF{beta}R1 inhibition.\n\nConclusionsStrain-induced myofibroblast migration across topographic confinement is ERK dependent and associated with pSMAD3 inhibition. These results provide insight into potential mechanisms of pathologic scleral remodeling.\n\nPrecisGlaucomatous scleral remodeling is driven by cellular activity. Here we find that scleral myofibroblasts have an exaggerated response to mechanical strain that is ERK dependent, associated with pSMAD3 inhibition and mitigated TGF{beta} signaling.",

    "abstract": "Development and regeneration are orchestrated by gene regulatory networks that operate in part through transcriptional enhancers. Although many enhancers are pleiotropic and are active in multiple tissues, little is known about whether enhancer pleiotropy is due to 1) site pleiotropy, in which individual transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are required for activity in multiple tissues, or 2) multiple distinct sites that regulate expression in different tissues. Here, we investigated the pleiotropy of an intronic enhancer of the stickleback Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (Bmp6) gene. This enhancer was previously shown to regulate evolved changes in tooth number and tooth regeneration, and is highly pleiotropic, with robust activity in both fins and teeth throughout embryonic, larval, and adult life. We tested the hypothesis that the pleiotropy of this enhancer is due to site pleiotropy of an evolutionarily conserved predicted Foxc1 TFBS. Transgenic analysis and site-directed mutagenesis experiments both deleting and scrambling this predicted Foxc1 TFBS revealed that the binding site is required for enhancer activity in both teeth and fins throughout embryonic, larval, and adult development. Collectively these data support a model where the pleiotropy of this Bmp6 enhancer is due to site pleiotropy and this putative binding site is required for enhancer activity in multiple anatomical sites from the embryo to the adult.",

    "abstract": "Connectivity, in the sense of the persistence of movements between habitat patches, is key to maintain endangered populations and has to be evaluated in management plans. In practice, connectivity is difficult to quantify especially for rare and elusive species. Here, we use spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models with an ecological detection distance to identify barriers to movement. We focused on the transnational critically endangered Pyrenean brown bear (Ursus arctos) population, which is distributed over Spain, France and Andorra and is divided into two main cores areas following translocations. We integrate structured monitoring from camera traps and hair snags with opportunistic data gathered after depredation events. While structured monitoring focuses on areas of regular bear presence, the integration of opportunistic data allows us to obtain information in a wider range of habitat, which is especially important for ecological inference. By estimating a resistance parameter from encounter data, we show that the road network impedes movements, leading to smaller home ranges with increasing road density. Although the quantitative effect of roads is context-dependent (i.e. varying according to landscape configuration), our model predicts that a brown bear with a home range located in an area with relatively high road density (8.29km/km2) has a home range size reduced by 1.4-fold for males and 1.6-fold for females compared to a brown bear with a home range located in an area with low road density (1.38km/km2). When assessing connectivity, spatial capture-recapture modeling offers an alternative to the use of experts opinion when telemetry data are not available.",

Here, we investigated the self-assembly behaviour of mono-N-dodecyl phosphate (DDP) and mixed systems of DDP with dodecyl 1-dodecanol (DOH) at varying pH conditions. Membranes composed of DDP showed pH-responsive vesicle formation in a wide range of pH with a low critical bilayer concentration (CBC). Further, the addition of DOH to DDP membrane system enhanced vesicle formation and stability in alkaline pH regimes. We also compared the high-temperature behaviour of DDP and DDP-DOH membranes with conventional fatty acid membranes. Both, DDP and DDP:DOH mixed membranes possess packing that is similar to decanoic acid membrane. However, the micropolarity of these systems are similar to phospholipid membranes. Finally, the pH-dependent modulation of different phospholipid membranes doped with DDP was also demonstrated to engineer tuneable membranes with potential translational implications.",

    "abstract": "The cholesterol metabolites oxysterols play central roles in cholesterol feedback control. They modulate the activity of two master transcription factors that control cholesterol homeostatic responses, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) and liver X receptor (LXR). Although the role of exogenous oxysterols has been well-established, whether endogenously synthesized oxysterols similarly control both SREBP-2 and LXR to those added exogenously remains poorly explored. Here, we carefully validate the role of oxysterols enzymatically synthesized within cells in cholesterol homeostatic responses. We first show that SREBP-2 responds more sensitively to exogenous oxysterols than LXR. We then show that endogenous 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), 27-HC, and 24S-HC synthesized by CH25H, CYP27A1, and CYP46A1, respectively, suppress SREBP-2 activity at different degrees by stabilizing Insig proteins whereas 7a-HC has little impact on SREBP-2. The results explain the hydroxylation site-specific role of endogenous oxysterols. On the other hand, the expression of CH25H, CYP46A1, CYP27A1, or CYP7A1 fails to induce LXR target gene expression. We also show the 25-HC production-dependent suppression of SREBP-2 using a tetracycline-inducible CH25H expression system. Moreover, we quantitatively determine the specificity of the four cholesterol hydroxylases in living cells. Based on these results, we propose that endogenous side-chain oxysterols primarily regulate the activity of SREBP-2, not LXR.",

    "abstract": "Molten globule (MG) state is an intermediate state of protein observed during folding into native structure. MG state of protein is induced by various denaturing agent (like Urea), extreme pH, pressure and heat. Experiments suggest that MG state of some protein is functionally relevant even if there is no well-defined tertiary structure. Earlier experimental and theoretical studies suggest that MG state of the protein is dynamic in nature, where conformational states are interconverted in nanosecond time scales. These observations lead us to study and compare conformational fluctuations of MG state to those of intrinsic disordered protein (IDP). We consider -Lactalbumin(aLA) protein, which shows MG state at low pH upon removal of calcium (Ca2+) ion. We use constant pH molecular dynamics simulation (CpHMD) to maintain low pH during simulation. We use the dihedral principal component analysis, the density based clustering method and the machine learning technique to identify the conformational fluctuations. We observe metastable states in the MG state. The residues containing the essential coordinates responsible for metastability belong to stable helix in crystal structure, but most of them prefer unstructured or bend conformation in MG state. These residues control the exposure of the putative binding residues for fatty acids. Thus, the MG state of protein behaves as intrinsic disorder protein, although the disorder here is induced by external conditions.",

    "abstract": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines upregulate the expression of the H2O2-producing NADPH oxidase dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) which, when elevated, adversely affects survival from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Because the cGAS-STING pathway is known to initiate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression following uptake of exogenous DNA, we examined whether activation of cGAS-STING could play a role in the generation of reactive oxygen species by PDAC cells. Here, we found that a variety of exogenous DNA species markedly increased the production of cGAMP, the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3, and the translocation of phosphorylated IRF3 into the nucleus, leading to a significant, IRF3-dependent enhancement of DUOX2 expression, and a significant flux of H2O2 in PDAC cells. However, unlike the canonical cGAS-STING pathway, DNA-related DUOX2 upregulation was not mediated by NF-{kappa}B; and although exogenous IFN-{beta} significantly increased Stat1/2-associated DUOX2 expression, intracellular IFN-{beta} signaling that followed cGAMP or DNA exposure did not itself increase DUOX2 levels. Finally, DUOX2 upregulation subsequent to cGAS-STING activation was accompanied by the enhanced, normoxic expression of HIF-1 as well as DNA double strand cleavage, suggesting that cGAS-STING signaling may support the development of an oxidative, pro-angiogenic microenvironment that could contribute to the inflammation-related genetic instability of pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) represents one of the most lethal forms of prostate cancer (PCa) and lacks life-prolonging treatment. The incidence of NEPC is increased due to the widespread use of AR pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) in the treatment of non-metastatic CRPC and hormone-sensitive metastatic tumors. Here, we identified histone lysine demethylase KDM4A as a key player in NEPC progression and an effective therapeutic target. We found that KDM4A mRNA and protein are overexpressed in human and mouse NEPC compared to prostate adenocarcinoma. Knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) of KDM4A in NEPC cell lines suppressed cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that KDM4A promotes NEPC progression, in part, through direct transcriptional regulation of MYC. We showed that MYC is hyper-activated in human and mouse NEPC. KDM4A KD led to suppression of MYC signaling. MYC KD or inhibition profoundly suppressed NEPC cell proliferation. Furthermore, a potent pan-KDM4 inhibitor QC6352 significantly reduced NEPC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, we demonstrated that KDM4A is an important regulator of NEPC progression and targeting KDM4A may potentially be an effective therapeutic strategy for NEPC.\n\nSignificanceNeuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is a highly aggressive prostate cancer subtype that is resistant to potent androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) and currently lacks effective therapeutic options. Histone lysine demethylase KDM4A is an important epigenetic regulator of gene expression in development and cancer. In this study, we show that KDM4A is highly expressed in NEPC and is required for NEPC proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo growth, which is in part mediated through the regulation of MYC expression. Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibition of KDM4A significantly impairs NEPC growth in preclinical models. Thus, our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying NEPC progression and offer a rationale for clinical trials with KDM4 inhibitor in NEPC patients.",

    "abstract": "Biofilms in wounds typically consist of aggregates of bacteria, most often Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, in close association with each other and the host microenvironment. Given this, the interplay across host and microbial elements, including the biochemical and nutrient profile of the microenvironment, likely influences the structure and organization of wound biofilms. While clinical studies, in vivo and ex vivo model systems have provided insights into the distribution of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in wounds, they are limited in their ability to provide a detailed characterization of biofilm structure and organization across the host-microbial interface. On the other hand, biomimetic in vitro systems, such as host cell surfaces and simulant media conditions, albeit reductionist, have been shown to support the co-existence of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus biofilms, with species-dependent localization patterns and interspecies interactions. Therefore, composite in vitro models that bring together key features of the wound microenvironment could provide unprecedented insights into the structure and organization of mixed-species biofilms. We have built a four-dimensional (4-D) wound microenvironment consisting of a 3-D host cell scaffold of co-cultured human epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts, and an in vitro wound milieu (IVWM); the IVWM provides the fourth dimension that represents the biochemical and nutrient profile of the wound infection state. We leveraged this composite 4-D wound microenvironment to probe the structure of mixed-species P. aeruginosa and S. aureus biofilms across multiple levels of organization such as aggregate dimensions and biomass thickness, species co-localization and organization within the biomass, overall biomass composition and interspecies interactions. In doing so, the composite 4-D wound microenvironment platform provides multi-level insights into the structure of mixed-species biofilms, which we incorporate into the current understanding of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus organization in the wound bed.",

Coordinated activation of extracellular matrix (ECM) production and autotoxin bacillunoic acids (BAs) biosynthesis/self-immunity, punished public goods-nonproducing cheaters in strain SQR9s community. Spo0A was identified to be the co-regulator for triggering both ECM production and BAs synthesis/immunity, which activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) to produce malonyl-CoA, an essential precursor for BAs biosynthesis, thereby stimulating BAs production and self-immunity. Elimination of phenotypic cheaters by this policing system, significantly enhanced population fitness under different stress conditions and in plant rhizosphere.

We deleted the conserved mouse orthologues of two independent AF-associated genomic regions in the Tbx5 locus, one intronic (RE(int)-/-) and one downstream of Tbx5 (RE(down)-/-). In both lines we observed a modest (30%) increase of Tbx5 in the postnatal atria. To gain insight into the effects of slight dosage increase in vivo, we investigated the atrial transcriptional, epigenetic and electrophysiological properties of both lines. We observed induction of genes involved in development, ion transport and conduction, increased action potential duration and increased susceptibility to atrial arrhythmias. We identified an AF-associated variant in the human intronic regulatory region that increases transcriptional activity. Expression of the AF-associated transcription factor Prrx1 was induced in RE(int)-/- cardiomyocytes. We found that some of the transcriptional and functional changes in the atria caused by increased Tbx5 expression were normalized when reducing cardiac Prrx1 expression in RE(int)-/- mice, indicating an interaction between these two AF genes. We conclude that modest increases in expression of dose-dependent transcription factors, caused by common regulatory variants, significantly impact on the cardiac gene regulatory network and disease susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas13 systems have been adapted as versatile toolkits for RNA-related applications. Here we systematically evaluate the performance of several popular Cas13 family effectors (Cas13a, Cas13b and Cas13d) under lentiviral vectors and reveal surprisingly differential defects and characteristics of these systems. Using RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, transcriptome profiling, biochemistry analysis, high-throughput CRISPR-Cas13 screening and machine learning approaches, we determine that each Cas13 system has its intrinsic RNA targets in mammalian cells. Viral process-related host genes can be targeted by Cas13 and affect production of fertile lentiviral particles, thereby restricting the utility of lentiviral Cas13 systems. Multiple RNase activities of Cas13 are involved in endogenous RNA targeting. Unlike target-induced nonspecific collateral effect, intrinsic RNA cleavage can be specific, target-independent and dynamically tuned by varied states of Cas13 nucleases. Our work provides guidance on appropriate use of lentiviral Cas13 systems and further raises cautions about intrinsic RNA targeting during Cas13-based basic and therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration requires the constant modification of cellular shape by reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The pentameric Scar/WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) is the main catalyst of pseudopod and lamellipodium formation. Its actin nucleation activity has been attributed to its ability to combine monomeric actin and Arp2/3 complex through the VCA domain of Scar/WAVE, while other regions of the complex are typically thought to mediate spatial and temporal regulation and have no direct role in actin polymerization.\n\nHere we show that the Scar/WAVE with its VCA domain deleted can still induce the formation of morphologically normal actin protrusions. Equivalent results are seen in B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells and Dictyostelium discoideum cells. This actin polymerization occurs independently of the Arp2/3 complex, whose recruitment to the leading edge is greatly reduced by the loss of the VCA domain. We also expressed Scar/WAVE with VCA and polyproline domains both deleted. In Dictyostelium cells, these were only active if WASP (which contains its own proline-rich domain) was available. Similarly, in B16-F1 cells both Abi and WAVE proline-rich domains needed to be deleted before the function of the WRC was lost. Thus we conclude that proline-rich domains play a central role in actin nucleation.\n\nOur data demonstrate a new actin nucleation mechanism of the WRC that is independent of its VCA domain and the Arp2/3 complex. We also show that proline-rich domains are more fundamental than has been thought. Together, these findings suggest a new mechanism for WRC action.",

    "abstract": "Groups of eukaryotic cells can coordinate their crawling motion to follow cues more effectively, stay together, or invade new areas. This collective cell migration depends on cell-cell interactions, which are often studied by colliding pairs of cells together. Can the outcome of these collisions be predicted? Recent experiments on trains of colliding epithelial cells suggest that cells with a smaller contact angle to the surface or larger speeds are more likely to maintain their direction (\"win\") upon collision. When should we expect shape or speed to correlate with the outcome of a collision? We build a model for two-cell collisions within the phase field approach, which treats cells as deformable objects. We can reproduce the observation that cells with high speed and small contact angles are more likely to win with two different assumptions for how cells interact: (1) velocity-aligning, in which we hypothesize that cells sense their own velocity and align to it over a finite timescale, and (2) front-front contact repolarization, where cells polarize away from cell-cell contact, akin to contact inhibition of locomotion. Surprisingly, though we simulate collisions between cells with widely varying properties, in each case, the probability of a cell winning is completely captured by a single summary variable: its relative speed (in the velocity-aligning model) or its relative contact angle (in the contact repolarization model). Both models are currently consistent with reported experimental results, but they can be distinguished by varying cell contact angle and speed through orthogonal perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Membrane organelle function, localization, and proper partitioning upon cell division depend on interactions with the cytoskeleton. Whether, reciprocally, membrane organelles also impact on the function of cytoskeletal elements remains less clear. Here, we show that acute disruption of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) around spindle poles affects mitotic spindle size and function in Drosophila syncytial embryos. Acute ER disruption was achieved through the inhibition of ER membrane fusion by the dominant-negative cytoplasmic domain of Atlastin. We reveal that when the ER is disrupted specifically at metaphase, mitotic spindles become smaller, despite no significant changes in microtubule dynamics. These smaller spindles are still able to mediate sister chromatid separation, yet with decreased velocity. Furthermore, by inducing mitotic exit, we found that nuclear separation and distribution are affected upon ER disruption. Our results suggest that ER integrity around spindle poles is crucial for the maintenance of mitotic spindle shape and pulling forces. Additionally, ER integrity also ensures nuclear spacing during syncytial divisions.",

    "abstract": "Sex Peptide, a seminal fluid protein of D. melanogaster males, has been described as driving a virgin-to-mated switch in females, through eliciting an array of responses, including increased egg laying, activity and food intake and a decreased re-mating rate. While it is known that Sex Peptide achieves this, at least in part, by altering neuronal signaling in females, the identity of key molecular regulators that act downstream of Sex Peptide is not known. Here, we used a high-resolution time series RNA-sequencing dataset of female heads at 10 time points within the first 24 hours after mating to investigate the genetic architecture, at the gene- and exon-level, of the females response to Sex Peptide. We find that Sex Peptide is not essential to trigger a virgin-to-mated transcriptional switch, which involves changes in a metabolic gene regulatory network. However, Sex Peptide is needed to maintain and diversify metabolic changes and to trigger changes in a neuronal gene regulatory network. We further find that Sex Peptide might interact with the females circadian clock to orchestrate transcriptional changes across different regulatory networks. That a male seminal fluid protein can alter a females rhythmic gene expression has implications for our understanding of both reproductive and circadian behaviors.",

We report a suite of technologies for genetically engineering cells to produce multifunctional EV vehicles--without employing chemical modifications that complicate biomanufacturing. We display high affinity targeting domains on the EV surface to achieve specific, efficient binding to T cells, identify a protein tag to confer active cargo loading into EVs, and display fusogenic glycoproteins to increase EV uptake and fusion with recipient cells. We demonstrate integration of these technologies by delivering Cas9-sgRNA complexes to edit primary human T cells.

    "abstract": "Malignant melanoma is one of the most common types of cancer in the United States. Despite recent and well-described progress in melanoma treatment, advanced disease still carries a poor prognosis for many patients and chemotherapy has been appropriately abandoned as a front-line option. Wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (wtIDH1) has recently been implicated as a metabolic dependency in cancer. The enzyme is protective to cancer cells under metabolic stress, including oxidative damage by conventional chemotherapy and nutrient limitation characteristic of the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, the cytosolic enzyme generates NADPH to maintain redox homeostasis. IDH1 also supports mitochondrial function through anaplerosis of its reaction product, -ketoglutarate. We show that melanoma patients express higher levels of the wtIDH1 enzyme compared to normal skin tissue, and elevated wtIDH1 expression portends poor patient survival. Knockdown of IDH1 by RNA interference inhibited cell proliferation and migration under low nutrient levels. Suppression of IDH1 expression in melanoma also decreased NADPH and glutathione levels, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species. An FDA-approved inhibitor of mutant IDH1, ivosidenib (AG-120), exhibited potent anti-wtIDH1 properties under low magnesium and nutrient levels, reflective of the tumor microenvironment in natura. Similarly, findings were replicated in murine models of melanoma. Further, wtIDH1 inhibition was synergistic to conventional anti-melanoma chemotherapy in pre-clinical models. This work points to a novel and readily available combination treatment strategy for patients with advanced and refractory melanoma.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how thought emerges from the topographical structure of the cerebral cortex is a primary goal of cognitive neuroscience. Recent work has revealed a principal gradient of intrinsic connectivity capturing the separation of sensory-motor cortex from transmodal regions of the default mode network (DMN); this is thought to facilitate memory-guided cognition. However, studies have not explored how this dimension of connectivity changes when conceptual retrieval is controlled to suit the context. We used gradient decomposition of informational connectivity in a semantic association task to establish how the similarity in connectivity across brain regions changes during familiar and more original patterns of retrieval. Multivoxel activation patterns at opposite ends of the principal gradient were more divergent when participants retrieved stronger associations; therefore, when long-term semantic information is sufficient for ongoing cognition, regions supporting heteromodal memory are functionally separated from sensory-motor experience. In contrast, when less related concepts were linked, this dimension of connectivity was reduced in strength as semantic control regions separated from the DMN to generate more flexible and original responses. We also observed fewer dimensions within the neural response towards the apex of the principal gradient when strong associations were retrieved, reflecting less complex or varied neural coding across trials and participants. In this way, the principal gradient explains how semantic cognition is organised in the human cerebral cortex: the separation of DMN from sensory-motor systems is a hallmark of the retrieval of strong conceptual links that are culturally shared.\n\nSignificance statementA central task in neuroscience is to understand how cognition emerges from the topographical structure of cerebral cortex. We used fMRI during a semantic task to assess informational connectivity as participants retrieved stereotypical or more unusual associations. The principal gradient of variation in informational connectivity captured the separation of heteromodal memory regions from unimodal cortex. This separation was reduced when weaker associations were retrieved; these trials also produced higher-dimensional neural responses in heteromodal regions. We conclude that the separation of DMN from sensory-motor systems is a hallmark of the retrieval of strong conceptual links that are culturally shared, while more complex and diverse cognition can be generated as this separation in connectivity is reduced.",

    "abstract": "Although words and faces activate neighboring regions in the fusiform gyrus, we lack an understanding of how such category selectivity emerges during development. To investigate the organization of reading and face circuits at the earliest stage of reading acquisition, we measured the fMRI responses to words, faces, houses, and checkerboards in three groups of 60 French children: 6-year-old pre-readers, 6-year-old beginning readers and 9-year-old advanced readers. The results showed that specific responses to written words were absent prior to reading, but emerged in beginning readers, irrespective of age. Likewise, specific responses to faces were barely visible in pre-readers and continued to evolve in the 9-year-olds, yet primarily driven by age rather than by schooling. Crucially, the sectors of ventral visual cortex that become specialized for words and faces harbored their own functional connectivity prior to reading acquisition: the VWFA with left-hemispheric spoken language areas, and the FFA with the contralateral region and the amygdalae. The results support the view that reading acquisition occurs through the recycling of a pre-existing but plastic circuit which, in pre-readers, already connects the VWFA site to other distant language areas. We argue that reading acquisition does not compete with the face system directly, through a pruning of preexisting face responses, but indirectly, by hindering the slow growth of face responses in the left hemisphere, thus increasing a pre-existing right hemispheric bias.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWritten words and faces activate neighboring areas of the fusiform gyri, but their developmental trajectory is different.\nC_LIO_LIThe growth of word-induced activation in VWFA is primarily due to schooling.\nC_LIO_LIThe growth of face responses is primarily affected by age rather than by schooling.\nC_LIO_LIWord and face-related areas exhibit distinct functional connectivity even prior to reading acquisition\nC_LIO_LIVWFA is initially functionally connected with left-hemisphere spoken language areas, and FFA with amygdala and contralateral FFA.\nC_LI",
