    "abstract": "Individuals that initiate alcohol use at younger ages and binge drink during adolescence are more susceptible to developing alcohol use disorder. Adolescents are relatively insensitive to the aversive effects of alcohol and tend to consume significantly more alcohol per occasion than adults, an effect that is conserved in rodent models. Adolescent typical insensitivity to the aversive effects of alcohol may promote greater alcohol intake by attenuating internal cues that curb its consumption. Attenuated sensitivity to the aversive effects of alcohol is also retained into adulthood following protracted abstinence from adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure. Despite these effects, much remains unknown regarding the neural contributors. In the present study, we used a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm to investigate neuronal activation in late-developing forebrain structures of male adolescents and adult cFos-LacZ transgenic rats as well as in AIE adults following consumption of 0.9% sodium chloride previously paired with an intraperitoneal injection of 0, 1.5 or 2.5g/kg of ethanol.. Unlike adults that were non-manipulated or received water exposure during adolescence, adolescents as well as adults who experienced AIE did not display CTA to a 1.5 g/kg ethanol dose. Adults displayed increased neuronal activation indexed via number of {beta}-galactosidase positive ({beta}-gal+) cells in the prefrontal and insular cortex that was absent in adolescents, whereas adolescents but not adults had reduced number of {beta}-gal+ cells in the central amygdala. Adults also displayed greater cortical-insular functional connectivity than adolescents as well as insular-amygdalar and prefrontal cortex-accumbens core functional connectivity. Like adolescents, adults previously exposed to AIE displayed reduced prefrontal-insular cortex and prefrontal-accumbal core functional connectivity. Taken together, these results suggest that attenuated sensitivity to the aversive effects of ethanol is related to a loss of an insular-prefrontal cortex-accumbens core circuit.",

    "abstract": "Language is central to human life; however, how our brains derive meaning from language is still not well understood. A commonly studied electrophysiological measure of on-line meaning related processing is the N400 component, the computational basis of which is still actively debated. Here, we test one of the recently proposed, computationally explicit hypotheses on the N400 - namely, that it reflects surprise with respect to a probabilistic representation of the semantic features of the current stimulus in a given context. We devise a Bayesian sequential learner model to derive trial-by-trial semantic surprise in a semantic oddball like roving paradigm experiment, where single nouns from different semantic categories are presented in sequences. Using experimental data from 40 subjects, we show that model-derived semantic surprise significantly predicts the N400 amplitude, substantially outperforming a non-probabilistic baseline model. Investigating the temporal signature of the effect, we find that the effect of semantic surprise on the EEG is restricted to the time window of the N400. Moreover, comparing the topography of the semantic surprise effect to a conventional ERP analysis of predicted vs. unpredicted words, we find that the semantic surprise closely replicates the N400 topography. Our results make a strong case for the role of probabilistic semantic representations in eliciting the N400, and in language comprehension in general.\n\nSignificance StatementWhen we read or listen to a sentence, our brain continuously analyses its meaning and updates its understanding of it. The N400 brain potential, measured with electrophysiology, is modulated by on-line, meaning related processing. However, its computational underpinnings are still under debate. Inspired by studies of mismatch potentials in perception, here we test the hypothesis that the N400 indexes the surprise of a Bayesian observer of semantic features. We show that semantic surprise predicts the N400 amplitude to single nouns in an oddball like roving paradigm with nouns from different semantic categories. Moreover, the semantic surprise predicts the N400 to a much larger extent than a non-probabilistic baseline model. Our results thus yield further support to the Bayesian brain hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "The simultaneous occurrence of multiple diseases is an understudied area in plant pathology; however, studies of animal and human diseases have shown that the presence of multiple pathogens can impact virulence, and the course of disease development. Furthermore, they also present an important driver of epidemiological dynamics. Global potato production is plagued by multiple pathogens, amongst which are Phytophthora infestans and Alternaria solani, the causal agents of potato late and early blight respectively. Both these pathogens have different lifestyles and are successful pathogens of potato, but despite observations of both pathogens infecting potato simultaneously in field conditions, the tripartite interactions between potato and these two pathogens are so far, poorly understood. Here we studied the interaction of A. solani and P. infestans first in vitro and subsequently in planta both in laboratory and field settings. We found that A. solani can inhibit P. infestans both in terms of growth in vitro and infection of potato, both in laboratory experiments and in an agriculturally relevant field setting.",

    "abstract": "Cellular metabolism is important for adult neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) behavior. However, its role in the transition from quiescence to proliferation is not fully understood. We here show that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) plays a crucial and unexpected part in this process. MPC transports pyruvate into mitochondria, linking cytosolic glycolysis to mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Despite its metabolic key function, the role of MPC in NSPCs has not been addressed. We show that quiescent NSPCs have an active mitochondrial metabolism and express high levels of MPC. Pharmacological MPC inhibition increases aspartate and triggers NSPC activation. Furthermore, genetic MPC-ablation in vivo also activates NSPCs, which differentiate into mature neurons, leading to overall increased hippocampal neurogenesis in adult and aged mice. These findings highlight the importance of metabolism for NSPC regulation and identify a novel pathway through which mitochondrial pyruvate import controls NSPC quiescence and activation.\n\nHighlights* Quiescent NSPCs have high levels of MPC and an active mitochondrial network\n* The import of pyruvate into mitochondria is necessary to maintain quiescence of NSPCs\n* MPC inhibition increases intracellular aspartate levels and triggers the activation of quiescent NSPCs\n* MPC-knockout NSPCs generate mature newborn neurons, leading to overall increased neurogenesis in adult and advanced age mice\n\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=140 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/494137v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ee8788org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1040633org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1330d26org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a474e0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Plants have developed strategies to adapt quickly to environmental changes. However, the regulation of these adaptive responses and coordination of signals network remains poorly understood for many environmental constraints. Indeed, signalling molecules play a central role in environmental stimuli and may coordinate plants development under environmental cues. Sucrose is the major transport carbohydrate in higher plants, in addition to its metabolic role; recent investigations suggested that sucrose impact the plasticity of plant development by controlling gene expression. Sucrose was also suggested as a ROS scavenger and as a signalling molecule. In this paper we showed that sucrose mitigated phenanthrene induced stress. Since, exogenous sucrose allowed growth and chlorophyll accumulation in the presence of high phenanthrene concentrations, whereas Arabidopsis development was blocked and seedlings were unable to accumulate chlorophyll in the presence of phenanthrene solely. To decipher the earlier molecular changes involved in sucrose tolerance to phenanthrene, wide transcriptional genes analysis and targeted metabolic profiling were carried out. We showed that sucrose driving plant response was associated with a deep reconfiguration of both genes expression and metabolites accumulation during the first hours of treatment, suggesting that sucrose, allowed plants to sustain the primary metabolism and to overcome the phenanthrene induced injuries.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how humans and animals can make effective decisions would have a profound impact on economics, psychology, ecology, and related fields. Neoclassical economics provides a formalism for optimal decisions, but the apparatus requires a large number of evaluations of the decision options as well as representations and computations that are biologically implausible. This article shows that natural constraints distill the economic optimization into an efficient and biologically plausible decision strategy. In this strategy, decision-makers evaluate the relative reward across their options and allocate their effort proportionally, thus equalizing the reward per effort across their options. Using a combination of analytical and simulation approaches, the article shows that this strategy is efficient, providing optimal or near-optimal gain following a single evaluation of decision options. The strategy is also rational; satisficing and indifferent decision-makers are found to perform relatively poorly. Moreover, the relativistic value functions underlying this efficient strategy provide an account of time discounting, effort discounting, and resource discounting in general.",

    "abstract": "The patterns of biogeographical distribution and assembly processes of microbiota are of vital importance for understanding ecological adaptation and functioning maintenance that microorganisms provide. Although the assembly of microbial communities was increasingly inspected, the role of their morphological characteristics is still poorly ascertained. Here, by integrating high-throughput sequencing and traditional trait-based classification, we investigated taxonomic and phylogenetic turnovers of different morphotypes of terrestrial cyanobacteria in biocrusts, as a model system, to evaluate the contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes across a large scale in drylands. The results showed that the bundle-forming category dominated in arid ecosystems with high tolerance against environmental fluctuations. Despite strong distance-decay relationships of {beta}-diversity in all categories, both spatial composition and phylogenetic turnover rates of bundle-forming cyanobacteria were significantly lower than unicellular/colonial, heterocystous, and other non-heterocyst filamentous cyanobacteria. Null model analysis of phylogenetic signals and abundance-based neutral model found that stochastic processes prevailed in the assembly, while aridity mediated the balance between determinism and stochasticity and prompted a shifting threshold among morphotypes. Our findings provide a unique perspective to understand the role of microbial morphology, highlighting the differentiation of biogeographic distribution, environmental response, and species preference between morphotypes with consideration of potential functional consequences, and therefore facilitated the prediction of biodiversity loss under climate change.",

For each PSM, SpecGlob computes the best alignment according to a given score system, while interpreting the mass delta within the PSM as one or several unspecified modification(s). All alignments are provided in a file, written in a specific syntax.\n\nResultsUsing several sets of simulated spectra generated from the human proteome, we demonstrate that running SpecGlob as a post-analysis of an OMS method can significantly increase the number of correctly interpreted spectra, as SpecGlob is able to correctly and rapidly align spectra that differ by one or more modification(s) without any a priori.\n\nConclusionSince SpecGlob explores all possible alignments that may explain the mass delta within a PSM, it reduces interpretation errors generated by incorrect assumptions about the modifications present in the sample or the number and the specificities of modifications carried by peptides. Our results demonstrate that SpecGlob should be relevant to align experimental spectra, although this consists in a more challenging task.",

    "abstract": "Long-read DNA sequencing techniques such as nanopore are especially useful for characterizing complex sequence rearrangements, which occur in some genetic diseases and also during evolution. Analyzing the sequence data to understand such rearrangements is not trivial, due to sequencing error, rearrangement intricacy, and abundance of repeated similar sequences in genomes.\n\nThe O_SCPLOWLASTC_SCPLOW and dnarrange software packages can resolve complex relationships between DNA sequences, and characterize changes such as gene conversion, processed pseudogene insertion, and chromosome shattering. They can filter out numerous rearrangements shared by controls, e.g. healthy humans versus a patient, to focus on rearrangements unique to the patient. One useful ingredient is last-train, which learns the rates (probabilities) of deletions, insertions, and each kind of base match and mismatch. These probabilities are then used to find the most likely sequence relationships/alignments, which is especially useful for DNA with unusual rates, such as DNA from Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) with [~] 80% a+t. This is also useful for less-studied species that lack reference genomes, so the DNA reads are compared to a different species genome. We also point out that a reference genome with ancestral alleles would be ideal.",

PFAS are characterized by their fluorinated carbon chains that make them hard to degrade and bioaccumulate in human and animals. Toxicological studies have shown PFAS toxic effects: cytotoxicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity. Two major categories of PFAS are perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid (PFCA) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid (PFSA). In this study, we used a mouse-oocyte-in-vitro-maturation (IVM) system to study how the structures of PFAS, such as carbon-chain length and functional groups, determine their reproductive toxicity. We found the toxicity of PFAS is elevated with increasing carbon-chain length and the inclusion of the sulfonate group. Specifically, at 600 {micro}M, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) reduced the rates of both germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and polar body extrusion (PBE) as well as induced the formation of relatively large polar bodies. However, the shorter PFSA, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), and all PFCA did not show similar adverse cytotoxicity. We further examined mitochondria and cytoskeleton, two essential factors for cell division, in PFOS- and PFHxS-treated oocytes. We found that 600 {micro}M PFHxS and PFOS exposure induced excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Cytoskeleton analysis revealed that PFHxS and PFOS exposure induced chromosome misalignment, abnormal F-actin organization, elongated the spindle formation, and symmetric division in the treated oocytes. Together, our study provides new information on the structure-toxicity relationship of PFAS.\n\nSynopsisReproductive toxicity of PFAS, a group of persistent organic pollutants, is determined by their chemical structures.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance is a hallmark feature of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), but the progression of the disease is closely linked to a deterioration in {beta}-cell mass and function. While the precise mechanisms of {beta}-cell failure are unclear, chronic hyperglycemia (glucotoxicity) and dyslipidemia (lipotoxicity) are considered contributing factors; however, the relative importance of these insults on {beta}-cell function remains controversial. To examine this, we dissociated glucotoxicity from lipotoxicity using a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mouse model of T2D and the glucose-lowering SGLT2 inhibitor, canagliflozin (CANA). As expected, HFD-feeding impaired glucose tolerance and isolated islet function. However, despite improvements in glucose tolerance and indices of {beta}-cell insulin secretory function in vivo, CANA failed to restore isolated {beta}-cell function. Shotgun lipidomics analysis of isolated islets revealed that HFD-feeding induced glycerophospholipid remodeling with a persistent increase in arachidonic acid (20:4)-enriched molecular species. Further analysis revealed that lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was the predominant lipid class elevated in HFD islets following correction of glucotoxicity with CANA. In follow-up experiments, LPC stimulations acutely and dose-dependently impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in isolated wild-type islets, mechanistically linking this lipid class to {beta}-cell dysfunction. Our findings indicate that persistent inflammatory lipotoxicity impedes {beta}-cell function in diet-induced obese (DIO) rodents even after normalization of hyperglycemia. If replicated in humans, these data suggest that interventions targeting lipotoxicity may be beneficial for the long-term protection of pancreatic {beta}-cell function in T2D.",

We have taken advantage of this unique anatomical structure to establish proteome and phosphoproteome dynamics in neuronal cell bodies and axonal terminals in response to physiological stimulation. We have found that proteome and phosphoproteome responses are very different between somatic and axonal neuronal compartments, indicating the need of each cell domain to differentially adapt. In particular, changes in the phosphoproteome in the cell body are involved in the reorganisation of the cytoskeleton and in axonal terminals the regulation of synaptic and secretory processes. We have identified that prohormone precursors including vasopressin and oxytocin are phosphorylated in axonal terminals and become hyperphosphorylated following stimulation.

Herbacetin (HC) and Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) depleted polyamine levels in Vero cells, which has been demonstrated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). As polyamines play an essential role in the replication and transcription of RNA viruses, the depletion of polyamines by HC and CAPE was anticipated to inhibit the virus replication. To test this hypothesis, HC and CAPE were evaluated for antiviral activities using a cell-based virus yield assay by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), plaque reduction assay, and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). HC and CAPE displayed potent inhibition with EC50 of 463 nM and 0.417 nM for CHIKV and 8.5 {micro}M and 1.15 {micro}M for DENV, respectively. However, the addition of exogenous polyamines did not ultimately rescue the virus titer in both CHIKV and DENV-infected cells. This finding suggested additional antiviral mechanisms for HC and CAPE. Further, in silico analysis revealed that HC and CAPE may directly target the viral methyltransferases (MTase) of CHIKV and DENV. The inhibition of virus-specific MTases by HC and CAPE was confirmed using purified viral MTase of CHIKV and DENV. Altogether, the dual targeting of the host pathway and the viral MTase using potent natural antiviral molecules is expected to facilitate the development of effective biological therapies.\n\nIMPORTANCEVector-borne diseases caused by DENV and CHIKV has a catastrophic impact on human health worldwide. There are no effective vaccines and antiviral drugs present in the market till date against these viruses. In the present study, natural small molecules have been identified as antivirals against DENV and CHIKV. These molecules directly inhibit the virus and impede the synthesis of essential host molecules required for efficient virus replication. Hence, these broad-spectrum antivirals have high therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common type of gynaecologic cancer in women of developed countries. Despite surgery combined with chemo-/radiotherapy regimens, overall survival of patients with high-risk EC tumors is poor, indicating a need for novel molecular therapies. The MEK5-ERK5 pathway is activated in response to growth factors and to different forms of stress, including oxidative stress and cytokines. Previous evidence support a role for the MEK5-ERK5 pathway in the pathology of several cancers. We have investigated the role of ERK5 in EC. In silico analysis of the PanCancer Atlas dataset showed alterations in components of the MEK5-ERK5 pathway in 48% of EC patients. Here, we show that ERK5 inhibition decreased EGF-induced EC cell proliferation, and that depletion of MEK5 resulted in EC impaired proliferation and reduced tumor growth capacity in nude mice. Pharmacologic or genetic silencing of ERK5 impaired NF-kB pathway in EC cells and xenografts. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between ERK5 and p65/RELA protein levels in human EC tumor samples. Mechanistically, impairment of ERK5 resulted in downregulation of NEMO/IKK{gamma} expression, leading to impaired p65/RELA activity and to apoptosis in EC cells and xenografts, which was rescued by NEMO/IKK{gamma} overexpression. Notably, ERK5 inhibition, MEK5 depletion or NF-kB inhibition sensitized EC cells to standard EC chemotherapy (paclitaxel/carboplatin) toxicity, whereas ERK5 inhibition synergized with paclitaxel to reduce tumor xenograft growth in mice. Together, our results suggest that the ERK5-NEMO-NF-{kappa}B pathway mediates EC cell proliferation and survival. We propose the ERK5/NF-{kappa}B axis as new target for EC treatment.",

The localizations provide insights into the functions of hundreds of poorly-characterized proteins, including identifying novel components of nucleoids, plastoglobules, and the pyrenoid. We discovered and further characterized novel organizational features, including eleven chloroplast punctate structures, cytosolic crescent structures, and diverse unexpected spatial distributions of enzymes within the chloroplast.

    "abstract": "Clonal dominance is a wake-up-call for adverse events in gene therapy applications. This phenomenon has mainly been observed as a consequence of a malignancy progression, and, in some rare cases, also during normal haematopoiesis. We propose here a random-effects stochastic model that allows for a quick detection of clonal expansions that possibly occur during a gene therapy treatment.\n\nStarting from the Ito-type equation, the dynamics of cells duplication, death and differentiation at clonal level without clonal dominance can be described by a local linear approximation. The parameters of the base model, which are inferred using a maximum likelihood approach, are assumed to be shared across the clones. In order to incorporate the possibility of clonal dominance, we extend the base model by introducing random effects for the clonal parameters. This extended model is estimated using a tailor-made expectation maximization algorithm. The main idea of this paper is to compare the base and the extended models in high dimensional clonal tracking datasets by means of Akaike Information Criterion in order to detect the presence of clonal dominance. The method is evaluated using a simulation study, and is applied to investigating the dynamics of clonal expansion in a in-vivo model of rhesus macaque hematopoiesis.\n\nAuthor summaryPreventing or quickly detecting clonal dominance is an important aspect in gene therapy applications. Over the past decades, clonal tracking has proven to be a cutting-edge analysis capable to unveil population dynamics and hierarchical relationships in vivo. For this reason, clonal tracking studies are required for safety and long-term efficacy assessment in preclinical and clinical studies. In this work we propose a random-effects stochastic framework that allows to investigate events of clonal dominance using high-dimensional clonal tracking data. Our framework is based on the combination between stochastic reaction networks and mixed-effects generalized linear models. We have shown in a simulation study and in a real world application that our method is able to detect the presence of clonal expansions. Our tool can provide statistical support to biologists in gene therapy surveillance analyses.",

    "abstract": "Cilia are important organelles for signaling and motility and are constructed via intraflagellar transport (IFT). RabL2 is a small Rab-like GTPase that localizes to the basal body of cilia via an interaction with the centriolar protein CEP19 before downstream association with the IFT machinery to regulate the initiation of IFT. We have mapped the interaction with RabL2 to residues 107-195 of CEP19, purified the RabL2-CEP19 complex to show that CEP19 is not a GTPase activator protein for RabL2. In contrast, a reconstituted pentameric IFT complex containing IFT81/74 enhances the GTP hydrolysis in RabL2 by 20-fold. The binding site on IFT81/74 that promotes GTP hydrolysis in RabL2 is mapped to a 70 amino acid long coiled-coil region of IFT81/74. We present structural models for minimal IFT81/74-RabL2 complexes and demonstrate that the Chlamydomonas IFT81/74 complex enhances GTP hydrolysis of human RabL2 suggesting an ancient evolutionarily conserved function. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of RabL2 function in the initiation step of IFT and a molecular rationale for why RabL2 dissociates from anterograde IFT trains soon after departure from the ciliary base.",

    "abstract": "Unraveling molecular interactions between viral proteins and host cells is key to understanding the pathogenesis of viral diseases. We hypothesized that potential sequence and structural similarities between SARS-CoV2 proteins and proteins of infected cells might influence host cell biology and antiviral defense. Comparing the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 with human and mammalian proteins revealed sequence and structural similarities between viral helicase with human UPF1. The latter is a protein that is involved in nonsense mediated RNA decay (NMD), an mRNA surveillance pathway which also acts as a cellular defense mechanism against viruses. Protein sequence similarities were also observed between viral nsp3 and human Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) family of proteins. Gene set enrichment analysis on transcriptomic data derived from SARS-CoV-2 positive samples illustrated the enrichment of genes belonging to the NMD pathway compared with control samples. Moreover, comparing transcriptomic data from SARS-CoV2-infected samples with transcriptomic data derived from UPF1 knockout cells demonstrated a significant overlap between datasets. These findings suggest that helicase/UPF1 sequence and structural similarity might have the ability to interfere with the NMD pathway with pathogenic and immunological implications.",

    "abstract": "We report the engineering and selection of two synthetic proteins - FSR16m and FSR22 - for possible treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. FSR16m and FSR22 are trimeric proteins composed of DARPin SR16m or SR22 fused with a T4 foldon and exhibit broad spectrum neutralization of SARS-Cov-2 strains. The IC50 values of FSR16m against authentic B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and BA.1.1 variants are 3.4 ng/mL, 2.2 ng/mL and 7.4 ng/mL, respectively, comparable to currently used therapeutic antibodies. Despite the use of the spike protein from a now historical wild-type virus for design, FSR16m and FSR22 both exhibit increased neutralization against newly-emerged variants of concern (39- to 296-fold) in pseudovirus assays. Cryo-EM structures revealed that these DARPins recognize a region of the receptor binding domain (RBD, residues 455-456, 486-489) overlapping a critical portion of the ACE2-binding surface. K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with a B.1.617.2 variant and receiving intranasally-administered FSR16m were protected as judged by less weight loss and 10-100-fold reductions in viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tracts.

Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) promise to improve significantly the islet micro-environment but an efficient long-term delivery method has not been achieved. We therefore explore the potential of generating ASC enriched islet transplant structure by 3D bioprinting. Here, we fabricate a double-layered 3D bioprinted scaffold for islets and ASCs by using alginate-nanofibrillated cellulose bioink. We demonstrate the diffusion properties of the scaffold and report that human ASCs increase the islet viability, preserve the endocrine function, and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion in vitro. Intraperitoneal implantation of the ASCs and islets in 3D bioprinted scaffold improve the long-term function of islets in diabetic mice. Our data reveals an important role for ASCs on the islet micro-environment.

    "abstract": "ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPases are major regulators of cellular membrane homeostasis. High sequence similarity and multiple, possible redundant functions of the five human ARFs make investigating their function a challenging task. To shed light on the roles of the different Golgi-localized ARF members in membrane trafficking, we generated CRISPR-Cas9 knock ins (KIs) of type I (ARF1 and ARF3) and type II ARFs (ARF4 and ARF5) and mapped their nanoscale localization with stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution microscopy. We find ARF1, ARF4 and ARF5 on segregated nano-domains on the cis-Golgi and ER-Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGIC), revealing distinct roles in COPI recruitment on early secretory membranes. Interestingly, ARF4 and ARF5 define Golgi-tethered ERGIC elements decorated by COPI and devoid of ARF1. Differential localization of ARF1 and ARF4 on distal ERGICs suggests the presence of functionally different classes of intermediate compartments that could regulate bi-directional transport between the ER and the Golgi. Furthermore, ARF1 and ARF3 localize to segregated nano-domains on the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and TGN-derived post-Golgi tubules, strengthening the idea of distinct roles in post-Golgi sorting. This work provides the first map of the nanoscale organization of human ARF GTPases on cellular membranes and sets the stage to dissect their numerous cellular roles.",

    "abstract": "Prediction and understanding of tissue-specific virus-host interactions have relevance for the development of novel therapeutic interventions strategies. In addition, virus-like particles (VLPs) open novel opportunities to deliver therapeutic compounds to targeted cell types and tissues. Given our incomplete knowledge of virus-host interactions on one hand and the cost and time associated with experimental procedures on the other, we here propose a novel deep learning approach to predict virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Our method (Siamese Tailored deep sequence Embedding of Proteins - STEP) is based on recent deep protein sequence embedding techniques, which we integrate into a Siamese neural network architecture. After evaluating the high prediction performance of STEP in comparison to an existing method, we apply it to two use cases, SARS-CoV-2 and John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV), to predict virus protein to human host interactions. For the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein our method predicts an interaction with the sigma 2 receptor, which has been suggested as a drug target. As a second use case, we apply STEP to predict interactions of the JCV VP1 protein showing an enrichment of PPIs with neurotransmitters, which are known to function as an entry point of the virus into glial brain cells. In both cases we demonstrate how recent techniques from the field of Explainable AI (XAI) can be employed to identify those parts of a pair of sequences, which most likely contribute to the protein-protein interaction. Altogether our work highlights the potential of deep sequence embedding techniques originating from the field of natural language processing as well as XAI methods for the analysis of biological sequences. We have made our method publicly available via GitHub.\n\nThe bigger pictureDevelopment of novel cell and tissue specific therapies requires a profound knowledge about protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Identifying these PPIs with experimental approaches such as biochemical assays or yeast two-hybrid screens is cumbersome, costly, and at the same time difficult to scale. Computational approaches can help to prioritize huge amounts of possible PPIs by learning from biological sequences plus already-known PPIs. In this work, we developed a novel approach (Siamese Tailored deep sequence Embedding of Proteins - STEP) that is based on recent deep protein sequence embedding techniques, which we integrate into a Siamese neural network architecture. We use this approach to train models by utilizing protein sequence information and known PPIs.

As emerging evidence suggests the host microbiome may be involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, we aimed to investigate associations between the oral and nasopharyngeal microbiome and COVID-19 severity. We collected saliva (n = 78) and nasopharyngeal swab (n = 66) samples from a COVID-19 cohort and characterized the microbiomes using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. We also examined associations between the salivary and nasopharyngeal microbiome and age, COVID-19 symptoms, and blood cytokines. SARS-CoV-2 infection status, but not COVID-19 severity, was associated with community-level differences in the oral and nasopharyngeal microbiomes. Salivary and nasopharyngeal microbiome alpha diversity negatively correlated with age and were associated with fever and diarrhea. Several bacterial genera were differentially abundant by COVID-19 severity, including oral Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Solobacterium, all of which were depleted in patients with severe COVID-19. Nasopharyngeal Paracoccus was depleted while nasopharyngeal Proteus, Cupravidus, and Lactobacillus were increased in patients with severe COVID-19. Further analysis revealed that the abundance of oral Bifidobacterium was negatively associated with plasma concentrations of known COVID-19 biomarkers interleukin 17F (IL-17F) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In conclusion, our results suggest COVID-19 disease severity is associated with the relative abundance of certain bacterial taxa.",

    "abstract": "Auxin-inducible degradation (AID) is a powerful tool for the targeted degradation of proteins with spatiotemporal control. One limitation of the AID system is that not all proteins are degraded efficiently. Here, we demonstrate that an alternative degron sequence, termed mIAA7, improves the efficiency of degradation in C. elegans, as previously reported in human cells. We tested depletion of a series of proteins with various sub-cellular localizations in different tissue types and found that the use of the mIAA7 degron resulted in faster depletion kinetics for five out of six proteins tested. The exception was the nuclear protein HIS-72, which was depleted with similar efficiency as with the conventional AID* degron sequence. The mIAA7 degron also increased the leaky degradation for two of the tested proteins. To overcome this problem, we combined the mIAA7 degron with the C. elegans AID2 system (C.e.AID2), which resulted in complete protein depletion without detectable leaky degradation. Finally, we show that degradation of ERM-1, a highly stable protein that is challenging to deplete, could be improved further by using multiple mIAA7 degrons. Taken together, the mIAA7 degron further increases the power and applicability of the AID system. To facilitate the generation of mIAA7-tagged proteins using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering, we generated a toolkit of plasmids for the generation of dsDNA repair templates by PCR.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRearranged during transfection (RET) tyrosine kinase signaling has been previously implicated in endocrine resistant breast cancer, however the mechanism by which this signaling cascade promotes resistance is currently not well described. We recently reported that glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-RET signaling appears to promote a positive feedback loop with the transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR1). Here we investigate the mechanism behind this feedback loop and test the hypothesis that GDNF-RET signaling forms a regulatory loop with EGR1 to upregulate cyclin D1 (CCND1) transcription, leading to cell cycle progression and tamoxifen resistance.\n\nMethodsTo gain a better understanding of the GDNF-RET-EGR1 resistance mechanism, we studied the GDNF-EGR1 positive feedback loop and the role of GDNF and EGR1 in endocrine resistance by modulating their transcription levels using CRISPR-dCAS9 in tamoxifen sensitive (TamS) and tamoxifen resistant (TamR) MCF-7 cells. Additionally, we performed kinetic studies using recombinant GDNF (rGDNF) treatment of TamS cells. Statistical significance for qPCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR was determined using a students t-test.\n\nResultsGDNF-RET signaling formed a positive feedback loop with EGR1 and also downregulated estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) transcription. Upregulation of GDNF and EGR1 promoted tamoxifen resistance in TamS cells and downregulation of GDNF promoted tamoxifen sensitivity in TamR cells. Additionally, we show that rGDNF treatment activated GDNF-RET signaling in TamS cells, leading to recruitment of p-ELK-1 to the EGR1 promoter, upregulation of EGR1 mRNA and protein, binding of EGR1 to the GDNF and CCND1 promoters, increased GDNF protein expression, and subsequent upregulation of CCND1 mRNA levels.\n\nConclusionOutcomes from these studies support the hypotheses that GDNF-RET signaling forms a positive feedback loop with the transcription factor EGR1, and that GDNF-RET-EGR1 signaling promotes endocrine resistance via signaling to cyclin D1. Inhibition of components of this signaling pathway could lead to therapeutic insights into the treatment of endocrine resistant breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles, whose dysfunction causes fatal human diseases. Most peroxisomal enzymes are imported from the cytosol by the receptor PEX5, which interacts with a docking complex in the peroxisomal membrane, and then returns to the cytosol after monoubiquitination by a membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligase. The mechanism by which PEX5 shuttles between cytosol and peroxisomes, and releases cargo inside the lumen, is unclear. Here, we use Xenopus egg extract to demonstrate that PEX5 accompanies cargo completely into the lumen, utilizing WxxxF/Y motifs near its N-terminus that bind a lumenal domain of the docking complex. PEX5 recycling is initiated by an amphipathic helix that binds to the lumenal side of the ubiquitin ligase. The N-terminus then emerges in the cytosol for monoubiquitination. Finally, PEX5 is extracted from the lumen, resulting in unfolding of the receptor and cargo release. Our results reveal the unique mechanism by which PEX5 ferries proteins into peroxisomes.",

    "abstract": "The human genome is non-randomly organized within the cell nucleus. Spatial mapping of genome folding by biochemical methods and imaging has revealed extensive variation in locus interaction frequencies between cells in a population and between homologs within an individual cell. Commonly used mapping approaches typically examine either the relative position of genomic sites to each other or the position of individual loci relative to nuclear landmarks. Whether the frequency of specific chromatin-chromatin interactions is affected by where in the nuclear space a locus is located is unknown. Here, we have simultaneously mapped at the single cell level the interaction frequencies and radial position of more than a hundred locus pairs using high-throughput imaging to ask whether the location within the nucleus affects interactions frequency. We find strong enrichment of many interactions at specific radial positions. Position-dependency of interactions was cell-type specific, correlated with local chromatin type, and cell-type-specific enriched associations were marked by increased variability, sometimes without a significant decrease in mean spatial distance. These observations demonstrate that genome organization relative to itself and relative to nuclear landmarks are closely interwoven.\n\nSignificance StatementA genes nuclear environment is defined by its distance to other genes as well as its distance to nuclear structures such as the nuclear periphery. While both of these features have been shown to be important for gene function, they are often studied separately. We performed the first systematic analysis comparing these two features. We determined that at the level of single chromosomes they are correlated, suggesting that genome organization relative to itself and relative to nuclear landmarks are closely interwoven.",

    "abstract": "During meiotic prophase, the essential events of homolog pairing, synapsis, and recombination are coordinated with meiotic progression to promote fidelity and prevent aneuploidy. The conserved AAA+ ATPase PCH-2 coordinates these events to guarantee crossover assurance and accurate chromosome segregation. How PCH-2 accomplishes this coordination is poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that PCH-2 decelerates pairing, synapsis and recombination in C. elegans by remodeling meiotic HORMADs. We propose that PCH-2 converts the closed versions of these proteins, which drive these meiotic prophase events, to unbuckled conformations, destabilizing interhomolog interactions and delaying meiotic progression. Further, we find that PCH-2 distributes this regulation among three essential meiotic HORMADs in C. elegans: PCH-2 acts through HTP-3 to regulate pairing and synapsis, HIM-3 to promote crossover assurance, and HTP-1 to control meiotic progression. In addition to identifying a molecular mechanism for how PCH-2 regulates interhomolog interactions, our results provide a possible explanation for the expansion of the meiotic HORMAD family as a conserved evolutionary feature of meiosis. Taken together, our work demonstrates that PCH-2s remodeling of meiotic HORMADs has functional consequences for the rate and fidelity of homolog pairing, synapsis, recombination and meiotic progression, ensuring accurate meiotic chromosome segregation.",

The drivers of AMR evolution have been extensively studied in vitro, but the evolution of plasmid-mediated AMR in vivo remains poorly explored. Here, we tracked the evolution of the clinically-relevant plasmid pOXA-48, which confers resistance to the last-resort antibiotics carbapenems, in a large collection of enterobacterial clones isolated from the gut of hospitalised patients. Combining genomic and experimental approaches, we first characterized plasmid diversity and the genotypic and phenotypic effects of multiple plasmid mutations on a common genetic background. Second, using cutting-edge genomic editing in wild-type multidrug resistant enterobacteria, we dissected three cases of within-patient plasmid-mediated AMR evolution. Our results revealed, for the first time, compensatory evolution of plasmid-associated fitness cost, as well as the evolution of enhanced plasmid-mediated AMR, in bacteria evolving within the gut of hospitalised patients. Crucially, we observed that the evolution of plasmid-mediated AMR in vivo involves a pivotal trade-off between resistance levels and bacterial fitness. This study highlights the need to develop new evolution-informed approaches to tackle plasmid-mediated AMR dissemination.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial endosymbionts of the groups Wolbachia, Cardinium and Rickettsiaceae are well-known for their diverse effects on their arthropod hosts, ranging from mutualistic relationships to reproductive phenotypes. Here, we analyzed a unique system in which the dwarf spider Oedothorax gibbosus is co-infected with up to five different endosymbionts affiliated with Wolbachia,  Candidatus Tisiphia (formerly Torix group Rickettsia), Cardinium, and Rhabdochlamydia. Using short-read genome sequencing data, we show that the endosymbionts are heterogeneously distributed among O. gibbosus populations and are frequently found co-infecting spider individuals. To study this intricate host-endosymbiont system on a genome resolved level, we used long-read sequencing to reconstruct closed genomes of the Wolbachia,  Ca. Tisiphia and Cardinium endosymbionts. We provide insights in the ecology and evolution of the endosymbionts and shed light on the interactions with their spider host. We detected high quantities of transposable elements in all endosymbiont genomes and provide evidence that ancestors of the Cardinium,  Ca. Tisiphia and Wolbachia endosymbionts have co-infected the same hosts in the past. Our findings contribute to broadening our knowledge about endosymbionts infecting one of the largest animal phyla on earth and show the usefulness of transposable elements as an evolutionary \"contact-tracing\" tool.\n\nData summaryAll supporting data, code and protocols have been provided within the article or through supplementary data files.

The profiles of oligosaccharides on apoB-100 were determined by enzymatic digestions as follows. First, N-glycanase was used to release a mixture of oligomannose and complex types of oligosaccharides. Second, endoglycosidase H was used to release high-mannose and hybrid types. Third, O-glycosidase DS was used to release O-linked oligosaccharides. The released oligosaccharides were then labeled and quantified by electrophoresis. In vitro apoB-100 oxidation was mimicked by adding transition copper ions. For the signal transduction study, I examined the expression of adhesion molecules on cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells by adding LDL in which the oligosaccharide sequences were enzymatically modified. The sugar chain structures on the surface part of apoB-100 were composed predominantly of N-linked oligosaccharides, i.e., two forms of complex type and five forms of high-mannose type. The digestion of sugar chains by exoglycosidases and endoglycosidases did not result in any changes in the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation. Also, LDL without monosaccharides such as sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine did not induce any significant effect on the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, or ELAM-1. I found that the sugar chains did not play any significant roles in the oxidative processing of LDL and also in the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, or ELAM-1.",

    "abstract": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) has recently emerged as a new drug modality with great therapeutic potential. However, linear mRNAs are relatively unstable and also require base modification to reduce their immunogenicity, imposing a limitation to the broad application. With improved stability, the circular RNA (circRNA) presents a better alternative for prolonged expression of the proteins, however the in vitro circularization of RNA at a large scale is technically challenging. Here we developed a new self-catalyzed system to efficiently produce circRNAs in a co-transcriptional fashion. By rational sequence design, we can efficiently produce scarless circRNAs that do not contain foreign sequences. The resulting circRNAs are very stable and have low immunogenicity, enabling prolonged protein translation in different cells without cellular toxicity. The circRNAs generated from this platform can be encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles and efficiently delivered into mice to direct robust protein expression. Finally, the circRNAs encoding RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein induced strong antibody productions, with neutralization antibody titers higher than the preclinical data from the linear mRNAs. Collectively, this study provided a general platform for efficient production of circRNAs, demonstrating the potential of circRNAs as the new generation of mRNA therapy.",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning is increasingly applied to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Although the growth of distributed computer clusters has allowed researchers to obtain higher amounts of data, unbiased MD simulations have difficulty sampling rare states, even under massively parallel adaptive sampling schemes. To address this issue, several algorithms inspired by reinforcement learning (RL) have arisen to promote exploration of the slow collective variables (CVs) of complex systems. Nonetheless, most of these algorithms are not well-suited to leverage the information gained by simultaneously sampling a system from different initial states (e.g., a protein in different conformations associated with distinct functional states). To fill this gap, we propose two algorithms inspired by multi-agent RL that extend the functionality of closely-related techniques (REAP and TSLC) to situations where the sampling can be accelerated by learning from different regions of the energy landscape through coordinated agents. Essentially, the algorithms work by remembering which agent discovered each conformation and sharing this information with others at the action-space discretization step. A stakes function is introduced to modulate how different agents sense rewards from discovered states of the system. The consequences are threefold: (i) agents learn to prioritize CVs using only relevant data, (ii) redundant exploration is reduced, and (iii) agents that obtain higher stakes are assigned more actions. We compare our algorithm with other adaptive sampling techniques (Least Counts, REAP, TSLC, and AdaptiveBandit) to show and rationalize the gain in performance.",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning is increasingly applied to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Although the growth of distributed computer clusters has allowed researchers to obtain higher amounts of data, unbiased MD simulations have difficulty sampling rare states, even under massively parallel adaptive sampling schemes. To address this issue, several algorithms inspired by reinforcement learning (RL) have arisen to promote exploration of the slow collective variables (CVs) of complex systems. Nonetheless, most of these algorithms are not well-suited to leverage the information gained by simultaneously sampling a system from different initial states (e.g., a protein in different conformations associated with distinct functional states). To fill this gap, we propose two algorithms inspired by multi-agent RL that extend the functionality of closely-related techniques (REAP and TSLC) to situations where the sampling can be accelerated by learning from different regions of the energy landscape through coordinated agents. Essentially, the algorithms work by remembering which agent discovered each conformation and sharing this information with others at the action-space discretization step. A stakes function is introduced to modulate how different agents sense rewards from discovered states of the system. The consequences are threefold: (i) agents learn to prioritize CVs using only relevant data, (ii) redundant exploration is reduced, and (iii) agents that obtain higher stakes are assigned more actions. We compare our algorithm with other adaptive sampling techniques (Least Counts, REAP, TSLC, and AdaptiveBandit) to show and rationalize the gain in performance.",

    "abstract": "The voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ1 (KV7.1) is important for the repolarizing phase of the cardiac action potential. Activators of KCNQ1 may provide a strategy for the pharmacological treatment of congenital long QT syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by pathogenic variants in KCNQ1 that promote arrhythmia susceptibility and elevate risk for sudden cardiac death. The small-molecule agonist ML277 recovers function of mutant KCNQ1 channels in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and could represent a starting point for drug development. Here we investigated ML277 mode of action by developing a molecular model of the KCNQ1-ML277 interaction corroborated by experimental and computational analyses. Ligand docking and molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated that ML277 binds to the interface between the voltage sensor and pore domains in KCNQ1. Model predicted binding energies for ML277 and 62 chemical analogs of ML277 correlated with EC50 data available for these compounds. We identified novel ML277-interacting residues on the S5 and S6 segments of KCNQ1 by performing MM/PBSA energy calculations and site-directed mutagenesis of KCNQ1 coupled to electrophysiological characterization of the generated channel mutants. Network analysis of the molecular dynamics simulations further showed that ML277 increases the allosteric coupling efficiency between residues in the voltage sensor domain and residues in the pore domain. Derivatives of ML277 that are not active on KCNQ1 fail to increase allosteric coupling efficiency in the computational simulations. Our results reveal atomic details of the ML277 modulation of KCNQ1 activation. These findings may be useful for the design of allosteric modulators of KCNQ1 and other KCNQ channels that bind at the membrane-accessible protein surface.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe potassium ion channel KCNQ1 contributes to the generation of electrical impulses in the heart. Heritable mutations in KCNQ1 can cause channel loss-of-function and predispose to a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia. Small molecules that bind KCNQ1 and enhance channel function could establish a novel anti-arrhythmic drug paradigm. We used molecular simulations to investigate how a small agonist of KCNQ1 (ML277) binds to the KCNQ1 channel and increases its function. We identified amino acids that are responsible for ML277 binding and show how ML277 promotes signaling in KCNQ1 and channel opening. This work advances our understanding how KCNQ1 and possibly other potassium channels can be activated with small molecules. These data provide a framework for drug development studies.",

Existing FDA-approved drugs target the catalytic pocket of HDACs, which is conserved across subfamilies (classes) of HDAC. Here, we use molecular modeling approaches to identify and target potential novel pockets specific to Class IIA HDAC-HDAC4 at the interface between HDAC4 and the NCOR protein. These pockets were then targeted using an ensemble docking approach combined with consensus scoring to identify compounds with a different mechanism of binding than the currently known HDAC modulators. Using this approach, 18 compounds predicted in silico to bind to HDAC4s novel pockets were tested in vivo testing on two cancer cell lines. Of these, 5 compounds decreased cell viability to less than 60%. One inhibited the catalytic activity of HDAC4 but not HDAC3, which belongs to a different family of HDACs (Class I). The most potent compound has an IC50 comparable to the FDA-approved compound SAHA (Vorinostat).

    "abstract": "Metastatic disease is the major cause of death from cancer. From the primary tumor, cells remotely prepare the environment of the future metastatic sites by secreted factors and extracellular vesicles. During this process, known as pre-metastatic niche formation, immune cells play a crucial role. Mast cells are hematopoietic bone marrow-derived innate immune cells whose function in lung immune response to invading tumors remains to be defined. We found reduced melanoma lung metastasis in mast cell deficient mouse models (Wsh and MCTP5-Cre-RDTR), supporting a pro-metastatic role for mast cells in vivo. However, due to evidence pointing to their antitumorigenic role, we studied the impact of mast cells in melanoma cell function in vitro. Surprisingly, in vitro co-culture of bone-marrow derived mast cells with melanoma cells showed that they have an intrinsic anti-metastatic activity. Mass spectrometry analysis of melanoma-mast cell co-cultures secretome showed that HMGA1 secretion by melanoma cells was significantly impaired. Consistently, HMGA1 knock down in B16-F10 cells reduced their metastatic capacity in vivo. Importantly, analysis of HMGA1 expression in human melanoma tumors showed that metastatic tumors with high HMGA1 expression are associated with reduced overall and disease-free survival. Moreover, we show that HMGA1 is reduced in the nuclei and enriched in the cytoplasm of melanoma metastatic lesions when compared to primary tumors. These data suggest that high HMGA1 expression and secretion from melanoma cells promotes metastatic behavior. Targeting HMGA1 expression intrinsically or extrinsically by mast cells actions reduce melanoma metastasis. Our results pave the way to the use of HMGA1 as anti-metastatic target in melanoma as previously suggested in other cancer types.",

    "abstract": "Viroids, a group of plant pathogens, are mysterious subviral agents composed of single-stranded circular noncoding RNAs. Nuclear-replicating viroids exploit host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) activity for transcription from circular RNA genome to minus-strand intermediates, a classic example illustrating the intrinsic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of Pol II. The mechanism for Pol II to accept single-stranded RNAs as templates for transcription remains poorly understood. Here, we reconstituted a robust in vitro transcription system and demonstrated that Pol II also accepts the minus-strand viroid RNA template to generate plus-strand RNAs. Based on this reconstituted system, we purified the Pol II complex on RNA templates for nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. We identified a remodeled Pol II missing Rpb4, Rpb5, Rpb6, Rpb7, and Rpb9, which contrasts to the canonical 12-subunit Pol II or the 10-subunit Pol II core on DNA templates. This remodeled Pol II is active in transcription with the aid of TFIIIA-7ZF. Interestingly, this remodeled Pol II appears not to require other canonical general transcription factors (such as TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, and TFIIS), indicating a different mechanism/machinery regulating RNA-templated transcription. Transcription elongation factors, such as FACT complex, PAF1 complex, and SPT6, were also absent in the transcription complex on RNA templates. We further analyzed the critical zinc finger domains in TFIIIA-7ZF for aiding Pol II activity on RNA template and revealed the first three zinc finger domains pivotal for template binding. Collectively, our data illustrated a distinct organization of Pol II complex on viroid RNA templates, providing new insights into the evolution of transcription machinery, the mechanism of RNA-templated transcription, as well as viroid replication.",

Recent studies indicate that ASD-associated haploinsufficiency in Scn2a impairs dendritic excitability and synaptic function in neocortical pyramidal cells, but how NaV1.2 is anchored within dendritic regions is unknown. Here, we show that ankyrin-B is essential for scaffolding NaV1.2 to the dendritic membrane of mouse neocortical neurons, and that haploinsufficiency of Ank2 phenocopies intrinsic dendritic excitability and synaptic deficits observed in Scn2a+/- conditions. Thus, these results establish a direct, convergent link between two major ASD risk genes and reinforce an emerging framework suggesting that neocortical pyramidal cell dendritic dysfunction can be etiological to neurodevelopmental disorder pathophysiology.",

Here, we created a CRISPRi library of knockdown strains covering all known essential genes in the biofilm-forming Bacillus subtilis strain 3610. We show that gene essentiality is largely conserved between liquid and surface growth and between two media. We developed an image analysis algorithm to quantify biofilm colony wrinkling, which identified strains with high or low levels of wrinkling that were uncorrelated with extracellular matrix gene expression. We also designed a high-throughput screen for sensitive quantification of sporulation efficiency and performed the first screens of sporulation during essential gene knockdown. We found that all basal knockdowns of essential genes were competent for sporulation in a sporulation-inducing medium, but certain strains exhibited reduced sporulation efficiency in LB, a medium with generally lower levels of sporulation. Knockdown of fatty acid synthesis increased wrinkling and inhibited sporulation. These results highlight the importance of essential genes in biofilm structure and sporulation/germination and suggest a previously unappreciated and multifaceted role for fatty acid synthesis in bacterial lifestyles and developmental processes.\n\nAbstract ImportanceFor many bacteria, life typically involves growth in dense, three-dimensional communities called biofilms that contain cells with differentiated roles and are held together by extracellular matrix. To examine how gene function varies between non-biofilm and biofilm growth, we created a comprehensive library of strains using CRISPRi to knockdown expression of each essential gene in the model species Bacillus subtilis 3610, which can develop into a wrinkled biofilm structure or a spore capable of surviving harsh environments. This library enabled us to determine when gene essentiality depends on growth conditions. We also developed high-throughput assays and computational algorithms to identify essential genes involved in biofilm wrinkling and sporulation. Knockdown of fatty acid synthesis increased the density of wrinkles, and also inhibited sporulation in a medium with generally lower sporulation levels. These findings indicate that essential processes such as fatty acid synthesis can play important and multifaceted roles in bacterial development.",

These newly formed viral capsids navigate the complex chromatin architecture of the nucleus to reach the inner nuclear membrane and egress. Here, we demonstrate by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that HSV-1 capsids traverse dense heterochromatin in the nuclear periphery to reach the inner nuclear membrane. We found that this heterochromatin is dependent on the specific chromatin marks of trimethylation on histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and the histone variant macroH2A1. Through chromatin profiling over the course of infection, we revealed massive host genomic regions bound by macroH2A1 and H3K27me3 that correlate with decreased host transcription in active compartments. This indicates the formation of new heterochromatin during infection. We found that loss of these markers resulted in significantly lower viral titers but did not impact viral genome or protein accumulation. Strikingly, we discovered by TEM that loss of macroH2A1 or H3K27me3 resulted in nuclear trapping of viral capsids. Thus, our work demonstrates that HSV-1 takes advantage of the dynamic nature of host heterochromatin formation during infection for efficient viral egress.",

    "abstract": "Diverse bacterial species use type IVa pili (T4aP) to interact with their environments. The dynamic extension and retraction of T4aP is critical for their function, but the mechanisms that regulate this dynamic activity remain poorly understood. T4aP are typically extended via the activity of a dedicated extension motor ATPase and retracted via the action of an antagonistic retraction motor ATPase called PilT. These motors are generally functionally independent, and loss of PilT commonly results in T4aP hyperpiliation due to undeterred pilus extension.\n\nHowever, for the mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA) T4aP of Vibrio cholerae, the loss of PilT results in a loss of surface piliation, which is unexpected based on our current understanding of T4aP dynamics. Here, we employ a combination of genetic and cell biological approaches to dissect the underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrate that PilT is necessary for MSHA pilus extension in addition to its well-established role in promoting MSHA pilus retraction. Through a suppressor screen, we also provide genetic evidence that the MshA major pilin impacts pilus extension. Together, these findings contribute to our understanding of the factors that regulate pilus extension and describe a previously uncharacterized function for the PilT motor ATPase.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMany bacteria use filamentous appendages called type IVa pili to interact with their environment. These fibers dynamically extend and retract through the activity of ATPase motor proteins. In most pilus systems, deletion of the retraction motor results in uninterrupted pilus extension, leading to hyperpiliation. However, in the MSHA pilus system of V. cholerae, deletion of the retraction motor, pilT, results in a decrease in the number of surface pili. Here, we show that PilT is unexpectedly required for MSHA pilus extension in addition to its defined role in promoting pilus retraction. These results extend our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the dynamic activity of these broadly conserved filamentous appendages.",

These particles are sites of intense algal-bacterial interactions and provide diverse niches for microbes to thrive.

Particulate fractions larger than 10 {micro}m diameter were collected at almost daily intervals between early March and late May in 2018. Metaproteomics was used to assess microbial functional activity at three selected time points during the sampling period. Network analysis identified two major modules representing bacteria co-occurring with diatoms and with dinoflagellates, respectively. Bacterial communities associated with these two algal lineages differed in composition, with diatoms distinctly clustering with known sulfate-reducing Desulfobacterota as well as with potentially sulfur-oxidizing Ectothiorhodospiraceae. Metaproteomics confirmed the presence of key enzymes involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction, a process known to occur in sinking particles at greater depths, but considered of lesser importance in the photic zone.

    "abstract": "BackgroundViral Nervous Necrosis (VNN) is major disease affecting of European sea bass. Understanding the biological mechanisms that underlie VNN resistance is thus important for the welfare of farmed fish and the sustainability of production systems. This study aimed at identifying key genomic regions and genes that determine VNN resistance in sea bass.\n\nResultsWe generated a dataset of around 900,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in the parental generation in two different commercial populations (pop A and pop B) comprising 2371 and 3428 European sea bass with phenotypic records for binary survival in a VNN challenge. In each commercial population, three cohorts were submitted to the redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) challenge by immersion and genotyped on a 57K SNP chip. After imputation of WGS SNPs from their parents, QTL mapping was performed using a Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model (BSLMM). We found several QTL regions on different linkage groups (LG), most of which are specific to a single population, but a QTL region on LG12 was shared by both commercial populations. This QTL region is only 127 kB wide, and we identified IFI6, an interferon induced protein at only 1.9 kB of the most significant SNP. An unrelated validation population with 4 large families was used to validate the effect of the QTL, for which the survival of the susceptible genotype ranges from 39.8 to 45.4%, while that of the resistant genotype ranges from 63.8 to 70.8%.\n\nConclusionsWe could precisely locate the genomic region implied in the main resistance QTL at less than 1.9 kb of the interferon alpha inducible protein 6 (IFI6), which has already been identified as a key player for other viral infections such as hepatitis B and C. This will lead to major improvements for sea bass breeding programs, allowing for greater genetic gain by using marker-assisted genomic selection to obtain more resistant fish. Further functional analyses are needed to evaluate the impact of the variant on the expression of this gene.",

    "abstract": "The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a simple model host for studying the interaction between bacterial pathogens and the metazoan innate immune system. In the last two decades, much focus has been given to studying intestinal infection in the worm by the clinical strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14. Powerful genetic and molecular tools in both species facilitate the identification and analysis of bacterial virulence factors as well as host defense factors.\n\nHowever, findings from these studies are confounded by the use of the genetically, metabolically, and physiologically divergent E. coli OP50 as a food source and as the non-virulent control. Here we report the use of P. aeruginosa z11 strain as a preferable control for PA14 infection studies. We demonstrate that many aspects of worm behavior, health-span, longevity, food attraction, brood size, lifespan, and pathogen avoidance and survival are not affected in z11. We show that the use of z11 as a control for transcriptomics analysis can increase the discovery power. In particular, we identified three novel pathogenesis-related genes in C. elegans. Our findings accentuate the importance of choosing an appropriate control environment for host-pathogen studies.",

    "abstract": "Mycolactone is a cytotoxic and immunosuppressive macrolide produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans and the sole causative agent of the neglected tropical skin disease Buruli ulcer. The toxin acts by invading host cells and interacting with intracellular targets to disrupt multiple fundamental cellular processes. Mycolactones amphiphilic nature enables strong interactions with lipophilic environments, including cellular membranes; however, the specificity of these interactions and the role of membranes in the toxins pathogenicity remain unknown. It is likely that preferential interactions with lipophilic carriers play a key role in the toxins distribution in the host, which, if understood, could provide insights to aid in the development of needed diagnostics for Buruli ulcer disease. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations were combined with enhanced free energy sampling to characterize mycolactones association with and permeation through models of the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membranes (PM). We find that increased order in the PM not only leads to a different permeation mechanism compared to that in the ER membrane, but also an energetic driving force for ER localization. Increased hydration, membrane deformation, and preferential interactions with unsaturated lipid tails stabilize the toxin in the ER membrane, while disruption of lipid packing is a destabilizing force in the PM.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEMycolactone is sole the causative agent of Buruli ulcer, a neglected tropical disease involving large necrotic lesions that can cause permanent disfigurement if left untreated. Due to its amphiphilic nature, the toxin hides from traditional diagnostic detection and the host immune system by associating with lipophilic carriers, including cellular membranes. Our work uses extensive all-atom simulations to query if the toxin has preferential interactions with different types of membranes. We find a clear preference for more disordered membranes, like the endoplasmic reticulums, via interactions with unsaturated lipid tails and membrane deformation. The revealed insights can be used to predict host cell distribution between different types of lipophilic carriers and to aid in the design of Buruli ulcer diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Plants are an efficient production platform for manufacturing glycoengineered monoclonal antibodies and antibody-like molecules. Avaren-Fc (AvFc) is a lectin-Fc fusion protein or lectibody produced in Nicotiana benthamiana, which selectively recognizes cancer-associated high-mannose glycans. In this study, we report the generation of a glycovariant of AvFc that is devoid of plant glycans, including the core 1,3-fucose and {beta}1,2-xylose residues. The successful removal of these glycans was confirmed by glycan analysis using HPLC. This variant, AvFc{Delta}XF, has significantly higher affinity for Fc gamma receptors and induces higher levels of luciferase expression in an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) reporter assay against B16F10 murine melanoma cells without inducing apoptosis or inhibiting proliferation. In the B16F10 flank tumor mouse model, we found that systemic administration of AvFc{Delta}XF, but not an aglycosylated AvFc variant lacking affinity for Fc receptors, significantly delayed the growth of tumors, suggesting that Fc-mediated effector functions were integral. AvFc{Delta}XF treatment also significantly reduced lung metastasis of B16F10 upon intravenous challenge whereas a sugar-binding-deficient mutant failed to show efficacy. Lastly, we determined the impact of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) on drug activity in vivo by pretreating animals with AvFc{Delta}XF before implanting tumors. Despite a significant ADA response induced by the pretreatment, we found that the activity of AvFc{Delta}XF was unaffected by the presence of these antibodies. These results demonstrate that glycoengineering is a powerful strategy to enhance AvFcs antitumor activity.",

The plasma glycoproteome yielded high-specificity biomarker signatures for each of the individual genetic defects. Bioinformatic analyses revealed site-specific glycosylation differences that could be explained by underlying glycobiology and in specific diseases by protein-intrinsic factors.

    "abstract": "Ribozymes are RNA molecules that catalyze biochemical reactions. Self-cleaving ribozymes are a common naturally occurring class of ribozymes that catalyze site-specific cleavage of their own phosphodiester backbone. In addition to their natural functions, self-cleaving ribozymes have been used to engineer control of gene expression because they can be designed to alter RNA processing and stability. However, the rational design of ribozyme activity remains challenging, and many ribozyme-based systems are engineered or improved by random mutagenesis and selection (in vitro evolution). Improving a ribozyme-based system often requires several mutations to achieve the desired function, but extensive pairwise and higher-order epistasis prevent a simple prediction of the effect of multiple mutations that is needed for rational design. Recently, high-throughput sequencing-based approaches have produced data sets on the effects of numerous mutations in different ribozymes (RNA fitness landscapes). Here we used such high-throughput experimental data from variants of the CPEB3 self-cleaving ribozyme to train a predictive model through machine learning approaches. We trained models using either a random forest or long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network approach. We found that models trained on a comprehensive set of pairwise mutant data could predict active sequences at higher mutational distances, but the correlation between predicted and experimentally observed self-cleavage activity decreased with increasing mutational distance. Adding sequences with increasingly higher numbers of mutations to the training data improved the correlation at increasing mutational distances. Systematically reducing the size of the training data set suggests that a wide distribution of ribozyme activity may be the key to accurate predictions. Because the model predictions are based only on sequence and activity data, the results demonstrate that this machine learning approach allows readily obtainable experimental data to be used for RNA design efforts even for RNA molecules with unknown structures. The accurate prediction of RNA functions will enable a more comprehensive understanding of RNA fitness landscapes for studying evolution and for guiding RNA-based engineering efforts.",

    "abstract": "Small airway fibrosis is a common pathology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contributes to airflow obstruction. However, the underlying fibrogenic mechanism is poorly understood. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been proposed as a driver of fibrosis. EMT occurs in the airways of COPD patients and smokers, but it remains elusive whether EMT may contribute to airway fibrosis. We previously reported that FBXO11 is a critical suppressor of EMT and Fbxo11 deficiency in mice causes neonatal lethality and EMT in epidermis. Here, we found that Fbxo11-deficient mouse embryonic lungs showed impaired epithelial differentiation, excess fibroblast cells surrounding the airways, and thickened interstitial mesenchyme. We further generated conditional mutant mice to ablate Fbxo11 selectively in the club airway epithelial cells in adult mice, which induced partial EMT in the airways. To determine the effect of EMT on airway fibrosis, Fbxo11 conditional mutant mice were exposed to cigarette smoke. Airway-specific loss of Fbxo11 markedly enhanced smoking-induced airway fibrotic remodeling and collagen deposition. Taken together, our study suggests that EMT in the airway epithelium exacerbates cigarette smoke-induced airway fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "The steady decline of avian populations worldwide urgently calls for a cyber-physical system to monitor bird migration at the continental scale. Compared to other sources of information (radar and crowdsourced observations), bioacoustic sensor networks combine low latency with a high taxonomic specificity. However, the scarcity of flight calls in bioacoustic monitoring scenes (below 0.1% of total recording time) requires the automation of audio content analysis. In this article, we address the problem of scaling up the detection and classification of flight calls to a full-season dataset: 6672 hours across nine sensors, yielding around 480 million neural network predictions. Our proposed pipeline, BirdVox, combines multiple machine learning modules to produce per-species flight call counts. We evaluate BirdVox on an annotated subset of the full season (296 hours) and discuss the main sources of estimation error which are inherent to a real-world deployment: mechanical sensor failures, sensitivity to background noise, misdetection, and taxonomic confusion. After developing dedicated solutions to mitigate these sources of error, we demonstrate the usability of BirdVox by reporting a species-specific temporal estimate of flight call activity for the Swainsons Thrush (Catharus ustulatus).",

However, head movements play a more significant role in gaze shifts in birds than eye movement because of the flat eye shape. Additionally, most birds with laterally placed eyes usually turn the lateral face to the target. Therefore, we used Bengalese finches to examine whether songbirds can discriminate between conspecific frontal and lateral faces and divide head orientations in different angles into two categories. In experiments, birds were trained by operant conditioning to discriminate stimuli consisting of conspecific frontal and lateral head images. Eight out of nine birds finished discrimination training and test sessions. The results indicate that Bengalese finches can discriminate gaze direction by the head orientations. Furthermore, as the number of stimuli set increased, fewer trials were needed to achieve the criteria, which suggests that birds have developed a learning set during the training. However, we did not find a clear discrimination boundary for head orientation categorization.",

    "abstract": "The membrane-anchored c-Src tyrosine kinase mediates signaling from a wide range of cell surface receptors controlling cell growth, adhesion, and survival. c-Src deregulation is associated with cancer. Dimerization appears to be a novel layer of regulation through a yet unclear mechanism. Binding of c-Src tyrosine kinase to the plasma membrane is mediated by the myristoylated and strongly positively charged N-terminal SH4 domain. Although activation of c-Src is known to require phosphorylation by a second c-Src molecule, electrostatic repulsion between the charged residues was considered to prevent dimerization. Here we show that a cluster of positively charged lysine residues in c-Src SH4 domain not only does not prevent dimerization but, in fact, enhances it through a lipid-mediated process. Dimerization not only depends on the number of positive charges but also on their position and the nature of the charged residues. Replacement of lysine by arginine increases dimerization in vitro and in vivo and, in HEK293T cells, causes a two-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. Lipid mediated protein-protein interactions induced by clusters of basic residues may represent a general mechanism for modulating cell signaling, consistent with the abundance of positively charged residues in the juxta membrane region of many signaling proteins.",
