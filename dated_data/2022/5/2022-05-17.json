    "abstract": "Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the aetiologic agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) is an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium. During infection, A. phagocytophilum enhances the adhesion of neutrophils to infected endothelial cells. However the bacterial factors contributing to this phenomenon remain unknown. In this study, we characterized a type IV secretion system substrate of A. phagocytophilum, AFAP (an actin filament-associated Anaplasma phagocytophilum protein), and found it enhanced cell adhesion. Tandem affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry identified host nucleolin as an AFAP-binding protein. Further study showed disruption of nucleolin by RNA interference and treatment of a nucleolin-binding DNA aptamer AS1411 attenuated AFAP-mediated cell adhesion. The characterization of AFAP with enhancement effect on cell adhesion and identification of its interaction partner may help understand the mechanism underlying A. phagocytophilum-promoting cell adhesion, facilitating elucidation of HGA pathogenesis.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAnaplasma phagocytophilum AFAP localized to cell periphery.\nC_LIO_LIAFAP enhanced cell adhesion.\nC_LIO_LIAFAP interacted with host nucleolin.\nC_LIO_LIDisruption of nucleolin attenuated AFAP-mediated cell adhesion.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Chlamydia muridarum (Cm) was detected in mice from 2 colonies with lymphoplasmacytic pulmonary infiltrates using PCR and immunohistochemistry. This discovery was unexpected as Cm infection had not been reported in laboratory mice since the 1940s. A Cm specific PCR assay was developed and testing implemented for resident colonies from 8 vivaria from 3 academic institutions, 58 incoming mouse shipments from 39 academic institutions, and mice received from 55 commercial breeding colonies (4 vendors). To estimate Cms global prevalence in laboratory colonies, a database containing 11,387 metagenomic fecal microbiota samples from 120 institutions and a cohort of 900 diagnostic samples from 96 institutions were examined. Results indicate significant prevalence amongst academic institutions with Cm detected in 62.9% of soiled bedding sentinels from 3 institutions; 32.7% of incoming mouse shipments from 39 academic institutions; 14.2% of 120 institutions submitting microbiota samples; and 16.2% of the diagnostic sample cohort. All samples from commercial breeding colonies were negative. Additionally, naive NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice exposed to Cm shedding mice and their soiled bedding developed clinical disease 21 to 28 days following exposure. These mice had a moderate-to-severe histiocytic and neutrophilic bronchointerstitial pneumonia with respiratory epithelium demonstrating inclusions, chlamydial major outer membrane protein immunostaining, and hybridization with a Cm reference sequence (GenBank accession no. U68436). Cm was isolated on HeLa 229 cells from lungs, cecum, and feces of a Cm infected NSG mouse. The considerable prevalence of Cm is likely attributed to widespread global interinstitutional distribution of unique mouse strains and failure to recognize that some of these mice were from enzootically infected colonies. Given that experimental Cm colonization of mice results in a robust immune response and, on occasion, pathology, natural infection may confound experimental results. Therefore, Cm should be excluded and eradicated from endemically infected laboratory mouse colonies.",

    "abstract": "Fungi are potential biological resources for refractory organics degradation, but their anaerobic degradation of azo dyes are rarely reported. In this study, a fungus Aspergillus tabacinus LZ-M was isolated grown aerobically and degraded acid red 73 (AR73) with a decolorization rate of 90.28% in 5 days at 400 mg/L of concentration anaerobically. Metabolic pathway showed that AR73 was reduced into 2-hydroxynaphthalene and aniline then mineralized into CO2. The anaerobic self-redox process revealed electrons generated in carbon oxidation and transferred to -C-N= and -N=N, resulting in complete mineralization of AR73 in strain LZ-M. Data of transcriptome analysis showed that the benzene compounds produced from AR73 by declorizing reductase entered the catechol pathway and glycolysis process to mineralize. Enzymes involved in aromatics degradation, glycolysis processes, cytochrome C and quinone oxidoreductases were up-regulate, but the key reductase responsible to cleave AR73 to phenylhydrazine was not found. A novel enzyme Ord95 containing a glutamate S-transferase domain was identified in the unknown genes as a reductase which cleaving -C-N= in AR73 using NADH as electron donor, and three arginines key active sites. These observations reveal a new degradation mechanism of AR73 in strain LZ-M which would be potential candidate for treatment of azo dyes wastewater.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "One of the most important public health challenges facing the world today is that posed by antibiotic resistance. Many pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their antibiotic resistance genes, usually located on mobile genetic elements, are frequently present in the faeces of farm animals. To prevent the possibility of antimicrobial resistance transfer to the environment, these faeces should undergo treatment before being used as natural fertilizer. The two strategies for processing pig manure proposed in this study, viz. storage (most commonly used for livestock manure today) and composting, are cheap and do not require special tools or technologies. The present study examines the changes in the physicochemical properties of treated manure, in the microbiome, through metagenomic sequencing, and in the resistome, using the SmartChip Real-time PCR system compared to raw manure. This is the first such comprehensive analysis performed on the same batch of manure. Our results suggest that while none of the processes completely eliminates the environmental risk, composting results in a faster and more pronounced reduction of mobile genetic elements harbouring antibiotic resistance genes, including those responsible for multi-drug resistance. The physicochemical parameters of the treated manure are comparable after both processes; however, composting resulted in significantly higher organic matter. Overall, it appears that the composting process can be an efficient strategy for mitigating the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment and reducing the risk of its transfer to agricultural crops and hence, the food chain. It also provides the organic matter necessary for humus formation, and increases the sorption properties of the soil and the micro and macro elements necessary for plant growth, which in turn translates into increased soil productivity.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe changes in microbial population composition correlate with changes in specific antibiotic-resistance genes and mobile genetic elements in the studied populations.\nC_LIO_LIPositive correlations have been demonstrated between microbial phyla and genes coding the multi-drug resistance mechanism\nC_LIO_LICo-occurrence networks showed positive correlations between antibiotic-resistance genes and mobile genetic elements\nC_LIO_LIThe composting strategy was most efficient at reducing microbial loads, antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements.\nC_LIO_LIComposted manure can be part of a natural, safe soil fertilization strategy.\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=167 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/492273v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@155a284org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1209100org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10f9dbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3c8b9d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus haemolyticus is one of the most important nosocomial human pathogens frequently isolated in bloodstream and medical devices related infections. This species is notorious for its multidrug resistance and genome plasticity. However, its mechanisms of evolution and adaptation are still poorly explored. In this study we aimed to characterize the strategies of genetic and phenotypic diversity in S. haemolyticus. Here, we analyzed an invasive S. haemolyticus strain, recovered from a bloodstream infection, for genetic and phenotypic stability after serial passage in vitro (>400 generations) in the absence and presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of a beta-lactam antibiotic. We performed PFGE of the culture and five colonies at seven time points during stability assays were analyzed for beta-lactams susceptibility, hemolysis, mannitol fermentation and biofilm production. We compared their whole genome regarding chromosomal structure, gene content and mutations and preformed phylogenetic analysis based on core SNPs. We observed a high instability in the PFGE profiles at the different time points during serial passage in vitro in the absence of antibiotic. However, no variation was observed in PFGE patterns in the presence of beta-lactams. Analysis of WGS data for individual colonies collected at different time points showed the occurrence of six large-scale genomic deletions within the oriC environ (36 kbp-348 kbp) in the cell populations analyzed, smaller deletions in non-OriC environ region as well as non-synonymous mutations in clinically relevant genes. The regions of deletion and point mutations included genes encoding amino acid and metal transporters, resistance to environmental stress and beta-lactams, virulence, mannitol fermentation, metabolic processes and IS elements. A parallel variation was additionally detected in clinically significant phenotypic traits such as mannitol fermentation, beta-lactams resistance, hemolysis and biofilm formation. All the genetic variants analyzed were closely related in their core genome (13-292 SNPs). Our results suggest that S. haemolyticus populations are composed of subpopulations of genetic and phenotypic variants that might be affected in antibiotic and stress resistance, specific metabolic processes and virulence. The maintenance of subpopulations in different physiological states might be a strategy to adapt rapidly to a stress situation imposed by the host particularly in the hospital environment.",

    "abstract": "A hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) consisting of GGGGCC24+ in the C9ORF72 gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Both are fatal neurodegenerative diseases with no current approved treatments that significantly slow disease progression or extend life expectancy. Several hypotheses have emerged to explain how this HRE causes neuronal death, including C9ORF72 haploinsufficiency, sequestration of RNA-binding proteins in the nucleus, and production of dipeptide repeat proteins. In the present study we used a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing approach to remove the HRE from the C9ORF72 genomic locus, designing guide RNAs (gRNAs) flanking the HRE, and delivered Cas9 and gRNAs using adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vectors. Here, we demonstrate successful excision of the HRE in C9ORF72 in primary cortical neurons and brains of three mouse models containing the C9ORF72 expanded HRE (ranging from 500-600 repeats) as well as in patient-derived iPSC motor neurons and brain organoids (450 repeats). This resulted in a reduction of RNA foci, poly-dipeptides and haploinsufficiency, the major hallmarks of C9-ALS/FTD, making this an extremely attractive therapeutic approach to these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Self-cleaving ribozymes are RNA molecules that catalyze the cleavage of their own phosphodiester backbones. These ribozymes are found in all domains of life and are also a tool for biotechnical and synthetic biology applications. Self-cleaving ribozymes are also an important model of sequence to function relationships for RNA because their small size simplifies synthesis of genetic variants and self-cleaving activity is an accessible readout of the functional consequence of the mutation. Here we used a high-throughput experimental approach to determine the relative activity for every possible single and double mutant of five self-cleaving ribozymes. From this data, we comprehensively identified non-additive effects between pairs of mutations (epistasis) for all five ribozymes. We analyzed how changes in activity and trends in epistasis map to the ribozyme structures. The variety of structures studied provided opportunities to observe several examples of common structural elements, and the data was collected under identical experimental conditions to enable direct comparison. Heat-map based visualization of the data revealed patterns indicating structural features of the ribozymes including paired regions, unpaired loops, non-canonical structures and tertiary structural contacts. The data also revealed signatures of functionally critical nucleotides involved in catalysis. The results demonstrate that the data sets provide structural information similar to chemical or enzymatic probing experiments, but with additional quantitative functional information. The large-scale data sets can be used for models predicting structure and function and for efforts to engineer self-cleaving ribozymes.",

    "abstract": "As evolving populations accumulate mutations, the benefits and costs of subsequent mutations change. As fitness increases, the relative benefit of new mutations typically decreases. However, the question remains whether deleterious mutations tend to have larger or smaller costs as a population adapts; theory and experiments provide support for both conflicting hypotheses. To address this question, we compared the effects of insertion mutations in every gene in Escherichia coli between ancestral and 12 independently derived strains after 50,000 generations in a uniform environment. We found both increases and decreases in the fitness costs of mutations, leaving the overall distribution of effects largely unchanged. However, at the extreme, more genes became essential over evolution than vice versa. Both changes in fitness effects and essentiality evolved in parallel across the independent populations, and most changes were not explained by structural variation or altered gene expression. Thus, the macroscopic features of the local fitness landscape remained largely unchanged, even as access to particular evolutionary trajectories changed consistently during adaptation to the experimental environment.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryLimdi et al. report parallel changes in the cost of mutations in replicate lineages of a decades-long E. coli evolution experiment.",

A typical editing experiment consists of two steps: (i) editing cultured cells; (ii) cell cloning and selection of clones with and without intended edit, presumed to be isogenic. The application of CRISPR-Cas9 system may result in off-target edits, while cloning will reveal culture-acquired mutations. We analyzed the extent of the former and the latter by whole genome sequencing in three experiments involving separate genomic loci and conducted by three independent laboratories. In all experiments we hardly found any off-target edits, while detecting hundreds to thousands of single nucleotide mutations unique to each clone after relatively short culture of 10-20 passages. Notably, clones also differed in copy number alterations that were several kb to several mb in size and represented the largest source of genomic divergence among clones. We suggest that screening of clones for mutations and copy number alterations acquired in culture is a necessary step to allow correct interpretation of DNA editing experiments. Furthermore, since culture associated mutations are inevitable, we propose that experiments involving derivation of clonal lines should compare a mix of multiple unedited lines and a mix of multiple edited lines.",

Here we report the first identification of endogenous D-cysteine in mammalian pancreas. Serine Racemase (SR) is the biosynthetic enzyme for D- cysteine. D-cysteine is present in substantial amounts in the eyes, brain and pancreas of mice. To characterize endogenous D-cysteine, we used SR deficient mice lacking racemizing ability and show 3.5 fold reduction in pancreatic D-cysteine. SR-/- mice produce 6-10 fold higher levels of insulin in the pancreas and plasma and are stored as amyloid aggregates in secretory vesicles and exosomes respectively. Lack of SR and endogenous D-cysteine globally decreased levels of nucleotides and cAMP, followed by reduced phosphorylation of CREB (S133) including lower expression of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1, 3A and 3B, and reduced DNMT enzymatic and promoter activities in the pancreas. This results in decreased DNA methylation globally and specifically of the Ins1 promoter. D-cysteine is efficiently metabolized by D-amino acid oxidase and transported by ASCT2 and Asc1 transporters in cells. Dietary supplementation with methyl donors rescues the high insulin levels and low DNMT activity in SR-/- mice. Our data show that SR racemizes cysteine in the pancreas and is a physiologic down regulator of insulin promoter methylation.",

    "abstract": "SummaryLiving organisms have developed protein sensors helping them to adapt to their environment1. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is an emblematic member of this class of proteins, and a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates a broad spectrum of (patho)physiological processes in response to numerous substances including pollutants, natural products and metabolites2. However, in the absence of high-resolution structural data, a molecular understanding of how AHR is activated by such diverse compounds is lacking. Here we present a 2.85 [A] cryo-electron microscopy structure of the cytosolic complex comprising AHR bound to the ligand indirubin, the chaperone Hsp90 and the co-chaperone XAP2. The structure reveals a closed Hsp90 dimer with AHR threaded through its lumen. XAP2 directly interacts with Hsp90 and the AHR ligand-binding domain, thereby acting as a brace stabilizing the entire complex. Importantly, we provide the first experimental visualization of the AHR PAS-B domain bound to a ligand, revealing a unique organization of the ligand-binding pocket and the structural determinants of ligand-binding specificity and promiscuity of the receptor. By providing unprecedented structural details of the molecular initiating event leading to AHR activation, our study rationalizes prior biochemical data and provides a framework for future mechanistic studies and structure-guided drug design.",

    "abstract": "In humans, mutations in D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) dehydrogenase (D2HGDH) result in D-2HG accumulation, delayed development, seizures, and ataxia. While the mechanisms of 2HG-associated diseases have been studied extensively, the endogenous metabolism of D-2HG remains unclear in any organism. Here, we find that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, D-2HG is produced in the propionate shunt, which is transcriptionally activated when flux through the canonical, vitamin B12-dependent propionate breakdown pathway is perturbed. Deletion of the D2HGDH ortholog, dhgd-1, results in embryonic lethality, mitochondrial defects, and the upregulation of ketone body metabolism genes. Viability can be rescued by RNAi of hphd-1, which encodes the enzyme that produces D-2HG, or by supplementing either vitamin B12 or the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB). Altogether, our findings support a model in which C. elegans relies on ketone bodies for energy when vitamin B12 levels are low, and in which a loss of dhgd-1 causes lethality by limiting ketone body production.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS- D-2-hydroxyglutarate is produced by HPHD-1 in the propionate shunt pathway\n- DHGD-1 recycles 2-hydroxyglutarate to sustain flux through the propionate shunt\n- dhgd-1 loss perturbs ketone body metabolism and causes embryonic lethality\n- 3-Hydroxybutyrate, vitamin B12 or hphd-1 RNAi rescue dhgd-1 mutant lethality",

    "abstract": "Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency is a major cause of primary lactic acidemia resulting in high morbidity and mortality, with limited therapeutic options. The E1 component of the mitochondrial multienzyme PDC (PDC-E1) is a symmetric dimer of heterodimers ({beta}/{beta}) encoded by the PDHA1 and PDHB genes, with two symmetric active sites each consisting of highly conserved phosphorylation loops A and B. PDHA1 mutations are responsible for 82-88% of cases. Greater than 85% of E1 residues with disease-causing missense mutations (DMMs) are solvent inaccessible, with ~30% among those involved in subunit-subunit interface contact (SSIC). We performed molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type (WT) PDC-E1 and E1 variants with E1 DMMs at R349 and W185 (residues involved in SSIC), to investigate their impact on human PDC-E1 structure. We evaluated the change in E1 structure and dynamics and examined their implications on E1 function with the specific DMMs. We found that the dynamics of phosphorylation Loop A which is crucial for E1 biological activity, changes with DMMs that are at least about 15 [A] away. Because communication is essential for PDC-E1 activity (with alternating active sites), we also investigated the possible communication network within WT PDC-E1 via centrality analysis. We observed that DMMs altered/disrupted the communication network of PDC-E1. Collectively, these results indicate allosteric effect in PDC-E1, with implications for development of novel small molecule therapeutics for specific recurrent E1 DMMs such as replacements of R349 responsible for ~10% of PDC deficiency due to E1 DMMs.",

    "abstract": "Glucose metabolism is biochemically intertwined between energy metabolism and building block biosynthesis in living cells. However, it has not been investigated yet how its metabolic network is orchestrated to govern glucose flux in space and time. Since we reported that human enzymes in glucose metabolism are spatially organized into metabolically active membraneless compartments (i.e., glucosomes), we have employed lattice light sheet microscopic imaging and other biophysical and biochemical techniques to understand their functional significance in cellular metabolism. Now, we demonstrated that glucosome assemblies behave like liquid droplets in human cells and thus reversibly respond to environmental changes. In addition, we characterized a molecular architecture of the glucosome, which appears to be constructed from higher-ordered oligomeric structures of its scaffolder enzyme along with transient enzyme-enzyme interactions. Importantly, we found that enzymatic compositions of glucosomes are altered when they are spatially in proximity to mitochondria to functionally couple glycolysis with mitochondrial metabolism in human cells. Collectively, we envision that the subcellular localization-function relationship between glucosomes and mitochondria may represent one of fundamental principles by which 4-dimensional metabolic networks are not only dynamically but also efficiently regulated in living human cells.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryInvestigation of a 4D functional network of glucose metabolism uncovers a fundamental principal of subcellular metabolic regulation in human cells.",

Yet, genetic circuits are not immediately transferable to an outside-the-lab setting where their performance is highly compromised. We propose introducing a scale step to the design-build-test workflow to include factors that might contribute to unexpected genetic circuit performance. As a proof-of-concept, we designed and tested a genetic circuit under different temperatures, mediums, inducer concentrations, and bacterial growth phases. We determined that the circuits performance is dramatically altered when these factors differ from the optimal lab conditions. Based on these results, a scaling effort, coupled with a learning process, proceeded to generate model predictions for the genetic circuits performance under untested conditions, which is currently lacking in synthetic biology application design. As the synthetic biology discipline transitions from proof-of-concept genetic programs to appropriate and safe application implementations, more emphasis on a scale step is needed to ensure correct and robust performances.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria from the genus Providencia are ubiquitous Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens, causing \"travelers diarrhea\", urinary tract, and other nosocomial infections in humans. Some Providencia strains have also been isolated as natural pathogens of Drosophila melanogaster. Despite clinical relevance and extensive use in Drosophila immunity research, little is known about Providencia virulence mechanisms and the corresponding insect host defenses. To close this knowledge gap, we investigated the virulence factors of a representative Providencia species - P. alcalifaciens which is highly virulent to fruit flies and amenable to genetic manipulations. We generated a P. alcalifaciens transposon mutant library and performed an unbiased forward genetics screen in vivo for attenuated mutants. Our screen uncovered 23 mutants with reduced virulence. The vast majority of them had disrupted genes linked to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis or modifications. These LPS mutants were sensitive to cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in vitro and their virulence was restored in Drosophila mutants lacking most AMPs. Thus, LPS-mediated resistance to host AMPs is one of the virulence strategies of P. alcalifaciens. Another subset of P. alcalifaciens attenuated mutants exhibited increased susceptibility to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro and their virulence was rescued by chemical scavenging of ROS in flies prior to infection. Using genetic analysis, we found that the enzyme Duox specifically in hemocytes is the source of bactericidal ROS targeting P. alcalifaciens. Consistently, the virulence of ROS-sensitive P. alcalifaciens mutants was rescued in flies with Duox knockdown in hemocytes. Therefore, these genes function as virulence factors by helping bacteria to counteract the ROS immune response. Our reciprocal analysis of host-pathogen interactions between D. melanogaster and P. alcalifaciens identified that AMPs and hemocyte-derived ROS are the major defense mechanisms against P. alcalifaciens, while the ability of the pathogen to resist these host immune responses is its major virulence mechanism. Thus, our work revealed a host-pathogen conflict mediated by ROS and AMPs.\n\nAuthor summaryPathogens express special molecules or structures called virulence factors to successfully infect a host. By identifying these factors, we can learn how hosts fight and how pathogens cause infections. Here, we identified virulence factors of the human and fruit fly pathogen Providencia alcalifaciens, by infecting flies with a series of mutants of this pathogen. In this way, we detected 23 mutants that were less virulent. Some of these less virulent mutants were hypersensitive to fruit fly immune defense molecules called antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), while others were sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the immune cells. Notably, AMPs-sensitive mutants remained virulent in a Drosophila mutant that lacks AMPs, while pathogens sensitive to oxidative stress retained their virulence in a fruit fly mutant devoid of oxidative species. These results suggest that the ability of P. alcalifaciens to resist two major host immune molecules, namely AMPs and ROS, is the major virulence mechanism. Overall, our systematic analysis of P. alcalifaciens virulence factors has identified the major defense mechanisms of the fruit fly against this pathogen and the bacterial mechanisms to combat these immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Although it is known that the composition of EVs is determined by the characteristics of the cell and its environment, the effects of intracellular infection on EV composition and functions are not well understood. We had previously shown that cultured macrophages infected with Leishmania parasites release EVs that contain parasite derived molecules (LiEVs). In this study we show that LdVash, a molecule previously identified in LiEVs from L. donovani infected RAW264.7 macrophages is widely distributed in the liver of L. donovani infected mice. This result shows for the first time that parasite molecules are released in EVs and distributed in infected tissues where they can be endocytosed by cells in the liver, including macrophages that undergo a significant increase in numbers as the infection progresses. To commence evaluating the potential impact of LiEVs on macrophage functions, we show that primary peritoneal exudate macrophages (PECs) express transcripts of signature molecules of M2 macrophages such as arginase 1, IL-10 and IL-4R when incubated with LiEVs. In comparative studies that illustrate how intracellular pathogens control the composition and functions of EVs released from macrophages, we show that EVs from RAW264.7 macrophages infected with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium activate PECs to express transcripts of signature molecules of M1 macrophages such as iNOS, TNF alpha and IFN gamma and not M2 signature molecules. Finally, we show that in contrast to the polarized responses observed in in vitro studies of macrophages, both M1 and M2 signature molecules are detected in L. donovani infected livers although they exhibit differences in their spatial distribution in infected tissues.",

    "abstract": "The surfaces of most Gram-positive bacterial cells, including that of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), are heavily decorated with proteins that coordinate cellular interactions with the extracellular space. In S. aureus, sortase A is the principal enzyme responsible for covalently anchoring proteins, which display the sorting signal LPXTG, onto the peptidoglycan (PG) matrix. Considerable efforts have been made to understand the role of this signal peptide in the sortase-mediated reaction. In contrast, much less is known about how the primary structure of the other substrate involved in the reaction (PG stem peptide) could impact sortase activity. To assess the sortase activity, a library of synthetic analogs of the stem peptide that mimic naturally existing variations found in the S. aureus PG primary sequence were evaluated. Using a combination of two unique assays, we showed that there is broad tolerability of substrate variations that are effectively processed by sortase A. While some of these stem peptide derivatives are naturally found in mature PG, they are not known to be present in the PG precursor, lipid II. These results suggest that sortase A could process both lipid II and mature PG as acyl-acceptor strands, which has not been previously described.",

    "abstract": "Abstract and KeywordsO_ST_ABSAimsC_ST_ABSInfective endocarditis (IE) complicates 10-20% of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB). We aimed to determine whether IE strains of S. aureus are genotypically different or behave differently in experimental endocarditis models as compared to non-IE SAB strains.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) of 924 S. aureus genomes from IE (274) and non-IE (650) SAB patients, and tested a subset of strains in two experimental animal models of IE, one studying the early step of bacterial adhesion to inflamed mice valves, the second evaluating the local and systemic developmental process of IE on mechanically damaged rabbit valves. The genetic profile of S. aureus IE and non-IE SAB strains did not differ when considering single nucleotide polymorphisms, coding sequences and k-mers analyses in GWASs. In the inflammation-induced IE model in mice no difference was observed between IE and non-IE SAB strains both in adhesion to the cardiac valves and in the propensity to cause IE; in the mechanical IE-induced rabbit model, there was no difference between IE and non-IE SAB strains regarding vegetation size and CFU.\n\nConclusionS. aureus isolates from SAB patients with and without IE were indistinguishable, by GWAS and by two in vivo models of IE. Thus, S. aureus strain variation is not the primary determinant of IE. Pending the possible identification of host factors predisposing to IE, all strains of S. aureus must be considered in patients as capable of causing this common, lethal infection once they have accessed the bloodstream.\n\nTranslational PerspectiveStaphylococcus aureus endocarditis (IE) is a deadly complication of S. aureus bacteraemia (SAB). Beyond well-identified host related IE risk factors, whether bacterial features may influence the occurrence of IE in the course of bacteraemia remain elusive. We analysed the genomes of 924 S. aureus strains from IE and non-IE SAB and compared some in two in vivo IE models. We demonstrated that the propensity of S. aureus to cause IE in the course of bacteraemia does not depend on the intrinsic genetic or virulence factors of S. aureus. These findings are of importance for the management of S. aureus bacteraemia.",

Amplicon sequencing and network analysis of Albugo-infected and uninfected samples revealed an abundance of negative correlations between Albugo and other phyllosphere microbes. Analysis of the apoplastic proteome of Albugo colonized leaves combined with machine-learning predictors enabled the selection of candidates for heterologous expression and study of their inhibitory activity. We found that three of the candidate proteins show selective antimicrobial activity on gram-positive bacteria isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana and that these inhibited bacteria are important for the stability of the community structure. We could ascribe the antibacterial activity of the candidates to intrinsically disordered regions and positively correlate it with net charge. This is the first report of protist proteins with antimicrobial activity under apoplastic conditions that therefore are potential biocontrol tools for targeted manipulations of the microbiome.",

    "abstract": "The yeasts, Saccharomyces pastorianus, are hybrids of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces eubayanus and have acquired traits from the combined parental genomes such as ability to ferment a range of sugars at low temperatures and to produce aromatic flavour compounds, allowing for the production of lager beers with crisp, clean flavours. The polyploid strains are sterile and have reached an evolutionary bottleneck for genetic variation. Here we describe an accelerated evolution approach to obtain lager yeasts with enhanced flavour profiles. As the relative expression of orthologous alleles is a significant contributor to the transcriptome during fermentation, we aimed to induce genetic variation by altering the S. cerevisiae to S. eubayanus chromosome ratio. Aneuploidy was induced through the temporary inhibition of the cells stress response and strains with increased production of aromatic amino acids via the Shikimate pathway were selected by resistance to amino acid analogues. Genomic changes such as gross chromosomal rearrangements, chromosome loss and chromosome gain were detected in the characterised mutants, as were Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in ARO4, encoding for DAHP synthase, the catalytic enzyme in the first step of the Shikimate pathway. Transcriptome analysis confirmed the upregulation of genes encoding enzymes in the Ehrlich pathway and the concomitant increase in the production of higher alcohols and esters such as 2-phenylethanol, 2-phenylethyl acetate, tryptophol, and tyrosol. We propose that the plasticity of polyploid S. pastorianus genomes is an advantageous trait supporting opportunities for genetic diversity in otherwise sterile strains.\n\nSignificance StatementLager beer is the product of fermentations conducted with Saccharomyces pastorianus, which are hybrids of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces eubayanus. A quintessential property of lager beers is the distinctive flavours produced during fermentation. Hybrids are sterile and have reached an evolutionary bottleneck. Finding ways to introduce genetic variation as a means of enhancing the flavour profiles is a challenge. Here, we describe an approach to introduce genetic variation by inducing aneuploidy through the temporary inhibition of the cells stress response. Strains with an enhanced flavour production were selected by resistance to amino acid analogues. We identified genomic changes and transcriptome analysis confirmed the upregulation of genes in the Ehrlich pathway which is responsible for the production of flavour compounds.",

    "abstract": "Drug repurposing is a novel strategy for the development of new therapies against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Zidovudine, an antiviral largely used in the HIV-therapy, exerts antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Zidovudine was identified in a previous drug repurposing synergy screening as fosfomycin enhancer against Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883. Our aim was to evaluate the antibacterial in vitro activity of zidovudine-based combinations with last-line antibiotics against MDR/XDR K. pneumoniae isolates. We validated the zidovudine/fosfomycin combination against a collection of 12 MDR K. pneumoniae isolates by the checkerboard assay (CBA). In addition, we performed time-kill assays (TKA) to analyze synergistic and bactericidal activities of zidovudine paired combinations with fosfomycin, ceftazidime-avibactam, colistin and tigecycline. These were compared with frequent clinical combinations in the treatment of MDR Enterobacteriaceae. The potential of the triple zidovudine/fosfomycin/colistin was also assessed by TKA. CBA synergy confirmation rate between zidovudine/fosfomycin was 83.33%. TKA yielded synergy confirmation rates of 83.3% for zidovudine/ceftazidime-avibactam, 75% for zidovudine/fosfomycin, 75% for zidovudine/colistin and 66.6% for zidovudine/tigecycline with potent killing activities. Frequent clinical combinations displayed synergy rates of 41.6% for meropenem/ertapenem, 33.33% for meropenem/colistin, 75% for fosfomycin/colistin and 66.6% for fosfomycin/tigecycline with lower bactericidal efficacy than zidovudine-based combinations. The triple zidovudine/fosfomycin/colistin combination exhibited activities similar to fosfomycin/colistin and fosfomycin/zidovudine. As conclusion, zidovudine is an effective partner in in vitro combinations with existing antibiotics against MDR K. pneumoniae, especially with ceftazidime-avibactam, fosfomycin or colistin. Further studies are needed to elucidate the clinical potential of zidovudine as a repurposed drug in the antibacterial therapy.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a pathogen of major public health importance that is largely incurable once a chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection is established. Only humans and great apes are fully permissive to HBV replication, and this species restriction has impacted HBV research by limiting the utility of small animal models of HBV. To combat the species restriction of HBV and enable more HBV studies in vivo, liver-humanized mouse models have been developed that harbor primary human hepatocytes (PHH) and are fully permissive to HBV infection and replication. Unfortunately, these models can be difficult to establish and are expensive commercially, which has limited their academic use. As an alternative mouse model to study HBV, we evaluated liver-humanized NSG-PiZ mice and showed that they are fully permissive to HBV and can develop CHB. Mice were infected with a precore mutant clinical isolate that has now been serially passaged through 3 generations of mice without loss of fitness. HBV selectively replicates in hCK18+ human hepatocytes within chimeric livers, and HBV+ mice secrete infectious virions and HBsAg into blood, while also harboring covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). HBV+ mice remain viremic for at least 169 days, which should enable the study of new curative therapies targeting CHB and respond to antiviral entecavir therapy. The extended duration of viremia is sufficient to enable the study of established and new therapeutic approaches targeting CHB. Furthermore, HBV+ PHH in NSG-PiZ mice can be transduced by the hepatotropic AAV3b and AAV.LK03 vector capsids, which should enable the study of curative gene therapies that target CHB. In summary, our data demonstrates that liver humanized NSG-PiZ mice can be used as a robust and cost-effective alternative to existing CHB models and may enable more academic research labs to study HBV disease pathogenesis and antiviral therapy in a setting that is fully permissive to ongoing replication.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations is central to predicting adaptive evolution, but observing how it changes as organisms adapt is challenging. Here we use saturated, genome-wide insertion libraries to quantify how the fitness effects of new mutations changed in two E. coli populations that adapted to a constant environment for 15,000 generations. The proportions of neutral and deleterious mutations remained constant, despite large fitness gains. In contrast, the beneficial fraction declined rapidly, approximating an exponential distribution, with strong epistasis profoundly changing the genetic identity of adaptive mutations. Despite this volatility, many important targets of selection were predictable from the ancestral distribution. This predictability occurs because genetic target size contributed to the fixation of beneficial mutations as much as or more than their effect sizes. Overall, our results demonstrate that short-term adaptation can be idiosyncratic but empirically predictable, and that long-term dynamics can be described by simple statistical principles.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryCouce et al. demonstrate that short-term bacterial adaptation is predictable at the scale of individual genes, while long-term adaptation is predictable at a global scale.",

We synthesized a series of  clickable geranyl-pyrophosphate analogs and identified two candidates for indirect RNA labeling using a two-step process, azidation-and-click-tagging of fluorescent dyes, namely ACT-Flu. We also developed a direct metabolic incorporation and biorthogonal tagging (MIBT-Tag) method based on the Ene-ligation of prenyl-groups. Both methods have been successfully applied to in-cell RNA labeling and the identification of new proteins associated with the geranylation process through proteomic and bioinformatic studies.

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of disease vector insects is crucial when collecting epidemiological data. Traditionally, mosquitoes that transmit diseases like malaria, yellow fever, chikungunya, and dengue fever have been identified by looking at their external morphological features at different life cycle stages. This process is tedious and labour intensive.\n\nIn this paper, the potential of Raman spectroscopy in combination with Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis to classify three mosquito species, namely: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus, was explored. The classification was based on the mosquitoes cuticular melanin. The three mosquito species represented two subfamilies of medically important mosquitoes, i.e. the Anophelinae and the Culicinae. The housefly (Musca domestica) was included as a  control group to assess the discrimination ability of the classifiers. This study is the first to use Raman spectroscopy to classify mosquitoes. Fresh mosquitoes were anaesthetized with chloroform, and a dispersive Raman microscope was used to capture spectra from their legs. Broad melanin peaks centred around 1400 cm-1, 1590 cm-1, and 2060 cm-1 dominated the spectra. Variance Threshold (VT) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used for feature selection and feature extraction respectively from the preprocessed data. The extracted features were then used to train and test Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) classifiers.\n\nThe VT/PCA/QDA classification model performed better than VT/PCA/LDA. VT/PCA/QDA achieved an overall accuracy of 94%, sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 96%, whereas VT/PCA/LDA attained an accuracy of 85%, a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 90%. The success of these relatively simple classification models on Raman spectroscopy data lays the groundwork for future development of models for discriminating morphologically indistinguishable insect species.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen that is frequently co-isolated with other microbes in catheterized urinary tract infections and chronically infected wounds. While E. faecalis can subvert the host immune response and promote the survival of other microbes via interbacterial synergy, little is known about the impact of immune suppression mediated by E. faecalis and how E. faecalis impacts the survival of co-infecting microbes. We hypothesized that E. faecalis can attenuate neutrophil-mediated responses in mixed-species infection to promote survival of the co-infecting species. Here, we show that E. faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus mono-species infection activates intracellular ROS production and NET formation, respectively, enabling effective neutrophil-mediated control of the microbial infection. Growth of both bacterial species was enhanced during co-infection in neutrophils in vitro and in wounds in vivo. E. faecalis reduced S. aureus-induced NET formation and S. aureus suppressed E. faecalis-induced intracellular ROS production. When the species ratios were skewed, the neutrophil reaction profile resembled that elicited by the more abundant species, favoring enhanced survival of the less abundant species. These findings highlight the complexity of the immune response to polymicrobial infections and show that attenuated pathogen-specific immune responses contribute to microbial survival in the mammalian host.",

    "abstract": "Involution of the mammary gland after lactation is a dramatic example of coordinated cell death. Weaning causes distension of the alveolar structures due to the accumulation of milk, which, in turn, activates STAT3 and initiates a caspase- independent but lysosome-dependent cell death (LDCD) pathway. Although the importance of STAT3 and LDCD in early mammary involution is well established, it has not been entirely clear how milk stasis activates STAT3. In this report, we demonstrate that protein levels of the PMCA2 calcium pump are significantly downregulated within 2- 4 hours of experimental milk stasis. Reductions in PMCA2 expression correlate with an increase in cytoplasmic calcium in vivo as measured by multiphoton intravital imaging of GCaMP6f fluorescence. These events occur concomitant with the appearance of nuclear pSTAT3 expression but prior to significant activation of LDCD or its previously implicated mediators such as LIF, IL6 and TGF{beta}3, all of which appear to be upregulated by increased intracellular calcium. We also observed that milk stasis, loss of PMCA2 expression and increased intracellular calcium levels activate TFEB, an important regulator of lysosome biogenesis. This is the result of increased TGF{beta} signaling and inhibition of cell cycle progression. Finally, we demonstrate that increased intracellular calcium activates STAT3 by inducing degradation of its negative regulator, SOCS3, a process which also appears to be mediated by TGF{beta} signaling. In summary, these data suggest that intracellular calcium serves as an important proximal biochemical signal linking milk stasis to STAT3 activation, increased lysosomal biogenesis, and lysosome- mediated cell death.",

    "abstract": "Most mammalian cells have an intrinsic circadian clock that coordinates their metabolic activity with the daily rest and wake cycle. In addition, the circadian clock is known to regulate cell differentiation, but how continuous daily oscillations of the internal clock control a much longer, multi-day differentiation process is not known. Here we simultaneously monitor the circadian clock and progression of adipocyte differentiation live in single cells. Strikingly, we find a bursting behavior in the cell population whereby individual preadipocytes commit to differentiate primarily during a 12-hour window each day corresponding to the time of rest. Daily gating of differentiation occurs because cells can irreversibly commit to differentiate within a few hours, which is faster than the rest phase and much faster than the overall multi-day differentiation process. We show that the daily bursts in differentiation are driven by a variable and slow increase in expression of PPARG, the master regulator of adipogenesis, combined with rapid, clock-driven expression of CEBPA, which is in a fast positive feedback relationship with PPARG. During each rest cycle, the increase in CEBPA causes a brief step increase in PPARG so that some cells can reach the threshold to irreversibly commit to differentiate, causing the consecutive daily bursts in cell differentiation at the population level. Our findings are broadly relevant given that most differentiating somatic cells are regulated by the circadian clock. Having a restricted time each day when differentiation occurs may open therapeutic strategies to use timed treatment relative to the clock to promote tissue regeneration.\n\nSignificance StatementCells rely on a circadian clock that coordinates cellular activities with the day-night cycle. Defects in circadian clock genes dysregulate cell differentiation processes in immune, muscle, skin and fat cells. However, how a perpetual daily clock can regulate a multi-day long cell differentiation process was not understood. Here we show that the circadian clock controls a fast upregulation of the transcription factor CEBPA during each daily rest phase which in turn controls a fast irreversible step during the overall slow multi-day differentiation of fat cells, causing daily bursts of cell differentiation. Our finding opens potential therapeutic strategies to enhance tissue regeneration by timing when during the day drugs are administered.",

Despite its importance, the essential regulators of ZGA remain largely unknown in mammals. Based on de novo motif searches, we identified the orphan nuclear receptor Nr5a2 as a key activator of major ZGA in mouse embryos. Nr5a2 binds to its motif within a subtype of SINE B1/Alu transposable elements found in cis-regulatory regions of ZGA genes. Chemical inhibition suggests that 72% of ZGA genes are regulated by Nr5a2 and potentially other orphan nuclear family receptors. Consistent with a role in ZGA, Nr5a2 is required for progression beyond the 2-cell stage. Nr5a2 promotes chromatin accessibility during ZGA and binds to entry/exit sites of nucleosomal DNA in vitro. We conclude that Nr5a2 is an essential pioneer factor that distinctly regulates totipotency and pluripotency during mammalian development.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryNr5a2 is an essential pioneer transcription factor that activates expression of zygotic genes in mouse embryos.",

    "abstract": "In animal development, most cell types stop dividing before terminal differentiation; thus, cell cycle control is tightly linked to cell differentiation programs. Although cell cycle control in animal development has been studied extensively, such links are not well understood. In ascidian embryos, cell lineages do not vary among individuals, and rounds of the cell cycle are determined according to cell lineages. In the present study, we first showed that maternal factors promote approximately 10 rounds of cell division without zygotic gene expression. Notochord and muscle cells stop dividing after fewer than 10 rounds of cell division, and we show that a Cdk inhibitor (Cdkn1.b) is responsible. Cdkn1.b is also necessary for epidermal cells to stop dividing. In contrast, mesenchymal and endodermal cells divided more than 10 times, and Myc, which encodes a proto-oncogenic transcription factor, is responsible for maintaining cell cycle progression in these tissues. Expression of Cdkn1.b in notochord and muscle is controlled by the same developmental programs that specify the developmental fate of notochord and muscle. Likewise, expression of Myc in mesenchyme and endoderm was under control of the same developmental programs that specify the developmental fate of mesenchyme and endoderm. Because these transcription factors that regulate Cdkn1.b and Myc are essential factors for fate specification of these tissues, cell fate specification and cell cycle control are linked by those transcription factors. In other words, ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal tissues in ascidian embryos control the cell cycle through Cdkn1.b and Myc, which are under the control of transcription factors that specify cell fate.",

    "abstract": "The placenta serves as a connection between the mother and the fetus during pregnancy, and provides the fetus with oxygen, nutrients, and growth hormones. However, the regulatory mechanisms and dynamic gene interaction networks underlying early placental development are understudied. Here, we generated RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from mouse fetal placenta tissues at embryonic day (e) 7.5, e8.5 and e9.5 to identify genes with timepoint-specific expression, then inferred gene interaction networks to analyze highly connected network modules. We determined that timepoint-specific gene network modules associated with distinct developmental processes, and with similar expression profiles to specific human placental cell populations. From each module, we obtained hub genes and their direct neighboring genes, which were predicted to govern placental functions. We confirmed that four novel candidate regulators identified through our analyses regulate cell migration in the HTR-8/SVneo cell line. Upon conclusion of this study, we were able to predict several novel regulators of placental development using network analysis of bulk RNA-seq data. Our findings and analysis approaches will be valuable for future studies investigating the transcriptional landscape of early placental development.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which animals can regenerate cells, tissues, or body parts varies largely. Hydra has a remarkable ability to undergo full body regeneration. Bisected polyps can regenerate the head and foot, and whole polyps can form from aggregates of cells. This capability is made possible by a cluster of cells known as the head organizer. This organizer has the capability to self-regulate and to induce a second axis. Previous studies have found Wnt3 and other developmental genes associated with head organizer function. Yet, the cellular composition and molecular program of regenerating tissue remains largely unknown. In this study, we used single cell RNA-seq from a regeneration time course to identify the molecular and cellular features of Hydra head regeneration. We identified nine distinct cell types in the regenerating head tissue, including candidate head organizer cells. We found Wnt-signaling and early wound response genes co-expressed with Wnt3, and all were more highly expressed in the head organizer cell cluster. In addition, we found that Wnt3 expression is likely being regulated by conserved developmental transcription factors. Our study reveals coordination of early wound response, developmental transcription factors, and transposable elements during Hydra tissue regeneration and provides insight into the evolution of development and regeneration programs.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) is the only passageway for macromolecules between nucleus and cytoplasm, and one of localization microscopys most important reference standards: it is massive and stereotypically arranged. The average architecture of NPC proteins has been resolved with pseudo-atomic precision, however observed NPC heterogeneities evidence a high degree of divergence from this average. Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) images NPCs at protein-level resolution, whereupon image analysis software studies NPC variability. However the true picture of NPC variability is unknown. In quantitative image analysis experiments, it is thus difficult to distinguish intrinsically high SMLM noise from true variability of the underlying structure.\n\nResultsWe introduce CIR4MICS (\"ceramics\", Configurable, Irregular Rings FOR MICroscopy Simulations), a pipeline that creates artificial datasets of structurally variable synthetic NPCs based on architectural models of the true NPC. Users can select one or more N- or C-terminally tagged NPC proteins, and simulate a wide range of geometric variations. We also represent the NPC as a spring-model such that arbitrary deforming forces, of user-defined magnitudes, simulate irregularly shaped variations. We provide an open-source simulation pipeline, as well as reference datasets of simulated human NPCs. Accompanying ground truth annotations allow to test the capabilities of image analysis software and facilitate a side-by-side comparison with real data. We demonstrate this by synthetically replicating a geometric analysis of real NPC radii and reveal that a wide range of simulated variability parameters can lead to observed results. Our simulator is therefore valuable to benchmark and develop image analysis methods, as well as to inform experimentalists about the requirements of hypothesis-driven imaging studies.\n\nAvailabilityCode: https://github.com/uhlmanngroup/cir4mics.

    "abstract": "Approximately 87% of the more than 190,000 atomic-level, (three-dimensional) 3D biostructures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) were determined using macromolecular crystallography (MX). Agreement between 3D atomic coordinates and experimental data for >100 million individual amino acid residues occurring within [~]150,000 PDB MX structures was analyzed in detail. The Real-Space-Correlation-Coefficient (RSCC) calculated using the 3D atomic coordinates for each residue and experimental electron density enables outlier detection of unreliable atomic coordinates (particularly important for poorly-resolved sidechain atoms) and ready evaluation of local structure quality by PDB users. For human protein MX structures in PDB, comparisons of per-residue RSCC experimental-agreement metric with AlphaFold2 computed structure model confidence (pLDDT-predicted local distance difference test) document (i) that RSCC values and pLDDT scores are correlated (median correlation coefficient[~]0.41), and (ii) that experimentally-determined MX structures (3.5 [A] resolution or better) are more reliable than AlphaFold2 computed structure models and should be used preferentially whenever possible.",
