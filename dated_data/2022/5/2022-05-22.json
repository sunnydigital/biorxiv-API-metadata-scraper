    "abstract": "The Gene Balance Hypothesis (GBH) proposes that selection acts on the dosage (i.e. copy number) of genes within dosage-sensitive portions of networks, pathways, and protein complexes to maintain balanced stoichiometry of interacting proteins, because perturbations to stoichiometric balance can result in reduced fitness. This selection has been called dosage balance selection. Dosage balance selection is also hypothesized to constrain expression responses to dosage changes, making dosage-sensitive genes (those encoding members of interacting proteins) experience more similar expression changes. In allopolyploids, where whole-genome duplication involves hybridization of diverged lineages, organisms often experience homoeologous exchanges (HEs) that recombine, duplicate, and delete homoeologous regions of the genome and alter the expression of homoeologous gene pairs. Although the GBH makes predictions about the expression response to HEs, they have not been empirically tested. We used genomic and transcriptomic data from six resynthesized, isogenic Brassica napus lines over ten generations to identify HEs, analyzed expression responses, and tested for patterns of genomic imbalance. Groups of dosage-sensitive genes had less variable expression responses to HEs than dosage-insensitive genes, a sign that their relative dosage is constrained. This difference was absent for homoeologous pairs whose expression was biased toward the BnA subgenome. Finally, the expression response to HEs was more variable than the response to WGD, suggesting HEs create genomic imbalance. These findings expand our knowledge of the impact of dosage balance selection on genome evolution and potentially connect patterns in polyploid genomes over time; from homoeolog expression bias to duplicate gene retention.",

    "abstract": "We develop a lattice model on the rate of hybridization of the complementary single-stranded DNAs (c-ssDNAs). Upon translational diffusion mediated collisions, c-ssDNAs interpenetrate each other to form correct (cc), incorrect (icc) and trap-correct contacts (tcc) inside the reaction volume. Correct contacts are those with exact registry matches which leads to nucleation and zipping. Incorrect contacts are the mismatch contacts which are less stable compared to tcc which can occur in the repetitive c-ssDNAs. Although tcc possess registry match within the repeating sequences, they are incorrect contacts in the view of the whole c-ssDNAs. The nucleation rate (kN) is directly proportional to the collision rate and the average number of correct-contacts (<ncc>) formed when both the c-ssDNAs interpenetrate each other. Detailed lattice model simulations suggest that [&lt;]ncc[&gt;] {propto} L/V where L is the length of c-ssDNAs and V is the reaction volume. Further numerical analysis revealed the scaling for the average radius of gyration of c-ssDNAs (Rg) with their length as [Formula]. Since the reaction space will be approximately a sphere with radius equals to 2Rg and V {propto} L3/2, one obtains [Formula]. When c-ssDNAs are nonrepetitive, then the overall renaturation rate becomes as kR {propto} kNL and one finally obtains [Formula] in line with the experimental observations. When c-ssDNAs are repetitive with a complexity of c, then earlier models suggested the scaling [Formula] which breaks down at c = L. This clearly suggested the existence of at least two different pathways of renaturation in case of repetitive c-ssDNAs viz. via incorrect contacts and trap correct contacts. The trap correct contacts can lead to the formation of partial duplexes which can keep the complementary strands in the close vicinity for a prolonged timescale. This is essential for the extended 1D slithering, inchworm movements and internal displacement mechanisms which can accelerate the searching for the correct contacts. Clearly, the extent of slithering dynamics will be inversely proportional to the complexity. When the complexity is close to the length of c-ssDNAs, then the pathway via incorrect contacts will dominate. When the complexity is much lesser than the length of c-ssDNA, then pathway via trap correct contacts would be the dominating one.\n\nPACS87.10.-e; 87.14.gk; 82.39.Pj; 87.15.R-",

    "abstract": "Many small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA)s are processed from introns of host genes, but the importance of splicing for proper biogenesis and the fate of the snoRNAs is not well understood. Here we show that inactivation of splicing factors or mutation of splicing signals leads to the accumulation of partially processed hybrid mRNA-snoRNA transcripts (hmsnoRNA). HmsnoRNAs are processed to the mature 3'-ends of the snoRNAs by the nuclear exosome and bound by snoRNP proteins. HmsnoRNAs are unaffected by translation-coupled RNA quality control pathways, but they are degraded by the major cytoplasmic exonuclease Xrn1p due to their mRNA-like 5'-extensions. These results show that completion of splicing is required to promote complete and accurate processing of intron-encoded snoRNAs and that splicing defects lead to degradation of hybrid mRNA-snoRNA species by cytoplasmic decay, underscoring the importance of splicing for the biogenesis of intron encoded snoRNAs.\n\nSignificance StatementSmall nucleolar RNAs mediate modifications of nucleosides within ribosomal RNAs, which are necessary for proper ribosomal function and translation. Many snoRNAs are encoded within introns of host genes and accurate biogenesis of these small RNAs is required to produce functional snoRNAs. The work presented here shows that when the splicing reactions are inactivated, snoRNAs undergo a distinct biogenesis pathway which leads to the production of aberrant hybrid RNAs that contain both mRNAs and small RNAs components of the host genes. While snoRNAs are primarily found in the nucleolus, these hybrid RNAs are degraded by the cytoplasmic mRNA degradation pathway. These results demonstrate the importance of splicing to promote accurate snoRNA processing and prevent the production of aberrant mRNA-snoRNA hybrids.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous fluctuations in arousal influence neural and behavioral responses to sensory stimuli. However, it is not known if and how animals regulate their arousal to respond to fluctuating behavioral demands. Here, we show results from mice performing an auditory feature-based sustained attention task with intermittently shifting task utility. We use pupil size to infer arousal across a wide range of states in a large behavioral cohort. We find that mice stabilize their arousal state near an intermediate and optimal level when task utility is high. In contrast, during epochs of low task utility they sample a broader and suboptimal range of arousal states. Using diffusion modeling, we further show that multiple computational elements of attention-based decisionmaking improve during high task utility and that arousal influences some, but not all, of them. Specifically, arousal influences the likelihood and timescale of sensory evidence accumulation, but not its quality. In sum, the results establish a specific attentional signature of adaptively self-regulated arousal and provide an experimental framework for understanding arousal self-regulation in brain disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.",

    "abstract": "Most prokaryotic proteins consist of a single structural domain (SD) with little intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that by themselves do not adopt stable structures, while the typical eukaryotic protein is comprised of multiple SDs and IDRs. How eukaryotic proteins evolved to differ from prokaryotic proteins has not been fully elucidated. Here, we found that the longer internal exons are, the more frequently they encode IDRs in eight eukaryotes including vertebrates, invertebrates, a fungus, and plants. Based on this observation, we propose the \"small bang\" model from the proteomic viewpoint: the protoeukaryotic genes had no introns and mostly encoded one SD each, but a majority of them subsequently divided into multiple exons (step 1). Many exons unconstrained by SDs elongated to encode IDRs (step 2). The elongated exons encoding IDRs frequently facilitated the acquisition of multiple SDs to make the last common ancestor of eukaryotes (step 3). One prediction of the model is that long internal exons are mostly unconstrained exons. Analytical results of the eight eukaryotes are consistent with this prediction. In support of the model, we identified cases of internal exons that elongated after the rat-mouse divergence and discovered that the expanded sections are mostly in unconstrained exons and preferentially encode IDRs. The model also predicts that SDs followed by long internal exons tend to have other SDs downstream. This prediction was also verified in all the eukaryotic species analysed. Our model accounts for the dichotomy between prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins and proposes a selective advantage conferred by IDRs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma (GB) is the most severe form of brain cancer, with a 12-15 month median survival. Surgical resection, temozolomide (TMZ) treatment, and radiotherapy (RT) remain the primary therapeutic options for GB, and no new therapies have been introduced in recent years. This therapeutic standstill is primarily due to preclinical approaches that do not fully respect the complexity of GB cell biology and fail to test efficiently anti-cancer treatments. Therefore, better treatment screening approaches are needed. In this study, we have developed a novel functional precision medicine approach to test the response to anticancer treatments in organoids derived from the resected tumors of glioblastoma patients.\n\nMethodsGB organoids were grown for a short period of time to prevent any genetic and morphological evolution and divergence from the tumor of origin. We chose metabolic imaging by NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to predict early and non-invasively ex-vivo anti-cancer treatment responses of GB organoids. TMZ was used as the benchmark drug to validate the approach. Whole-transcriptome and whole-exome analyses were then performed to characterize tumor cases stratification.\n\nResultsOur functional precision medicine approach was completed within one week after surgery and two groups of TMZ Responder and Non Responder tumors were identified. FLIM-based metabolic tumor stratification was well-reflected at the molecular level, confirming the validity of our approach, highlighting also new target genes associated with TMZ treatment and identifying a new 17 gene molecular signature associated with survival. The number of promoter methylated tumors for the MGMT gene was higher in the responsive group, as expected, however, some non-methylated tumor cases turned out to be nevertheless responsive to TMZ, suggesting that our procedure could be synergistic with the classical MGMT methylation biomarker.\n\nConclusionsFor the first time, FLIM-based metabolic imaging was used on ex-vivo live glioblastoma organoids. Unlike other approaches, ex-vivo patient-tailored drug response is performed at an early stage of tumor culturing with no animal involvement and with minimal tampering with the original tumor cytoarchitecture. This functional precision medicine approach can be exploited in a range of clinical and laboratory settings to improve the clinical management of GB patients and implemented on other cancers as well.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a program of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis resistance, and cytokine release induced by stress exposure in metazoan cells. Landmark studies in laboratory mice have characterized a number of master senescence regulators, including p16INK4a, p21, NF-kB, p53, and C/EBP{beta}. To discover other molecular players in senescence, we developed a screening approach to harness the evolutionary divergence between mouse species. We found that primary cells from the Mediterranean mouse Mus spretus, when treated with DNA damage to induce senescence, produced less cytokine and had less-active lysosomes than cells from laboratory M. musculus. We used allele-specific expression profiling to catalog senescence-dependent cis-regulatory variation between the species at thousands of genes. We then tested for correlation between these expression changes and interspecies sequence variants in the binding sites of transcription factors. Among the emergent candidate senescence regulators, we chose a little-studied cell cycle factor, USF2, for molecular validation. In acute irradiation experiments, cells lacking USF2 had compromised DNA damage repair and response. Longer-term senescent cultures without USF2 mounted an exaggerated senescence regulatory program--shutting down cell cycle and DNA repair pathways, and turning up cytokine expression, more avidly than wild-type. We interpret these findings under a model of pro-repair, anti-senescence regulatory function by USF2. Our study affords new insights into the mechanisms by which cells commit to senescence, and serves as a validated proof of concept for natural variation-based regulator screens.",

    "abstract": "In Escherichia coli and Salmonella, many genes silenced by the nucleoid structuring protein H-NS are activated upon inhibiting Rho-dependent transcription termination. This response is poorly understood and difficult to reconcile with the view that H-NS acts mainly by blocking transcription initiation. Here we have analysed the basis for the upregulation of H-NS-silenced Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 (SPI-1) in cells depleted of Rho-cofactor NusG. Evidence from genetic experiments, semi-quantitative 5 RACE-Seq and ChiP-Seq shows that transcription originating from spurious antisense promoters, when not stopped by Rho, elongates into a H-NS-bound regulatory region of SPI-1, displacing H-NS and rendering the DNA accessible to the master regulator HilD. In turn, HilDs ability to activate its own transcription triggers a positive feedback loop that results in transcriptional activation of the entire SPI-1. Significantly, single-cell analyses revealed that this mechanism is largely responsible for the coexistence of two subpopulations of cells that, although genetically identical, either express or dont express SPI-1 genes. We propose that cell-to-cell differences produced by stochastic spurious transcription, combined with feedback loops that perpetuate the activated state, can generate bimodal gene expression patterns in bacterial populations.",

    "abstract": "TRAF6 is an adapter protein and E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in signaling downstream of cell receptors essential for development and the immune system. TRAF6 participates in many protein-protein interactions, some of which are mediated by a C-terminal MATH domain that recruits TRAF6 to cell-surface receptors and associated proteins. The TRAF6 MATH domain binds to short peptide segments containing the motif PxExx[FYWHDE], where x is any amino acid. Blocking TRAF6 interactions is associated with favorable effects in various disease models. To better define the TRAF6 MATH domain binding preferences, we generated a bacterial cell-surface peptide display library to sample the TRAF6 motif sequence space. We performed sorting experiments and identified 236 of the best TRAF6-interacting peptides and a set of 1,200 peptides that match the sequence PxE but do not bind TRAF6. Selected binders, tested by single-clone bacterial display titrations and bio-layer interferometry, bound TRAF6 tighter than previously measured native peptides. To elucidate the structural basis for TRAF6 interaction preferences, we built all-atom structural models of the TRAF6 MATH domain in complex with high-affinity binders and motif-matching nonbinders that were identified in the screen. We identified motif features that favor binding to TRAF6 as well as negative design elements distributed across the motif that can disfavor or preclude binding. Searching the human proteome for matches to the library screening-defined binding motif revealed that most known, biologically relevant TRAF6 motif matches occupy a different sequence space from the most enriched hits discovered in combinatorial library screening. Our experimentally determined binding preferences and structural models can support the design of peptide-based interaction inhibitors with higher affinities than endogenous TRAF6 ligands.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundModern medicine is equipped with huge amounts of big biological datasets and a wide range of computational methods to understand the molecular events underlying complex disorders. The recent availability of omics data allows a holistic view towards the interactions of various biomolecule types. However, the constructed maps are static, ignoring the dynamicity of molecular processes. On the other hand, the dynamic models of biological systems are commonly generated in small scales. Hence, the construction of large scale dynamic models that can quantitatively predict the time-course cellular behaviors is a big challenge. This study was aimed at developing a pipeline for automatic construction of such models from time-course experimental data.\n\nResultsInformation of interactions between input genes is retrieved from SIGNORE 2.0 database and an interaction network is constructed which then is translated to biochemistry language and converted to a biochemical reactions network. In the next step, a large-scale ODE system is constructed by generating the ODE equivalent of each biochemical reaction. To estimate the kinetics parameters of the ODE model, a novel large-scale parameter approximation method is proposed. This method gives an estimation of system parameters by fitting model outputs to time-course experimental measurements. The total pipeline is provided as a MATLAB toolbox called SPADAN, standing for Systematic Protein Association Dynamic ANalyzer. Using multilayer time-series experimental data, the performance of the pipeline was checked by modeling 4379 regulatory interactions between 768 molecules in colon cancer cells exposed to chemotherapy agents.\n\nConclusionStarting from time-series experimental data, SPADAN automatically constructs map of interactions, generates an ODE system, and performs a parameter approximation procedure. It constructs genome-scale dynamic models, filling the gap between large-scale static and small-scale dynamic modeling strategies. This simulation approach allows for holistic quantitative predictions which is critical for the simulation of therapeutic interventions in precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "The blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) tightly regulates molecular transport from the blood to the spinal cord. Herein, we present a novel approach for transient modulation of BSCB permeability and localized delivery of peptides into the spinal cord for behavior modulation with high spatial resolution. This approach utilizes optical stimulation of vasculature-targeted nanoparticles and allows delivery of BSCB-nonpermeable molecules into the spinal cord without significant glial activation or impact on animal locomotor behavior. We demonstrate minimally invasive light delivery into the spinal cord using an optical fiber and BSCB permeability modulation in the lumbar region. Our method of BSCB modulation allows delivery of bombesin, a centrally-acting and itch-inducing peptide, into the spinal cord and induces a rapid and transient increase in itching behaviors in mice. This minimally invasive approach enables behavior modulation without genetic modifications and is promising for delivering a wide range of biologics into the spinal cord for behavior modulation and potentially therapy.\n\nSignificance StatementSpinal cord diseases and disorders are common and cause significant disability, including chronic pain, paralysis, cognitive impairment, and mortality. The blood-spinal cord barrier is a considerable challenge for delivery by systemic therapeutic administration. We developed an optical approach for effectively and safely delivering molecules to the spinal cord to overcome this barrier. The fiberoptic method is minimally invasive and overcomes challenges that previous technologies face, including the complicated bone structure and standing waves that complicate BSCB opening using ultrasound. Optical stimulation offers unprecedented spatial resolution for the precise delivery in intricate spinal cord structures. Significantly, our approach modulates animal behavior (i.e., itch) without genetic modifications and demonstrates the potential for delivery of biologics such as peptides into the spinal cord.",

Here we show that the Cb-SNc form monosynaptic glutamatergic synapses with both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons in the SNc. Optogenetic activation Cb-SNc axons in the SNc rapidly increases SNc activity, elevates striatal dopamine levels, and increases the probability of locomotion. During ongoing behavior, Cb-SNc axons are bilaterally activated prior to ambulation and unilateral lever manipulation. The Cb-SNc axons show prominent activation to water reward, and higher activation for sweet water, suggesting that the pathway also encodes reward value. Thus, the cerebellum directly, rapidly, and effectively modulates basal ganglia dopamine levels and conveys information related to movement initiation, vigor, and possibly reward processing.",

    "abstract": "The fossil record is essential for understanding when lineages originate and their pace of diversification. However, numerous taphonomic biases in the fossil record can hinder interpretation, creating discord between palaeontological and phylogenetic estimates of clade origination dates. Here, I use the recently published Bayesian Brownian Bridge method to infer the age of birds using occurrence data from the Paleobiology Database. I also estimate the age of the speciose sub-clade Telluraves to compare age estimates with previous tip-dating analyses of the same group. Analyses of all birds show place the root age approximately 100 Ma, approximately 26 Myr before the oldest fossil occurrences. Increasing the time bin size from 2.5 to 5 Myr produced significantly older and less precise estimates. Divergence estimates for Telluraves were strikingly consistent with tip-dating analyses, placing origination of the group in the latest Cretaceous. Although these dates are consistent with a hypothesis of Mesozoic origination and Cenozoic diversification, significant diversification was estimated before the end-Cretaceous mass extinction suggesting analyses using pooled species counts may produce spurious results. Overall, these analyses provide further evidence to a growing consensus that several major avian lineages survived the end-Cretaceous mass extinction before diversifying into the most speciose extant tetrapod radiation.",

    "abstract": "Extracting information on the selective and demographic past of populations that is contained in samples of genome sequences requires a description of the distribution of the underlying genealogies. Using the Laplace transform, this distribution can be generated with a simple recursive procedure, regardless of model complexity. Assuming an infinite-sites mutation model, the probability of observing specific configurations of linked variants within small haplotype blocks can be recovered from the Laplace transform of the joint distribution of branch lengths. However, the repeated differentiation required to compute these probabilities has proven to be a serious computational bottleneck in earlier implementations.\n\nHere, I show that the state space diagram can be turned into a computational graph, allowing efficient evaluation of the Laplace transform by means of a graph traversal algorithm. This general algorithm can, for example, be applied to tabulate the likelihoods of mutational configurations in non-recombining blocks. This work provides a crucial speed up for existing composite likelihood approaches that rely on the joint distribution of branch lengths to fit isolation with migration models and estimate the parameters of selective sweeps.

    "abstract": "Social affinity and collective behavior are nearly ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, but many lineages feature evolutionarily asocial species. These solitary species may have evolved to conserve energy in food-sparse environments. However, the mechanism by which metabolic shifts regulate social affinity is not well investigated. In this study, we used the Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus), which features riverine sighted surface (surface fish) and cave-dwelling populations (cavefish), to address the impact of metabolic shifts on asociality and other cave-associated behaviors in cavefish, including repetitive turning, sleeplessness, swimming longer distances, and enhanced foraging behavior. After one month of ketosis-inducing ketogenic diet feeding, asocial cavefish exhibited significantly higher social affinity, whereas social affinity regressed in cavefish fed the standard diet. The ketogenic diet also reduced repetitive turning and swimming in cavefish. No major behavioral shifts were found regarding sleeplessness and foraging behavior, suggesting that other evolved behaviors are not largely regulated by ketosis. We further examined the effects of the ketogenic diet via supplementation with extragenic ketone bodies, revealing that ketone bodies are pivotal molecules positively associated with social affinity. Our study indicated that fish that evolved to be asocial remain capable of exhibiting social affinity under ketosis, possibly linking the seasonal food availability and sociality.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system is a proteolytic pathway that removes damaged and unwanted proteins. Their selective turnover is initiated by ubiquitin (Ub) attachment, mainly by Ub ligases that recognize substrates through their short linear motifs termed degrons. A degradation-targeting degron comprises a nearby Ub-modified residue and an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) involved in interaction with the proteasome. Degron-signaling has been studied over the last decades, yet there are no resources for systematic screening of degron sites to facilitate studies on their biological significance, such as targeted protein degradation approaches. To bridge this gap, we developed DEGRONOPEDIA, a web server that allows exploration of degron motifs in the proteomes of seven model organisms and maps these data to Lys, Cys, Thr, and Ser residues that can undergo ubiquitination and to IDRs proximal to them, both in sequence and structure. The server also reports the post-translational modifications and pathogenic mutations within the degron and its flanking regions, as these can modulate the degrons accessibility. Degrons often occur at the amino or carboxyl end of a protein substrate, acting as initiators of the N-/C-degron pathway, respectively. Therefore, since they may appear following the protease cleavage, DEGRONOPEDIA simulate sequence nicking based on experimental data and theoretical predictions and screen for emerging degron motifs. Moreover, we implemented machine learning to predict the stability of the N-/C-termini, facilitating the identification of substrates of the N-/C-degron pathways. We are confident that our tool will stimulate research on degron-signaling providing output information in a ready-to-validate context. DEGRONOPEDIA can be freely accessed at degronopedia.com.",

Somatic oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA, encoding p110-PI3K, specifically cause venous and lymphatic malformations (LM), yet the basis of vessel type-restricted disease manifestation is unknown. Here we report endothelial subtype-specific responses to the common causative Pik3caH1047R mutation, and reveal a new immunoregulatory subtype of dermal lymphatic capillary endothelial cells (iLECs) as a driver of LM pathology. Mouse model of Pik3caH1047R-driven vascular malformations showed that cell proliferation was a common early response of venous and lymphatic ECs to oncogenic Pik3ca, but sustained selectively in LECs of advanced lesions. Lymphatic overgrowth was associated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and pro-lymphangiogenic myeloid cell infiltrate. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed a new LEC subtype at capillary terminals, characterized by the expression of immunoregulatory genes. Selective expansion and activation of iLECs in the Pik3caH1047R mice was evidenced by proliferation and upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes. Importantly, macrophage depletion or anti-inflammatory COX-2 inhibition limited Pik3caH1047R-driven lymphangiogenesis. This provides a therapeutic target for LM and suggests a paracrine crosstalk in which LEC-autonomous oncogenic Pik3ca signaling induces immune activation that in turn sustains pathological lymphangiogenesis. Identification of iLECs indicates that peripheral lymphatic vessels not only respond to inflammation but also actively orchestrate the immune response.",

    "abstract": "Two major mechanisms have evolved to safeguard genome stability during mitosis: the mitotic checkpoint delays mitosis until all chromosomes have attached to microtubules, and the kinetochore-microtubule error-correction pathway keeps this attachment process free from errors. We demonstrate here that the optimal strength and dynamics of both processes is set by a kinase-phosphatase pair (PLK1-PP2A) that engage in negative feedback on the BUB complex. Uncoupling this homeostatic feedback to skew the balance towards PLK1 produces a strong checkpoint, weak microtubule attachments, and mitotic delays. Conversely, skewing the balance towards PP2A causes a weak checkpoint, strong microtubule attachments, and chromosome segregation errors. The number of MELT motifs on the KNL1 signalling scaffold sets the optimal levels of each enzyme, because engineering KNL1 to recruit too many BUB complexes increases KNL1-PLK1/PP2A levels, and enhances checkpoint/microtubule attachment strength. In contrast, recruiting too few BUB complexes lowers KNL1-PLK1/PP2A, and decreases checkpoint/microtubule attachment strength. Both of these situations are associated with chromosome segregation errors. Together, these data demonstrate how a single bifunctional kinase-phosphatase module integrates two major mitotic processes to help preserve genome stability.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian aging is characterized by the progressive loss of tissue integrity and function manifesting in ill health and increased risk for developing multiple chronic conditions. Accumulation of senescent cells in aging tissues partly contributes to this decline and targeted depletion of senescent cells in vivo ameliorates many age-related phenotypes. However, the fundamental molecular mechanisms responsible for the decline of cellular health and fitness during senescence and aging are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated whether chromatin-mediated loss of transcriptional fidelity, known to contribute to fitness and survival in yeast and worms, also occurs during human cellular senescence and mouse aging. Our findings reveal that aberrant transcription initiation inside genes is widespread in senescence and aging. It co-occurs with changes in the chromatin landscape and formation of non-canonical transcription start sites. Interventions that alter spurious transcripts have dramatic consequences on cellular health primarily affecting intracellular signal transduction pathways. We propose that spurious transcription is a conserved hallmark of aging that promotes a noisy transcriptome and degradation of coherent transcriptional networks.",

    "abstract": "Proximity-dependent protein labeling provides a powerful in vivo strategy to characterize the interactomes of specific proteins. We previously optimized a proximity labeling protocol for C. elegans using the highly active biotin ligase TurboID. A significant constraint on the sensitivity of TurboID is the presence of abundant, endogenously biotinylated proteins that take up bandwidth in the mass spectrometer, notably carboxylases that use biotin as a co-factor. In C. elegans, these comprise POD-2/acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, PCCA-1/propionyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, PYC-1/pyruvate carboxylase and MCCC-1/methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase alpha. We developed ways to remove these carboxylases prior to streptavidin purification and mass spectrometry, by engineering their corresponding genes to add a C-terminal His10 tag. This allows us to deplete them from C. elegans lysates using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). To demonstrate the methods efficacy, we use it to expand the interactome map of the presynaptic active zone protein ELKS-1. We identify many known active zone proteins, as well as previously uncharacterized potentially synaptic proteins. Our approach provides a quick and inexpensive solution to a common contaminant problem in biotin- dependent proximity labeling. The approach may be applicable to other model organisms and will enable deeper and more complete analysis of interactors for proteins of interest.",

However, most current photo-responsive DNA switches are limited either by irreversible switching or reversible switching with impractically slow kinetics. Here, we report the design of an intramolecular triplex photoswitch (TPS) design based on single-stranded DNA that undergoes rapid and reversible photoswitching between folded and unfolded states through isomerization of internal azobenzene modifications. After optimizing the performance of our photoswitch design, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal how individual azobenzenes contribute to the stabilization or destabilization of the triplex depending on their photoisomerization state. By coupling our TPS to an existing aptamer, we can reversibly modulate its binding affinity with less than 15 seconds of UV light exposure. We further demonstrate reproducible shifting in affinity over multiple cycles of UV and blue light irradiation without substantial photobleaching. Given that our TPS can introduce switching functionality to aptamers without manipulating the aptamer sequence itself, we believe our design methodology should offer a versatile means for integrating photo-responsive properties into DNA nanostructures.",

    "abstract": "Scientific conferences increasingly include online aspects. Some are moving to be entirely virtual while others are adopting hybrid models in which there are both in-person and virtual elements. This development of opportunities for people to attend conferences virtually has the potential to both reduce their environmental impact and to make access to them more equitable. An issue with virtual conference participation that has been raised, however, is that there is a reduction in informal communication between attendees. This is an important deficit as such informal contacts play a significant role in both knowledge transmission and professional network development. One forum where some informal communication around conferences does occur is Twitter, with this being encouraged by some conferences. It is not clear, though, to what extent the informal networks built around this service help reduce the problems of unequal access see with in-person conferences. Focusing on geographical equity, we looked at Twitter usage surrounding four international conferences between 2010 and 2021. It was found that engagement with conference hashtags increased steadily over time, peaking in 2019. Users represented 9% of conference attendees and were primarily located in Europe and North America, communicating primarily in English (97% of tweets). Hub nodes within the interaction network were also primarily located in these regions. East Asia had fewer users than would be expected based on neuroscience publication numbers from that region. What users there were in East Asia were engaged with less than were users in other regions. It was found that the overall interaction network showed a rich-club structure, where users with more connections tend to interact more with others with similar connections. Finally, it was found that users in Europe and North America tend to communicate with other users in their own regions whereas users in the rest of the world direct their interactions out of their region. These results suggest that although conference-related Twitter use has been successful to some degree in opening up access, there are some notable limitations in its usage that may mirror aspects of inequality inherent to in-person conferences. How to build equitable informal communication networks around virtual conferences remains a challenging question that requires further discussion.",

    "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation is one of the most widespread post-translational modifications in biology. With the advent of mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, more than 200,000 sites of serine and threonine phosphorylation have been reported, of which several thousand have been associated with human diseases and biological processes. For the vast majority of phosphorylation events, it is not yet known which of the more than 300 protein Ser/Thr kinases encoded in the human genome is responsible. Here, we utilize synthetic peptide libraries to profile the substrate sequence specificity of nearly every functional human Ser/Thr kinase. Viewed in its entirety, the substrate specificity of the kinome was substantially more diverse than expected and was driven extensively by negative selectivity. Our kinome-wide dataset was used to computationally annotate and identify the most likely protein kinases for every reported phosphorylation site in the human Ser/Thr phosphoproteome. For the small minority of phosphosites where the protein kinases involved have been previously identified, our predictions were in excellent agreement. When this approach was applied to examine the signaling response of tissues and cell lines to hormones, growth factors, targeted inhibitors, and environmental or genetic perturbations, it revealed unexpected insights into pathway complexity and compensation. Overall, these studies reveal the full extent of substrate specificity of the human Ser/Thr kinome, illuminate cellular signaling responses, and provide a rich resource to link unannotated phosphorylation events to biological pathways.",

    "abstract": "Histone acetylation is a key component in the consolidation of long-term fear memories. Epigenetic enzymes involved in histone acetylation, including histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases, have been put forward as potential pharmacological targets in the treatment of pathological fear memories, such as those that underlie post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, these enzymes typically play a ubiquitous role in gene regulation, which precludes the clinical use of systemic manipulations. Recently, we have found that a nuclear-localized metabolic enzyme, Acetyl-coA synthetase 2 (Acss2), modulates histone acetylation during learning and memory. Loss of Acss2 is well-tolerated in mice, with no impact on general health or baseline behavior. Here, we show that an Acss2 null mouse model shows reduced acquisition of long-term fear memories in assays of contextual and cued fear conditioning. We find that loss of Acss2 leads to consolidation-specific reductions in both histone acetylation and the expression of critical learning and memory-related genes in the dorsal hippocampus. Further, we show that systemic administration of blood-brain-barrier (BBB)-permeable Acss2 inhibitors during the consolidation window reduces fear memory formation in mice and rats, and also reduces anxiety in a predator-scent-stress (PSS) paradigm. Our findings suggest that Acss2 plays a critical role in the formation of fear memories, and represents a potential pharmacological target in the treatment of PTSD.",

    "abstract": "In order to explore the mechanism of general anesthesia emergence, based on the common clinical phenomenon-delayed emergence, we explore the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus in promoting awakening from sevoflurane anesthesia in mice model. In this study, C57BL/6J male mice were selected to specifically activate or inhibit 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and different 5-HT receptors by intraperitoneal, lateral ventricle, intranuclear or DRN injection of agonists/antagonists and optogenetics during the sevoflurane anesthesia to record and observe the anesthesia induction and emergence time of mice. Through intraventricular infusion and intranuclear microinjection of 5-HT and the agonists or antagonists of different 5-HT receptors, our data showed that 5-HT and 5-HT1A and 2A/C receptors, especially 5-HT1A receptor, are involved in the regulation of delayed awakening mediated by DRN 5-HT neurons. This can provide a reliable theoretical basis as well as potential targets for clinical intervention to prevent delayed emergence and some postoperative risks.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/492958v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (68K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ff4f7forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bc56dborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ea5737org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@41548_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The factors that govern differentiation of graft-directed effector CD8+ T cells could lead to targeted approaches to limit acute rejection. Using MHC Class I tetramers, we found that allogeneic CD8+ T cells were present at an elevated precursor frequency in naive mice, only modestly increased in number after grafting, and maintained high T cell receptor diversity throughout the immune response. While antigen-specific effector CD8+ T cells poorly express the canonical effector marker KLRG-1, expression of the activated glycoform of CD43 defined potent effectors after transplantation. Activated CD43+ effector T cells maintained high expression of ICOS in the presence of CTLA-4 Ig, and dual CTLA-4 Ig/anti-ICOS treatment prolonged graft survival. These data demonstrate that graft-specific CD8+ T cells have a distinct response profile relative to anti-pathogen CD8+ T cells, and that CD43 and ICOS are critical surface receptors that define potent effector CD8+ T cell populations that form after transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Intricate molecular communication between the schistosome (flatworms) and its mammalian host, as well as between paired male and female schistosomes has shaped the secreted proteome of these flatworms. Whereas the schistosome egg is responsible for the disease manifestations of chronic schistosomiasis, the long lived, adult female and male stages also release mediators that facilitate their long-lived intra-vascular existence in a hostile niche where they are bathed in immune cells and effector molecules. However, despite their importance, no studies have focused on analysing the excretory/secretory products (ESPs) from adult schistosomes.\n\nHerein, ESPs from cultured Schistosoma mansoni male or female adult worms were identified, quantified, compared and contrasted using a label-free proteomic approach. Approximately 1,000 proteins were identified, from which almost 800 could be finally quantified. Considering the proteins uniquely identified and proteins with a significantly regulated expression pattern in male or female flukes, a total of 370 and 140 proteins were more abundantly secreted by males and females, respectively. Using functional analysis networks showing the gene ontology terms and KEGG pathways with the highest significance, we observed that male schistosomes secrete proteins related to carbohydrate metabolism, cytoskeletal organisation more abundantly than females, while female worms secreted more hydrolases and proteins involved in cellular homeostasis than males.\n\nThis analysis doubles the number of previously reported ESPs from S. mansoni, contributing to a better understanding of the host-parasite dynamic interactions. Furthermore, these findings expand potential vaccine and diagnostic candidates for this neglected tropical disease pathogen, which will enable deeper understanding of the molecular communication critical to parasitism.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how in vivo platelet biogenesis is undertaken is critical to making on-demand platelet production for clinical use feasible. We recently described the discovery of plasma membrane budding as a major in vivo platelet-producing pathway. In vitro recapitulation of this finding could pave the way towards efficient laboratory-based platelet production.\n\nThe plausibility of the plasma membrane budding model has been called into question. The foundation of this is the contention that the size and payload composition of plasma membrane buds are not consistent with bona fide platelets. Thus, membrane buds likely represent stages in megakaryocyte-derived microparticle formation.\n\nUsing 3D super-resolution imaging, we have performed a quantitative comparison of size and organelle content of plasma membrane buds, platelets, and microparticles in the adult mouse bone marrow. We unequivocally demonstrate that the structures we previously described as membrane buds exhibit the same size range as free platelets, that all buds contain organelles, and that membrane buds and free platelets contained an equivalent number of organelles. Crucially, membrane buds and microparticles are completely distinct from each other. To prevent future confusion between the processes of microparticle formation and platelet biogenesis, we propose using the more specific term \"pre-platelet membrane buds\".",

Analysis of size frequency distribution (SFD) of hard corals enables post hoc assessments of major demographic events (e.g., recruitment and mortality) that follow ecological disturbances. Here, we present an evaluation of current reef health, SFD and recruitment of 37 morpho-taxa in Northeast Peninsular Malaysia. Results highlight stress viable demographic structure of massive taxa (e.g., massive Porites) and significant differences of SFD across gradients of reef health, whereby degraded sites were predominantly characterized by negatively skewed (e.g., large colonies) and leptokurtic (e.g., high population turnover) distribution of dominant hard coral taxa. Ultimately, results suggest that locally coral reef degradation can exceed tipping points, after which annual monsoon conditions and degraded reef substrates interact to reinforce and manifest negative feedback loops, thereby impeding demographic recovery, and altering coral SFD and population assemblage.",

    "abstract": "While most ant species establish a colony independently, some socially parasitic ants build the foundation of their colony by invading other ant (host) colonies and utilizing their labour forces. Many socially parasitic ants disguise their cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile, which is also known as nestmate discrimination pheromones, when invading the host colony. Since the strategy of chemical disguise is widespread in socially parasitic ants, elucidating the mechanism of chemical disguise will promote knowledge on the evolutionary history of social parasitism. However, detailed knowledge is still lacking, as the relevant information has only originated from circumstantial evidence, which was obtained from ecological observations. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of chemical disguise in a new queen of a temporary socially parasitic spiny ant (Polyrhachis lamellidens) by measuring its CHC profile, performing a tracing assay with labelled substances, and analysing gene expression levels. First, after rubbing behaviour was observed against the host workers, the CHC profile in P. lamellidens shifted to pronounced peaks that closely resembling that of the host workers. We also observed a reduction in aggressive behaviours by the host ant against P. lamellidens after rubbing behaviour was performed. In addition, P. lamellidens acquired artificially-applied labelling substances from host workers through their rubbing behaviours, while gene expression profiling showed the expression of CHC synthesis-related genes did not change during this behaviour. These results suggest that P. lamellidens directly obtains host CHCs through rubbing behaviour, and these host CHCs enables P. lamellidens to remain disguised during colony invasion.",

Canonical view of host-pathogen interactions supposes two possible outcomes. Because of immune defence being an energy/resource intensive function, an infected female reallocates resources away from reproductive processes and towards immune defence, therefore compromising its reproductive output. Alternatively, faced with impending mortality, an infected female increases its reproductive output to compensate for lost opportunities of future reproduction. We tested if pathogen identity, infection outcome (survival vs. death), and/or time of death determines the reproductive output of females infected with three bacterial pathogens. Our results show that pathogen identity is a reliable predictor of population level response of infected females but does not reliably predict the behaviour of individual females. Additionally, females succumbing to infection exhibit greater variability in reproductive output, compared to both survivors and controls, but this variability is not explained by either the time of death or the identity of the infecting pathogen. Furthermore, survivors of infection have reproductive output similar to control females.",

    "abstract": "Sequence-based deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown superior performance on a wide range of genomic tasks. A key limitation of these models is the lack of interpretability, slowing down their adoption by the genomics community. Current approaches to model interpretation do not readily reveal how a model makes predictions, can be computationally intensive, and depend on the implemented architecture. Here, we introduce ExplaiNN, an adaptation of neural additive models[1] for genomic tasks wherein predictions are computed as a linear combination of multiple independent CNNs, each consisting of a single convolutional filter and fully connected layers. This approach brings together the expressiveness of CNNs with the interpretability of linear models, providing global (cell state level) as well as local (individual sequence level) biological insights into the data. We use ExplaiNN to predict transcription factor (TF) binding and chromatin accessibility states, demonstrating performance levels comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while providing a transparent view of the models predictions in a straightforward manner. Applied to de novo motif discovery, ExplaiNN identifies equivalent motifs to those obtained from specialized algorithms across a range of datasets. Finally, we present ExplaiNN as a plug-and-play platform in which pretrained TF binding models and annotated position weight matrices from reference databases can be easily combined. We expect that ExplaiNN will accelerate the adoption of deep learning by biological domain experts in their daily genomic sequence analyses.",

    "abstract": "The formation of membraneless biomolecular condensates is driven by macromolecules with sticker-and-spacer architectures that undergo phase separation coupled to percolation (PSCP). Driving forces for PSCP are governed by the interplay between reversible inter-sticker crosslinks and solvation preferences of spacers. Here, we introduce molecular and mesoscale descriptions of structures within, outside, and at the interfaces of condensates that are formed by prion-like low complexity domains (PLCDs), which are exemplars of intrinsically disordered, linear multivalent proteins. Our studies are based on simulations that accurately describe sequence-specific phase behaviors of PLCDs. We find that networks of reversible, intermolecular, inter-sticker crosslinks organize PLCDs into small-world topologies within condensates. These topologies result from distinct conformational preferences within dense, dilute, and interfacial regions. Specifically, the degree of conformational expansion varies non-monotonically, being most expanded at the interface and most compact in the dilute phase with molecules preferring to be oriented perpendicular to condensate interfaces. This contrasts with dense and dilute phases where molecules are randomly oriented relative to one another. Our results demonstrate that even simple condensates, with only one type of macromolecule, feature inhomogeneous spatial organizations of molecules and interfacial features that likely prime them for being locations of biochemical activity.",

    "abstract": "T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) is a NOTCH1-driven disease in need of novel therapies. Here, we identify a NOTCH1-SIRT1-KAT7 link as a therapeutic vulnerability in T-ALL, in which SIRT1 is overexpressed downstream of a novel NOTCH1-bound enhancer. SIRT1 loss impairs leukemia generation, while SIRT1 overexpression accelerates leukemia and confers resistance to NOTCH1 inhibition in a deacetylase-dependent manner. Moreover, secondary SIRT1 loss extends survival and synergizes with NOTCH1 inhibition. Global acetyl-proteomics upon SIRT1 loss uncovered hyperacetylation of KAT7 and BRD1, subunits of a histone acetyltransferase complex targeting H4K12. Metabolic and gene expression profiling revealed a metabolic crisis together with a transcriptional signature resembling KAT7 deletion. Consistently, SIRT1 loss resulted in reduced H4K12ac, and overexpression of a non-acetylatable KAT7 mutant partly rescued SIRT1 loss-induced proliferation defects. The newly unveiled NOTCH1-SIRT1-KAT7 axis uncovers novel therapeutic targets in T-ALL and reveals a circular feedback mechanism balancing deacetylase/acetyltransferase activation with potentially broad relevance in cancer.\n\nStatement of significanceWe identified a novel axis in T-ALL whereby NOTCH1 activates SIRT1 through an enhancer region, and SIRT1 deacetylates and activates KAT7. Targeting SIRT1 shows antileukemic effects, partly mediated by KAT7 inactivation. Our results identify novel therapeutic targets and uncover a rheostat mechanism between deacetylase/acetyltransferase activities with potentially broader cancer relevance.",

    "abstract": "The skin epithelium acts as the barrier between an organisms internal and external environments. In zebrafish and other freshwater organisms, this barrier function requires withstanding a large osmotic pressure differential. Wounds breach this epithelium, causing a large disruption to the tissue microenvironment due to the mixing of isotonic interstitial fluid with the external hypotonic fresh water. Here we show that, following acute injury, the larval zebrafish epidermis undergoes a dramatic fissuring process that resembles hydraulic fracturing, driven by the influx of external fluid. The fissuring starts in the basal epidermal layer nearest to the wound, and then propagates at a constant rate through the tissue spanning over one hundred micrometers; during this process the outermost superficial epidermal layer remains intact. Fissuring is completely inhibited when larvae are wounded in an isotonic external media, suggesting that osmotic pressure gradients drive fissure. Additionally, fissuring partially depends on myosin II activity, as its inhibition reduces fissure propagation away from the wound. During and after fissuring, the basal layer forms large macropinosomes (with cross-sectional areas ranging from 1-10 {micro}m2), presumably to clear the excess fluid. We conclude that excess external fluid entry through the wound and subsequent closure of the wound through actomyosin purse string contraction in the superficial cell layer causes fluid pressure buildup in the extracellular space of the zebrafish epidermis. This excess fluid pressure causes tissue to fissure, and eventually the fluid is cleared through macropinocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of heart failure in diabetes. At the cellular level, diabetic cardiomyopathy leads to altered mitochondrial energy metabolism and cardiomyocyte ultrastructure. We combined electron microscopy and computational modelling to understand the impact of diabetes induced ultrastructural changes on cardiac bioenergetics.\n\nWe collected transverse micrographs of multiple control and type I diabetic rat cardiomyocytes using electron microscopy. Micrographs were converted to finite element meshes, and bioenergetics was simulated over them using a biophysical model. The simulations also incorporated depressed mitochondrial capacity for oxidative phosphorylation and creatine kinase reactions to simulate diabetes induced mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nAnalysis of micrographs revealed a 14% decline in mitochondrial area fraction in diabetic cardiomyocytes, and an irregular arrangement of mitochondria and myofibrils. Simulations predicted that this irregular arrangement, coupled with depressed activity of mitochondrial creatine kinase enzymes, leads to large spatial variation in ADP/ATP profile of diabetic cardiomyocytes. However, when spatially averaged, myofibrillar ADP/ATP ratios of a cardiomyocyte do not change with diabetes. Instead, average concentration of inorganic phosphate rises by 40% due to lower mitochondrial area fraction and dysfunction in oxidative phosphorylation. These simulations indicate that a disorganized cellular ultrastructure negatively impacts metabolite transport in diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

    "abstract": "Occurring independently at seven separate origins across the avian tree of life, obligate brood parasitism is a unique suite of traits observed in only approximately 1% of all bird species. Obligate brood parasites exhibit varied physiological, morphological, and behavioural traits across lineages, but common among all obligate brood parasites is that the females lay their eggs in the nest of other species. Unique among these species is the black-headed duck (Heteronetta atricapilla), a generalist brood parasite that is the only obligate brood parasite among waterfowl. This provides an opportunity to assess evolutionary changes in traits associated with brood parasitism, notably the loss of parental care behaviours, with an unspecialized brood parasite. We generated new high-quality genome assemblies and genome annotations of the black-headed duck and three related non-parasitic species (freckled duck, African pygmy-goose, and ruddy duck). With these assemblies and existing public genome assemblies, we produced a whole genome alignment across Galloanserae to identify conserved non-coding regions with atypical accelerations in the black-headed duck and coding genes with evidence of positive selection, as well as to resolve uncertainties in the duck phylogeny. To complement these data, we sequenced a population sample of black-headed ducks, allowing us to conduct McDonald-Kreitman tests of lineage-specific selection. We resolve the existing polytomy between our focal taxa with concordance from coding and non-coding sequences, and we observe stronger signals of evolution in non-coding regions of the genome than in coding regions. Collectively, the new high-quality genomes, comparative genome alignment, and population genomics provide a detailed picture of genome evolution in the only brood parasitic duck.",

    "abstract": "It has been ten years since the first publication of a method dedicated entirely to mapping third-generation sequencing long-reads. The unprecedented characteristics of this new type of sequencing data created a shift, and methods moved on from the seed-and-extend framework previously used for short reads to a seed-and-chain framework due to the abundance of seeds in each read. As a result, the main novelties in proposed long-read mapping algorithms are typically based on alternative seed constructs or chaining formulations. Dozens of tools now exist, whose heuristics have considerably evolved with time. The rapid progress of the field, synchronized with the frequent improvements of data, does not make the literature and implementations easy to keep up with. Therefore, in this survey article, we provide an overview of existing mapping methods for long reads with accessible insights into methods. Since mapping is also very driven by the implementations themselves, we join an original visualization tool to understand the parameter settings (http://bcazaux.polytech-lille.net/Minimap2/) for the chaining part.",

    "abstract": "Small angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) is a method for determining basic structural characteristics such as size, shape, and surface of particles. SAXS can generate low resolution models of biomolecules faster than any other conventional structural biology tools. SAXS data is mostly collected in synchrotron facilities to obtain the best scattering data possible however home source SAXS devices can also generate valuable data when optimized properly. Here, we examined sample data collection and optimization at home source SAXS beamline in terms of concentration, purity, and the duration of data acquisition. We validated that high concentration, monodisperse and ultra pure protein samples obtained by size exclusion chromatography are necessary for generating viable SAXS data using home source beamline. Longer data collection time does not always generate higher resolutions but at least one hour is required for generating a feasible model from SAXS data. Furthermore, with small optimizations both during data collection and later data analysis SAXS can determine properties such as oligomerization, molecular mass, and overall shape of particles in solution under physiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the United States the rates of performed cesarean section (CS) have increased. The scientific community has observed an association between birth by cesarean and the offsprings increased weight at maturity (Masukume, 2019). Studies are being conducted to better understand the relationship between cesarean delivery and offspring metabolism (Kozhimannil, 2013; Kenkel, 2020). To test this potential connection, a diet intervention study has been used to test vaginal delivery (VD) vs CS birth subjects weight gain using a prairie vole model. Vole diets were either supplemented with a high-fat alternative mixed chow (MC) or fed standard vole chow (VC) to induce weight gain. Through this study, we collected sucrose preference, home cage, food consumption data from both birth mode groups and diet conditions. At sacrifice, we collected measures of weight, length, and adipose tissue to analyze for post-mortem body composition in adulthood of each group. CS voles gained more weight than VD voles, despite having lower food consumption and greater locomotive activity. Body composition analysis found that CS animals were longer and heavier than their VD counterparts. Additionally, CS animals were found to have a larger percent brown adipose tissue relative to body weight compared to VD counterparts. Future studies will target the variables contributing to this weight gain among CS offspring by examining factors like muscle mass, and total adiposity through advanced imaging data. Future studies will incorporate exogenous oxytocin administration to examine the impact of birth mode on body weight, metabolism, adiposity, and later life development to determine the possible mechanisms impacting the metabolic outcomes seen in this study.",
