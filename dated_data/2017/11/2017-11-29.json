    "abstract": "When an individual engages in a task, the associated evoked activities build upon already ongoing activity, itself shaped by an underlying functional connectivity baseline (Fox et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2009; Tavor et al., 2016). To facilitate understanding the building blocks of cognition we incorporate the idea that task-induced functional connectivity modulation with respect to its underlying resting state functional connectivity is task-specific. Here, we introduce a framework incorporating task potency, providing direct access to task-specificity through enabling direct comparison between task paradigms. In particular, to study functional connectivity modulations related to cognitive involvement in a task we define task potency as the amplitude of connectivity modulations away from the brains baseline functional connectivity architecture as observed during a resting state acquisition. We demonstrate the use of our framework by comparing three tasks (visuo-spatial working memory, reward processing, and stop signal task) available within a large cohort. Using task potency, we demonstrate that cognitive operations are supported by a common baseline of within-network interactions, supplemented by connections between large-scale networks in order to solve a specific task.\\n\\nHighlights- Task potency framework defines modulation of functional connectivity away from baseline resting state\\n- More within-than between-network modulations are induced by task performance\\n- Between-network modulations are task-specific\\n- Edges modulated by multiple tasks are mostly within-network\\n- The task potency can be used to define the most potent task",

    "abstract": "Extensive evidence suggests that people use base rate information inconsistently in decision making. A classic example is the inverse base rate effect (IBRE), whereby participants classify ambiguous stimuli sharing features of both common and rare categories as members of the rare category. Computational models of the IBRE have either posited that it arises from associative similarity-based mechanisms or dissimilarity-based processes that may depend upon higher-level inference. Here we develop a hybrid model, which posits that similarity- and dissimilarity-based evidence both contribute to the IBRE, and test it using functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from human subjects completing an IBRE task. Consistent with our model, multivoxel pattern analysis reveals that activation patterns on ambiguous test trials contain information consistent with dissimilarity-based processing. Further, trial-by-trial activation in left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex tracks model-based predictions for dissimilarity-based processing, consistent with theories positing a role for higher-level symbolic processing in the IBRE.",

    "abstract": "Rehabilitation is the most effective treatment for promoting the recovery of motor deficits after stroke. Despite its importance, the processes associated with rehabilitative intervention are poorly understood. One of the most challenging experimental goals is to unambiguously link specific circuit changes induced by rehabilitation to improved behavior. Here, we investigate which facets of cortical remodeling are induced by rehabilitation by combining optical imaging and manipulation tools in a mouse model of stroke. We demonstrate the progressive restoration of cortical motor maps and of cortical activity in parallel with the reinforcement of inter-hemispheric connectivity after rehabilitation. Furthermore, we reveal that the increase in vascular density goes along with the stabilization of peri-infarct neural circuitry at synaptic level. The present work provides the first evidences that rehabilitation is sufficient to promote the combined recovery of distinct structural and functional features distinctive of healthy neuronal networks.",

    "abstract": "Branched and crosslinked actin networks mediate cellular processes that move and shape membranes. To understand how actin contributes during the different stages of endocytic membrane reshaping, we analysed deletion mutants of yeast actin network components using a hybrid imaging approach that combines live imaging with correlative microscopy. We could thereby temporally dissect the effects of different actin network perturbations, revealing distinct stages of actin-based membrane reshaping. Our data show that initiation of membrane bending requires the actin network to be physically linked to the plasma membrane and to be optimally crosslinked. Once initiated, the membrane invagination process is driven by nucleation and polymerization of new actin filaments, independently of the degree of cross-linking and unaffected by a surplus of actin network components. A key transition occurs 2 seconds before scission when the filament nucleation rate drops. From that time point on, invagination growth and vesicle scission are driven by an expansion of the assembled actin network. The expansion is sensitive to the amount of filamentous actin and its crosslinking. Our results suggest that the mechanism by which actin reshapes the membrane adapts to force requirements that vary during the progress of endocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Expression levels of retinoic acid receptor gamma (NR1B3/RARG, encodes RAR{gamma}), are commonly reduced in prostate cancer (PCa). Therefore we sought to establish the cellular and gene regulatory consequences of reduced RAR{gamma} expression, and determine RAR{gamma} regulatory mechanisms. RARG shRNA approaches in non-malignant (RWPE-1 and HPr1-AR) and malignant (LNCaP) prostate models revealed that reducing RAR{gamma} levels, rather than adding exogenous retinoid ligand, had the greatest impact on prostate cell viability and gene expression. ChIP-Seq defined the RAR{gamma} cistrome which was significantly enriched at active enhancers associated with AR binding sites. Reflecting a significant genomic role for RAR{gamma} to regulate androgen signaling, RAR{gamma} knockdown in HPr1-AR cells significantly regulated the magnitude of the AR transcriptome. RAR{gamma} down-regulation was explained by increased miR-96 in PCa cell and mouse models, and TCGA PCa cohorts. Biochemical approaches confirmed that miR-96 directly regulated RAR{gamma} expression and function Capture of the miR-96 targetome by biotin-miR96 identified that RAR{gamma} and a number of RAR{gamma} interacting co-factors including TACC1 were all targeted by miR-96, and expression of these genes were prominently altered, positively and negatively, in the TCGA-PRAD cohort. Differential gene expression analyses between tumors in the TCGA-PRAD cohort with lower quartile expression levels of RARG and TACC1 and upper quartile miR-96, compared to the reverse, identified a gene network including several RAR{gamma} target genes (e.g. SOX15) that significantly associated with worse disease free survival (hazard ratio 2.23, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.88, p=0.015). In summary, miR-96 targets a RAR{gamma} network to govern AR signaling, PCa progression and disease outcome.\\n\\nConflict of interestThe authors certify that they have NO affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest (such as honoraria; educational grants; participation in speakers bureaus; membership, employment, consultancies, stock ownership, or other equity interest; and expert testimony or patent-licensing arrangements), or non-financial interest (such as personal or professional relationships, affiliations, knowledge or beliefs) in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript.\\n\\nFUNDINGLESC acknowledges support, in part, of Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center-University of Pittsburg Cancer Institute Ovarian Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence National Institutes of Health [P50CA159981-01A1].\\n\\nMDL acknowledges support of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics NRSA T32 program [T32CA009072] held at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center.\\n\\nMJC and DJS acknowledges support in part from the Prostate program of the Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs [W81XWH-14-1-0608, W81XWH-11-2-0033] and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) grant P30CA016056 involving the use of Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Centers Genomic Shared Resource.\\n\\nMJC, GL, AR, HW and PvdB acknowledges support from the European Union-United States Atlantis Program [P116J090011].\\n\\nMJC and LESC acknowledge support from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) grant P30CA016056 involving the use of OSUCCC The James, CCSG P30CA016058",

    "abstract": "The Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimers Prevention (WRAP) is a longitudinal observational cohort study enriched with persons with a parental history (PH) of probable Alzheimers Disease (AD) dementia. Since late 2001, WRAP has enrolled 1,561 people at a mean baseline age of 54. Participants return for a second visit four years after baseline and subsequent visits occur every two years. Eighty-one percent (1270) of participants remain active in the study at a current mean age of 64 and 9 years of follow-up. Serially assessed cognition, self-reported medical and lifestyle histories (e.g. diet, physical and cognitive activity, sleep, and mood), laboratory tests, genetics, and linked studies comprising molecular imaging, structural imaging and cerebrospinal fluid data, have yielded many important findings. In this cohort, PH of probable AD is associated with 46% APOE {varepsilon}4 positivity, more than twice the rate of 22% among persons without PH. Subclinical or worse cognitive decline relative to internal normative data has been observed in 17.6% of the cohort. Twenty-eight percent exhibit amyloid and/or tau positivity. Biomarker elevations, but not APOE or PH status, are associated with cognitive decline. Salutary health and lifestyle factors are associated with better cognition and brain structure, and lower AD pathophysiologic burden. Of paramount importance is establishing the amyloid and tau AD endophenotypes to which cognitive outcomes can be linked. Such data will provide new knowledge on the early temporal course of AD pathophysiology and inform the design of secondary prevention clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal damage results in profound retrograde, but no anterograde amnesia in contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Although the content learned in the latter have been discussed, the compensating regions were seldom proposed and never empirically addressed. Here, we employed network analysis of pCREB expression quantified from brain slices of rats with dorsal hippocampal lesion (dHPC) after undergoing CFC session. Using inter-regional correlations of pCREB-positive nuclei between brain regions, we modelled functional networks using different thresholds. The dHPC network showed small-world topology, equivalent to SHAM (control) network. However, diverging hubs were identified in each network. In a direct comparison, hubs in both networks showed consistently higher centrality values compared to the other network. Further, the distribution of correlation coefficients was different between the groups, with most significantly stronger correlation coefficients belonging to the SHAM network. These results suggest that dHPC network engaged in CFC learning is partially different, and engage alternative hubs. We next tested if pre-training lesions of dHPC and one of the new dHPC network hubs (perirhinal, Per; or disgranular retrosplenial, RSC, cortices) would impair CFC. Only dHPC-RSC, but not dHPC-Per, impaired CFC. Interestingly, only RSC showed a consistently higher centrality in the dHPC network, suggesting that the increased centrality reflects an increased functional dependence on RSC. Our results provide evidence that, without hippocampus, the RSC, an anatomically central region in the medial temporal lobe memory system might support CFC learning and memory.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYWhen determined cognitive performances are not affected by brain lesions of regions generally involved in that performance, the interpretation is that the remaining regions can compensate the damaged one. In contextual fear conditioning, a memory model largely used in laboratory rodents, hippocampal lesions produce amnesia for events occurred before, but not after the lesion, although the hippocampus is known to be important for new learning. Addressing compensation in animal models has always been challenging as it requires large-scale brain mapping. Here, we quantified 30 brain regions and used mathematical tools to model how a brain network can compensate hippocampal loss and learn contextual fear. We described that the damaged network preserved general interactivity characteristics, although different brain regions were identified as highly important for the network (e.g. highly connected). Further, we empirically validated our network model by performing double lesions of the hippocampus and the alternative hubs observed in the network models. We verified that double lesion of the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex, one of the hubs, impaired contextual fear learning. We provide evidence that without hippocampus, the remaining network relies on alternative important regions from the memory system to coordinate contextual fear learning.",

    "abstract": "Outer membrane vesicles produced by Gram-negative bacteria have been studied for half a century but the possibility that Gram-positive bacteria secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) was not pursued due to the assumption that the thick peptidoglycan cell wall would prevent their release to the environment. However, following discovery in fungi, which also have cell walls, EVs have now been described for a variety of Gram-positive bacteria. EVs purified from Gram-positive bacteriaare implicated in virulence, toxin release and transference to host cells, eliciting immune responses, and spread of antibiotic resistance. Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium that is the etiological agent of listeriosis. Here we report that L. monocytogenes produces EVs with diameter ranging from 20-200 nm, containing the pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O(LLO) and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Using simultaneous metabolite, protein, and lipid extraction (MPLEx) multi-omics we characterized protein, lipid and metabolite composition of bacterial cells and secreted EVs and found that EVs carry the majority of listerial virulence proteins. Cell-free EV preparations were toxic to the murine macrophage cell line J774.16, in a LLO-dependent manner, evidencing EV biological activity. The deletion of plcA increased EV toxicity, suggesting PI-PLC can restrain LLO activity. Using immunogold electron microscopy we detect LLO localization at several organelles within infected human epithelial cells and with high-resolution fluorescence imaging we show that dynamic lipid structures are released from L. monocytogenes that colocalize with LLO during infection. Our findings demonstrate that L. monocytogenes utilize EVs for toxin release and implicate these structures in mammalian cytotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "The availability of increasing volumes of multi-omics profiles across many cancers promises to improve our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying cancer. The main challenge is to integrate these multiple levels of omics profiles and especially to analyze them across many cancers. Here we present AMARETTO, an algorithm that addresses both challenges in three steps. First, AMARETTO identifies potential cancer driver genes through integration of copy number, DNA methylation and gene expression data. Then AMARETTO connects these driver genes with co-expressed target genes that they control, defined as regulatory modules. Thirdly, we connect AMARETTO modules identified from different cancer sites into a pancancer network to identify cancer driver genes. Here we applied AMARETTO in a pancancer study comprising eleven cancer sites and confirmed that AMARETTO captures hallmarks of cancer. We also demonstrated that AMARETTO enables the identification of novel pancancer driver genes. In particular, our analysis led to the identification of pancancer driver genes of smoking-induced cancers and  antiviral interferon-modulated innate immune response.\\n\\nSoftware availabilityAMARETTO is available as an R package at https://bitbucket.org/gevaertlab/pancanceramaretto\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe present an algorithm for pancancer identification of cancer driver genes based on multiomics data fusion\\nC_LIO_LIGPX2 is a novel driver gene in smoking induced cancers and validated using knockdown of GPX2 in the A549 cell line.\\nC_LIO_LIOAS2 is a novel driver gene defining cancers with an antiviral signature supported by increased infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages.\\nC_LI\\n\\nResearch in contextWe present an algorithm that combines multiple sources of molecular data to identify novel genes that are involved in cancer development.

    "abstract": "Learning is a fundamental process in neural systems. However, microorganisms without a nervous system have been shown to possess learning abilities. Specifically, Paramecium caudatum has been previously reported to be able to form associations between lighting conditions and cathodal shocks in its swimming medium. We have replicated previous reports on this phenomenon and tested the predictions of a molecular pathway hypothesis on paramecium learning. Our results indicated that in contrast to the previous reports, paramecium can only associate higher light intensities with cathodal stimulation and it cannot associate lower light intensities with cathodal stimulation. These results found to be in line with the predictions of the previously proposed model for the molecular mechanisms of learning in paramecium which depends on the effects of cathodal shocks on the interplay between Cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration and phototactic behavior of paramecium.",

    "abstract": "To make decisions, animals must evaluate outcomes of candidate choices by accessing memories of relevant experiences. Yet little is known about which experiences are considered or ignored during deliberation, which ultimately governs choice. Here, we propose a normative theory to predict which memories should be accessed at each moment to optimize future decisions. Using nonlocal \\\"replay\\\" of spatial locations in hippocampus as a window into memory access, we simulate a spatial navigation task where an agent accesses memories of locations sequentially, ordered by utility: how much extra reward would be earned due to the computation enabling better choices. This prioritization balances two desiderata: the need to evaluate imminent choices, vs. the gain from propagating newly encountered information to predecessor states. We show that this theory offers a unifying account of a range of hitherto disconnected findings in the place cell literature such as the balance of forward and reverse replay, biases in the replayed content, and effects of experience. Accordingly, various types of nonlocal events during behavior and rest are re-interpreted as instances of a single choice evaluation operation, unifying seemingly disparate proposed functions of replay including planning, learning and consolidation, and whose dysfunction may underlie pathologies like rumination and craving.",

    "abstract": "We had previously reported [1] a mouse line carrying the Atypical female courtship (HoxDAfc) allele, where an ectopic accumulation of Hoxd10 transcripts was observed in a sparse population of cells in the adult isocortex, as a result of a partial deletion of the HoxD gene cluster (Figure 1A). Female mice carrying this allele displayed an exacerbated paracopulatory behavior, culminating in a severe mutilation of the studs external genitals. To unequivocally demonstrate that this intriguing phenotype was indeed caused by an illegitimate function of the HOXD10 protein, we use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to induced a microdeletion into the homeobox of the Hoxd10 gene in cis with the HoxDAfc allele [2]. Females carrying this novel HoxDDel(1-9)d10hd allele no longer mutilate males. We conclude that a brain malfunction leading to a severe pathological behavior can be caused by the mere binding to DNA of a transcription factor expressed ectopically. We also show that in HoxDAfc mice, Hoxd10 was expressed in cells containing Gad1 and Cck transcripts, corroborating our proposal that a small fraction of GABAergic neurons in adult hippocampus may participate to some aspects of female courtship.",

    "abstract": "In many diseases, components of the ubiquitin system - such as E2/E3 ligases and deubiquitylases - are dysregulated. The ubiquitin system has therefore become an emergent target for the treatment of a number of diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration and autoimmunity. Despite of the efforts in this field, primary screenings of compound libraries to individuate new potential therapeutic molecules targeting the ubiquitin pathway have been strongly limited by the lack of robust and fast high-throughput assays. Here we report the first label-free high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzymes and E3 ligases based on Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight (MALDI TOF) mass spectrometry. The MALDI TOF E2/E3 assay allows us to test E2 conjugating enzymes and E3 ligases for their ubiquitin transfer activity, to identify E2/E3 active pairs, inhibitor potency and specificity and to screen compound libraries in vitro without synthesis of chemical or fluorescent probes. We demonstrate that the MALDI TOF E2/E3 assay is a universal tool for drug discovery screening in the ubiquitin pathway as it is suitable for working with all E3 ligase families and requires a reduced amount of reagents, compared to standard biochemical assays.",

    "abstract": "Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) plays a crucial role in Vibrio cholerae mediated pathogenicity and predation. Tip of T6SS is homologous to gp27/gp5 complex or tail spike of T4 bacteriophage. VgrG-1 of V. cholerae T6SS is unusual among other VgrG because its effector domain is trans-located into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells with an additional actin cross-linking domain (ACD) at its C terminal end. ACD of VgrG-1 (VgrG-1-ACD) causes T6SS dependent host cell cytotoxicity through actin cytoskeleton disruption to prevent bacterial engulfment by macrophages. ACD mediated actin cross-linking promotes survival of the bacteria in the small intestine of humans, along with other virulence factors; establishes successful infection with the onset of diarrhoea in humans. Our studies demonstrated VgrG-1-ACD can bind to actin besides actin cross-linking activity. Computational analysis of ACD revealed the presence of WH2 domain through which it binds actin. Mutations in WH2 domain lead to loss of actin binding in vitro. VgrG-1-ACD having the mutated WH2 domain cannot cross-link actin efficiently in vitro and manifests less actin cytoskeleton disruption when transfected in HeLa cells.\\n\\nSummary statementActin cross-linking (ACD) domain of VgrG-1 toxin of Type VI secretion in Vibrio cholera has WASP Homology domain 2 (WH2) domain.

Here, we demonstrate label-free, non-invasive, rapid quantification of the lipid contents in individual micro-algal cells measuring the three-dimensional refractive index tomograms. We measure three-dimensional refractive index distributions within Nannochloropsis oculata cells and find that lipid droplets are identifiable in tomograms by their high refractive index. In addition, we alter N. oculata under nitrogen deficiency by measuring the volume, lipid weight, and dry cell weight of individual cells. Characterization of individual cells allows correlative analysis between the lipid content and size of individual cells.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular simulations are typically performed in an aqueous environment where the number of ions remains fixed for the duration of the simulation, generally with either a minimally neutralizing ion environment or a number of salt pairs intended to match the macroscopic salt concentration. In contrast, real biomolecules experience local ion environments where the salt concentration is dynamic and may differ from bulk. The degree of salt concentration variability and average deviation from the macroscopic concentration remains, as yet, unknown. Here, we describe the theory and implementation of a Monte Carlo osmostat that can be added to explicit solvent molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations to sample from a semigrand canonical ensemble in which the number of salt pairs fluctuates dynamically during the simulation. The osmostat reproduce the correct equilibrium statistics for a simulation volume that can exchange ions with a large reservoir at a defined macroscopic salt concentration. To achieve useful Monte Carlo acceptance rates, the method makes use of nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) moves in which monovalent ions and water molecules are alchemically transmuted using short nonequilibrium trajectories, with a modified Metropolis-Hastings criterion ensuring correct equilibrium statistics for an ({Delta}{micro}, N, p, T) ensemble. We demonstrate how typical protein (DHFR and the tyrosine kinase Src) and nucleic acid (Drew-Dickerson B-DNA dodecamer) systems exhibit salt concentration distributions that significantly differ from fixed-salt bulk simulations and display fluctuations that are on the same order of magnitude as the average.",

In order to increase the variety of rhodopsin proteins having a wide range of absorption wavelengths, the light absorption properties of various wild-type rhodopsins and their artificially mutated variants were investigated in the literature. Here, we demonstrate that a machine-learning-based (ML-based) data-driven approach is useful for understanding and predicting the light-absorption properties of microbial rhodopsin proteins. We constructed a database of 796 proteins consisting of microbial rhodopsin wildtypes and their variants. We then proposed an ML method that produces a statistical model describing the relationship between amino-acid sequences and absorption wavelengths and demonstrated that the fitted statistical model is useful for understanding colour tuning rules and predicting absorption wavelengths. By applying the ML method to the database, two residues that were not considered in previous studies are newly identified to be important to colour shift.",

    "abstract": "The electrophysiological and secretory properties of the human {beta}-cell lines EndoC-{beta}H1 and EndoC-{beta}H2 were investigated. Both cell lines respond to glucose (6-20mM) with 2-to 3-fold stimulation of insulin secretion, an effect that was mimicked by tolbutamide (0.2mM) and reversed by diazoxide (0.5mM). Glucose-induced insulin release correlated with an elevation of [Ca2+]i, membrane depolarization and increased action potential firing. KATP channel activity at 1mM glucose is low and increasing glucose to 6 or 20mM reduced KATP channel activity to the same extent as application of the KATP channel blocker tolbutamide (0.2mM). The upstroke of the action potentials in EndoC-{beta}H1 and -{beta}H2 cells observed at high glucose principally reflects activation of L- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels with some small contribution of TTX-sensitive Na+ channels. Action potential repolarization involves activation of voltage-gated Kv2.2 channels and large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Exocytosis (measured by measurements of membrane capacitance) was triggered by membrane depolarizations >10ms to membrane potentials above -30mV. Both cell lines were well-granulated (6,000-15,000 granules/cell) and granules consisted of a central insulin core surrounded by a clear halo. We conclude that the EndoC-{beta}H1 and -{beta}H2 cells share many features of primary human {beta}-cells and that they represent a useful experimental model.",

We have identified an evolutionarily conserved regulator of the protrusion machinery, which we name CYRI (CYFIP-related Rac interacting) protein. CYRI shows sequence similarity to the Scar/WAVE complex member CYFIP in a Domain of Unknown Function, DUF1394. CYRI binds specifically to activated Rac1 via a common motif shared with CYFIP, establishing DUF1394 as a new Rac1 binding domain. CYRI-depleted cells have broad, Scar/WAVE-enriched lamellipodia and enhanced Rac1 signaling. Conversely, CYRI overexpression suppresses spreading and dramatically sharpens protrusions into unproductive needles. CYRI proteins use dynamic inhibition of Scar/WAVE induced actin to focus positive protrusion signals and regulate pseudopod complexity. CYRI behaves like a \\\"local inhibitor\\\" predicted and described in widely accepted mathematical models, but not previously identified in living cells.",

This can be challenging for many invertebrates because conventional chromosome preparation protocols deal primarily hypotonic conditions tailored for use with vertebrates and rely extensively on cultured cells which are rarely available for invertebrates. Hence, a simple and inexpensive chromosome preparation protocol, adaptable to multiple invertebrate model species is needed.\\n\\nResultsWe optimized a chromosome preparation protocol and applied it to several planarian species (Phylum: Platyhelminthes), the freshwater apple snail Pomacea canaliculata (Phylum: Mollusca), and the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (Phylum: Cnidaria). We showed that both mitotically active adult tissues and embryos can be used as sources of metaphase chromosomes, expanding the potential use of this technique to invertebrates lacking cell lines and/or with limited access to the complete life cycle. Simple hypotonic treatment with DI water was sufficient for karyotyping. The karyotypes we obtained allowed the identification of differences in ploidy and chromosome architecture among otherwise morphologically indistinguishable organisms, as in the case of a mixed population of planarians collected in the wild. Furthermore, we showed that in all tested organisms representing three different phyla, this protocol can be effectively coupled with downstream applications, such as chromosome fluorescent in situ hybridization.\\n\\nConclusionThe simple and inexpensive chromosome preparation protocol reported here can be readily adapted to new invertebrate research organisms in order to expand and accelerate the discovery of new biology in understudied branches of the tree of life.",

Four origins of Dioscorea in the neotropics were estimated since the Eocene. The two most diverse lineages originated between the Eocene and Oligocene, respectively in the Southern Andes and eastern South America. Both lineages occupied the South American  Dry Diagonal after the Miocene, but New World II clade remained associated with forest habitats. Several exchanges between Dry Diagonal and adjacent forested biomes occurred, corroborating the interchange between these vegetation types. Dispersals to Central America occurred before the closure of the Panama Isthmus. We highlight two important events of long distance dispersal, the colonization of Central American before the closure of Isthmus of Panama and the dispersal of D. antaly lineage to Madagascar. In addition, our phylogenetic tree evidenced the unnatural nature of the classical infrageneric classification of Dioscorea. The taxonomic implications of our results are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Whether mutations in bacteria exhibit a noticeable delay before expressing their corresponding mutant phenotype was discussed intensively in the 1940s-50s, but the discussion eventually waned for lack of supportive evidence and perceived incompatibility with observed mutant distributions in fluctuation tests. Phenotypic delay in bacteria is widely assumed to be negligible, despite lack of direct evidence. Here we revisited the question using recombineering to introduce antibiotic resistance mutations into E. coli at defined time points and then tracking expression of the corresponding mutant phenotype over time. Contrary to previous assumptions, we found a substantial median phenotypic delay of 3-4 generations. We provided evidence that the primary source of this delay is multifork replication causing cells to be effectively polyploid, whereby wild-type gene copies transiently mask the phenotype of recessive mutant gene copies in the same cell. Using modeling and simulation methods, we explored the consequences of effective polyploidy for mutation rate estimation by fluctuation tests and sequencing-based methods. For recessive mutations, despite the substantial phenotypic delay, the per-copyor per-genome mutation rate is accurately estimated. However, the per-cell rate cannot be estimated by existing methods. Finally, with a mathematical model, we showed that effective polyploidy increases the frequency of costly recessive mutations in the standing genetic variation, and thus their potential contribution to evolutionary adaptation, while drastically reducing the chance that de novo recessive mutations can rescue populations facing a harsh environmental change such as antibiotic treatment. Overall, we have identified phenotypic delay and effective polyploidy as previously overlooked but essential components in bacterial evolvability, including antibiotic resistance evolution.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWhat is the time delay between the occurrence of a genetic mutation in a bacterial cell and manifestation of its phenotypic effect? We show that antibiotic resistance mutations in E.coli show a remarkably long phenotypic delay of 3-4 bacterial generations. The primary underlying mechanism of this delay is effective polyploidy. In a polyploid cell with multiple chromosomes, once a mutation arises on one of the chromosomes, the presence of non-mutated, wild-type gene copies on other chromosomes may mask the phenotype of the mutation. One implication of this finding is that conventional methods to determine the mutation rates of bacteria do not detect polyploidy and thus underestimate their potential for adaptation. More generally, the effect that a new mutation may become useful only in the \\\"grand-children of the grand-children\\\" suggests that pre-existing mutations are more important for surviving sudden environmental catastrophe.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary dynamics of social traits depend crucially on the social structure of a population, i.e., who interacts with whom. A large body of work studies the effect of social structure on behaviors such as cooperation, but relatively little is known about how social structure itself coevolves with social traits. Here, I use a simple yet realistic model of within-group social structure to study such coevolution. In this model, social connections are either inherited from a parent or made with random individuals. My model shows cooperation can evolve when individuals make few random connections, but the presence of cooperation selects for increased rates of random connections, which leads to the collapse of cooperation. Inherent costs of social connections can prevent this negative feedback, but the more beneficial cooperation is, the higher linking costs have to be maintain it, and linking costs can negate some or all of the aggregate benefits of cooperation. Exogenously maintained social inheritance can mitigate the latter problem and allow cooperation to persist and increase the average fitness of a population. These results illustrate how coevolutionary dynamics can constrain the long-term persistence of cooperation.",

    "abstract": "The rate of recombination affects the mode of molecular evolution. In high-recombining sequence, the targets of selection are individual genetic loci; under low recombination, selection collectively acts on large, genetically linked genomic segments. Selection under linkage can induce clonal interference, a specific mode of evolution by competition of genetic clades within a population. This mode is well known in asexually evolving microbes, but has not been traced systematically in an obligate sexual organism. Here we show that the Drosophila genome is partitioned into two modes of evolution: a local interference regime with limited effects of genetic linkage, and an interference condensate with clonal competition. We map these modes by differences in mutation frequency spectra, and we show that the transition between them occurs at a threshold recombination rate that is predictable from genomic summary statistics. We find the interference condensate in segments of low-recombining sequence that are located primarily in chromosomal regions flanking the centromeres and cover about 20% of the Drosophila genome. Condensate regions have characteristics of asexual evolution that impact gene function: the efficacy of selection and the speed of evolution are lower and the genetic load is higher than in regions of local interference. Our results suggest that multicellular eukaryotes can harbor heterogeneous modes and tempi of evolution within one genome. We argue that this variation generates selection on genome architecture.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe Drosophila genome is an ideal system to study how the rate of recombination affects molecular evolution. It harbors a wide range of local recombination rates, and its high-recombining parts show broad signatures of adaptive evolution. The low-recombining parts, however, have remained dark genomic matter that has been omitted from most studies on the inference of selection. Here we show that these genomic regions evolve in a different way, which involves clonal competition and is akin to the evolution of asexual systems. This regime shows a lower efficacy of selection, a lower speed of evolution, and a higher genetic load than high-recombining regions. We argue these evolutionary differences have functional consequences: protein stability and protein expression are gene traits likely to be partially compromised by low recombination rates.",

    "abstract": "Hospital acquired infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and regimes to prevent infection are crucial in infection control. These include decolonisation of at-risk patients of carriage of MRSA which is commonly achieved by protocols that include the use of chlorhexidine, or octenidine as biocidal agents. There is however no standardised single decolonisation regime agreed upon in the UK or other countries and protocols include a variety of active agents. Antibiotic resistant bacteria cause major problems in hospital medicine and concern has been raised regarding the development of biocide resistance which would cause decolonisation regimes to become unreliable. In this study, we assembled a panel of isolates of S. aureus including isolates collected before the development of chlorhexidine and octenidine through to a contemporaneous panel of isolates from a major hospital trust in the UK during a period when the decolonisation regime was altered. We observed significant increases in the MIC and MBC of chlorhexidine in isolates collected from periods of high usage of chlorhexidine. No isolates had a significantly altered MIC or MBC of octenidine apart from those collected after octenidine was introduced into the trust where isolates with four-fold decreases in susceptibility emerged. There was no suggestion of cross-resistance between the two biocidal agents. A combination of VNTR, PCR for qac genes and whole genome sequencing was used to type isolates and examine possible mechanisms of resistance. The typing data showed no expansion of a single strain was associated with decreased biocide tolerance and isolates with increased chlorhexidine MIC and MBCs were found from different clonal complexes; CC8, CC22 and CC30. Biocide susceptibility did not correlate with carriage of qac efflux pump genes - carriage of qacA and qacB was detected but, with one exception was restricted to isolates of CC8. Analysis of genome sequence data for closely related pairs of strains with differential biocide susceptibility revealed no common mutations or carriage of accessory elements that correlated with biocide tolerance. Mutations with the NorA or NorB efflux pumps, previously associated with chlorhexidine export were identified suggesting this may be an important mechanism of biocide tolerance. The clinical relevance of decreased biocide tolerance in terms of efficacy of decolonisation therapies remains to be established but we present evidence here that isolates are evolving in the face of biocide challenge in patients and that changes to decolonisation regimes are reflected in changes in susceptibility of isolates. More work is needed to assess the impact of these changes to ensure effective and robust decolonisation protocols remain in place.",

We developed a zebrafish model and used live imaging to directly study how the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae invades the intestine. The gut microbiota of fish mono-colonized by commensal strain Aeromonas veronii was displaced by V. cholerae expressing its Type VI Secretion System (T6SS), a syringe-like apparatus that deploys effector proteins into target cells. Surprisingly, displacement was independent of T6SS-mediated killing of Aeromonas, driven instead by T6SS-induced enhancement of zebrafish intestinal movements that led to expulsion of the resident commensal by the host. Deleting an actin crosslinking domain from the T6SS apparatus returned intestinal motility to normal and thwarted expulsion, without weakening V. cholerae's ability to kill Aeromonas in vitro. Our finding that bacteria can manipulate host physiology to influence inter-microbial competition has implications for both pathogenesis and microbiome engineering.",

    "abstract": "Retinal prostheses for treating incurable blindness are designed to electrically stimulate surviving retinal neurons, causing them to send artificial visual signals to the brain. However, electrical stimulation generally cannot precisely reproduce typical patterns of neural activity in the retina. Therefore, an electrical stimulus must be selected so as to produce a neural response as close as possible to the desired response. This requires a technique for computing the distance between a desired response and an achievable response that is meaningful in terms of the visual signal being conveyed. We propose a method to learn a metric on neural responses directly from recorded light responses of a population of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the primate retina. The learned metric produces a measure of similarity of RGC population responses that accurately reflects the similarity of visual inputs. Using data from electrical stimulation experiments, we demonstrate that the learned metric could produce improvements in the performance of a retinal prosthesis.",

Conditional random fields (CRFs) allowed us not only to identify cortical ensembles representing visual stimuli, but also to individually target neurons that are functionally key for pattern completion.

Recently, dI6 neurons were suggested to participate in the control of locomotion. The dI6 neurons can be subdivided into three populations, one of which expresses the Wilms tumor suppressor gene Wt1. However, the role that Wt1 exerts on these cells is not understood. Here, we aimed to identify behavioral changes and cellular alterations in the spinal cord associated with Wt1 deletion. Locomotion analyses of mice with neuron-specific Wt1 deletion revealed that these mice ran slower than controls with a decreased stride frequency and an increased stride length. These mice showed changes in their fore-hindlimb coordination, which were accompanied by a loss of contralateral projections in the spinal cord. Neonates with Wt1 deletion displayed an increase in uncoordinated hindlimb movements and their motor neuron output was arrhythmic with a decreased frequency. The population size of dI6, V0 and V2a neurons in the developing spinal cord of conditional Wt1 mutants was significantly altered. These results show that the development of particular dI6 neurons depends on Wt1 expression and loss of Wt1 is associated with alterations in locomotion.",

The current methods study offers proof-of-principle that PiezoSleep (noninvasive, unsupervised piezoelectric monitoring of gross body movement, together with respiration patterns during behavioral quiescence), can be used to determine sleep/wake as applicable to the development of wake-promoting therapeutics. First, the translational wake-maintenance score (WMS, the ratio of time during the first half of the dark period spent in long wake bouts to short sleep bouts) of the PiezoSleep narcolepsy screen was introduced as a means by which to rank narcoleptic orexin/ataxin-3 mice and wild type mice by sleep/wake fragmentation severity. Accuracy of the WMS to detect narcoleptic phenotypes were determined in genotype-confirmed orexin/ataxin-3 mice and wild type colony mates. The WMS was used to identify the most highly symptomatic mice for resource-intensive EEG/EMG studies for further analysis of specific arousal states. Second, PiezoSleep was demonstrated for use in high-throughput screening of wake-promoting compounds using modafinil in orexin/ataxin-3 and wild type mice.\\n\\nResultsThe WMS detected a narcoleptic phenotype with 89% sensitivity, 92% specificity and 98% positive predictive value. A 15-fold difference in WMS differentiated wild type littermates from the most severely affected orexin/ataxin-3 mice. Follow-up EEG/EMG study indicated 82% of the orexin/ataxin-3 mice with the lowest wake-maintenance scores met or exceeded the cataplexy-occurrence threshold ([&ge;] 3 bouts) for inclusion in therapeutic efficacy studies. In the PiezoSleep dose-response study, the ED50 for wake-promotion by modafinil was approximately 50 mg/kg in both genotypes. Using unsupervised piezoelectric monitoring, the efficacy of wake-promoting compounds can be determined in a 5-arm study with 60 mice in less than one week--a fraction of the time compared to EEG/EMG studies.\\n\\nConclusionsThe WMS on the PiezoSleep narcolepsy screen quantifies the inability to sustain wakefulness and provides an accurate measure of the narcoleptic phenotype in mice.

The UV-induced AF appears to be induced by cysteine protease-mediated keratin 1 proteolysis: 1) UV rapidly induced significant keratin 1 degradation; 2) administration of keratin 1 siRNA largely decreased the UV-induced AF; and 3) administration of E-64, a cysteine protease inhibitor, significantly attenuated the UV-induced AF and keratin 1 degradation. Our study has also suggested that the UV-induced keratin 1 proteolysis may be a novel crucial pathological factor in UV-induced skin damage, which is supported by both the findings that indicate critical biological roles of keratin 1 in epithelium and our observation that prevention of UV-induced keratin 1 proteolysis can lead to decreased UV-induced skin damage.

Here, using patient samples obtained from a pancreatic islet transplantation program, we constructed a tissue-specific gene regulatory network and used the control centrality (Cc) concept to identify the high control centrality (HiCc) pathways, which might serve as key pathobiological pathways for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). We found that HiCc pathway genes were significantly enriched with modest GWAS p-values in the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) study. We identified variants regulating gene expression (expression quantitative loci, eQTL) of HiCc pathway genes in islet samples. These eQTL genes showed higher levels of differential expression compared to non-eQTL genes in low, medium and high glucose concentrations in rat islets. Among genes with highly significant eQTL evidence, NFATC4 belonged to four HiCc pathways. We asked if the expressions of T2D-associated candidate genes from GWAS and literature are regulated by Nfatc4 in rat islets. Extensive in vitro silencing of Nfatc4 in rat islet cells displayed reduced expression of 16, and increased expression of 4 putative downstream T2D genes. Overall, our approach uncovers the mechanistic connection of NFATC4 with downstream targets including a previously unknown one, TCF7L2, and establishes the HiCc pathways relationship to T2D.",

    "abstract": "Proteomic analyses provide essential information on molecular pathways of cellular systems and the state of a living organism. Mass spectrometry is currently the first choice for proteomic analysis. However, the requirement for a large amount of sample renders a small-scale proteomics study, such as single-cell analysis, challenging. Here we demonstrate a proof of concept of singlemolecule FRET-based protein fingerprinting. We harnessed the AAA+ protease ClpXP to scan peptides. By using donor fluorophore-labeled ClpP, we sequentially read out FRET signals from acceptor-labeled amino acids of peptides. The repurposed ClpXP exhibits uni-directional processing with high processivity and has the potential to detect low-abundance proteins. Our technique is a promising approach for sequencing protein substrates using a small amount of sample.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEProtein sequencing remains a challenge for small samples. A sensitive sequencing technology will create the opportunity for single-cell proteomics and real-time screening for on-site medical diagnostics. In order to resolve protein identity, we previously developed a computational algorithm that analyzes the ordered sequence of only two types of amino acids within a protein species. Through modification of a biological nanomachine, here we developed single-molecule fluorescence technology to linearize protein molecules and to read signals from labeled amino acids in an ordered manner. This proof of concept of singlemolecule fingerprinting will open a new door to single-molecule protein sequencing and pave the road towards the development of a new, fast, and reliable diagnostic tool.",

    "abstract": "Age-related changes in DNA methylation have been observed in many cross-sectional studies, but longitudinal evidence is still very limited. Here, we aimed to characterize longitudinal age-related methylation patterns (Illumina HumanMethylation450 array) using 1011 blood samples collected from 385 old Swedish twins (mean age of 69 at baseline) up to five times over 20 years. We identified 1316 age-associated methylation sites (p<1.3x10-7) using a longitudinal epigenome-wide association study design. We measured how estimated cellular compositions changed with age and how much they confounded the age effect. We validated the results in two independent longitudinal cohorts, where 118 CpGs were replicated in PIVUS (p<3.9x10-5) and 594 were replicated in LBC (p<5.1x10-5). Functional annotation of age-associated CpGs showed enrichment in CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and other unannotated transcription factor binding sites. We further investigated genetic influences on methylation (methylation quantitative trait loci) and found no interaction between age and genetic effects in the 1316 age-associated CpGs. Moreover, in the same CpGs, methylation differences within twin pairs increased over time, where monozygotic twins had smaller intra-pair differences than dizygotic twins. We show that age-related methylation changes persist in a longitudinal perspective, and are fairly stable across cohorts. Moreover, the changes are under genetic influence, although this effect is independent of age. In addition, inter-individual methylation variations increase over time, especially in age-associated CpGs, indicating the increase of environmental contributions on DNA methylation with age.",

The availability of the first large-scale dataset with both whole genome and gene expression data enabled us to uncover the effects of the non-coding variation on cancer. In addition to confirming known regulatory effects, we identified novel associations between somatic variation and expression dysregulation, in particular in distal regulatory elements. Finally, we uncovered links between somatic mutational signatures and gene expression changes, including TERT and LMO2, and we explained the inherited risk factors in APOBEC-related mutational processes.

In budding yeast, although some molecular mechanisms responsible for cell size control during G1 have been elucidated, the mechanism by which cell size homeostasis is established and maintained throughout the cell cycle remains to be discovered. Here, we developed a new technique based on quantification of histone levels to monitor cell cycle progression in individual yeast cells with unprecedented accuracy. Our analysis establishes the existence of a strong mechanism controlling bud size in G2/M that prevents premature entry into mitosis, and contributes significantly to the overall control of size variability during the cell cycle. While most G1/S regulation mutants do not display any strongly impaired size homeostasis, mutants in which B-type cyclin regulation is altered display large cell-to-cell size variability. Our study thus demonstrates that size homeostasis is not controlled by a G1-specific mechanism but is likely to be an emergent property resulting from the integration of several mechanisms, including the control of cyclin B-Cdk activity, that coordinate cell and bud growth with division.",

    "abstract": "Pathogen infection is common in wild plants and animals, and may regulate their populations. If pathogens have narrow host ranges and increase with the density of their favored hosts, they may promote host species diversity by suppressing common species to the benefit of rare species. Yet, because many pathogens infect multiple co-occurring hosts, they may not strongly respond to the relative abundance of a single host species. Are natural communities dominated by specialized pathogens that respond to the relative abundance of a specific host or by pathogens with broad host ranges and limited responses to the relative abundance of single host? The answer determines the potential for pathogens to promote host coexistence, as often hypothesized, or to have negligible or even negative effects on host coexistence. We lack a systematic understanding of the impacts, identities, and host ranges of pathogens in natural communities. Here we characterize a community of foliar fungal pathogens and evaluate their host specificity and fitness impacts in a California grassland community of native and exotic species. We found that most of the commonly isolated fungal pathogens were multi-host, with intermediate to low specialization. The amount of pathogen damage each host experienced was independent of host species local relative abundance. Despite pathogen sharing among the host species, fungal communities slightly differed in composition across host species. Plants with high pathogen damage tended to have lower seed production but the relationship was weak, suggesting limited fitness impacts. Moreover, seed production was not dependent on the local relative abundance of each plant species, suggesting that stabilizing coexistence mechanisms may operate at larger spatial scales in this community. Because foliar pathogens in this grassland community are multi-host and have small fitness impacts, they are unlikely to promote negative frequency-dependence or plant species coexistence in this system. Still, given that pathogen community composition differentiates across host species, some more subtle feedbacks between host relative abundance and pathogen community composition, damage, and fitness impacts are possible, which could in turn promote either coexistence or competitive exclusion.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial communities are composed of distinct groups of potentially interacting lineages, each thought to occupy a distinct ecological niche. It remains unclear, however, how quickly niche preference evolves and whether more closely related lineages are more likely to share ecological niches. We addressed these questions by following the dynamics of two bloom-forming cyanobacterial genera over an 8-year time-course in Lake Champlain, Canada, using 16S amplicon sequencing and measurements of several environmental parameters. The two genera, Microcystis (M) and Dolichospermum (D), are frequently observed simultaneously during bloom events and thus have partially overlapping niches. However, the extent of their niche overlap is debated, and it is also unclear to what extent niche partitioning occurs among strains within each genus. To identify strains within each genus, we applied minimum entropy decomposition (MED) to 16S rRNA gene sequences. We confirmed that at a genus level, M and D have different preferences for nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Within each genus, we also identified strains differentially associated with temperature, precipitation, and concentrations of nutrients and toxins. In general, niche similarity between strains (as measured by co-occurrence over time) declined with genetic distance. This pattern is consistent with habitat filtering - in which closely-related taxa are ecologically similar, and therefore tend to co-occur under similar environmental conditions. In contrast with this general pattern, similarity in certain niche dimensions (notably particulate nitrogen and phosphorus) did not decline linearly with genetic distance, and instead showed a complex polynomial relationship. This observation suggests the importance of processes other than habitat filtering - such as competition between closely-related taxa, or convergent trait evolution in distantly-related taxa - in shaping particular traits in microbial communities.",

We studied the effects of 37 BMI/obesity-associated SNPs in 75,230 adults of European ancestry along BMI percentiles using conditional quantile regression (CQR) and meta-regression (MR) models. The effects of 9 SNPs (24%) increased significantly across the sample BMI distribution including, FTO (rs1421085, p=8.69x10-15), PCSK1 (rs6235, p=7.11x10-06), TCF7L2 (rs7903146, p=9.60x10-06), MC4R (rs11873305, p=5.08x10-05), FANCL (rs12617233, p=5.30x10-05), GIPR (rs11672660, p=1.64x-04), MAP2K5 (rs997295, p=3.25x10-04), FTO (rs6499653, p=6.23x10-04) and NT5C2 (rs3824755, p=7.90x10-04). We showed that such increases stem from unadjusted gene interactions that enhanced the effects of SNPs in persons with high BMI. When 125 height-associated were analyzed for comparison, only one (<1%), IGF1 (rs6219, p=1.80x10-04), showed effects that varied significantly across height percentiles. Cumulative gene scores of these SNPs (GS-BMI and GS-Height, respectively) showed that only GS-BMI had effects that increased significantly across the sample distribution (BMI: p=7.03x10-37, Height: p=0.499). Overall, these findings underscore the importance of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in shaping the genetic architecture of BMI and advance a method to detect such interactions using only the sample outcome distribution.",

    "abstract": "The existence of cerebral blood flow (CBF) reductions in Alzheimers disease (AD) patients and related mouse models has been known for decades, but the underlying mechanisms and the resulting impacts on cognitive function and AD pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD we found that an increased number of cortical capillaries had stalled blood flow as compared to wildtype animals, largely due to leukocytes that adhered in capillary segments and blocked blood flow. These capillary stalls were an early feature of disease development, appearing before amyloid deposits. Administration of antibodies against the neutrophil marker Ly6G reduced the number of stalled capillaries, leading to an immediate increase in CBF and to rapidly improved performance in spatial and working memory tasks. Our work has thus identified a cellular mechanism that explains the majority of the CBF reduction seen in a mouse model of AD and has also demonstrated that improving CBF rapidly improved short-term memory function. Restoring cerebral perfusion by preventing the leukocyte adhesion that plugs capillaries may provide a novel strategy for improving cognition in AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Neurons perform computations by integrating inputs from thousands of synapses - mostly in the dendritic tree - to drive action potential firing in the axon. One fruitful approach to understanding this process is to record from neurons using patch-clamp electrodes, fill the recorded neuron with a substance that allows subsequent staining, reconstruct the three-dimensional architecture of the dendrites, and use the resulting functional and structural data to develop computer models of dendritic integration. Accurately producing quantitative reconstructions of dendrites is typically a tedious process taking many hours of manual inspection and measurement. Here we present ShuTu, a new software package that facilitates accurate and efficient reconstruction of dendrites imaged using bright-field microscopy. The program operates in two steps: (1) automated identification of dendritic process, and (2) manual correction of errors in the automated reconstruction. This approach allows neurons with complex dendritic morphologies to be reconstructed rapidly and efficiently, thus facilitating the use of computer models to study dendritic structure-function relationships and the computations performed by single neurons.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe developed a software package - ShuTu - that integrates automated reconstruction of stained neurons with manual error correction. This package facilitates rapid reconstruction of the three-dimensional geometry of neuronal dendritic trees, often needed for computational simulations of the functional properties of these structures.",

    "abstract": "The primary problem with the explosion of biomedical datasets is not the data itself, not computational resources, and not the required storage space, but the general lack of trained and skilled researchers to manipulate and analyze these data. Eliminating this problem requires development of comprehensive educational resources. Here we present a community-driven framework that enables modern, interactive teaching of data analytics in life sciences and facilitates the development of training materials. The key feature of our system is that it is not a static but a continuously improved collection of tutorials. By coupling tutorials with a web-based analysis framework, biomedical researchers can learn by performing computation themselves through a web-browser without the need to install software or search for example datasets. Our ultimate goal is to expand the breadth of training materials to include fundamental statistical and data science topics and to precipitate a complete re-engineering of undergraduate and graduate curricula in life sciences.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal Fluids (CSF) of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients have increased levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-18. Because IL-18 is produced by dendritic cells stimulated by the Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a major neuroinflammatory mediator, it is expected that PAF is involved in ALS. Pilot experimental data on amplification of PAF receptor (PAFR) mRNA by RT-PCR show that PAFR is overexpressed, as compared to age matched controls, in the spinal cords of transgenic ALS mouse model SOD1-G93A, suggesting PAF mediation. Although anti-inflammatory drugs have been tested for ALS before, no clinical trial has been conducted using PAFR specific inhibitors. Therefore, we hypothesize that administration of PAFR inhibitors, such as Ginkgolide B, PCA 4248 and WEB 2086, have potential to function as a novel therapy for ALS, particularly in SOD1 familial ALS forms. Because currently there are only two approved drugs with modest effectiveness for ALS therapy, a search for novel drugs and targets is essential.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) proteins are RNA-guided DNA targeting enzymes that bind and cut DNA as components of bacterial adaptive immune systems. Like CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a can be used as a powerful genome editing tool based on its ability to induce genetic changes in cells at sites of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cuts. Here we show that RNA-guided DNA binding unleashes robust, non-specific single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity in Cas12a sufficient to completely degrade both linear and circular ssDNA molecules within minutes. This activity, catalyzed by the same active site responsible for site-specific dsDNA cutting, indiscriminately shreds ssDNA with rapid multiple-turnover cleavage kinetics. Activation of ssDNA cutting requires faithful recognition of a DNA target sequence matching the 20-nucleotide guide RNA sequence with specificity sufficient to distinguish between closely related viral serotypes. We find that target-dependent ssDNA degradation, not observed for CRISPR-Cas9 enzymes, is a fundamental property of type V CRISPR-Cas12 proteins, revealing a fascinating parallel with the RNA-triggered general RNase activity of the type VI CRISPR-Cas13 enzymes.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryCas12a (Cpf1) and related type V CRISPR interference proteins possess non-specific, single-stranded DNase activity upon activation by guide RNA-dependent DNA binding.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in stem cell differentiation validation is the availability of bioassays to prove cell types generated in vitro are equivalent to cells in vivo. In the mouse model, differentiation of primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) from pluripotent cells was validated by transplantation, leading to the generation of spermatogenesis and to the birth of offspring. Here we report the use of xenotransplantation (monkey to mouse) and homologous transplantation (monkey to monkey) to validate our in vitro protocol for differentiating male rhesus macaque PGCLCs (rPGCLCs) from rhesus macaque induced pluripotent stem cells (riPSCs). Specifically, transplantation of aggregates containing rPGCLCs into mouse and nonhuman primate testicles overcomes a major bottleneck in rPGCLC differentiation with the expression of VASA and MAGEA4, but not ENO2. These findings suggest that immature rPGCLCs once transplanted into an adult gonadal niche commit to differentiate towards late PGCs and spermatogonia-like cells but do not complete the conversion into ENO2-positive spermatogonia.",

    "abstract": "An unanswered question regarding Alzheimer disease dementia (ADD) is whether amyloid-beta (A{beta}) plaques sequester toxic soluble A{beta} species early in the pathological progression. We previously reported that the concentration of soluble A{beta} aggregates from patients with mild dementia was higher than soluble A{beta} aggregates from patients with modest A{beta} plaque burden but no dementia. The ratio of soluble A{beta} aggregate concentration to A{beta} plaque area fully distinguished these groups of patients. We hypothesized that initially plaques may serve as a reservoir or sink for toxic soluble A{beta} aggregates, sequestering them from other targets in the extracellular space and thereby preventing their toxicity. To initially test a generalized version of this hypothesis, we have performed binding assessments using biotinylated synthetic A{beta}1-42 peptide. A{beta}1-42-biotin peptide was incubated on unfixed frozen sections from non-demented high plaque pathology controls and patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type. The bound peptide was measured using ELISA and confocal microscopy. We observed no quantitative difference in A{beta} binding between the groups using either method. Further testing of the buffering hypothesis using various forms of synthetic and human derived soluble A{beta} aggregates will be required to definitively address the role of plaque buffering as it relates to ADD.",

    "abstract": "For stable perception of odor intensity, there must exist a neural correlate that is invariant across other parameters, such as the highly variable sniff cycle. Previous hypotheses suggest that variance in inhalation dynamics alters odor concentration profiles in the naris despite a constant environmental concentration. Using whole cell recordings in the olfactory bulb of awake mice, we directly demonstrate that increased sniffing frequency mimics the effect of odor concentration increase at the level of both mitral and tufted cell (MTC) firing rate responses and temporal responses. In contrast, we find that mice are capable of discriminating concentrations within short timescales despite highly variable sniffing behavior. We reason that the only way mice can differentiate a change in sniff parameters and a change in concentration is to encode information about the inhalation parameters in parallel. While conceivably this could be achieved via corollary discharge from respiration control centres, we find that the sniff-driven activity of MTCs without odor input is informative of the kind of inhalation that just occurred, allowing rapid detection of a change in inhalation. Thus, a possible reason for sniff modulation of the early olfactory system may be to inform downstream centres of nasal flow dynamics, so that an inference can be made about environmental concentration independent of sniff variance.",

    "abstract": "22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a recurrent copy number variant (CNV) with high penetrance for developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. Study of individuals with 22q11DS therefore may offer key insights into neural mechanisms underlying such complex illnesses. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) studies in idiopathic schizophrenia have consistently revealed disruption of thalamic and hippocampal circuitry. Here, we sought to test whether this circuitry is similarly disrupted in the context of this genetic high-risk condition. To this end, resting-state functional connectivity patterns were assessed in a sample of young men and women with 22q11DS (n=42) and demographically matched healthy controls (n=39). Neuroimaging data were acquired via single-band protocols, and analyzed in line with methods provided by the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We computed functional relationships between individual-specific anatomically-defined thalamic and hippocampal seeds and all gray matter voxels in the brain. Whole-brain type I error protection was achieved through nonparametric permutation-based methods. 22q11DS patients displayed reciprocal disruptions in thalamic and hippocampal functional connectivity relative to control subjects. Thalamo-cortical coupling was increased in sensorimotor cortex, and reduced across associative networks. The opposite effect was observed for the hippocampus in regards to sensory and associative network connectivity. The thalamic and hippocampal dysconnectivity observed in 22q11DS suggest that high genetic risk for psychiatric illness is linked with disruptions in large-scale cortico-subcortical networks underlying higher-order cognitive functions. These effects highlight the translational importance of large-effect CNVs for informing mechanisms underlying neural disruptions observed in idiopathic developmental neuropsychiatric disorders.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTInvestigation of neuroimaging biomarkers in highly penetrant genetic syndromes represents a more biologically tractable approach to identify neural circuit disruptions underlying developmental neuropsychiatric conditions. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome confers particularly high risk for psychotic disorders, and is thus an important translational model in which to investigate systems-level mechanisms implicated in idiopathic illness. Here, we show resting-state fMRI evidence of large-scale sensory and executive network disruptions in youth with 22q11DS. In particular, this study provides the first evidence that these networks are disrupted in a reciprocal fashion with regard to the functional connectivity of the thalamus and hippocampus, suggesting circuit-level dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Translation termination ensures proper lengths of cellular proteins. During termination, release factor (RF) recognizes a stop codon and catalyzes peptide release. Conformational changes in RF are thought to underlie accurate translation termination. If true, the release factor should bind the A-site codon in inactive (compact) conformation(s), but structural studies of ribosome termination complexes have only captured RFs in an extended, active conformation. Here, we identify a hyper-accurate RF1 variant, and present crystal structures of 70S termination complexes that suggest a structural pathway for RF1 activation. In the presence of blasticidin S, the catalytic domain of RF1 is removed from the peptidyl-transferase center, whereas the codon-recognition domain is fully engaged in stop-codon recognition in the decoding center. RF1 codon recognition induces decoding-center rearrangements that precede accommodation of the catalytic domain. Our findings suggest how structural dynamics of RF1 and the ribosome coordinate stop-codon recognition with peptide release, ensuring accurate translation termination.",
