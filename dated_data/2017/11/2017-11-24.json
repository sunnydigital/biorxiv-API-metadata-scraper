    "abstract": "Estimates of microbial fitness from growth curves are inaccurate. Rather, competition experiments are necessary for accurate estimation. But competition experiments require unique markers and are difficult to perform with isolates derived from a common ancestor or non-model organisms. Here we describe a new approach for predicting relative growth of microbes in a mixed culture utilizing mono- and mixed culture growth curve data. We validated this approach using growth curve and competition experiments with E. coli. Our approach provides an effective way to predict growth in a mixed culture and infer relative fitness. Furthermore, by integrating several growth phases, it provides an ecological interpretation for microbial fitness.",

    "abstract": "When infants and adults communicate, they exchange social signals of availability and communicative intention such as eye gaze. Previous research indicates that when communication is successful, close temporal dependencies arise between adult speakers and listeners neural activity. However, it is not known whether similar neural contingencies exist within adult-infant dyads. Here, we used dual-electroencephalography to assess whether direct gaze increases neural coupling between adults and infants during screen-based and live interactions. In Experiment 1 (N=17), infants viewed videos of an adult who was singing nursery rhymes with (a) Direct gaze (looking forward); (b) Indirect gaze (head and eyes averted by 20{degrees}); or (c) Direct-Oblique gaze (head averted but eyes orientated forward). In Experiment 2 (N=19), infants viewed the same adult in a live context, singing with Direct or Indirect gaze. Gaze-related changes in adult-infant neural network connectivity were measured using Partial Directed Coherence. Across both experiments, the adult had a significant (Granger)-causal influence on infants neural activity, which was stronger during Direct and Direct-Oblique gaze relative to Indirect gaze. During live interactions, infants also influenced the adult more during Direct than Indirect gaze. Further, infants vocalised more frequently during live Direct gaze, and individual infants who vocalized longer also elicited stronger synchronisation from the adult. These results demonstrate that direct gaze strengthens bi-directional adult-infant neural connectivity during communication. Thus, ostensive social signals could act to bring brains into mutual temporal alignment, creating a joint-networked state that is structured to facilitate information transfer during early communication and learning.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus, like the neocortex, has a morphological structure that is complex and variable in its folding pattern, especially in the hippocampal head. The current study presents a computational method to unfold hippocampal grey matter, with a particular focus on the hippocampal head where complexity is highest due to medial curving of the structure and the variable presence of digitations. This unfolding was performed on segmentations from high-resolution, T2-weighted 7T MRI data from 12 healthy participants and one surgical patient with epilepsy whose resected hippocampal tissue was used for histological validation. We traced a critical hippocampal component, the hippocampal sulcus and stratum radiatum, lacunosum moleculaire, (SRLM) in these images, then employed user-guided semi-automated techniques to detect and subsequently unfold the surrounding hippocampal grey matter. This unfolding was performed by solving Laplaces equation in three dimensions of interest (long-axis, proximal-distal, and laminar). The resulting  unfolded coordinate space provides an intuitive way of mapping the hippocampal subfields in 2D space (long-axis and proximal-distal), such that similar borders can be applied in the head, body, and tail of the hippocampus independently of variability in folding. This unfolded coordinate space was employed to map intracortical myelin and thickness in relation to subfield borders, which revealed intracortical myelin differences that closely follow the subfield borders used here. Examination of a histological sample from a patient with epilepsy reveals that our unfolded coordinate system shows biological validity, and that subfield segmentations applied in this space are able to capture features not seen in manual tracing protocols.\\n\\nResearch highlightsO_LISRLM in hippocampal head consistently detected with 7T, T2 isotropic MRI\\nC_LIO_LIHippocampal grey matter unfolded using Laplaces equation in 3D\\nC_LIO_LIIntracortical myelin and thickness mapped in unfolded coordinate space\\nC_LIO_LIUnfolded subfields capture critical structural regularities and agree with histology\\nC_LI",

Although recent human urothelial organoid models are promising, none demonstrate long-term tolerance to urine, the natural substrate of the tissue and of the uropathogens that live there. We developed a novel human organoid from progenitor cells which demonstrates key structural hallmarks and biomarkers of the urothelium. After three weeks of transwell culture with 100% urine at the apical interface, the organoid stratified into multiple layers. The apical surface differentiated into enlarged and flattened umbrella-like cells bearing characteristic tight junctions, structures resembling asymmetric unit membrane plaques, and a glycosaminoglycan layer. The apical cells also expressed apical cytokeratin-20, a spatial feature of the mammalian urothelium. Urine itself was necessary for full development, and undifferentiated cells were urine-tolerant despite the lack of membrane plaques and a glycosaminoglycan layer. Infection with Enterococcus faecalis revealed the expected invasive outcome, including urothelial sloughing and the formation of intracellular colonies similar to those previously observed in patient cells. This new biomimetic model could help illuminate invasive behaviours of uropathogens, and serve as a reproducible test bed for disease formation, treatment and resolution in patients.",

    "abstract": "Membrane invagination and vesicle formation are key steps in endocytosis and cellular trafficking. Here, we show that endocytic coat proteins with prion-like domains (PLDs) form hemispherical puncta in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae. These puncta have the hallmarks of biomolecular condensates and enable membrane remodeling to drive actin-independent endocytosis. The puncta, which we refer to as endocytic condensates, form and dissolve reversibly in response to changes in temperature and solution conditions. The condensates are organized around dynamic protein-protein interaction networks, which involve interactions among PLDs with high glutamine contents. The endocytic coat protein Sla1 is at the hub of the protein-protein interaction network. Using active rheology, we indirectly characterized the material properties of endocytic condensates. These experiments show that endocytic condensates are viscoelastic materials and allow us to estimate the interfacial tension between endocytic condensates and their surroundings. We then adapt the physics of contact mechanics, specifically the contact theory of Hertz, to develop a quantitative framework for describing how interfacial tensions among condensates, the membrane, and the cytosol can deform the plasma membrane to enable actin independent endocytosis.",

The resulting software proves to be flexible and easily extensible in Python, while building on the PyTorch library [32], which was previously used successfully in deep learning applications, for just-in-time optimization and compilation of the model onto CPU or GPU architectures. An alternative implementation based on Theano [33] is also available, although not fully supported.\\n\\nThrough automatic differentiation, any parameter of a specified model can be optimized to approach a desired output which is a significant improvement over e.g. Monte Carlo or particle optimizations without gradients. We show that a number of models including even complex non-linearities such as contrast gain control and spiking mechanisms can be implemented easily.\\n\\nWe show in this paper that we can in particular recreate the simulation results of a popular retina simulation software VirtualRetina [35], with the added benefit of providing (1) arbitrary linear filters instead of the product of Gaussian and exponential filters and (2) optimization routines utilizing the gradients of the model. We demonstrate the utility of 3d convolution filters with a simple direction selective filter. Also we show that it is possible to optimize the input for a certain goal, rather than the parameters, which can aid the design of experiments as well as closed-loop online stimulus generation. Yet, Convis is more than a retina simulator. For instance it can also predict the response of V1 orientation selective cells.\\n\\nConvis is open source under the GPL-3.0 license and available from https://github.com/jahuth/convis/ with documentation at https://jahuth.github.io/convis/.",

    "abstract": "1Life continues to shock and amaze us, reminding us that truth is far stranger than fiction. http://Euplotid.io is a quantized geometric model of the eukaryotic cell, an attempt at quantifying the incredible complexity that gives rise to a living cell by beginning from the smallest unit, a quanta. Starting from the very bottom we are able to build the pieces which when hierarchically and combinatorially combined produce the emergent complex behavior that even a single celled organism can show. Euplotid is composed of a set of quantized geometric 3D building blocks and constantly evolving dockerized bioinformatic pipelines enabling a user to build and interact with the local regulatory architecture of every gene starting from DNA-interactions, chromatin accessibility, and RNA-sequencing. Reads are quantified using the latest computational tools and the results are normalized, quality-checked, and stored. The local regulatory architecture of each gene is built using a Louvain based graph partitioning algorithm parameterized by the chromatin extrusion model and CTCF-CTCF interactions. Cis-Regulatory Elements are defined using chromatin accessibility peaks which are mapped to Transcriptional Start Sites based on inclusion within the same neighborhood. Deep Neural Networks are trained in order to provide a statistical model mimicking transcription factor binding, giving the ability to identify all Transcription Factors within a given chromatin accessibility peak. By in-silico mutating and re-applying the neural network we are able to gauge the impact of a transition mutation on the binding of any transcription factor. The annotated output can be visualized in a variety of 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D ways overlaid with existing bodies of knowledge such as GWAS results or PDB structures. Once a particular CRE of interest has been identified a Base Editor mediated transition mutation can then be performed in a relevant model for further study.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/170159v15_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a55a1borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bebb0dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ea5b11org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100e735_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 0.1:C_FLOATNO Graphical Abstract\n\nC_FIG",

Here, we provide a novel explanation for how human time perception might be accomplished, based on non-temporal perceptual clas-sification processes. To demonstrate this proposal, we built an artificial neural system centred on a feed-forward image classification network, functionally similar to human visual processing. In this system, input videos of natural scenes drive changes in network activation, and accumulation of salient changes in activation are used to estimate duration. Estimates produced by this system match human reports made about the same videos, replicating key qualitative biases, including differentiating between scenes of walking around a busy city or sitting in a cafe or office. Our approach provides a working model of duration perception from stimulus to estimation and presents a new direction for examining the foundations of this central aspect of human experience.",

This transformation involves rearrangements at the nucleosome level and has consequences for transcription, but the details remain unclear. Here, we use cryo-electron tomography to determine the 3-D arrangement of nucleosomes and other large nuclear features in frozen-hydrated fission-yeast cells. Nucleosomes can form irregular clusters in both interphase and mitotic cells, but they are smaller than expected for Hi-C domains. The nucleosomes are co-mingled with two features: nucleosome-free pockets and megadalton-sized \\\"megacomplexes\\\". Compared to interphase, the nucleosomes in mitotic chromosomes pack into slightly larger clusters. However, nearest-neighbor distance analysis reveals that mitotic nucleosome clusters have the same internal packing density as in interphase. Furthermore, mitotic chromosomes contain fewer megacomplexes. This uneven chromosome condensation helps explain a longstanding enigma of mitosis: most genes are repressed but a subset is upregulated.",

The proof that the invariable site plus continuous {Gamma} model is identifiable (model parameters can be inferred correctly given enough data) has increased the creditability of its application to phylogeny reconstruction. However, most phylogenetic software implement the invariable site plus discrete {Gamma} model, whose identifiability is likely but unproven. How well the parameters of the invariable site plus discrete {Gamma} model are estimated is still disputed. Especially the correlation of the fraction of invariable sites with the fractions of sites with a slow evolutionary rate is discussed as being problematic. We show that optimization heuristics as implemented in frequently used phylogenetic software cannot always reliably estimate the shape parameter, the proportion of invariable sites and the tree length. Here, we propose an improved optimization heuristic that accurately estimates the three parameters. While research efforts mainly focus on tree search methods, our results signify the equal importance of verifying and developing effective estimation methods for complex models of sequence evolution.",

Host response to viral infection typically includes virus-induced rewiring of metabolic network to supply essential building blocks for viral assembly, as opposed to activation of anti-viral host defense. Nevertheless, there is a major bottleneck to accurately discern between viral hijacking strategies and host defense responses when averaging bulk population response. Here we use Emiliania huxleyi, a bloom-forming alga and its specific virus (EhV), as one of the most ecologically important host-virus model system in the ocean. Using automatic microfluidic setup to capture individual algal cells, we quantified host and virus gene expression on a single-cell resolution during the course of infection. We revealed high heterogeneity in viral gene expression among individual cells. Simultaneous measurements of expression profiles of host and virus genes at a single-cell level allowed mapping of infected cells into newly defined infection states and uncover a yet unrecognized early phase in host response that occurs prior to viral expression. Intriguingly, resistant cells emerged during viral infection, showed unique expression profiles of metabolic genes which can provide the basis for discerning between viral resistant and sensitive cells within heterogeneous populations in the marine environment. We propose that resolving host-virus arms race at a single-cell level will provide important mechanistic insights into viral life cycles and will uncover host defense strategies.",

During limb development, the telomeric TAD controls the early transcription of Hoxd gene in forearm cells, whereas the centromeric TAD subsequently regulates more posterior Hoxd genes in digit cells. Therefore, the TAD boundary prevents the terminal Hoxd13 gene to respond to forearm enhancers, thereby allowing proper limb patterning. To assess the nature and function of this CTCF-rich DNA region in embryo, we compared chromatin interaction profiles between proximal and distal limb bud cells isolated from mutant stocks where various parts or this boundary region were removed. The resulting progressive release in boundary effect triggered inter-TAD contacts, favored by the activity of the newly accessed enhancers. However, the boundary was highly resilient and only a 400kb large deletion including the whole gene cluster was eventually able to merge the neighboring TADs into a single structure. In this unified TAD, both proximal and distal limb enhancers nevertheless continued to work independently over a targeted transgenic reporter construct. We propose that the whole HoxD cluster is a dynamic TAD border and that the exact boundary position varies depending on both the transcriptional status and the developmental context.",

The dataset included a number of subjects with a substantial Finnish contribution to ancestry. We have reanalysed the same dataset after removal of these subjects and we have also included non-singleton variants of all types using a weighted burden test which assigns higher weights to variants predicted to have a greater effect on protein function. We investigated the same 31 gene sets as previously and also 1454 GO gene sets. The reduced dataset consisted of 4225 cases and 5834 controls. No individual variants or genes were significantly enriched in cases but 13 out of the 31 gene sets were significant after Bonferroni correction and the \\\"FMRP targets\\\" set produced a signed log p value (SLP) of 7.1. The gene within this set with the highest SLP, equal to 3.4, was FYN, which codes for a tyrosine kinase which phosphorylates glutamate metabotropic receptors and ionotropic NMDA receptors, thus modulating their trafficking, subcellular distribution and function. In the most recent GWAS of schizophrenia it was identified as a \\\"prioritized candidate gene\\\". Two of the subunits of the NMDA receptor which are substrates of FYN are coded for by GRIN1 (SLP=1.7) and GRIN2B (SLP=2.1). Of note, for some sets there was a substantial enrichment of non-singleton variants. Of 1454 GO gene sets, 3 were significant after Bonferroni correction. Identifying specific genes and variants will depend on genotyping them in larger samples and/or demonstrating that they cosegregate with illness within pedigrees.",

Here, we perform a comprehensive reconstruction of the evolutionary histories of the chromosomal inversions in these species. We provide a solution to the puzzling origins of the selfish Sex-Ratio chromosome in D. persimilis and show that this Sex-Ratio chromosome directly descends from an ancestrally-arranged chromosome. Our results further show that all fixed inversions between D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura were segregating in the ancestral population long before speciation, and that the genes contributing to reproductive barriers between these species must have evolved within them afterwards. We propose a new model for the role of chromosomal inversions in speciation and suggest that higher levels of divergence and an association with hybrid incompatibilities are emergent properties of ancestrally segregating inversions. These findings force a reconsideration of the role of chromosomal inversions in speciation, not as protectors of existing hybrid incompatibility alleles, but as fertile grounds for their formation.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the phylogenetic variation of avian evaporative cooling efficiency and heat tolerance in hot environments. We quantified thermoregulatory responses to high air temperature (Ta) in ~100-g representatives of three orders: African cuckoo (Cuculus gularis, Cuculiformes), lilac-breasted roller (Coracias caudatus, Coraciiformes), and Burchells starling (Lamprotornis australis, Passeriformes). All three species initiated respiratory mechanisms to increase evaporative heat dissipation when body temperature (Tb) approached 41.5{degrees}C in response to increasing Ta, with gular flutter observed in cuckoos and panting in rollers and starlings. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and evaporative water loss (EWL) increased by quantitatively similar magnitudes in all three species, although maximum rates of EWL were proportionately lower in starlings. Evaporative cooling efficiency [defined as the ratio of evaporative heat loss (EHL) to metabolic heat production (MHP)] generally remained below 2.0 in cuckoos and starlings, but reached a maximum of ~3.5 in rollers. The high value for rollers reveals a very efficient evaporative cooling mechanism, and is similar to EHL/MHP maxima for similarly sized columbids which very effectively dissipate heat via cutaneous evaporation. This unexpected phylogenetic variation among the orders tested in the physiological mechanisms of heat dissipation is an important step toward determining the evolution of heat tolerance traits in desert birds.\\n\\nSummary statementWe show that avian evaporative cooling efficiency and heat tolerance display substantial taxonomic variation that are, unexpectedly, not systematically related to the use of panting versus gular flutter processes.",

    "abstract": "In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for thousands of phenotypes in large biobanks, most binary traits have substantially fewer cases than controls. Both of the widely used approaches, linear mixed model and the recently proposed logistic mixed model, perform poorly - producing large type I error rates - in the analysis of phenotypes with unbalanced case-control ratios. Here we propose a scalable and accurate generalized mixed model association test that uses the saddlepoint approximation (SPA) to calibrate the distribution of score test statistics. This method, SAIGE, provides accurate p-values even when case-control ratios are extremely unbalanced. It utilizes state-of-art optimization strategies to reduce computational time and memory cost of generalized mixed model. The computation cost linearly depends on sample size, and hence can be applicable to GWAS for thousands of phenotypes by large biobanks. Through the analysis of UK Biobank data of 408,961 white British European-ancestry samples for >1400 binary phenotypes, we show that SAIGE can efficiently analyze large sample data, controlling for unbalanced case-control ratios and sample relatedness.",

Using a MAX deficient cell line and siRNA-mediated silencing of MAX, we show that in the absence of MAX, the total MNT levels are elevated and that MNT localizes both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In contrast, MNT is predominantly nuclear when MAX is expressed. MNT is required for optimal cell proliferation even in the absence of MAX, being the first report of a MAX-independent function of MNT.

    "abstract": "Genome evolution in disparate species is synopsized to highlight the role of common genetic variants during their adaptation, and an evolutionary perspective is provided to infer lifestyle-related disease progression in humans. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a multi-factorial disease, where maladaptation due to a sedentary lifestyle and faulty diet can influence its prognosis, but the genetic basis for its differential severity remains unknown. As a healthy diet and lifestyle may restrict its prognosis, we hypothesize that a hierarchy of common genetic variants may differentially modulate that severity in a subpopulation. We suggest that the loss-of-function paradigm due to a genetic variant may give rise to a broad spectrum of CVD severity in conjunction with other variants. Here, we have inferred that CAD severity may be a consequence of the plasticity of common variants exclusive among patients with disparate disease severity. Most importantly, we have used a small and outbred subpopulation to demonstrate that common genetic variants can be exploited to trace this unique facet of CAD etiology. Moreover, we corroborate our hypothesis by reporting that a hierarchical plasticity of the LDLR gene, which has been implicated in a differential response to lipid metabolism, is associated with differential CVD severity.\\n\\nCan we gain insight to the genetic etiology of diseases using a limited number of genomes (few hundred)? Can small data sets lend insights that large data sets may subsequently confirm? Here, I show how common genetic variants, which were identified only from hundreds of individuals, may be used to gain unique insights regarding the disease etiology of a common lifestyle-related disease.",

We achieved a complete integration of the major software suites resulting in the first turn-key workflow encompassing all steps for mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics including preprocessing, multivariate statistics, and metabolite identification.

    "abstract": "Head direction (HD) cells signal the orientation of an animals head relative to its environment. During post-natal development, HD cells are the earliest spatially modulated neurons in the hippocampal circuit to emerge. However, before eye-opening, HD cell responses in rat pups carry low directional information content and are directionally unstable. Using Bayesian decoding, we characterise this instability and identify its source: despite the directional signal being internally coherent, it consistently under-signals angular head velocity (AHV), incompletely shifting in proportion to head turns. We find evidence that geometric cues (corners) can be used to mitigate this under-signalling, and stabilise the directional signal even before eye-opening. Crucially, even when directional firing cannot be stabilised, ensembles of unstable HD cells show short-timescale (1-10 sec) temporal and spatial couplings consistent with an adult-like HD network, through which activity drifts unanchored to landmark cues. The existence of fixed spatial and temporal offsets across co-recorded cells and of an AHV-responsive signal, even before HD responses become spatially stable, suggests that the HD circuit is assembled through internal, self-organising processes, without reference to external landmarks. The HD network is widely modelled as a continuous attractor whose output is one coherent activity peak, updated during movement by angular head velocity (AHV) signals, and anchored by landmark cues. Our findings present strong evidence for this model, and demonstrate that the required network circuitry is in place and functional during development, independent of reference to landmark information.",

Comparative transcriptome analysis of ten organs from breeders and non-breeders of the eusocial long-lived NMR and the polygynous shorter-lived guinea pig provide comprehensive and unbiased molecular evidence that sexual maturation in NMR is socially suppressed. After transition into breeders, transcriptomes are markedly sex-specific, show pronounced feedback signaling via gonadal steroids and have similarities to reproductive phenotypes in African cichlid fish. Further, NMRs show functional enrichment of status-related expression differences associated with aging. Lipid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation - molecular networks known to be linked to aging - were identified among most affected gene sets. Further, a transcriptome pattern associated with longevity is reinforced in NMR breeders contradicting the disposable soma theory of aging and potentially contributing to their exceptional long life- and healthspan.",

However, whether conspecifics pay attention to facial masculinity has only been assessed in humans. In a study of free-ranging rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, we used a two-alternative look-time experiment to test whether females perceive male facial masculinity. We presented 107 females with pairs of images of male faces - one with a more masculine shape and one more feminine - and recorded their looking behaviour. Females looked at the masculine face longer than at the feminine face in more trials than predicted by chance. Although there was no overall difference in average look-time between masculine and feminine faces across all trials, females looked significantly longer at masculine faces in a subset of trials for which the within-pair difference in masculinity was most pronounced. Additionally, the proportion of time subjects looked toward the masculine face increased as the within-pair difference in masculinity increased. This study provides evidence that female macaques perceive variation in male facial shape, a necessary condition for intersexual selection to operate on such a trait. It also highlights the potential impact of perceptual thresholds on look-time experiments.",

ISRIB, a drug-like eIF2B activator, reverses the effects of eIF2 phosphorylation and, remarkably, in rodents enhances cognition and corrects cognitive deficits after brain injury. To determine its mechanism of action, we solved an atomic-resolution structure of ISRIB bound in a deep cleft within decameric human eIF2B by electron cryo-microscopy. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that formation of fully active, decameric eIF2B holoenzyme depended on the assembly of two identical tetrameric subcomplexes, and that ISRIB promoted this step by cross-bridging a central symmetry interface. Regulation of eIF2B assembly emerges as a rheostat for eIF2B activity that tunes translation during the ISR and that can be further modulated by ISRIB.",

However, it is still debated whether the rhythmic activity emerges from network morphology developed in neurogenesis or as a result of neuronal dynamics realized under certain conditions. In this research we found, that in neural networks formed in mature hippocampal cultures with high cellular density the spiking activity self-organized and converged to long, complex and rhythmically repeated superbursts. The superburst lasted tens of seconds and consisted of hundreds of short (50-100 ms) small bursts with a high spiking rate of 139.0 {+/-} 78.6 Hz that can be associated with high-frequency oscillations in the hippocampus. In turn, the interval between peak burst activities in the range of 100-150 ms can be treated as a theta rhythm (11.2 {+/-} 1.5 Hz). Distribution of spikes within the bursts was non-random, representing a set of well-defined space-time base patterns or motifs. We found that the long superburst can be classified into two types. Each type was associated with a unique direction of spike propagation and, hence, can be encoded by a binary sequence with random switching between the two \\\"functional\\\" states. Such precisely structured bidirectional rhythmic activity developed in self-organizing cultured networks were quite similar to what observed in the in vivo experiments.",

    "abstract": "The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the single worldwide archive of experimentally-determined three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins and nucleic acids. As of January 2017, the PDB housed more than 125,000 structures and was growing by more than 11,000 structures annually. Since the 3D structure of a protein is vital to understand the mechanisms of biological processes, diseases, and drug design, correct oligomeric assembly information is of critical importance. For example, it makes a difference if the protein is normally a dimer and not a monomer or a trimer or a tetramer or a hexamer in nature. Unfortunately, the biologically relevant oligomeric form of a 3D structure is not directly obtainable by X-ray crystallography. Instead, this information may be provided by the PDB Depositor as metadata coming from additional experiments, be inferred by sequence-sequence comparisons with similar proteins of known oligomeric state, or predicted using software, such as PISA (Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies) or EPPIC (Evolutionary Protein Protein Interface Classifier). Despite significant efforts by professional PDB Biocurators during data deposition, there remain a number of structures in the archive with incorrect quaternary structure descriptions (or annotations). Further investigation is, therefore, needed to evaluate the correctness of quaternary structure annotations. In this study, we aim to identify the most probable oligomeric states for proteins represented in the PDB. Our approach evaluated the performance of four independent prediction methods, including text mining of primary publications, inference from homologous protein structures, and two computational methods (PISA and EPPIC). Aggregating predictions to give consensus results outperformed all four of the independent prediction methods, yielding 86% correct, 9% incorrect, and 5% inconclusive predictions, when tested with a well-curated benchmark dataset. We have developed a freely-available web-based tool to make this approach accessible to researchers and PDB Biocurators (http://quatstruct.rcsb.org).",

    "abstract": "Hydraulics of plants that take different strategies of stomatal control under water stress are still relatively poorly understood. Here we explore how root and shoot hydraulics, gas exchange, aquaporin expression and abscisic acid (ABA) concentration in leaf xylem sap ([ABA]xylem) may be involved and coordinated. A comparison in responses to mild water stress and ABA application was made between two cultivars of Vitis vinifera L. previously classified as isohydric (Grenache) and anisohydric (Syrah). Grenache showed stronger adjustments of leaf, plant, and root hydraulic conductances to decreased soil moisture and a steeper correlation of stomatal conductance (gs) to [ABA]xylem than Syrah resulting in greater conservation of soil moisture, but not necessarily more isohydric behaviour. Under well-watered conditions, changes in vapour pressure deficit (VPD) had a strong influence on gs in both cultivars with adjustments of leaf hydraulic conductance. Grenache was more sensitive to decreases in soil water availability compared to Syrah that rather responded to VPD. There were stronger correlations between plant hydraulic parameters and changes in aquaporin gene expression in leaves and roots of Grenache. Overall, the results reinforce the hypothesis that both hydraulic and chemical signals significantly contribute to the differences in water conservation behaviours of the two cultivars.",

    "abstract": "Heterodimeric class IA phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K) transduce signals from many receptor tyrosine kinases including the insulin receptor. PI3K recruitment to phosphotyrosines is mediated by Pik3r1 gene products including the most intensely studied PI3K regulatory subunit, p85, which also binds and regulates the PIP3 phosphatase Pten, and the lipogenic transcription factor Xbp1. Mutations in human PIK3R1 cause SHORT syndrome, featuring lipodystrophy and severe insulin resistance which, uniquely, are uncoupled from fatty liver and dyslipidemia. We describe a novel mouse model of SHORT syndrome made by knock in of the Pik3r1 Y657X mutation. Homozygous embryos die at E11.5, while heterozygous mice exhibit pre-and postnatal growth impairment with diminished placental vascularity. Adipose tissue accretion on high fat feeding was reduced, however adipocyte size was unchanged and preadipocyte differentiation ex vivo unimpaired. Despite severe insulin resistance, heterozygous mice were hypolipidemic, and plasma adiponectin, liver weight, cholesterol, glycogen and triglyceride content were unchanged. Mild downregulation of lipogenic Srebp1, Srebp2 and Chrebp transcriptional activity but no suppression of Xbp1 target genes was seen after fasting. These findings give new insights into the developmental role of Pik3r1, and establish a model of lipodystrophic insulin resistance dissociated from dyslipidemia as seen in SHORT syndrome.",

Impressive as these results may be, a fundamental statistical error has persisted in the literature that affects the numerical resolution values for practically all published structures. The error goes back to a misinterpretation of basic statistics and pervades virtually all popular cryo-EM quality metrics. The resolution in cryo-EM is typically assessed by the Fourier Shell Correlation \\\"FSC\\\" [Harauz & van Heel: Optik 73(1986)146-156] using a fixed threshold value of 0.143 (\\\"FSC0.143\\\") [Rosenthal, Henderson, J.

When two vectors are uncorrelated the expectation value of their inner-product is zero. That, however, does not imply that each individual inner-product of the vectors is zero (the vectors are not orthogonal). This error was introduced to electron microscopy in [Frank & Al-Ali, Nature 256(1975)376-379] and has since proliferated into virtually all quality and resolution-related metrics in EM. One criterion not affected by this error is the information-based [1/2]-bit FSC threshold [van Heel & Schatz: J. Struct. Biol. 151(2005)250-262].",

    "abstract": "Chaotic dynamics of neural oscillations has been shown at the single neuron and network levels, both in experimental data and numerical simulations. Theoretical studies over the last twenty years have demonstrated an underlying role of chaos in neural systems. Nevertheless, whether chaotic neural oscillators make a significant contribution to relevant network behavior and whether the dynamical richness of neural networks are sensitive to the dynamics of isolated neurons, still remain open questions. We investigated transition dynamics of a medium-sized heterogeneous neural network of neurons connected by electrical coupling in a small world topology. We make use of an oscillatory neuron model (HB+Ih) that exhibits either chaotic or non-chaotic behavior at different combinations of conductance parameters. Measuring order parameter as a measure of synchrony, we find that the heterogeneity of firing rate and types of firing patterns make a greater contribution than chaos to the steepness of synchronization transition curve. We also show that chaotic dynamics of the isolated neurons do not always make a visible difference in process of network synchronization transitions. Moreover, the macroscopic chaos is observed regardless of the dynamics nature of the neurons. However, performing a Functional Connectivity Dynamics analysis, we show that chaotic nodes can promote what is known as the multi-stable behavior, where the network dynamically switches between a number of different semi-synchronized, metastable states.",

    "abstract": "In his theoretical work of the 70s, Robert May introduced a Random Matrix Theory (RMT) approach for studying the stability of large complex biological systems. Unlike the established paradigm, May demonstrated that complexity leads to instability in generic models of biological networks. The RMT approach has since similarly been applied in many disciplines. Central to the approach is the famous \\\"circular law\\\" that describes the eigenvalue distribution of an important class of random matrices. However the \\\"circular law\\\" generally does not apply for ecological and biological systems in which density-dependence (DD) operates. Here we directly determine the far more complicated eigenvalue distributions of complex DD systems. A simple mathematical solution falls out, that allows us to explore the connection between feasible systems (i.e., having all equilibrium populations positive) and stability. In particular, for these RMT systems, almost all feasible systems are stable. The degree of stability, or resilience, is shown to depend on the minimum equilibrium population, and not directly on factors such as network topology.",

However, DIP-seq profiles often exhibit significant variation between independent studies of the same genome and from profiles obtained by alternative methods. Here we show that these differences are primarily due to intrinsic affinity of IgG for short unmodified DNA repeats. This pervasive experimental error accounts for 50 - 99% of regions identified as  enriched for DNA modifications in DIP-seq data. Correction of this error profoundly alters DNA modification profiles for numerous cell types, including mouse embryonic stem cells, and subsequently reveals novel associations between DNA modifications, chromatin modifications and biological processes. We propose new methodological guidelines that minimize the impact of these errors on future DIP-seq experiments and allow new insights to be made from the wealth of existing DIP-seq data.",

In this study, the draft genome of YO was assembled using a hybrid de novo assembly method that takes advantage of high-depth Illumina short-reads (232.2X) and low-depth PacBio long-reads (11.5X). Although the contig and scaffold N50s (defined as the shortest contig or scaffold length at 50% of the entire assembly) of the initial de novo assembly were 53.6Kbp and 10.7Mbp, respectively, additional and pseudo-reference-assisted assemblies extended the assembly to 504.8Kbp for contig N50 (pseudo-contig) and 21.2Mbp for scaffold N50, which included 551 structural variations including the Fibromelanosis (FM) locus duplication, compared to galGal4 and 5. The completeness (97.6%) of the draft genome (Ogye_1) was evaluated with single copy orthologous genes using BUSCO, and found to be comparable to the current chicken reference genome (galGal5; 97.4%), which was assembled with a long read-only method, and superior to other avian genomes (92~93%), assembled with short read-only and hybrid methods. To comprehensively reconstruct transcriptome maps, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data were analyzed from twenty different tissues, including black tissues. The maps included 15,766 protein-coding and 6,900 long non-coding RNA genes, many of which were expressed in the tissue-specific manner, closely related with the DNA methylation pattern in the promoter regions.",

Here, we performed whole genome sequencing in 16,324 participants from four ancestries at mean depth >29X and analyzed correlations of genotypes with four quantitative traits - plasma levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. We conducted a discovery analysis including common or rare variants in coding as well as non-coding regions and developed a framework to interpret genome sequence for dyslipidemia risk. Common variant association yielded loci previously described with the exception of a few variants not captured earlier by arrays or imputation. In coding sequence, rare variant association yielded known Mendelian dyslipidemia genes and, in non-coding sequence, we detected no rare variant association signals after application of four approaches to aggregate variants in non-coding regions. We developed a new, genome-wide polygenic score for LDL-C and observed that a high polygenic score conferred similar effect size to a monogenic mutation (~30 mg/dl higher LDL-C for each); however, among those with extremely high LDL-C, a high polygenic score was considerably more prevalent than a monogenic mutation (23% versus 2% of participants, respectively).",

The organization of nucleosomes is influenced by the underlying DNA sequence itself, transcription factors or other transcriptional machinery associated proteins and chromatin remodeling complexes (1-4). Herein, we show that the naturally occurring DNA modification, 5-formylcytosine (5fC) contributes to the positioning of nucleosomes. We show that the ability of 5fC to position nucleosomes in vitro is associated with the formation of covalent interactions between histone residues and 5fC in the form of Schiff bases. We demonstrate that similar interactions can occur in a cellular environment and define their specific genomic loci in mouse embryonic stem cells. Collectively, our findings identify 5fC as a determinant of nucleosomal organization in which 5fC plays a role in establishing distinct regulatory regions that are linked to gene expression Our study provides a previously unknown molecular mechanism, involving the formation of reversible-covalent bonds between chromatin and DNA that supports a molecular linkage between DNA sequence, DNA base modification and chromatin structure.",

    "abstract": "While the perception of time plays a crucial role in our day-to-day functioning, the underlying neural mechanism of time processing on short time scales (~1s) remains to be elucidated. Recently, the power of beta oscillations (~20 Hz) has been suggested to play an important role in temporal processing. However, the paradigms supporting this view have often had confounds of working memory, as well as motor preparation. In the current EEG study, we set out to investigate if power of oscillatory activity would be involved in time perception without an explicit working memory component or confound of a motor response. Participants indicated through a button press whether the time between a tone and a visual stimulus was 1 or 1.5s.Critically, we focused on the differences in oscillatory activity in the alpha (~10 Hz) and beta (~20 Hz) ranges preceding correct versus incorrect temporal judgments. Behaviourally, we found participants made more errors on the long (1.5s) than on the short (1s) interval. In addition, we found that participants were fastest to correctly respond to a long interval. The onset of the tone induced a suppression of alpha and beta activity over occipital and parietal electrodes. In the long estimation intervals, this suppression was greater for correct than incorrect estimations. Interestingly, alpha and beta suppression allowed us to predict whether participants would judge the long interval correctly. For the short interval trials we did not find a significant difference in alpha or beta band activity for the correct and incorrect judgments. Taken together, our behavioural and EEG results suggest a multifaceted role of alpha and beta activity in the temporal estimation of sub- and supra-second intervals, where power increases seem to lead to temporal compression. Higher alpha and beta power resulted in shorter temporal judgments for sub-second intervals.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LITemporal judgments without motor confounds were studied with EEG.\\nC_LIO_LIAlpha/beta activity differences for correct and incorrect temporal judgments.\\nC_LIO_LISub-second intervals were judged as short when alpha/beta power was higher.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Symmetries are present at many scales in images of natural scenes, due to a complex interplay of physical forces that govern pattern formation in nature. The importance of symmetry for visual perception has been known at least since the gestalt movement of the early 20th century. Since then, symmetry has been shown to contribute to the perception of shapes[1, 2] scenes[3] and surface properties[4], as well as the social process of mate selection[5]. In the two spatial dimensions relevant for images, the four fundamental symmetries, reflection, rotation, translation and glide reflection, can be combined in 17 distinct ways, the \\\"wallpaper\\\" groups[6-8]. The 17 wallpaper obey a hierarchy of complexity, determined by mathematical group theory, where simpler groups are subgroups of more complex ones[9]. Here we use Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) to measure responses to the complete set of wallpaper groups, and present a complete description of the neural basis of symmetry. We find that activity in human visual cortex is remarkably consistent with the hierarchical relationships between the wallpaper groups. Specifically, the amplitudes of symmetry-specific responses in individual participants (n=25) preserve these relationships at an above-chance level in 88.3% (53 out of 60) of cases. Visual cortex thus encodes all the fundamental symmetries using a representational structure that closely approximates the subgroup relationships from group theory. Given that most participants had no knowledge of group theory, the ordered structure of visual responses to wallpaper groups is likely learned implicitly from regularities in the visual environment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective evidence based treatment for depression. At present there is no reliable predictor of CBT in depression. Although the key to successful CBT in depression lies in altering maladaptive information processing, no previous imaging study has probed predictors of CBT response using pre-treatment neural encoding of information processing. METHODS: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging we scanned 37 unmedicated depressed subjects before and after completing computerised CBT (cCBT). We model the trial-by-trial appraisal of feedback information during a probabilistic learning task by means of a dynamic learning rate. To discriminate response to cCBT we capitalise on the pre-treatment blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity encoding the dynamic learning rate as a function of feedback congruence and valence. Additionally, we probe between-group differences in the learning style encoded in the models parameters.\\n\\nRESULTSWe show BOLD activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) to be encoding the dynamic learning rate. Crucially, responders exhibit greater BOLD activity in the dmPFC during incongruent negative trials but lower BOLD activity during congruent negative trials than non-responders. Additionally, on between-group comparisons of models parameter estimates we show responders take relatively greater account of previous feedback history and make comparatively smaller adjustments to the learning rate as a result of outcome surprisingness.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSOur findings provide novel and important insights into the cognitive mechanisms underpinning response to cCBT and lend support to the feasibility and validity of neurocomputational approaches to treatment prediction research in psychiatry.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral and molecular characterization of cell-type specific populations governing fear learning and behavior is a promising avenue for the rational identification of potential therapeutics for fear-related disorders. Examining cell-type specific changes in neuronal translation following fear learning allows for targeted pharmacological intervention during fear extinction learning, mirroring possible treatment strategies in humans. Here we identify the central amygdala (CeA) Drd2-expressing population as a novel fear-supporting neuronal population that is molecularly distinct from other, previously identified, fear-supporting CeA populations. Sequencing of actively translating transcripts of Drd2 neurons using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technology identifies mRNAs that are differentially regulated following fear learning. Differentially expressed transcripts with potentially targetable gene products include Npy5r, Rxrg, Adora2a, Sst5r, Fgf3, Erbb4, Fkbp14, Dlk1, and Ssh3. Direct pharmacological manipulation of NPY5R, RXR, and ADORA2A confirms the importance of this cell population and these cell-type specific receptors in fear behavior. Furthermore, these findings validate the use of functionally identified specific cell populations to predict novel pharmacological targets for the modulation of emotional learning.",

    "abstract": "The system (PTTRS) formed by typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prx), thioredoxin (Trx), Trx reductase (TrxR), and sulfiredoxin (Srx) is central in antioxidant protection and redox signaling in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. Understanding how the PTTRS integrates these functions requires tracing phenotypes to molecular properties, which is non-trivial. Here we analyze this problem based on a model that captures the PTTRS conserved features. We have mapped the conditions that generate each distinct response to H2O2 supply rates ({nu}sup), and estimated the parameters for thirteen human cell types and for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The resulting composition-to-phenotype map yielded the following experimentally testable predictions. The PTTRS permits many distinct responses including ultra-sensitivity and hysteresis. However, nearly all tumor cell lines showed a similar response characterized by limited Trx-S- depletion and a substantial but self-limited gradual accumulation of hyperoxidized Prx at high{nu} sup. This similarity ensues from strong correlations between the TrxR, Srx and Prx activities over cell lines, which contribute to maintain the Prx-SS reduction capacity in slight excess over the maximal steady state Prx-SS production. In turn, in erythrocytes, hepatocytes and HepG2 cells high{nu} sup depletes Trx-S- and oxidizes Prx mainly to Prx-SS. In all nucleated human cells the Prx-SS reduction capacity defined a threshold separating two different regimes. At sub-threshold{nu} sup cytoplasmic H2O2 is determined by Prx, nM-range and spatially localized, whereas at supra-threshold{nu} sup it is determined by much less active alternative sinks and M-range throughout the cytoplasm. The yeast shows a distinct response where the Prx Tsa1 accumulates in sulfenate form at high{nu} sup. This is mainly due to an exceptional stability of Tsa1s sulfenate.\\n\\nThe implications of these findings for thiol redox regulation and cell physiology are discussed.

Programs such as MEGAN allow the user to interactively navigate these large datasets. Long read sequencing technologies continue to improve and produce increasing numbers of longer reads (of varying lengths in the range of 10k-1M bps, say), but of low quality. There is an increasing interest in using long reads in microbiome sequencing and there is a need to adapt short read tools to long read datasets.\\n\\nMethodsWe describe a new LCA-based algorithm for taxonomic binning, and an interval-tree based algorithm for functional binning, that are explicitly designed for long reads and assembled contigs. We provide a new interactive tool for investigating the alignment of long reads against reference sequences. For taxonomic and functional binning, we propose to use LAST to compare long reads against the NCBI-nr protein reference database so as to obtain frame-shift aware alignments, and then to process the results using our new methods.\\n\\nResultsAll presented methods are implemented in the open source edition of MEGAN and we refer to this new extension as MEGAN-LR (MEGAN long read). We evaluate the LAST+MEGAN-LR approach in a simulation study, and on a number of mock community datasets consisting of Nanopore reads, PacBio reads and assembled PacBio reads. We also illustrate the practical application on a Nanopore dataset that we sequenced from an anammox bio-rector community.",

    "abstract": "A correct assessment of the quaternary structure of proteins is a fundamental prerequisite to understanding their function, physico-chemical properties and mode of interaction with other proteins. Currently about 90% of structures in the Protein Data Bank are crystal structures, in which the correct quaternary structure is embedded in the crystal lattice among a number of crystal contacts. Computational methods are required to 1) classify all protein-protein contacts in crystal lattices as biologically relevant or crystal contacts and 2) provide an assessment of how the biologically relevant interfaces combine into a biological assembly In our previous work we addressed the first problem with our EPPIC (Evolutionary Protein Protein Interface Classifier) method. Here, we present our solution to the second problem with a new method that combines the interface classification results with symmetry and topology considerations. The new algorithm enumerates all possible valid assemblies within the crystal using a graph representation of the lattice and predicts the most probable biological unit based on the pairwise interface scoring. Our method achieves 85% precision on a new dataset of 1,481 biological assemblies with consensus of PDB annotations. Although almost the same precision is achieved by PISA, currently the most popular quaternary structure assignment method, we show that, due to the fundamentally different approach to the problem, the two methods are complementary and could be combined to improve biological assembly assignments. The software for the automatic assessment of protein assemblies (EPPIC version 3) has been made available through a web server at http://www.eppic-web.org.\\n\\nAuthor summaryX-ray diffraction experiments are the main experimental technique to reveal the detailed atomic 3-dimensional structure of proteins. In these experiments, proteins are packed into crystals, an environment that is far away from their native solution environment. Determining which parts of the structure reflect the proteins state in the cell rather than being artifacts of the crystal environment can be a difficult task. How the different protein subunits assemble together in solution is known as the quaternary structure. Finding the correct quaternary structure is important both to understand protein oligomerization and for the understanding of protein-protein interactions at large. Here we present a new method to automatically determine the quaternary structure of proteins given their crystal structure. We provide a theoretical basis for properties that correct protein assemblies should possess, and provide a systematic evaluation of all possible assemblies according to these properties. The method provides a guidance to the experimental structural biologist as well as to structural bioinformaticians analyzing protein structures in bulk. Assemblies are provided for all proteins in the Protein Data Bank through a public website and database that is updated weekly as new structures are released.",

    "abstract": "Many genomic analyses, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or genome-wide screening for Gene-Environment (GxE) interactions have been performed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of human traits and diseases. When the analyzed outcome is quantitative, the overall contribution of identified genetic variants to the outcome is often expressed as the percentage of phenotypic variance explained. In practice, this is commonly estimated using individual genotype data. However, using individual-level data faces practical and ethical challenges when the GWAS results are derived in large consortia through meta-analysis of results from multiple cohorts.

    "abstract": "DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are genomic regions that provide important information regarding the presence of transcriptional regulatory elements and the state of chromatin. Therefore, identifying DHSs in uncharacterized DNA sequences is crucial for understanding their biological functions and mechanisms. Although many experimental methods have been proposed to identify DHSs, they have proven to be expensive for genome-wide application. Therefore, it is necessary to develop computational methods for DHS prediction. In this study, we proposed a support vector machine (SVM)-based method for predicting DHSs, called DHSpred (DNase I Hypersensitive Site predictor in human DNA sequences), which was trained with 174 optimal features. The optimal combination of features was identified from a large set that included nucleotide composition and di- and trinucleotide physicochemical properties, using a random forest algorithm. DHSpred achieved a Matthews correlation coefficient and accuracy of 0.660 and 0.871, respectively, which were 3% higher than those of control SVM predictors trained with non-optimized features, indicating the efficiency of the feature selection method. Furthermore, the performance of DHSpred was superior to that of state-of-the-art predictors.

The aim of this study was to characterize and compare the urinary microbiome of bladder cancer patients with those of healthy controls. Bacterial communities present in urine specimens collected from male patients diagnosed with primary or recurrent, non-muscle invasive bladder cancers, and from healthy, age-matched individuals were analysed using 16S Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Our result show that the most abundant phylum in both groups was Firmicutes, followed by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. While microbial diversity and overall microbiome composition were not significantly different between bladder cancer and healthy samples, we identified specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were significantly more abundant (p < 0.05) in either type of samples. Among those that were significantly enriched in the bladder cancer group, we identified an OTU belonging to genus Fusobacterium, a possible protumorigenic pathogen. Three OTUs more abundant in healthy urines were from genera Veillonella, Streptococcus and Corynebacterium. Detected microbiome changes suggest that microbiome may be a factor in bladder cancer pathology, and the clinical implications of reported results remain to be explored.",

Surprisingly, either down- or up-regulation of hsr{omega} lncRNAs in sev-GAL4>RasV12 expressing eye discs resulted in complete pupal lethality and substantially greater increase in R7 photoreceptor number at the expense of cone cells. Enhanced nuclear p-MAPK and presence of sev-GAL4 driven RasV12 bound RafRBDFLAG in cells not expressing the sev-GAL4 driver indicated non-cell autonomous spread of Ras signaling when hsr{omega} levels were co-altered. RNA-sequencing revealed that down-and up-regulation of hsr{omega} transcripts in sev-GAL4>RasV12 expressing eye discs elevated transcripts of positive or negative modulators, respectively, of Ras signaling so that either condition enhances it. Altered hsr{omega} transcript levels in sev-GAL4>RasV12 expressing discs also affected sn/sno/sca RNAs and some other RNA processing transcript levels. Post-transcriptional changes due to the disrupted intra-cellular dynamicity of omega speckle associated hnRNPs and other RNA-binding proteins that follow down- or up-regulation of hsr{omega} lncRNAs appear to be responsible for the further elevated Ras signaling. Cell autonomous and non-autonomous enhancement of Ras signaling by lncRNAs like hsr{omega} has implications for cell signaling during high Ras activity commonly associated with some cancers.\\n\\nHighlightsOur findings highlight roles of hsr{omega} lncRNAs in conditionally modulating the important Ras signaling pathway and provide evidence for cell non-autonomous Ras signaling in Drosophila eye discs.",

However, the dynamics of interaction between small RNAs and polysomes during this process is largely unknown. 0-1h and 7-8h Drosophila embryos were fractionated on sucrose density gradients into four fractions based on A254 reading (1) translationally inactive messengerribonucleoprotein (mRNP); (2) 60S; (3) monosome; and (4) polysome. Comparative analysis of deep-sequencing reads from fractionated and un-fractionated 0-1h and 8-h embryos revealed development-specific co-sedimentation pattern of small RNAs with the cellular translation machinery. Although most miRNAs did not have a specific preference for any state of the translational machinery, we detected fraction-specific enrichment of some miRNAs such as miR-1-3p, -184-39, 5-5p and 263-5p. More interestingly, we observed dysregulation of a subset of miRNAs in fractionated embryos despite no measurable difference in their amount in unfractionated embryos. Transposon-derived endosiRNAs are over-expressed in 7-8h embryos and are associated mainly with the mRNP fraction. However, transposon-derived piRNAs, which are more abundant in 0-1h embryos, co-sediment primarily with the polysome fractions. These results suggest that there appears to be a complex interplay among the small RNAs with respect to their polysome-cosedimention pattern during early development in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "In mixed tree-grass ecosystems, tree recruitment is limited by demographic bottlenecks to seedling establishment arising from inter- and intra-life form competition, and disturbances such as fire. Enhanced nutrient availability resulting from anthropogenic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition can alter the nature of these bottlenecks by changing seedling growth and biomass allocation patterns, and lead to longer-term shifts in tree community composition if different plant functional groups respond differently to increased nutrient availability. However, the extent to which tree functional types characteristic of savannas differ in their responses to increased N and P availability remains unclear. We quantified differences in above- and belowground biomass, and root carbohydrate contents - parameters known to influence the ability of plants to compete, as well as survive and recover from fires - in seedlings of multiple N-fixing and non-N-fixing tree species characteristic of Indian savanna and dry-forest ecosystems to experimental N and P additions. N-fixers in our study were co-limited by N and P availability, while non-N-fixers were N limited. Although both functional groups increased biomass production following fertilisation, non-N-fixers were more responsive and showed greater relative increases in biomass with fertilisation than N-fixers. N-fixers had greater baseline investment in belowground resources and root carbohydrate stocks, and while fertilisation reduced root:shoot ratios in both functional groups, root carbohydrate content only reduced with fertilisation in non-N-fixers. Our results indicate that, even within a given system, plants belonging to different functional groups can be limited by, and respond differentially to, different nutrients, suggesting that long-term consequences of nutrient deposition are likely to vary across savannas contingent on the relative amounts of N and P being deposited in sites.",

This has implications for antibiotic treatment: exposure to sub-inhibitory doses of antibiotics has been reported to increase bacterial mutation rates, and thus probably the rate at which resistance mutations appear and lead to treatment failure.\\n\\nMeasuring mutation rates under stress, however, is problematic, because existing methods assume there is no death. Yet sub-inhibitory stress levels may induce a substantial death rate. Death events need to be compensated by extra replication to reach a given population size, thus giving more opportunities to acquire mutations. We show that ignoring death leads to a systematic overestimation of mutation rates under stress.\\n\\nWe developed a system using plasmid segregation to measure death and growth rates simultaneously in bacterial populations. We use it to replicate classical experiments reporting antibiotic-induced mutagenesis. We found that a substantial death rate occurs at the tested sub-inhibitory concentrations, and taking this death into account lowers and sometimes removes the signal for stress-induced mutagenesis. Moreover even when antibiotics increase mutation rate, sub-inhibitory treatments do not increase genetic diversity and evolvability, again because of effects of the antibiotics on population dynamics.\\n\\nBeside showing that population dynamic is a crucial but neglected parameter affecting evolvability, we provide better experimental and computational tools to study evolvability under stress, leading to a re-assessment of the magnitude and significance of the stress-induced mutagenesis paradigm.",

However, reversals to the terrestrial habit occurred sparsely in species of Epidendroideae. To better understand which factors might have been involved in reversals to terrestrial habits in the predominantly epiphytic Epidendroideae, we investigate Galeandra diversification in time and space. We hypothesized that the reversal to the terrestrial habitat is linked to the origin of open vegetation habitats in South America. We generated a time-calibrated phylogeny based on a matrix of 17 out of 20 species of Galeandra plus outgroups and seven DNA markers. We found that Galeandra originated towards end of the Miocene, about 10 Ma in Amazonia (including the Guiana Shield). The terrestrial clade originated synchronously with the rise of dry vegetation biomes, suggesting that aridification during the last 5 million years dramatically impacted the diversification of epiphytic lineages in the Neotropics. Habit is correlated with floral spur lengths and geographic range size. The longer spurs and narrower ranges are found in epiphytic species: probably adapted to a specialized pollination mode, associated to the long-tongued Euglossini bees, which also prefer forested habits. The terrestrial species presents variable floral spurs and wide distribution ranges, with evidence of self-pollination, suggesting the loss of specialized pollination system and concomitant range expansion.",

Also known as cuckoo bees they belong to several lineages, especially diverse in Apinae. We focused on a lineage of Apinae cleptoparasitic bees, the clade Ericrocidini+Rhathymini, which attack nests of the oil-collecting bees. We sequenced five genes for a broad sampling in this clade plus a large outgroup and reconstruct phylogeny and divergence times. We confirmed the monophyly of the clade Ericrocidini+Rhathymini and its position inside the ericrocidine line, together with the tribes Protepeolini, Isepeolini and Coelioxoidini. Our results corroborate the current taxonomic classification. Ericrocis is the basal most lineage in Ericrocidini and the position of Acanthopus and the most diverse genus Mesoplia were inconclusive. Ericrocidini+Rhathymini diverged from Parepeolus aterrimus 74 mya in the Cretaceous. Considering the robust molecular evidence of their sister relationships, the striking differences on the first instar larvae morphology of the two groups are probably adaptations to the distinct nesting biology of their hosts. As other parasites in the ericrocidine line, both groups possess larvae adapted to kill the immature host and to feed on floral oil provisioned by the host female. The evolution of host specialization in the line Ericrocidini+Rhathymini retroced to the Eocene when they arose synchronously with their hosts, Centris and Epicharis.",

    "abstract": "Ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV) can cause mass mortality events in Pacific oyster aquaculture. While various factors impact on the severity of outbreaks, it is clear that genetic resistance of the host is an important determinant of mortality levels. This raises the possibility of selective breeding strategies to improve the genetic resistance of farmed oyster stocks, thereby contributing to disease control. Traditional selective breeding can be augmented by use of genetic markers, either via marker-assisted or genomic selection. The aim of the current study was to investigate the genetic architecture of resistance to OsHV in Pacific oyster, to identify genomic regions containing putative resistance genes, and to inform the use of genomics to enhance efforts to breed for resistance. To achieve this, a population of ~1,000 juvenile oysters were experimentally challenged with a virulent form of OsHV, with samples taken from mortalities and survivors for genotyping and qPCR measurement of viral load. The samples were genotyped using a recently-developed SNP array, and the genotype data were used to reconstruct the pedigree. Using these pedigree and genotype data, the first high density linkage map was constructed for Pacific oyster, containing 20,353 SNPs mapped to the ten pairs of chromosomes. Genetic parameters for resistance to OsHV were estimated, indicating a significant but low heritability for the binary trait of survival and also for viral load measures (h2 0.12 - 0.25). A genome-wide association study highlighted a region of linkage group 6 containing a significant QTL affecting host resistance. These results are an important step towards identification of genes underlying resistance to OsHV in oyster, and a step towards applying genomic data to enhance selective breeding for disease resistance in oyster aquaculture.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBats are the only mammals capable of true, powered flight, which drives an extremely high metabolic rate. The \\\"Free Radical Theory of Ageing\\\" (FTRA) posits that a high metabolic rate leads to mitochondrial heteroplasmy and the progressive ageing phenotype. Contrary to this, bats are the longest lived order of mammals despite their small size and high metabolic rate. To investigate if bats exhibit increased mitochondrial heteroplasmy with age as predicted by the FRTA, we performed targeted, deep sequencing of mitogenomes and measured point heteroplasmy in wild, long lived Myotis myotis as they age.\\n\\nResultsIn total, blood was sampled from 195 individuals, aged between <1 and at 6+ years old, and whole mitochondria were sequenced, with a subset sampled over multiple years. The majority of heteroplasmies, 77.6%, were at a frequency below 5%. Oxidative mutations were not the primary source of heteroplasmies and present in only a small number of individuals, likely representing local oxidative stress events. There was a significant positive correlation between age and heteroplasmy, with a rate of increase of 0.13 sites per year. Longitudinal data from recaptured individuals show heteroplasmy is dynamic, and does not increase uniformly over time.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show that bats do not suffer from the predicted, inevitable increase in heteroplasmy which underscores the FRTA. Most heteroplasmies were at low frequency and are primarily transitions. Heteroplasmy increased with age, however how this contributes to ageing is unclear, as heteroplasmy was dynamic, questioning its presumed role as a primary driver of ageing.",

    "abstract": "Divergent transcription from promoters and enhancers is pervasive in many species, but it remains unclear if it is a general and passive feature of all eukaryotic cis regulatory elements. To address this, we define promoters and enhancers in C. elegans, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens using ATAC-Seq and investigate the determinants of their transcription initiation directionalities by analyzing genome-wide nascent, cap-selected, polymerase run-on assays. All three species initiate divergent transcription from separate core promoter sequences. Sequence asymmetry downstream of forward and reverse initiation sites, known to be important for termination and stability in H. sapiens, is unique in each species. Chromatin states of divergent promoters are not entirely conserved, but in all three species, the levels of histone modifications on the +1 nucleosome are independent from those on the -1 nucleosome, arguing for independent initiation events. This is supported by an integrative model of H3K4me3 levels and core promoter sequence that is highly predictive of promoter directionality and of two types of promoters: those with balanced initiation directionality and those with skewed directionality. Lastly, D. melanogaster enhancers display variation in chromatin architecture depending on enhancer location, and D. melanogaster promoter regions with dual enhancer/promoter potential are enriched for divergent transcription. Our results point to a high degree of variation in regulatory element transcription initiation directionality within and between metazoans, and to non-passive regulatory mechanisms of transcription initiation directionality in those species.",

    "abstract": "Cystic hydatid disease is a zoonosis caused by the larval stage (hydatid cyst) of Echinococcus granulosus (Cestoda, Taeniidae). The hydatid cyst develops in the viscera of intermediate host as a unilocular structure filled by the hydatid fluid, which contains parasitic excretory/secretory products. Antigen B (AgB) is the major component of E. granulosus metacestode hydatid fluid. Functionally, AgB has been implicated in immunomodulation and lipid transport. However, the mechanisms underlying AgB functions are not completely known. In this study, we investigated AgB interactions with different mammalian cell types and the pathways involved in its internalization. AgB uptake was observed in four different cell lines, NIH-3T3, A549, J774 and RH. Inhibition of raft-mediated endocytosis causes about 50 and 69% decrease in AgB internalization by RH and A549 cells, respectively. Interestingly, AgB colocalized with the raft endocytic marker, but also showed a partial colocalization with the clathrin endocytic marker. The results indicate that raft-mediated endocytosis is the main route to AgB internalization, and that a clathrin-mediated entry may also occur at a lower frequency. Cellular internalization could be a requirement for AgB functions as a lipid carrier and/or immunomodulatory molecule, contributing to create a more permissive microenvironment to metacestode development and survival.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAntigen B (AgB) is an oligomeric lipoprotein highly abundant in Echinococcus granulosus hydatid fluid. AgB has already been characterized as an immunomodulatory protein, capable of inducing a permissive immune response to parasite development. Also, an important role in lipid acquisition is attributed to AgB, because it has been found associated to different classes of host lipids. However, the mechanisms of interaction employed by AgB to perform its functions remain undetermined. In this study, we demonstrate that mammalian cells are able to internalize E. granulosus AgB in culture and found that specific mechanisms of endocytosis are involved. Our results extend the understanding of AgB biological role indicating cellular internalization as a mechanism of interaction, which in turn, may represent a target to intervention.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in sensory cortex are tuned to diverse features in natural scenes. But what determines which features neurons become selective to? Here we explore the idea that neuronal selectivity is optimised to represent features in the recent past of sensory input that best predict immediate future inputs. We tested this hypothesis using simple feedforward neural networks, which were trained to predict the next few video or audio frames in clips of natural scenes. The networks developed receptive fields that closely matched those of real cortical neurons, including the oriented spatial tuning of primary visual cortex, the frequency selectivity of primary auditory cortex and, most notably, in their temporal tuning properties. Furthermore, the better a network predicted future inputs the more closely its receptive fields tended to resemble those in the brain. This suggests that sensory processing is optimised to extract those features with the most capacity to predict future input.\\n\\nImpact statementPrediction of future input explains diverse neural tuning properties in sensory cortex.",

    "abstract": "Despite the discovery of striosomes several decades ago, technical difficulties have hampered the study of their functions. Here we used 2-photon calcium imaging in neuronal birthdate-labeled Mash1-CreER mice to image simultaneously the activity of striosomal and matrix neurons in vivo. We report that with this method we can visually identify circumscribed zones of neuropil that correspond to striosomes as verified in immunostained sections. We find that striosomal neurons, relative to matrix neurons, preferentially encode reward-predicting cues, and that their activity contains more information about expected outcome. These characteristics emerge during training and further strengthen during overtraining. Both striatal compartments are active similarly after reward delivery, firing at neuron-specific times during or after consummatory licking. Finally, we find that immediate reward history strongly modulates neuronal activation in the next trial, especially in matrix neurons. These results suggest that striosomes and matrix have distinct functions in relation to reinforcement learning.",

The present project examined whether the LAN effect, observed in the grand average response to local agreement violations, is the result of the overlap between two different ERP effects (N400, P600) at the level of subjects (n=80), items (n=120), or trials (n=6160). By-subject, by-item, and by-trial analyses of the ERP effect between 300 and 500 ms showed a LAN for 55% of the participants, 46% of the items, and 49% of the trials. Many examples of the biphasic LAN-P600 response were observed. Mixed-linear models showed that the LAN effect size was not reduced after accounting for subject variability. The present results suggest that there are cases where the grand average LAN effect represents the brain responses of individual participants, items, and trials.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide sensory feedback of ongoing brain oscillations enabling stroke survivors to modulate their sensorimotor rhythms purposefully. A number of recent clinical studies indicate that repeated use of such BCIs might trigger neurological recovery and hence improvement in motor function. Here we provide a first meta-analysis evaluating the clinical effectiveness of BCI-based post-stroke motor rehabilitation.\\n\\nMethodsTrials were identified using MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PEDro and by inspection of references in several review articles. We selected randomized controlled trials that used BCIs for post-stroke motor rehabilitation and provided motor impairment scores before and after the intervention. A random-effects inverse variance method was used to calculate the summary effect size.\\n\\nResultsWe initially identified 524 articles and, after removing duplicates, we screened titles and abstracts of 473 articles. We found 26 articles corresponding to BCI clinical trials, of these, there were nine studies that involved a total of 235 post-stroke survivors fulfilling the inclusion criterion (randomized controlled trials that examined motor performance as an outcome measure) for the meta-analysis. Motor improvements, mostly quantified by the upper limb Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE), exceeded the minimal clinical important difference (MCID=5.25) in six BCI studies, while such improvement was reached only in three control groups. Overall, the BCI training was associated with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.37 to 1.20) in FMA-UE compared to control conditions, which is in the range of medium to large summary effect size. In addition, several studies indicated BCI-induced functional and structural neuroplasticity at a sub-clinical level.\\n\\nInterpretationWe found a medium to large effect size of BCI therapy compared to controls. This suggests that BCI technology might be an effective intervention for post-stroke upper limb rehabilitation. However, more studies with larger sample size are required to increase the reliability of these results.",

    "abstract": "At low temperatures, Drosophila, like most insects, lose the ability to regulate ion and water balance across the gut epithelia, which can lead to a lethal increase of [K+] in the hemolymph (hyperkalemia). Cold-acclimation, the physiological response to low temperature exposure, can mitigate or entirely prevent these ion imbalances, but the physiological mechanisms that facilitate this process are not well understood. Here, we test whether plasticity in the ionoregulatory physiology of the gut and Malpighian tubules of Drosophila may aid in preserving ion homeostasis in the cold. Upon adult emergence, D. melanogaster females were subjected to seven days at warm (25{degrees}C) or cold (10{degrees}C) acclimation conditions. The cold acclimated flies had a lower critical thermal minimum (CTmin), recovered from chill coma more quickly, and better maintained hemolymph K+ balance in the cold. The improvements in chill tolerance coincided with increased Malpighian tubule fluid secretion and better maintenance of K+ secretion rates in the cold, as well as reduced rectal K+ reabsorption in cold-acclimated flies. To test whether modulation of ion-motive ATPases, the main drivers of epithelial transport in the alimentary canal, mediate these changes, we measured the activities of Na+-K+-ATPase and V-type H+-ATPase at the Malpighian tubules, midgut, and hindgut. Na+/K+-ATPase and V-type H+-ATPase activities were lower in the midgut and the Malpighian tubules of cold-acclimated flies, but unchanged in the hindgut of cold acclimated flies, and were not predictive of the observed alterations in K+ transport. Our results suggest that modification of Malpighian tubule and gut ion and water transport likely prevents cold-induced hyperkalemia in cold-acclimated flies and that this process is not directly related to the activities of the main drivers of ion transport in these organs, Na+/K+- and V-type H+-ATPases.\\n\\nSummary StatementAt low temperatures, insects lose the ability to regulate ion and water balance and can experience a lethal increase in hemolymph [K+]. Previous exposure to low temperatures can mitigate this effect and improve chill tolerance. Here, we show that plasticity of ion and fluid transport across the Malpighian tubule and rectal epithelia likely drive this response.",
