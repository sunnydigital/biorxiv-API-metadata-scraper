    "abstract": "Reduced representation methylation analysis utilizes a subset of CpGs in order to report the overall methylation status of the probed genomic regions. Here, we use this concept in order to create fluorescent optical methylation profiles along chromosomal DNA molecules for epigenetic profiling. Reduced representation optical methylation mapping (R2OM2) in combination with Bionano Genomics next generation genome mapping (NGM) technology provides a hybrid genetic/epigenetic genome map of individual chromosome segments spanning hundreds of kilobase pairs (kbp). These long reads, along with the single-molecule resolution, allow for epigenetic variation calling and methylation analysis of large structural aberrations such as pathogenic macrosatellite arrays not accessible to single-cell next generation sequencing (NGS). We show that in addition to the inherent long-read benefits of R2OM2, it provides genomic methylation patterns comparable to whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) while retaining single-molecule information. The method is applied here to detect methylation along genes, around regulatory histone marks and to study facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), simultaneously recording the haplotype, copy number and methylation status of the disease-associated, highly repetitive locus onchromosome 4q.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy is a growing field in cancer research. A privileged tumor-associated antigen that has received much attention is N-glycolyl (NeuGc) GM3. This ganglioside is present in several types of cancer, but is almost undetectable in human healthy tissues. However, its non-hydroxylated variant, NeuAc GM3, is abundant in all mammals. Due to a deletion in the human gene encoding the key enzyme for synthesis of NeuGc, humans, in contrast to other mammals, cannot synthesize NeuGc GM3. Therefore the presence of this ganglioside in human cancer cells represents an enigma. It has been shown that hypoxic conditions trigger the expression of NeuGc gangliosides, which not only serve as attractive targets for cancer therapy, but also as diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker. Here, we confirm hypoxia-induced expression of the NeuGc GM3 ganglioside also in HeLa cells and reveal several candidate proteins, in particular GM3 synthase and subunit B of respiratory complex II (SDHB), that may be involved in the generation of NeuGc GM3 by SILAC-based proteome analysis. These findings have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of how this enigmatic tumor-associated antigen is produced in humans, and also suggest a possible mechanism of action of anti-tumor antibodies that recognize hypoxia markers, such as 14F7.",

However, the effects of boreal river impoundment are not clear as the few studies that exist have not been able to separate the hydrological changes brought about by dams from other factors (e.g. fish stocking, and species introduction).\\nC_LIO_LIWe adopted a multi-scale analysis to examine changes in nearshore fish communities over 20 years (spanning before and after impoundment) using a network of 24 sampling stations spread across from four reservoirs and two hydroelectricity complexes located in the boreal region (Northern Quebec, Canada). Given the remote location, confounding factors were minimal.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found no strong temporal trends in alpha- and gamma-diversity in impacted stations (upstream and downstream of the dam) relative to reference sites across the three spatial scales. Using beta-diversity analyses, we also detected a high stability in fish composition over time and space at the complex and reservoir scales.\\nC_LIO_LIAt the scale of the sampling stations, we observed higher rates of species turnover (beta-diversity) coincident with the time of reservoir filling and shortly after. Likewise, we detected species assemblage shifts that correlated with time since impoundment only at the sampling station scale.

Overall, the isolated effect of impoundment in these remote boreal ecosystems caused no loss of species and little change in fish diversity over 20 years, but resulted in substantial species assemblage shifts.

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in the biology of sex-differences has eluded direct study in humans: how does sex chromosome dosage (SCD) shape genome function? To address this, we developed a systematic map of SCD effects on gene function by analyzing genome-wide expression data in humans with diverse sex chromosome aneuploidies (XO, XXX, XXY, XYY, XXYY). For sex chromosomes, we demonstrate a pattern of obligate dosage sensitivity amongst evolutionarily preserved X-Y homologs, and update prevailing theoretical models for SCD compensation by detecting X-linked genes whose expression increases with decreasing X- and/or Y-chromosome dosage. We further show that SCD-sensitive sex chromosome genes regulate specific co-expression networks of SCD-sensitive autosomal genes with critical cellular functions and a demonstrable potential to mediate previously documented SCD effects on disease. Our findings detail wide-ranging effects of SCD on genome function with implications for human phenotypic variation.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSex chromosome dosage (SCD) effects on human gene expression are central to the biology of sex differences and sex chromosome aneuploidy syndromes, but challenging to study given the co-segregation of SCD and gonadal status. We address this obstacle by systematically modelling SCD effects on genome wide expression data from a large and rare cohort of individuals with diverse SCDs (XO, XX, XXX, XXXX, XY, XXY, XYY, XXYY, XXXXY). Our findings update current models of sex chromosome biology by (i) pinpointing a core set of X- and Y-linked genes with \\\"obligate\\\" SCD sensitivity, (ii) discovering several non-canonical modes of X-chromosome dosage compensation, and (iii) dissecting complex regulatory effects of X-chromosome dosage on large autosomal gene networks with key roles in cellular functioning.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic networks are rooted, directed, acyclic graphs that model reticulate evolutionary histories. Recently, statistical methods were devised for inferring such networks from either gene tree estimates or the sequence alignments of multiple unlinked loci. Bi-allelic markers, most notably single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), provide a powerful source of genome-wide data. In a recent paper, a method called SNAPP was introduced for statistical inference of species trees from unlinked bi-allelic markers. The generative process assumed by the method combined both a model of evolution for the bi-allelic markers, as well as the multispecies coalescent. A novel component of the method was a polynomial-time algorithm for exact computation of the likelihood of a fixed species tree via integration over all possible gene trees for a given marker. Here we report on a method for Bayesian inference of phylogenetic networks from bi-allelic markers. Our method significantly extends the algorithm for exact computation of phylogenetic network likelihood via integration over all possible gene trees. Unlike the case of species trees, the algorithm is no longer polynomial-time on all instances of phylogenetic networks. Furthermore, the method utilizes a reversible-jump MCMC technique to sample the posterior of phylogenetic networks given bi-allelic marker data. Our method has a very good performance in terms of accuracy and robustness as we demonstrate on simulated data, as well as a data set of multiple New Zealand species of the plant genus Ourisia(Plantaginaceae). We implemented the method in the publicly available, open-source PhyloNet software package.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe availability of genomic data has revolutionized the study of evolutionary histories and phylogeny inference. Inferring evolutionary histories from genomic data requires, in most cases, accounting for the fact that different genomic regions could have evolutionary histories that differ from each other as well as from that of the species from which the genomes were sampled. In this paper, we introduce a method for inferring evolutionary histories while accounting for two processes that could give rise to such differences across the genomes, namely incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization. We introduce a novel algorithm for computing the likelihood of phylogenetic networks from bi-allelic genetic markers and use it in a Bayesian inference method. Analyses of synthetic and empirical data sets show a very good performance of the method in terms of the estimates it obtains.",

    "abstract": "The potential for behaviours to spread via cultural transmission has profound implications for our understanding of social dynamics and evolution. Several studies have provided empirical evidence that local traditions can be maintained in animal populations via conformist learning (i.e. copying the majority). A conformist bias can be characterized by a sigmoidal relationship between a behaviors prevalence in the population and an individuals propensity to adopt that behavior. For this reason, the presence of conformist learning in a population is often inferred from a sigmoidal acquisition curve in which the overall rate of adoption for the behavior is taken as the dependent variable. However, the validity of sigmoidal acquisition curves as evidence for conformist learning has recently been challenged by models suggesting that such curves can arise via alternative learning rules that do not involve conformity. We review these models, and find that the proposed alternative learning mechanisms either rely on faulty or unrealistic assumptions, or apply only in very specific cases. We therefore recommend that sigmoidal acquisition curves continue to be taken as evidence for conformist learning. Our paper also highlights the importance of understanding the generative processes of a model, rather than only focusing solely on the patterns produced. By studying these processes, our analysis suggests that current practices by empiricists have provided robust evidence for conformist transmission in both humans and non-human animals.",

    "abstract": "The Complementarity plot (CP) is an established validation tool for protein structures, applicable to both, globular proteins (folding) as well as protein-protein complexes (binding). It computes the shape and electrostatic complementarities (Sm, Em) for amino acid side-chains buried within the protein interior or interface and plots them in a two-dimensional plot having knowledge-based probabilistic quality estimates for the residues as well as for the whole structure. The current report essentially presents an upgraded version of the plot with the implementation of the advanced multi-dielectric functionality (as in Delphi version 6.2 or higher) in the computation of electrostatic complementarity to make the validation tool physico-chemically more realistic. The two methods (single- and multi-dielectric) agrees decently in their resultant Em values and hence, provisions for both methods have been kept in the software suite. So to speak, the global electrostatic balance within a well-folded protein and / or a well-packed interface seems only marginally perturbed by the choice of different internal dielectric values. However, both from theoretical as well as practical grounds, the more advanced multi-dielectric version of the plot is certainly recommended for potentially producing more reliable results. The report also presents a new methodology and a variant plot, namely, CPdock, based on the same principles of complementarity, specifically designed to be used in the docking of proteins. The efficacy of the method to discriminate between good and bad docked protein complexes have been tested on a recent state-of-the-art docking benchmark. The results unambiguously indicate that CPdock can indeed be effective in the initial screening phase of a docking scoring pipeline before going into more sophisticated and computationally expensive scoring functions.

In vitro evidence suggests that PRIS is related to the impaired mitochondrial function. There are indications that preexisting mitochondrial disorders predispose to PRIS. However, the precise molecular mechanisms, including mitochondrial defects and a metabolic conversion by propofol, are largely unknown as yet. To elucidate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of PRIS, we investigated the effects of propofol on the cellular metabolic mode and cell death. We demonstrated that clinically relevant concentrations of propofol, used within a clinically relevant exposure time, suppressed the mitochondrial function, caused the generation of reactive oxygen species, and induced a metabolic switch, from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, by targeting complexes I and III of mitochondria. The data also indicated that a predisposition to mitochondrial dysfunction, caused by a genetic mutation or pharmacological suppression of the electron transport chain by biguanides such as metformin and phenformin, promoted the cell death and caspase activation induced by propofol.",

    "abstract": "Reading disability is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by difficulties in reading despite educational opportunity and normal intelligence. Performance on rapid automatized naming (RAN) and rapid alternating stimulus (RAS) tests gives a reliable predictor of reading outcome. These tasks involve the integration of different neural and cognitive processes required in a mature reading brain. Most studies examining the genetic factors that contribute to RAN and RAS performance have focused on pedigree-based analyses in samples of European descent, with limited representation of groups with Hispanic or African ancestry. In the present study, we conducted a multivariate genome-wide association analysis to identify shared genetic factors that contribute to performance across RAN Objects, RAN Letters, and RAS Letters/Numbers in a sample of Hispanic and African American youth (n=1,331). We then tested whether these factors also contribute to variance in reading fluency and word reading. Genome-wide significant, pleiotropic, effects across RAN Objects, RAN Letters, and RAS Letters/Numbers were observed for SNPs located on chromosome 10q23.31 (rs1555839, multivariate association, p=2.23 x 10-8), which also showed significant association with reading fluency and word reading performance (p <0.001). Bioinformatic analysis of this region using epigenetic data from the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium indicates active transcription of the gene RNLS in the brain. Neuroimaging genetic analysis of fourteen cortical regions in an independent sample of typically developing children across multiple ethnicities (n=690) showed that rs1555839 was associated with variation in volume of the right inferior parietal cortex--a region of the brain that processes numerical information and has been implicated in reading disability. This study provides support for a novel locus on chromosome 10q23.31 associated with RAN, RAS, and reading-related performance.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYReading disability has a strong genetic component that is explained by multiple genes and genetic factors. The complex genetic architecture along with diverse cognitive impairments associated with reading disability, poses challenges in identifying novel genes and variants that confer risk. One method to begin parsing genetic and neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to reading disability is to take advantage of the high correlation among reading-related cognitive traits like rapid automatized naming (RAN) and rapid alternating stimulus (RAS) to identify shared genetic factors that contribute to common biological mechanisms. In the present study, we used a multivariate genome-wide analysis approach that identified a region of chromosome 10q23.31 associated with variation in RAN Objects, RAN Letters, and RAS Letters/Numbers performance in a sample of 1,331 Hispanic and African American youth in the Genes, Reading, and Dyslexia (GRaD) Study. Genetic variants in this region were also associated with reading fluency in GRaD, and differences in brain structures implicated in reading disability in a separate sample of 690 children. The gene, RNLS, is located within the implicated region of chromosome 10q23.31 and plays a role in breaking down a class of chemical messengers known to affect attention, learning, and memory in the brain. These findings provide a basis to inform our understanding of the biological basis of reading disability.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) comprises at least 90% of total RNA extracted from mammalian tissue or cell line samples. Informative transcriptional profiling using massively parallel sequencing technologies requires either enrichment of mature poly-adenylated transcripts or targeted depletion of the rRNA fraction. The latter method is of particular interest because it is compatible with degraded samples such as those extracted from FFPE and also captures transcripts that are not poly-adenylated such as some non-coding RNAs. Here we provide a cross-site study that evaluates the performance of ribosomal RNA removal kits from Illumina, Takara/Clontech, Kapa Biosystems, Lexogen, New England Biolabs and Qiagen on intact and degraded RNA samples. We find that all of the kits are capable of performing significant ribosomal depletion, though there are differences in their ease of use. All kits were able to remove ribosomal RNA to below 20% with intact RNA and identify [~]14,000 protein coding genes from the Universal Human Reference RNA sample at >1FPKM. Analysis of differentially detected genes between kits suggests that transcript length may be a key factor in library production efficiency. These results provide a roadmap for labs on the strengths of each of these methods and how best to utilize them.",

    "abstract": "The Bayesian model of confidence posits that confidence is the observers posterior probability that the decision is correct. It has been proposed that researchers can gain evidence in favor of the Bayesian model by deriving qualitative signatures of Bayesian confidence, i.e., patterns that one would expect to see if an observer was Bayesian, and looking for those signatures in human or animal data. We examine two proposed qualitative signatures, showing that their derivations contain hidden assumptions that limit their applicability, and that they are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for Bayesian confidence. One signature is an average confidence of 0.75 for trials with neutral evidence. This signature only holds when class-conditioned stimulus distributions do not overlap and internal noise is very low. Another signature is that, as stimulus magnitude increases, confidence increases on correct trials but decreases on incorrect trials. This signature is also dependent on stimulus distribution type. There is an alternative form of this signature that has been applied in the literature; we find no indication that it is expected under Bayesian confidence, which resolves an ostensible discrepancy. We conclude that, to determine the nature of the computations underlying confidence reports, there may be no shortcut to quantitative model comparison.",

    "abstract": "The collection of immunoglobulin genes in an individuals germline, which gives rise to B cell receptors via recombination, is known to vary significantly across individuals. In humans, for example, each individual has only a fraction of the several hundred known V alleles. Furthermore, the currently-accepted set of known V alleles is both incomplete (particularly for non-European samples), and contains a significant number of spurious alleles. The resulting uncertainty as to which immunoglobulin alleles are present in any given sample results in inaccurate B cell receptor sequence annotations, and in particular inaccurate inferred naive ancestors. In this paper we first show that the currently widespread practice of aligning each sequence to its closest match in the full set of IMGT alleles results in a very large number of spurious alleles that are not in the samples true set of germline V alleles. We then describe a new method for inferring each individuals germline gene set from deep sequencing data, and show that it improves upon existing methods by making a detailed comparison on a variety of simulated and real data samples. This new method has been integrated into the partis annotation and clonal family inference package, available at https://github.com/psathyrella/partis, and is run by default without affecting overall run time.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAntibodies are an important component of the adaptive immune system, which itself determines our response to both pathogens and vaccines. They are produced by B cells through somatic recombination of germline DNA, which results in a vast diversity of antigen binding affinities across the B cell repertoire. We typically learn about the development of this repertoire, and its history of interaction with antigens, by sequencing large numbers of the DNA sequences from which antibodies are derived. In order to understand such data, it is necessary to determine the combination of germline V, D, and J genes that was rearranged to form each such B cell receptor sequence. This is difficult, however, because the immunoglobulin locus exhibits an extraordinary level of diversity across individuals - encompassing both allelic variation and gene duplication, deletion, and conversion - and because the locuss large size and repetitive structure make germline sequencing very difficult. In this paper we describe a new computational method that avoids this difficulty by inferring each individuals set of immunoglobulin germline genes directly from expressed B cell receptor sequence data.",

    "abstract": "Aging-related physiological changes are systemic and, at least in humans, are linearly associated with age. Therefore, linear combinations of physiological measures trained to estimate chronological age have recently emerged as a practical way to quantify aging in the form of biological age. Aging acceleration, defined as the difference between the predicted and chronological age was found to be elevated in patients with major diseases and is predictive of mortality. In this work, we compare three increasingly accurate biological age models: metrics derived from unsupervised Principal Components Analysis (PCA), alongside two supervised biological age models; a multivariate linear regression and a state-of-the-art deep convolution neural network (CNN). All predictions were made using one-week long locomotor activity records from a 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset. We found that application of the supervised approaches improves the accuracy of the chronological age estimation at the expense of a loss of the association between the aging acceleration predicted by the model and all-cause mortality. Instead, we turned to the NHANES death register and introduced a novel way to train parametric proportional hazards models in a form suitable for out-of-the-box implementation with any modern machine learning software. Finally, we characterized a proof-of-concept example, a separate deep CNN trained to predict mortality risks that outperformed any of the biological age or simple linear proportional hazards models. Our findings demonstrate the emerging potential of combined wearable sensors and deep learning technologies for applications involving continuous health risk monitoring and real-time feedback to patients and care providers.",

    "abstract": "Gender bias is still unfortunately rife in the sciences, and men co-author most articles (> 70%) in ecology. Whether ecologists subconsciously rate the quality of their peers work more favourably if men are the dominant co-authors is still unclear. To test this hypothesis, we examined how expert ecologists ranked important ecology articles based on a previously compiled list. Women proposed articles with a higher average proportion of women co-authors (0.18) than did men proposers (0.07). For the 100 top-ranked articles, women voters placed more emphasis on articles co-authored by women (0.06) than did men (0.02). However, women voters were still biased because they ranked men-dominated articles more highly, albeit not by as much as men did. This effect disappeared after testing read-only articles. This indicates a persistent, subconscious bias that men-dominated articles are considered to be of higher quality before actual assessment. We add that ecologists need to examine their own subconscious biases when appointing students, hiring staff, and choosing colleagues with whom to publish.",

Considering transient response characteristics of retinal ganglion cells, a certain amount of motion of the eyes is required to efficiently encode information and to prevent neural adaptation. However, excessive motion of the eyes leads to insufficient exposure to the stimuli which creates blur and reduces visual acuity. Normal miniature eye movements fall in between these extremes but it is unclear if they are optimally tuned for seeing fine spatial details. We used a state-of-the-art retinal imaging technique with eye tracking to address this question. We sought to determine the optimal gain (stimulus/eye motion ratio) that corresponds to maximum performance in an orientation discrimination task performed at the fovea. We found that miniature eye movements are tuned, but may not be optimal, for seeing fine spatial details.",

    "abstract": "The Full Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) is challenging to fit to behavioural data. Precision of the fits are usually poor for some if not all parameters, and computationally expensive to obtain. Moreover, inference at the trial level for each and every parameters, threshold included, has so far been considered as impossible. Most approaches rely on strong assumptions about the model structure, such as selection of the parameters that are subject to trial-to-trial variability or prior distribution of these parameters, that usually lack precise mathematical or empirical justifications. The fact that, in most versions of the DDM, the sequence of participants choices are considered as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), has been mainly overlooked so far. Our contribution to the field is threefold: first, we introduce Variational Bayes as a method to fit the full DDM. Second, we relax the i.i.d. assumption, and propose a data-driven algorithm based on a Recurrent Auto-Encoder, that estimates the local posterior probability of the DDM parameters at each trial based on the sequence of parameters and data preceding the data. Finally, we show that inference at the trial level can be achieved efficiently for each and every parameter of the DDM, threshold included. This data-driven approach is highly generic and self-contained, in the sense that no external input (e.g. regressors or physiological measure) is necessary to fit the data. Using simulations and real-world examples, we show that this method outperforms by several order of magnitude the i.i.d.-based ones, either Markov Chain Monte Carlo or i.i.d.-VB.",

This can account for instances of context dependence beyond the reach of classic theories which assume stable preferences. In this paper, we provide a normative justification for DbS that is based on the principle of efficient coding. The efficient representation of information in a noiseless communication channel is characterized by a uniform response distribution, which the rank transformation implements. However, cognitive limitations imply that decision samples are finite, introducing noise. Efficient coding in a noisy channel requires smoothing of the signal, a principle that leads to a new generalization of DbS. This generalization is closely connected to range-frequency theory, and helps descriptively account for a wider set of behavioral observations, such as how context sensitivity varies with the number of available response categories.",

    "abstract": "Target selection is the first and pivotal step in drug discovery. An incorrect choice may not manifest itself for many years after hundreds of millions of research dollars have been spent. We collected a set of 332 targets that succeeded or failed in phase III clinical trials, and explored whether Omic features describing the target genes could predict clinical success. We obtained features from the recently published comprehensive resource: Harmonizome. Nineteen features appeared to be significantly correlated with phase III clinical trial outcomes, but only 4 passed validation schemes that used bootstrapping or modified permutation tests to assess feature robustness and generalizability while accounting for target class selection bias. We also used classifiers to perform multivariate feature selection and found that classifiers with a single feature performed as well in cross-validation as classifiers with more features (AUROC=0.57 and AUPR=0.81). The two predominantly selected features were mean mRNA expression across tissues and standard deviation of expression across tissues, where successful targets tended to have lower mean expression and higher expression variance than failed targets. This finding supports the conventional wisdom that it is favorable for a target to be present in the tissue(s) affected by a disease and absent from other tissues. Overall, our results suggest that it is feasible to construct a model integrating interpretable target features to inform target selection. We anticipate deeper insights and better models in the future, as researchers can reuse the data we have provided to improve methods for handling sample biases and learn more informative features. Code, documentation, and data for this study have been deposited on GitHub at https://github.com/arouillard/omic-features-successful-targets.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYDrug discovery often begins with a hypothesis that changing the abundance or activity of a target--a biological molecule, usually a protein--will cure a disease or ameliorate its symptoms. Whether a target hypothesis translates into a successful therapy depends in part on the characteristics of the target, but it is not completely understood which target characteristics are important for success. We sought to answer this question with a supervised machine learning approach. We obtained outcomes of target hypotheses tested in clinical trials, scoring targets as successful or failed, and then obtained thousands of features (i.e. properties or characteristics) of targets from dozens of biological datasets. We statistically tested which features differed between successful and failed targets, and built a computational model that used these features to predict success or failure of targets in clinical trials. We found that successful targets tended to have more variable mRNA abundance from tissue to tissue and lower average abundance across tissues than failed targets. Thus, it is probably favorable for a target to be present in the tissue(s) affected by a disease and absent from other tissues. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of predicting clinical trial outcomes from target features.",

    "abstract": "Many tools are available for RNA-seq alignment and expression quantification, with comparative value being hard to establish. Benchmarking assessments often highlight methods good performance, but are focused on either model data or fail to explain variation in performance. This leaves us to ask, what is the most meaningful way to assess different alignment choices? And importantly, where is there room for progress? In this work, we explore the answers to these two questions by performing an exhaustive assessment of the STAR aligner. We assess STARs performance across a range of alignment parameters using common metrics, and then on biologically focused tasks. We find technical metrics such as fraction mapping or expression profile correlation to be uninformative, capturing properties unlikely to have any role in biological discovery. Surprisingly, we find that changes in alignment parameters within a wide range have little impact on both technical and biological performance. Yet, when performance finally does break, it happens in difficult regions, such as X-Y paralogs and MHC genes. We believe improved reporting by developers will help establish where results are likely to be robust or fragile, providing a better baseline to establish where methodological progress can still occur.",

Computationally predicting these targets remains a challenge as they only partially match their target and so there can be hundreds of targets for a single microRNA. Current tools assume that most of the knowledge defining a microRNA-gene interaction can be captured by analysing the binding produced in the seed region ({approx} the first 8nt in the miRNA). However, recent studies show that the whole microRNA can be important and form non-canonical targets. Here, we use a target prediction methodology that relies on deep neural networks to automatically learn the relevant features describing microRNA-gene interactions for predicting microRNA targets. This means we make no assumptions about what is important, leaving the task to the deep neural network. A key part of the work is obtaining a suitable dataset. Thus, we collected and curated more than 150,000 experimentally verified microRNA targets and used them to train the network. Using this approach, we are able to gain a better understanding of non-canonical targets and to improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art prediction tools.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) are enriched in charged and polar residues; and, therefore, electrostatic interactions play a predominant role in their dynamics. In order to remain multi-functional and exhibit their characteristic binding promiscuity, they need to retain considerable dynamic flexibility. At the same time, they also need to accommodate a large number of oppositely charged residues, which eventually lead to the formation of salt-bridges, imparting local rigidity. The formation of salt-bridges therefore oppose the desired dynamic flexibility. Hence, there appears to be a meticulous trade-off between the two mechanisms which the current study attempts to unravel. With this objective, we identify and analyze salt-bridges, both as isolated as well as composite ionic bond motifs, in the molecular dynamic trajectories of a set of appropriately chosen IDPs. Time evolved structural properties of these salt-bridges like persistence, associated secondary structural 'order-disorder' transitions, correlated atomic movements, contribution in the overall electrostatic balance of the proteins have been studied in necessary detail. The results suggest that the key to maintain such a trade-off over time is the continuous formation and dissolution of salt-bridges with a wide range of persistence. Also, the continuous dynamic interchange of charged-atom-pairs (coming from a variety of oppositely charged side-chains) in the transient ionic bonds supports a model of dynamic flexibility concomitant with the well characterized stochastic conformational switching in these proteins. The results and conclusions should facilitate the future design of salt-bridges as a mean to further explore the disordered-globular interface in proteins.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen the emergence of several \\\"third-generation\\\" sequencing platforms, each of which aims to address shortcomings of standard next-generation short-read sequencing by producing data that capture long-range information, thereby allowing us to access regions of the genome that are inaccessible with short-reads alone. These technologies either produce physically longer reads typically with higher error rates or instead capture long-range information at low error rates by virtue of read \\\"barcodes\\\" as in 10x Genomics Chromium platform. As with virtually all sequencing data, sequence alignment for third-generation sequencing data is the foundation on which all downstream analyses are based. Here we introduce a latent variable model for improving barcoded read alignment, thereby enabling improved downstream genotyping and phasing. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach through developing EMerAld-- or EMA for short-- and testing it on the barcoded short-reads produced by 10xs sequencing technologies. EMA not only produces more accurate alignments, but unlike other methods also assigns interpretable probabilities to the alignments it generates. We show that genotypes called from EMAs alignments contain over 30% fewer false positives than those called from Lariats (the current 10x alignment tool), with a fewer number of false negatives, on datasets of NA12878 and NA24385 as compared to NIST GIAB gold standard variant calls. Moreover, we demonstrate that EMA is able to effectively resolve alignments in regions containing nearby homologous elements-- a particularly challenging problem in read mapping-- through the introduction of a novel statistical binning optimization framework, which allows us to find variants in the pharmacogenomically important CYP2D region that go undetected when using Lariat or BWA. Lastly, we show that EMAs alignments improve phasing performance compared to Lariats in both NA12878 and NA24385, producing fewer switch/mismatch errors and larger phase blocks on average.\\n\\nEMA software and datasets used are available at http://ema.csail.mit.edu.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn recent years, epigenetic research has enjoyed explosive growth as high-throughput sequencing technologies become more accessible and affordable. However, this advancement has not been matched with similar progress in data analysis capabilities from the perspective of experimental biologists not versed in bioinformatic languages. For instance, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) is at present widely used to identify genomic loci of transcription factor binding and histone modifications. Basic ChIP-seq data analysis, including read mapping and peak calling, can be accomplished through several well-established tools, but more sophisticated analyzes aimed at comparing data derived from different conditions or experimental designs constitute a significant bottleneck. We reason that the implementation of a single comprehensive ChIP-seq analysis pipeline could be beneficial for many experimental (wet lab) researchers who would like to generate genomic data.\\n\\nResultsHere we present ChIPdig, a stand-alone application with adjustable parameters designed to allow researchers to perform several analyzes, namely read mapping to a reference genome, peak calling, annotation of regions based on reference coordinates (e.g. transcription start and termination sites, exons, introns, 5' UTRs and 3' UTRs), and generation of heatmaps and metaplots for visualizing coverage. Importantly, ChIPdig accepts multiple ChIP-seq datasets as input, allowing genome-wide differential enrichment analysis in regions of interest to be performed. ChIPdig is written in R and enables access to several existing and highly utilized packages through a simple user interface powered by the Shiny package. Here, we illustrate the utility and user-friendly features of ChIPdig by analyzing H3K36me3 and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq profiles generated by the modENCODE project as an example.\\n\\nConclusionsChIPdig offers a comprehensive and user-friendly pipeline for analysis of multiple sets of ChIP-seq data by both experimental and computational researchers.

    "abstract": "Quantitative fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy from optical microscopy datasets is a very powerful tool to resolve multiple spatiotemporal cellular and subcellular processes at the molecular level. In particular, raster image correlation spectroscopy (RICS) and number and brightness analyses (N&B) yield molecular mobility and clustering dynamic information extracted from real-time cellular processes. This quantitative information can be inferred in a highly flexibly and detailed manner, i.e. 1) at the localisation level: from full-frame datasets and multiple regions of interest within; and 2) at the temporal level: not only from full-frame and multiple regions, but also intermediate temporal events. Here we build on previous research in deciphering the molecular dynamics of paxillin, a main component of focal adhesions. Cells use focal adhesions to attach to the extracellular matrix and interact with their local environment. Through focal adhesions and other adhesion structures, cells sense their local environment and respond accordingly; due to this continuous communication, these structures can be highly dynamic depending on the extracellular characteristics. By using a previously well-characterised model like paxillin, we examine powerful sensitivity characteristics and some limitations of RICS and N&B analyses. We show that cells upon contact to different surfaces show differential self-assembly dynamics in terms of molecular diffusion and oligomerisation. In addition, single-cell studies show that these dynamics change gradually following an antero-posterior gradient.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is important for erythroid survival and differentiation. Lack of iron, a critical component of heme and hemoglobin, activates Heme Regulated Inhibitor (HRI). This results in phosphorylation of eIF2 and reduced eIF2 availability, which inhibits protein synthesis. Translation of specific transcripts such as Atf4, however, is enhanced. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are key to this regulation. The aim of this study is to investigate how eIF2 phosphorylation affects mRNA translation in erythroblasts. Ribosome profiling combined with RNA sequencing was used to determine translation initiation sites and ribosome density on individual transcripts. Treatment of erythroblasts with Tunicamycin (Tm) increased phosphorylation of eIF2 2-fold. At a false discovery rate of 1%, ribosome density was increased for 147 transcripts, among which transcriptional regulators such as Atf4, Tis7/Ifrd1, Pnrc2, Gtf2h, Mbd3, JunB and Kmt2e. Translation of 337 transcripts decreased more than average, among which Dym and Csde1. Ribosome profiling following Harringtonine treatment uncovered novel translation initiation sites and uORFs. Surprisingly, translated uORFs did not predict eIF2-dependent translation efficiency, but uORF identity differs. The regulation of transcription and translation factors in reponse to eIF2 phosphorylation may explain the large overall response to iron deficiency in erythroblasts.\\n\\n- eif2 dependent translation in erythroblasts during proteotoxic stress determined by ribosome footprinting\\n- identification of transcription factors upregulated in response to eIF2 phosphorylation\\n- Advantages and disadvantages of translation initiation site determination using harringtonine\\n- distinct uORF pattern in transcripts with enhanced, or more than average reduced translation upon proteotoxic stress",

    "abstract": "Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) provides a way to directly observe the activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). To this end, FRET based biosensors are made, employing heterotrimeric G-protein subunits tagged with fluorescent proteins. These FRET based biosensors complement existing, indirect, ways to observe GPCR activation. Here we report on the insertion of mTurquoise2 at several sites in the human G13 subunit. Three variants were found to be functional based on i) plasma membrane localization and ii) ability to recruit p115-RhoGEF upon activation of the LPA2 receptor. The tagged G13 subunits were used as FRET donor and combined with cp173Venus fused to the G{gamma}2 subunit as the acceptor. We constructed G13 biosensors by generating a single plasmid that produces G13-mTurquoise2, G{beta}1 and cp173Venus-G{gamma}2. The G13 activation biosensors showed a rapid and robust response when used in primary human endothelial cells that were treated with thrombin, triggering endogenous protease activated receptors (PARs). This response was efficiently inhibited by the RGS domain of p115-RhoGEF and from the biosensor data we inferred that this is due to GAP activity. Finally, we demonstrated that the G13 sensor could be used to dissect heterotrimeric G-protein coupling efficiency in single living cells. We conclude that the G13 biosensor is a valuable tool for live-cell measurements that probe G13 activation.",

To understand this feat, one has to fathom two main characteristics of multicellular organisms: differentiation and self-organization. Any explanation concerning this major transition should involve mechanisms that can simultaneously explain the marvellous intricacies manifest in the aforementioned characteristics, and an account of the evolution of such traits. Here we propose a noise-driven differentiation (NDD) model. The reliance on noise, in place of a more mechanistic approach, makes the NDD model a more suitable approach to explain differentiation and self-organization. Furthermore, our model sheds some light on the possible evolutionary origins of these biological innovations. To test the NDD model, we utilize a model of cell aggregation. The behavior of this model of cell aggregation is in concert with the NDD model.",

In the past decades, much effort has been devoted to infer the importance of a particular structure by its capacity to tolerate an external perturbation on its structure or dynamics. Here we demonstrate that such a perspective leads to inconsistent conclusions. That is, the importance of a network structure changes as a function of the external perturbations acting on a community at any given point in time. Thus, we discuss a research agenda to investigate the relative importance of the structure of ecological networks under an environment-dependent framework. We hypothesize that only by studying systematically the link between network structure and community dynamics under an environment-dependent framework, we can uncover the limits at which communities can tolerate environmental changes.\\n\\n\\\"Variation stands out as the only meaningful reality\\\"\\n\\nStephen J.

    "abstract": "Specialist predators with oscillating dynamics are often strongly affected by the population dynamics of their prey, yet they do not always participate in a predator-prey cycle. Only those that exert strong population regulation of their prey do so. Inferring the strength and direction of the predator-prey coupling from time series therefore requires contrasting models with top-down versus bottom-up predator-prey dynamics. We examine such population-level coupling using multivariate autoregressive models. The models translate several hypotheses for the joint dynamics of population densities of the Icelandic gyrfalcon Falco rusticolus, and its prey, the rock ptarmigan Lagopus muta. The dynamics of both species are likely not only linked to each other but also to stochastic weather variables acting as confounding factors on the joint dynamics. The classical MAR(1) model, used most often in ecology, predicts that the times series exhibit predator-prey feedback (i.e., Granger causality): the predator helps to explain prey dynamics and the prey helps to explain predator dynamics. Weather, in the form of spring temperature, influences gyrfalcon population growth but not ptarmigan population growth, despite individual-level evidence that ptarmigan chicks can be strongly affected by weather. MAR(2) models, allowing for species to cycle independently from each other, further suggests alternative scenarios where a cyclic prey influence its predator but not the other way around; such bottom-up models produce a better fit but less realistic cross-correlation patterns. Simulations of MAR(1) and MAR(2) models further demonstrate that the top-down MAR(1) models are most likely to be misidentified as bottom-up dynamics than vice-versa. We therefore conclude that predator-prey feedback in the gyrfalcon-ptarmigan system is very likely, though bottom-up dynamics cannot be excluded with certainty. We finally discuss what sort of information is needed to advance the characterization of joint predator-prey dynamics in birds and other vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEvaluation of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) ratios in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems can advance our understanding of biological processes, nutrient cycling and the fate of organic matter (OM) in aquatic ecosystems. Eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems can disrupt the accumulation and decomposition of OM which serves as the base of the aquatic food web, and is central to the effectiveness of a treatment wetland. This study investigated nutrient stoichiometry within and between wetland ecosystem compartments (i.e. water column, vegetation, flocculent and soil) of two treatment flow-ways (FWs) in the Everglades Stormwater Treatment Areas located in south Florida (USA). These FWs include an emergent aquatic vegetation cell dominated by Typha spp.(cattail) and a submerged aquatic vegetation cell composed of species such as Chara spp. (muskgrass) and Potamogeton spp. (pondweed). The primary objective of this evaluation was to determine if nutrient stoichiometry is consistent within and between ecosystems and compartments to understand biogeochemical cycling and controls of nutrient removal within a treatment wetland ecosystem.\\n\\nResultsThis study demonstrates that C, N, and P stoichiometry can be highly variable among ecosystem compartments and between differing wetland ecosystems. Generally, total P declined along the length of each treatment FW in all ecosystem compartments, whereas trends in total N and C trends were more variable. These changes in C and nutrient concentrations result in variable nutrient stoichiometry along treatment FWs signaling potential changes in absolute and relative nutrient availability and biogeochemical processes.\\n\\nConclusionsAssessment of wetland nutrient stoichiometry between and within ecosystem compartments suggest decoupling of C:N:P relationships likely as a consequence of differential external nutrient supply, differences in primary producer communities and differential decomposition of organic matter. However, stoichiometry varies often monotonous along the flow paths, likely exhibiting a response to nutrient loading. Differences in C:N:P ratios in primary producers, light availability, microbial immobilization in the early stage of decomposition as well as nutrient mining during decomposition of OM are likely feedback mechanisms that lead to deviations from fixed stoichiometry, which in turn may have considerable influence on nutrient removal rates. This information could be used to further understand water treatment performance with respect to stoichiometric processes and OM decomposition.",

Symptomatic infection is associated with case fatality rates of ~20% in pregnant women. However, its epidemiology is poorly understood and the potential impact of immunisation in outbreak settings uncertain. We aimed to estimate key epidemiological parameters for HEV and to evaluate the potential impact of both reactive vaccination (initiated in response to an epidemic) and pre-emptive vaccination.\\n\\nMethodsWe analysed data from one of the worlds largest recorded HEV epidemics, which occurred in refugee camps in Uganda (2007-2009), using transmission dynamic models to estimate epidemiological parameters and assess the potential impact of reactive and pre-emptive vaccination strategies.\\n\\nResultsUnder baseline assumptions we estimated the basic reproduction number of HEV to range from 3.9 (95% CrI 2.8, 5.4) to 8.9 (5.4, 14.2). Mean latent and infectious periods were estimated to be 34 (28, 39) and 40 (23, 71) days respectively.\\n\\nReactive two-dose vaccination of those aged 16-65 years excluding pregnant women (for whom vaccine is not licensed), if initiated after 50 reported cases, led to mean camp-specific reductions in mortality of 10 to 29%. Pre-emptive vaccination with two doses reduced mortality by 35 to 65%. Both strategies were more effective if coverage was extended to groups for whom the vaccine is not currently licensed. For example, two dose pre-emptive vaccination, if extended to include pregnant women, led to mean reductions in mortality of 66 to 82%.\\n\\nConclusionsHEV has a high transmission potential in refugee camp settings. Substantial reductions in mortality through vaccination are expected, even if used reactively.

    "abstract": "Current estimates of the HIV epidemic indicate a decrease in the incidence of the disease in the undiagnosed subpopulation over the past 10 years. However, a lack of access to care has not been considered when modeling the population. Populations at high risk for contracting HIV are twice as likely to lack access to reliable medical care. In this paper, we consider three contributors to the HIV population dynamics: susceptible pool exhaustion, lack of access to care, and usage of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) by diagnosed individuals. We consider the change in the proportion of undiagnosed individuals as the parameter in a simple Markov model. We obtain conservative estimates for the proportional change of the infected subpopulations using hierarchical Bayesian statistics. The estimated proportional change is used to derive epidemic parameter estimates for a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Epidemic parameters are modified to capture the dynamics of each of the three contributors, as well as all their possible combinations. Model fit is quantified to determine the best explanation for the observed dynamics in the infected subpopulations.\\n\\nAuthor summaryUsing a combination of statistics and mathematical modeling, we look at some possible reasons for the reported decrease in the number of undiagnosed people living with HIV. One possibility is that the population of people at significant risk to contract HIV is being depleted (susceptibles). This might happen if significant risk for HIV infection occurs in small percentages of the overall population. Another possibility is that infected individuals lack access to care in some regions due to poverty or other cause. In this case we have to question the accuracy of the estimated size of that population. Finally, most diagnosed individuals report being on medication that reduces their viral load. This greatly reduces their chance to transmit HIV to susceptible individuals. We also combine these possibilities and look at the best explanation for the infected population size.",

    "abstract": "Airborne infectious diseases such as influenza are primarily transmitted from human to human by means of social contacts and thus easily spread within households. Epidemic models, used to gain insight in infectious disease spread and control, typically rely on the assumption of random mixing within households. Until now there was no direct empirical evidence to support this assumption. Here, we present the first social contact survey specifically designed to study contact networks within households. The survey was conducted in Belgium (Flanders and Brussels) in 2010-2011. We analyzed data from 318 households totaling 1266 individuals with household sizes ranging from 2 to 7 members. Exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) were fitted to the within-household contact networks to reveal the processes driving contact between household members, both on weekdays and weekends. The ERGMs showed a high degree of clustering and, specifically on weekdays, decreasing connectedness with increasing household size. Furthermore, we found that the odds of a contact between father and child is smaller than for any other pair except for older siblings. Epidemic simulation results suggest that within-household contact density is the main driver of differences in epidemic spread between complete and empirical-based household contact networks. The homogeneous mixing assumption may therefore be an adequate characterization of the within-household contact structure for the purpose of epidemic simulation. However, ignoring the contact density when inferring from an epidemic model will result in biased estimates of within-household transmission rates. Further research on the implementation of within-household contact networks in epidemic models is necessary.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHouseholds have a pivotal role in the spread of airborne infectious diseases. Households are bridging units between schools and workplaces, and social contacts within households are frequent and intimate, allowing for rapid disease spread. Infectious disease models typically assume that members of a household contact each other randomly. Until now there was no direct empirical evidence to support this assumption. In this paper, we present the first social contact survey specifically designed to study contact networks within households with young children. We investigate which factors drive contacts between household members on one particular day by means of a statistical model. Our results suggest the importance of connectedness within households over heterogeneity in number of contacts.",

    "abstract": "This research investigates the now-forgotten relationship between diphtheria and tuberculosis. Historical medical reports from the 19th century are reviewed followed by a statistical regression analysis of the relationship between the two diseases in the early 20th century. Historical medical records show a consistent association between diphtheria and tuberculosis that can increase the likelihood and severity of either disease in a co-infection. The statistical analysis uses historical weekly public health data on reported cases in five American cities over a period of several years, finding a modest but statistically significant relationship between the two diseases. No current medical theory explains the association between diphtheria and tuberculosis. Alternative explanations are explored with a focus on how the diseases assimilate iron. In a co-infection, the effectiveness of tuberculosis at assimilating extracellular iron can lead to increased production of diphtheria toxin, worsening that disease, which may in turn exacerbate tuberculosis. Iron-dependent repressor genes connect both diseases.",

    "abstract": "Recent data from Rio de Janeiro shows a sharp drop in the number of notified cases of Zika in the summer of 2016-17, compared to the previous summer. This is probably due to herd immunity built up after the previous year's epidemic. There is still a much higher incidence among women than men, almost certainly due to sexual transmission. An unexpected feature of the new data is that there are proportionally far more cases in children under 15 months than in older age classes. By comparing the incidence for 2016-17 with that of 2015-16, we can deduce the proportion of reported cases for men and women, and also verify that the disparity of incidence between them is still present. Women and children still represent risk groups with regard to Zika infection, even during a non-epidemic season.",

    "abstract": "In mathematical epidemiology, a well-known formula describes the impact of heterogeneity on the basic reproductive number, R0, for situations in which transmission is separable and for which there is one source of variation in susceptibility and one source of variation in infectiousness. This formula is written in terms of the magnitudes of the heterogeneities, as quantified by their coefficients of variation, and the correlation between them. A natural question to ask is whether analogous results apply when there are multiple sources of variation in susceptibility and/or infectiousness. In this paper we demonstrate that with three or more coupled heterogeneities, R0 under separable transmission depends on details of the distribution of the heterogeneities in a way that is not seen in the well-known simpler situation. We provide explicit formulae for the cases of multivariate normal and multivariate log-normal distributions, showing that R0 can again be expressed in terms of the magnitudes of the heterogeneities and the pairwise correlations between them. The formulae, however, differ between the two multivariate distributions, demonstrating that no formula of this type applies generally when there are three or more coupled heterogeneities. We see that the results of the formulae are approximately equal when heterogeneities are relatively small and show that an earlier result in the literature (Koella, 1991) should be viewed in this light. We provide numerical illustrations of our results and discuss a setting in which coupled heterogeneities are likely to have a major impact on the value of R0. We also describe a rather surprising result: in a system with three heterogeneities, R0 can exhibit non-monotonic behavior with increasing levels of heterogeneity, in marked contrast to the familiar two heterogeneity setting in which R0 either increases or decreases with increasing heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "The RelTime method estimates divergence times when evolutionary rates vary among lineages. Theoretical analyses show that RelTime relaxes the strict molecular clock throughout a molecular phylogeny, and it performs well in the analysis of empirical and computer simulated datasets in which evolutionary rates are variable. Lozano-Fernandez et al. (2017) found that the application of RelTime to one metazoan dataset (Erwin et al. 2011) produced equal rates for several ancient lineages, which led them to speculate that RelTime imposes a strict molecular clock for deep animal divergences. RelTime does not impose a strict molecular clock. The pattern observed by Lozano-Fernandez et al. (2017) was a result of the use of an option to assign the same rate to lineages in RelTime when the rates are not statistically significantly different. The median rate difference was 5% for many deep metazoan lineages for Erwin et al. (2011) dataset, so the rate equality was not rejected. In fact, RelTime analysis with and without the option to test rate differences produced very similar time estimates. We found that the Bayesian time estimates vary widely depending on the root priors assigned, and that the use of less restrictive priors produce Bayesian divergence times that are concordant with those from RelTime for Erwin et al. (2011) dataset. Therefore, it is prudent to discuss Bayesian estimates obtained under a range of priors in any discourse about molecular dating, including method comparisons.",

Models using somatic cell methylomes to predict age have been successfully constructed. However, gamete aging is quite distinct and as such age prediction using sperm methylomes is ineffective with current techniques.\\n\\nResultsWe have produced a model that utilizes human sperm DNA methylation signatures to predict chronological age by utilizing methylation array data from a total of 329 samples. The dataset used for model construction includes infertile patients, sperm donors, and individuals from the general population. Our model is capable of accurately predicting age with an R2 of 0.928 in our test data set. We additionally investigated the repeatability of prediction by processing the same sample on 6 different arrays and found very robust age prediction with an average standard deviation of only 0.877 years. Additionally, we found that smokers have approximately 5% increased age profiles compared to  never smokers.\\n\\nConclusionsThe predictive model described herein was built to offer researchers the ability to assess \\\"germ line age\\\" by accessing sperm DNA methylation signatures at genomic regions affected by age. Our data suggest that this model can predict an individuals chronological age with a high degree of accuracy regardless of fertility status and with a high degree of repeatability. Additionally, our data appear to show age acceleration patterns as a result of smoking suggesting that the aging process in sperm may be impacted by environmental factors, though this effect appears to be quite subtle.",

Recent research provides evidence that relevant gene-phenotype associations are discoverable in the study of intellectual disability (ID). Here we expand on that work, identifying distinctive gene interaction modules with unique enrichment patterns reflective of associated clinical features in ID.\\n\\nMethodsTwo hundred twelve forms of monogenic ID were curated according to comorbidities with autism and epilepsy. These groups were further subdivided according to secondary clinical symptoms of complex versus simple facial dysmorphia and neurodegenerative-like features due to their clinical prominence, modest symptom overlap, and probable etiological divergence. An aggregate gene interaction ID network for these phenotype subgroups was discovered using via a public database of known gene interactions: protein-protein, genetic, and mRNA coexpression. Additional annotation resources (Gene Ontology, Human Phenotype Ontology, TRANSFAC/JASPAR, and KEGG/WikiPathways) were utilized to assess functional and phenotypic enrichment modules within the full ID network.\\n\\nResultsPhenotypic analysis revealed high rates of complex facial dysmorphia in ID with comorbid autism. In contrast, neurodegenerative-like features were overrepresented in ID with epilepsy. Network analysis subsequently showed that gene groups divided according to clinical features of interest resulted in distinctive interaction clusters, with unique functional enrichments according to module.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data suggest that specific comorbid and secondary clinical features in ID are predictive of underlying genotype.

However, for polygenic traits, the prevalence of the disorder confounds the relationship between the number of significant findings and the sample size. To adjust the number of significant findings for prevalence, we develop a method that uses the expected noncentrality of the contrast between liabilities of cases and controls. We empirically find that, when compared to the sample size, this measure is a better predictor of number of significant findings. Even more, we show that the sample size effect on the number of signals is explained by the noncetrality measure. Finally, we provide an R script to estimate the required sample size (non-centrality) needed to yield a pre-specified number of significant findings.",

Short reads from each phasing block are allocated to each of the two haplotypes followed by generating a haploid genotype for each putative DNM.HAPDeNovo removes variants that are called as heterozygous in one of the haplotypes because they are almost certainly false positives.

Functional phylogenomics predicts defined steps in the evolution of response system properties, and comparative transcriptomics across six ancient lineages revealed how these innovations shaped a sophisticated response mechanism. Genetic analysis in a basal land plant revealed unexpected contributions of ancient non-canonical proteins in auxin response as well as auxin-unrelated function of core transcription factors.

The most constrained coding regions in our map are enriched for both pathogenic variants in ClinVar and de novo mutations underlying developmental disorders.

This is a fundamental challenge for differential expression (DE) analysis. In this study, the performance of 14 popular tools for testing DE in RNA-seq data along with their normalization methods is comprehensively evaluated, with a particular focus on lncRNAs and low abundant mRNAs.\\n\\nResultsThirteen performance metrics were used to evaluate DE tools and normalization methods using simulations and analyses of six diverse RNA-seq datasets. Non-parametric procedures are used to simulate gene expression data in such a way that realistic levels of expression and variability are preserved in the simulated data. Throughout the assessment, we kept track of the results for mRNA and lncRNA separately. All statistical models exhibited inferior performance for lncRNAs compared to mRNAs across all simulated scenarios and analysis of benchmark RNA-seq datasets. No single tool uniformly outperformed the others.\\n\\nConclusionOverall, the linear modeling with empirical Bayes moderation (limma) and the nonparametric approach (SAMSeq) showed best performance: good control of the false discovery rate (FDR) and reasonable sensitivity. However, for achieving a sensitivity of at least 50%, more than 80 samples are required when studying expression levels in a realistic clinical settings such as in cancer research. About half of the methods showed severe excess of false discoveries, making these methods unreliable for differential expression analysis and jeopardizing reproducible science.

A majority of our samples possess greater than 90% Native American ancestry and demographic modeling reveals, consistent with a rapid peopling model of the Americas, that most of Peru was peopled approximately 12,000 years ago. While the Native American populations possessed distinct ancestral divisions, the mestizo groups were admixtures of multiple Native American communities which occurred before and during the Inca Empire. The mestizo communities also show Spanish introgression only after Peruvian Independence. Thus, we present a detailed model of the evolutionary dynamics which impacted the genomes of modern day Peruvians.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMammalian phenotypes are shaped by numerous genome variants, many of which may regulate gene transcription or RNA splicing. To identify variants with regulatory functions in cattle, an important economic and model species, we used sequence variants to map a type of expression quantitative trait loci (expression QTLs) that are associated with variations in the RNA splicing, i.e., sQTLs. To further the understanding of regulatory variants, sQTLs were compare with other two types of expression QTLs, 1) variants associated with variations in gene expression, i.e., geQTLs and 2) variants associated with variations in exon expression, i.e., eeQTLs, in different tissues.\\n\\nResultsUsing whole genome and RNA sequence data from four tissues of over 200 cattle, sQTLs identified using exon inclusion ratios were verified by matching their effects on adjacent intron excision ratios. sQTLs contained the highest percentage of variants that are within the intronic region of genes and contained the lowest percentage of variants that are within intergenic regions, compared to eeQTLs and geQTLs. Many geQTLs and sQTLs are also detected as eeQTLs. Many expression QTLs, including sQTLs, were significant in all four tissues and had a similar effect in each tissue. To verify such expression QTL sharing between tissues, variants surrounding ({+/-}1Mb) the exon or gene were used to build local genomic relationship matrices (LGRM) and estimated genetic correlations between tissues. For many exons, the splicing and expression level was determined by the same cis additive genetic variance in different tissues. Thus, an effective but simple-to-implement meta-analysis combining information from three tissues is introduced to increase power to detect and validate sQTLs. sQTLs and eeQTLs together were more enriched for variants associated with cattle complex traits, compared to geQTLs. Several putative causal mutations were identified, including an sQTL at Chr6:87392580 within the 5th exon of kappa casein (CSN3) associated with milk production traits.\\n\\nConclusionsUsing novel analytical approaches, we report the first identification of numerous bovine sQTLs which are extensively shared between multiple tissue types. The significant overlaps between bovine sQTLs and complex traits QTL highlight the contribution of regulatory mutations to phenotypic variations.",

Although D. simplex is well studied, the fungal communities and their ecological role remain to be investigated. Here, using 18S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, we provide a comprehensive overview of the yeasts and filamentous fungi associated with the eastern larch beetle and compare fungal communities between different developmental stages and microenvironments. Fungal mycobiome associated with the galleries was also investigated. Our study has unveiled an unexpected fungal diversity associated with the developmental stages. Significant differences in species richness between the developmental stages were determined. Yeasts were found to be predominant in the adult and larval stages, whereas filamentous fungi were most prevalent in the pupae.

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive bacterium that natively colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract and opportunistically causes life-threatening infections. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. faecalis strains have emerged that are replete with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Non-MDR E. faecalis strains frequently possess CRISPR-Cas systems, which reduce the frequency of mobile genetic element (MGE) acquisition. We demonstrated in previous studies that E. faecalis populations can transiently maintain both a functional CRISPR-Cas system and a CRISPR-Cas target. In this study, we used serial passage and deep sequencing to analyze these populations. In the presence of antibiotic selection for the plasmid, mutants with compromised CRISPR-Cas defense and enhanced ability to acquire a second antibiotic resistance plasmid emerged. Conversely, in the absence of selection, the plasmid was lost from wild-type E. faecalis populations, but not E. faecalis populations that lacked the cas9 gene. Our results indicate that E. faecalis CRISPR-Cas can become compromised under antibiotic selection, generating populations with enhanced abilities to undergo horizontal gene transfer.\n\nImportanceEnterococcus faecalis is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections and disseminator of antibiotic resistance plasmids among Gram-positive bacteria. We have previously shown that E. faecalis strains with an active CRISPR-Cas system can prevent plasmid acquisition and thus limit the transmission of antibiotic resistance determinants. Yet, CRISPR-Cas was not a perfect barrier. In this study, we observed populations of E. faecalis with transient co-existence of CRISPR-Cas and one of its plasmid targets. Our experimental data demonstrate that antibiotic selection results in compromised E. faecalis CRISPR-Cas function, thereby facilitating the acquisition of additional resistance plasmids by E. faecalis.",

    "abstract": "Mosses are critical components of boreal ecosystems where they typically account for a large proportion of net primary productivity and harbor diverse bacterial communities that can be the major source of biologically-fixed nitrogen in these ecosystems. Despite their ecological importance, we have limited understanding of how microbial communities vary across boreal moss species and the extent to which local environmental conditions may influence the composition of these bacterial communities. We used marker gene sequencing to analyze bacterial communities associated with eight boreal moss species collected near Fairbanks, AK USA. We found that host identity was more important than site in determining bacterial community composition and that mosses harbor diverse lineages of potential N2- fixers as well as an abundance of novel taxa assigned to understudied bacterial phyla (including candidate phylum WPS-2). We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing to assemble genomes from the WPS-2 candidate phylum and found that these moss-associated bacteria are likely anoxygenic phototrophs capable of carbon fixation via RuBisCo with an ability to utilize byproducts of photorespiration from hosts via a glyoxylate shunt. These results give new insights into the metabolic capabilities of understudied bacterial lineages that associate with mosses and the importance of plant hosts in shaping their microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "The microbiome has been implicated in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The specific traits of these diseases vary along the axis of the digestive tract. Further, variation in the structure of the gut microbiota has been associated with both diseases. Here we profiled the microbiota of the healthy proximal and distal mucosa and lumen to better understand how bacterial populations vary along the colon. We used a two-colonoscope approach to sample proximal and distal mucosal and luminal contents from the colons of 20 healthy subjects that had not undergone any bowel preparation procedure. The biopsies and home-collected stool were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing and Random Forest classification models were built using taxa abundance and location to identify microbiota specific to each site. The right mucosa and lumen had the most similar community structures of the five sites we considered from each subject. The distal mucosa had higher relative abundance of Finegoldia, Murdochiella, Peptoniphilus, Porphyromonas and Anaerococcus. The proximal mucosa had more of the genera Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides and Pseudomonas. The classification model performed well when classifying mucosal samples into proximal or distal sides (AUC = 0.808). Separating proximal and distal luminal samples proved more challenging (AUC = 0.599) and specific microbiota that differentiated the two were hard to identify. By sampling the unprepped colon, we identified distinct bacterial populations native to the proximal and distal sides. Further investigation of these bacteria may elucidate if and how these groups contribute to different disease processes on their respective sides of the colon.",

    "abstract": "Antisense (as)lncRNAs can regulate gene expression but the underlying mechanisms and the different cofactors involved remain unclear. Using Native Elongating Transcript sequencing, here we show that stabilization of antisense Exo2-sensitivite IncRNAs (XUTs) results in the attenuation, at the nascent transcription level, of a subset of highly expressed genes displaying prominent promoter-proximal nucleosome depletion and histone acetylation. Mechanistic investigations on the catalase gene ctt1 revealed that its induction following oxidative stress is impaired in Exo2-deficient cells, correlating with the accumulation of an asXUT. Interestingly, expression of this asXUT was also activated in wild-type cells upon oxidative stress, concomitant to ctt1 induction, indicating a potential attenuation feedback. This attenuation correlates with asXUT abundance, it is transcriptional, characterized by low RNAPII-ser5 phosphorylation, and it requires an histone deacetylase activity and the conserved Set2 histone methyltransferase. Finally, we identified Dicer as another RNA processing factor acting on ctt1 induction, but independently of Exo2. We propose that asXUTs could modulate the expression of their paired-sense genes when it exceeds a critical threshold, using a conserved mechanism independent of RNAi.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYExamples of regulatory antisense (as)lncRNAs acting on gene expression have been reported in multiple model organisms. However, despite their regulatory importance, aslncRNAs have been poorly studied, and the molecular bases for aslncRNAs-mediated regulation remain incomplete. One reason for the lack of global information on aslncRNAs appears to be their low cellular abundance. Indeed, our previous studies in budding and fission yeasts revealed that aslncRNAs are actively degraded by the Xrn1/Exo2-dependent cytoplasmic 5'-3' RNA decay pathway. Using a combination of single-gene and genome-wide analyses in fission yeast, here we report that the stabilization of a set of Exo2-sensitive aslncRNAs correlates with attenuation of paired-sense genes transcription. Our work provides fundamental insights into the mechanism by which aslncRNAs could regulate gene expression. It also highlights for the first time that the level of sense gene transcription and the presence of specific chromatin features could define the potential of aslncRNA-mediated attenuation, raising the idea that aslncRNAs only attenuate those genes with expression levels above a \\\"regulatory threshold\\\". This opens novel perspectives regarding what the potential determinants of aslncRNA-dependent regulation, as previous models in budding yeast rather proposed that aslncRNA-mediated repression is restricted to lowly expressed genes.",

    "abstract": "Polycomb group (PcG) proteins facilitate chromatin-mediated gene repression through the modification of histone tails in a wide range of eukaryotes, including plants and animals. One of the PcG protein complexes, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), promotes repressive chromatin formation via tri-methylation of lysine-27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). The animal PRC2 is implicated in impacting subnuclear distribution of chromatin as its complex components and H3K27me3 are functionally connected with the nuclear lamina (NL) - a peripheral protein mesh that resides underneath the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and consists of lamins and lamina-associated proteins. In contrast to animals, NL in plants has an atypical structure and its association with PRC2-mediated gene repression is largely unknown. Here, we present a connection between lamin-like protein, CROWDED NUCLEI 1 (CRWN1), and a novel PRC2-associated component, PWWP INTERACTOR OF POLYCOMBS 1 (PWO1), in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that PWO1 and CRWN1 proteins associate physically with each other, act in the same pathway to maintain nuclear morphology and control expression of similar set of target genes. Moreover, we demonstrate that PWO1 proteins form speckle-like foci located partially at the subnuclear periphery in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. Ultimately, as CRWN1 and PWO1 are plant-specific, our results argue that plants developed an equivalent, rather than homologous, mechanism of linking PRC2-mediated chromatin repression and nuclear lamina.",

    "abstract": "Within the larger ABC superfamily of ATPases, ABCF family members eEF3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and EttA in Escherichia coli have been found to function as ribosomal translation factors. Several other ABCFs including biochemically characterised VgaA, LsaA and MsrE confer resistance to antibiotics that target the peptidyl transferase centre and exit tunnel of the ribosome. However, the diversity of ABCF subfamilies, the relationships among subfamilies and the evolution of antibiotic resistance factors from other ABCFs have not been explored. To address this, we analysed the presence of ABCFs and their domain architectures in 4505 genomes across the tree of life. We find 45 distinct subfamilies of ABCFs that are widespread across bacterial and eukaryotic phyla, suggesting they were present in the last common ancestor of both. Surprisingly, currently known antibiotic resistance (ARE) ABCFs are not confined to a distinct lineage of the ABCF family tree. This suggests that either antibiotic resistance is a pervasive feature of bacterial ABCFs, or it is relatively easy to evolve antibiotic resistance from other ABCF functions. Our data suggest there are a number of previously unidentified ARE ABCFs in antibiotic producers and important human pathogens. We also find that ATPase-deficient mutants of all four E. coli ABCFs (EttA, YbiT, YheS and Uup) inhibit protein synthesis, indicative of their ribosomal function, and demonstrate a genetic interaction of ABCFs Uup and YheS with translational GTPase BipA involved in assembly of the 50S ribosome subunit. Finally, we show that Bacillus subtilis VmlR is a ribosome-binding resistance factor localised to the cytoplasm.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIsolated members of the ABCF protein family of ATP-hydrolysing enzymes have been found to have important roles in protein synthesis and antibiotic resistance. However, their full diversity across the tree of life, and their evolutionary histories have never been examined. Therefore, we analysed the presence of ABCFs and their constituent domains in genomes across the tree of life, discovering 45 distinct subfamilies of ABCFs that are widespread across bacterial and eukaryotic phyla. This includes several subfamilies that we predict comprise novel antibiotic resistance (ARE) ABCFs, present in antibiotic producers and important human pathogens. There are significant gaps in our knowledge about the functional capabilities of different ABCF families. To address this, we have made ATPase domain mutants of all four Escherichia coli ABCFs, showing that they inhibit protein synthesis and indicating a role on the ribosome. Furthermore, we demonstrate a genetic interaction of two E. coli ABCFs with the GTPase BipA, involved in ribosome assembly. Finally, we show that Bacillus subtilis VmlR in the ARE2 subfamily is a ribosome-binding resistance factor localised to the cytoplasm. As more is discovered about the function of individual ABCFs, the more it will be possible to predict functions of uncharacterised members, using the ABCF family tree as a framework.",

    "abstract": "An important issue facing the empirical study of consciousness concerns how the contents of incoming stimuli gain access to conscious processing. According to classic theories, facial stimuli are processed in a hierarchical manner. However, it remains unclear how the brain determines which level of stimulus contents is consciously accessible when facing an incoming facial stimulus. Accordingly, with a magnetoencephalography technique, this study aims to investigate the temporal dynamics of the neural mechanism mediating which level of stimulus content is consciously accessible. Participants were instructed to view masked target faces at threshold, so that according to behavioral responses, their perceptual awareness alternated from consciously accessing facial identity in some trials to being able to consciously access facial configuration features but not facial identity in other trials. Conscious access at these two levels of facial contents were associated with a series of differential neural events. Before target presentation, different patterns of phase angle adjustment were observed between the two types of conscious access. This effect was followed by stronger phase clustering for awareness of facial identity immediately during stimulus presentation. After target onset, conscious access to facial identity, as opposed to facial configural features, was able to elicit more robust late positivity. In conclusion, we suggest that the stages of neural events, ranging from prestimulus to stimulus-related activities, may operate in combination to determine which level of stimulus contents is consciously accessed.

    "abstract": "Cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) form a secondary germinative epithelium, the external germinal layer (EGL) where they proliferate extensively to produce the most numerous cell type in the brain. The morphological sequence of events that characterizes the differentiation of GCPs in the EGL is well established. However, morphologies of individual GCP and their differentiation status have never been correlated. Here, we examine the morphological features and transitions of GCPs in the chicken cerebellum by labelling a subset of GCPs with a stable genomic expression of a GFP transgene and following their development within the EGL in fixed tissue and using time-lapse imaging. We use immunohistochemistry to observe cellular morphologies of mitotic and differentiating GCPs to better understand their differentiation dynamics. Results reveal that mitotic activities of GCPs are more complex and dynamic than currently appreciated. While most GCPs divide in the outer and middle EGL, some are capable of division in the inner EGL. Some GCPs remain mitotically active during process extension and tangential migration and retract their processes prior to each cell division. The mitotically active precursors can also express differentiation markers such as TAG1 and NeuroD1. Further, we explore the result of misexpression of NeuroD1 on granule cell development. When misexpressed in GCPs, NeuroD1 leads to premature differentiation, defects in migration and reduced cerebellar size and foliation. Overall, we provide the first characterisation of individual morphologies of mitotically active cerebellar GCPs in ovo and reaffirm the role of NeuroD1 as a differentiation factor in the development of cerebellar granule cells.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian visual system consists of several anatomically distinct areas, layers, and cell types. To understand the role of these subpopulations in visual information processing, we analyzed neural signals recorded from excitatory neurons from various anatomical and functional structures. For each of 186 mice, one of six genetically tagged cell-types and one of six visual areas were targeted while the mouse was passively viewing various visual stimuli. We trained linear classifiers to decode one of six visual stimulus categories with distinct spatiotemporal structures from the population neural activity. We found that neurons in both the primary visual cortex and secondary visual areas show varying degrees of stimulus-specific decodability, and neurons in superficial layers tend to be more informative about the stimulus categories. Additional decoding analyses of directional motion were consistent with these findings. We observed synergy in the population code of direction in several visual areas suggesting area-specific organization of information representation across neurons. These differences in decoding capacities shed light on the specialized organization of neural information processing across anatomically distinct subpopulations, and further establish the mouse as a model for understanding visual perception.",

    "abstract": "Speech is a critical form of human communication and is central to our daily lives. Yet, despite decades of study, an understanding of the fundamental neural control of speech production remains incomplete. Current theories model speech production as a hierarchy from sentences and phrases down to words, syllables, speech sounds (phonemes) and the movements of speech articulator muscles used to produce these sounds (articulatory gestures). Here, we investigate the cortical representation of articulatory gestures and phonemes in speech motor, premotor, and inferior frontal cortices. Our results indicate that primary motor and premotor areas represent gestures to a greater extent than phonemes, while inferior frontal cortex represents both gestures and phonemes. These findings suggest that the cortical control of speech production shares a common representation with that of other types of movement, such as arm and hand movements.",

    "abstract": "Modern spatial navigation requires fluency with multiple representational formats, including visual scenes, signs, and words. These formats convey different information. Visual scenes are rich and specific, but contain extraneous details. Arrows, as an example of signs, are schematic representations in which the extraneous details are eliminated, but analog spatial properties are preserved. Words eliminate all spatial information and convey spatial directions in a purely abstract form. How does the human brain compute spatial directions within and across these formats? To investigate this question, we conducted two experiments on men and women: a behavioral study that was preregistered, and a neuroimaging study using multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data to uncover similarities and differences among representational formats. Participants in the behavioral study viewed spatial directions presented as images, schemas, or words (e.g., \\\"left\\\"), and responded to each trial, indicating whether the spatial direction was the same or different as the one viewed previously. They responded more quickly to schemas and words than images, despite the visual complexity of stimuli being matched. Participants in the fMRI study performed the same task, but responded only to occasional catch trials. Spatial directions in images were decodable in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) bilaterally, but were not in schemas and words. Spatial directions were also decodable between all three formats. These results suggest that IPS plays a role in calculating spatial directions in visual scenes, but this neural circuitry may be bypassed when the spatial directions are presented as schemas or words.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHuman navigators encounter spatial directions in various formats: words (\\\"turn left\\\"), schematic signs (an arrow showing a left turn), and visual scenes (a road turning left). The brain must transform these spatial directions into a plan for action. Here, we investigate similarities and differences between neural representations of these formats. We found that bilateral intraparietal sulci represents spatial directions in visual scenes and across the three formats. We also found that participants respond quickest to schemas, then words, then images, suggesting that spatial directions in abstract formats are easier to interpret than concrete formats. These results support a model of spatial direction interpretation in which spatial directions are either computed for real world action, or computed for efficient visual comparison.",

    "abstract": "When combined with source modeling, magneto- (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to study long-range interactions among cortical processes non-invasively. Estimation of such inter-areal connectivity is nevertheless hindered by instantaneous field spread and volume conduction, which artificially introduce linear correlations and impair source separability in cortical current estimates. To overcome the inflating effects of linear source mixing inherent to standard interaction measures, alternative phase- and amplitude-correlation based connectivity measures, such as imaginary coherence and orthogonalized amplitude correlation have been proposed. Being by definition insensitive to zero-lag correlations, these techniques have become increasingly popular in the identification of correlations that cannot be attributed to field spread or volume conduction. We show here, however, that while these measures are immune to the direct effects of linear mixing, they may still reveal large numbers of spurious false positive connections through field spread in the vicinity of true interactions. This fundamental problem affects both region-of-interest-based analyses and all-to-all connectome mappings. Most importantly, beyond defining and illustrating the problem of spurious, or \\\"ghost\\\" interactions, we provide a rigorous quantification of this effect through extensive simulations. Additionally, we further show that signal mixing also significantly limits the separability of neuronal phase and amplitude correlations. We conclude that spurious correlations must be carefully considered in connectivity analyses in MEG/EEG source space even when using measures that are immune to zero-lag correlations.\\n\\nHighlights{checkmark} Reliable estimation of neuronal coupling with MEG and EEG is challenged by signal mixing\\n{checkmark}A number of coupling techniques attempt to overcome this limitation by excluding zero-lag interactions\\n{checkmark}Contrary to what is commonly admitted, our simulations illustrate that such interaction metrics will still yield false positives\\n{checkmark}Spurious, or \\\"ghost\\\", interactions are generally detected between sources in the vicinity of true phase-lagged interacting sources\\n{checkmark}Signal mixing also severely affects the mutual separability of phase and amplitude correlations",

    "abstract": "Higher-order visual thalamus plays a fundamental but poorly understood role in attention-demanding tasks. To investigate how neuronal dynamics in higher-order visual thalamus are modulated by sustained attention, we performed multichannel electrophysiological recordings in the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex (LP/pulvinar) in the ferret (Mustela putorius furo). We recorded single unit activity and local field potential during the performance of the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) that is used in both humans and animals as an assay of sustained attention. We found that half of the units exhibited an increasing firing rate during the delay period before stimulus onset (attention-modulated units). In contrast, the non-attention-modulated units responded to the stimulus, but not during the delay period. Spike-field coherence of only the attention-modulated neurons significantly increased from the start of the delay period until screen touch, predominantly in the theta frequency band. In addition, theta power and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling were elevated throughout the delay period. Our findings suggest that the theta oscillation plays a central role in orchestrating thalamic signaling during sustained attention.\\n\\nSignificanceImpaired sustained attention can be deadly, as illustrated by the number of motor vehicle accidents that are caused by drivers not reacting quickly enough to unexpected events on the road. Understanding how electrical signaling in higher-order visual nuclei, such as the LP/pulvinar, is modulated during tasks that require sustained attention is an important step in achieving a mechanistic understanding of sustained attention, which will eventually lead to new strategies to prevent and treat impairment in sustained attention.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental property of the nervous systems across the animal kingdom is the ability to select appropriate actions and sequences of actions in response to sensory cues. Many behaviors are physically mutually exclusive so commitment to one requires complete suppression of others. Further, because many behaviors are serially organized into sequences of actions, mechanisms must also exist that control transitions from one action to the next. The circuit mechanisms by which nervous systems achieve behavioral choice, stability and transitions are still incompletely understood. A key step in understanding these functions is to identify neurons and brain areas involved in controlling behavioral choice, stability and transitions. To do this, we developed an approach where we combined a large-scale neuronal inactivation screen with an automated action detection of sensorimotor decisions and sequences in response to a sensory cue. We characterized the response of wild-type larvae to a mechanosensory stimulus and found they can respond to the stimulus with a probabilistic sequence of 4 possible actions (head-cast, head-retraction, back-up and stop). We analyzed behaviors from around three hundred thousand larvae (N=2.9x105) where we selectively silenced small numbers of neuron types and individual neuron types systematically across the nervous system using a library of Drosophila GAL4 lines and determined the effect of these manipulations on larval mechanosensory responses. We identified neurons and brain-regions that when inactivated affected Drosophila larval sensorimotor decisions and sequence transitions between the different actions. Specifically, we identified 51 candidate lines for sensory processing and 24 candidate lines for competitive interactions. We also detected phenotype categories for sequence transitions consistent with a model of sequence generation where transitions and reversals are independently controlled. These findings provide the basis for understanding how sensorimotor decisions and sequence transition are controlled by the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Salinity is one of the major abiotic stresses that affects the growth and productivity of plants. The presence of soluble salts at high concentration near the root system restricts the uptake of water by plants. Plants grown under saline conditions possess higher amounts of secondary metabolites compared with those grown under normal conditions. The use of traditional medicine to treat infectious diseases is increasing day by day throughout the world. Developing novel drugs with antimicrobial potential from the source of medicinal plants is receiving attention to replace the use of synthetic drugs and to combat the growth of multi-drug resistant strains. Thus screening of medicinal plant extracts is carried out to evaluate their antimicrobial potency. The present study aimed at determining the secondary metabolites and antimicrobial potential of leaf, stem and root ethanol and chloroform extracts of five different Coleus species; C.aromaticus, C.amboinicus, Cbarbatus, C.forskohlii and C.zeylanicus subjected to salinity stress. The up regulation in the content of plant bioactive compounds along with the antimicrobial activities of ethanol and chloroform extracts under the influence of salinity stress have been observed during the study in Coleus. The leaf, stem and root extracts of all the five Coleus species showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested pathogenic strains. The leaf extracts of Coleus showed higher inhibitory activity compared to the stem and root extracts. Ethanol extracts showed higher anti-microbial activity ranging from 1.5-100 mg/ml compared with the chloroform extracts ranging from 0.97-250 mg/ml respectively. The study revealed that the increased antimicrobial activity with increasing salinity might be due to the up regulation of secondary metabolites. The leaf, stem and root extracts of Coleus showed effective antimicrobial activity against the pathogenic strains even under saline conditions is due to the up regulation of secondary metabolites which provides a scope of developing novel drugs to treat infectious diseases.",

Here we develop mathematical models based on existing empirical data to explicitly test this assumption. We show that although resistance prevents drive systems from spreading to fixation in large populations, even the least effective systems reported to date are highly invasive. Releasing a small number of organisms often causes invasion of the local population, followed by invasion of additional populations connected by very low gene flow rates. Examining the effects of mitigating factors including standing variation, inbreeding, and family size revealed that none of these prevent invasion in realistic scenarios. Highly effective drive systems are predicted to be even more invasive. Contrary to the National Academies report on gene drive, our results suggest that standard drive systems should not be developed nor field-tested in regions harboring the host organism.",

    "abstract": "Members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) are the causative agents of tuberculosis in a range of mammals, including humans. A key feature of MTBC pathogens is their high degree of genetic identity, yet distinct host tropism. Notably, while Mycobacterium bovis is highly virulent and pathogenic for cattle, the human pathogen M. tuberculosis is attenuated in cattle. Previous research also suggests that host preference amongst MTBC members has a basis in host innate immune responses. To explore MTBC host tropism, we present in-depth profiling of the MTBC reference strains M. bovis AF2122/97 and M. tuberculosis H37Rv at both the global transcriptional and translational level via RNA-sequencing and SWATH mass spectrometry. Furthermore, a bovine alveolar macrophage infection time course model was employed to investigate the shared and divergent host transcriptomic response to infection with M. tuberculosis or M. bovis. Significant differential expression of virulence-associated pathways between the two bacilli was revealed, including the ESX-1 secretion system. A divergent transcriptional response was observed between M. tuberculosis and M. bovis infection of bovine alveolar macrophages, in particular cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways at 48 hours post-infection, and highlights a distinct engagement of M. bovis with the bovine innate immune system. The work presented here therefore provides a basis for the identification of host innate immune mechanisms subverted by virulent host-adapted mycobacteria to promote their survival during the early stages of infection.\\n\\nImportanceThe Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) includes the most important global pathogens for humans and animals, namely Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis, respectively. These two exemplar mycobacterial pathogens share a high degree of genetic identity, but the molecular basis for their distinct host preference is unknown. In this work we integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of the pathogens to elucidate global quantitative differences between them at the mRNA and protein level. We then integrated this data with transcriptome analysis of the bovine macrophage response to infection with either pathogen. Increased expression of the ESX-1 virulence system in M. bovis appeared a key driver of an increased cytosolic nucleic acid sensing and interferon response in bovine macrophages infected with M. bovis compared to M. tuberculosis. Our work demonstrates the specificity of host-pathogen interaction and how the subtle interplay between mycobacterial phenotype and host response may underpin host specificity amongst MTBC members.",

    "abstract": "Two-photon imaging is a major recording technique in neuroscience but its low sampling rate imposes a severe limit of elucidating high temporal profiles of neuronal dynamics. Here we developed two hyperacuity Bayesian algorithms to improve spike detection and spike time precision, minimizing the estimation error supervised by the ground-truth given as the electrical spike signals. The benchmark showed that our algorithms outperformed other unsupervised algorithms maximizing the likelihood of the estimates for both experimental and simulation data. We argue that the supervised algorithms are useful tools to improve spike estimation of two-photon recording in case ground truth signals are available.",

    "abstract": "Spiking activity often correlates across neurons in the cerebral cortex. Precise spike-timing correlation at millisecond scale reflects underlying neural circuitries. Correlations of stimulus evoked spiking activities affects the distributions of spike counts in a multi-neuron space and reflects stimulus encoding ability of neuron populations. The present study compared the degree of spiking-activity correlation among three areas of the macaque visual system to determine whether neural circuitry and the way to encode stimulus-related information by neuron populations are unique to each area. Spiking activity of multiple single neurons was recorded in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), visual association cortex (V4), and inferior temporal cortex (IT). Cross-correlation of spike trains revealed that single-neuron pairs in IT exhibited the highest incidence of precisely correlated firing, whereas V1 pairs showed the lowest incidence. Although noise correlation, which quantifies similarity in trial-to-trial response fluctuations, differed among cortical areas, signal correlation, which quantifies similarity in stimulus preferences, did not. The degree of temporally precise correlation was positively related to the signal-correlation strength in all three cortical areas and the relation of IT pairs was stronger than that of V1 pairs. Temporally precise correlations between single-neuron and population-level activity also differed among cortical areas and V1 neurons exhibited the lowest incidence of correlated firing with population activities. The differences in spiking-activity correlations among visual cortical areas suggest that each cortical area has unique neuronal circuitry for representing information, and which performs unique neuronal computations.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAlthough hierarchical information processing plays a crucial role in the brain and in artificial neural networks, whether hierarchically connected brain areas share neural circuitry and information representation remains unclear. Here, we examined spiking activity across the ventral visual system in macaque monkeys and found that cortical areas differed in how correlated their spiking activity was, suggesting that neural circuitry and the way to encode stimulus-related information by neuron populations are unique to each cortical area.",
