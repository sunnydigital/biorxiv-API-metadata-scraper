    "abstract": "Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality, yet our understanding of the genetic interactions underlying this disease remains incomplete. Here, we harvested 1352 healthy and failing human hearts directly from transplant center operating rooms, and obtained genome-wide genotyping and gene expression measurements for a subset of 313. We built failing and non-failing cardiac regulatory gene networks, revealing important regulators and cardiac expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). PPP1R3A emerged as a novel regulator whose network connectivity changed significantly between health and disease. Time-course RNA sequencing after PPP1R3A knock-down validated network-based predictions of metabolic pathway expression, increased cardiomyocyte size, and perturbed respiratory metabolism. Mice lacking PPP1R3A were protected against pressure-overload heart failure. We present a global gene interaction map of the human heart failure transition, identify new cardiac eQTLs, and demonstrate the discovery potential of disease-specific networks through the description of PPP1R3A as a novel central protective regulator in heart failure.",

    "abstract": "Human hookworm Necator Americanus (NA) causes iron deficiency anemia, as the parasite ingests blood from the gastrointestinal tract of its human host. This bioinformatics-based study focuses on eight of the cathepsin B-like cysteine proteases (CPs) of the worm to explore their pathogenic potential. CP1 - CP6, which harbored the active site cysteine residue for enzymatic activity, were relevantly observed to have N-terminal signal peptide for extracellular localization. The secretory CPs could be releasing indigenous worm heparin at the host-pathogen interface for anticoagulation purposes. CP2 and CP3 showed a novel hemoglobinase motif that could be a prerequisite for hemoglobin degradation. CP1 and CP6 shared similar enzymatic-pocket features with cathepsin B and cruzain that cleave high molecular weight kininogen for blood-thinning activity. CP1, CP2, CP3, CP5 and CP6 were predicted to bind heparin, at their C terminal domain, like human cathepsin B and cruzain non-covalently bind heparin to enhance their activity. NA CPs action in concert with heparin, have implications for anti-heparin and heparin analog design against hookworm infection.",

    "abstract": "Fast-rising sensory events evoke a series of functionally heterogeneous event-related potentials (ERPs). Stimulus repetition at 1 Hz is known to induce a strong habituation of the largest ERP responses, the vertex waves, which are elicited by stimuli regardless of their modality7, provided that they are salient and behaviourally-relevant. In contrast, the effect of stimulus repetition on the earlier sensor)7 components of ERls has been less explored, and the few existing results are inconsistent. To characterize how the different ERP waves habituate over time, we recorded the responses elicited by 60 identical somatosensory stimuli (activating either non-nociceptive A {beta} or nociceptive A5 afferents), delivered at 1 Hz to healthy human participants. We show that the well-described spatiotemporal sequence of lateralised and vertex ERP components elicited by the first stimulus of the series is largely preserved in the smaller-amplitude, habituated response elicited by the last stimuli of the series. We also found that the earlier lateralised sensory waves habituate across the 60 trials following the same decay function of the vertex waves: this decay function is characterised by a large drop at the first stimulus repetition followed by smaller decreases at subsequent repetitions. Interestingly, the same decay functions described the habituation of ERPs elicited by repeated non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli. This study provides a neurophysiological characterization of the effect of prolonged and repeated stimulation on the main components of somatosensory ERPs. It also demonstrates that both lateralised waves and vertex waves are obligator}7 components of ERPs elicited by non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance statementOur results provide a functional characterization of the decay of the different ERP components when identical somatosensory (nociceptive and non-nociceptive) stimuli are repeated at 1Hz. East-rising stimuli elicit ERPs obligator)7 contributed by both early lateralised components and late vertex components, even when stimulus repetition minimizes stimulus relevance. This challenges the view that lateralised waves are not obligatorily elicited by nociceptive stimuli. Furthermore, the lateralised and vertex waves habituate to stimulus repetition following similar decay functions, which are unlikely explained in terms of fatigue or adaptation of skin receptors.",

    "abstract": "Classic pulse-chase studies have shown that actin is conveyed in slow axonal transport, but the mechanistic basis for this movement is unknown. Recently, we reported that axonal actin was surprisingly dynamic, with focal assembly/dis-assembly events (\\\"hotspots\\\") and elongating polymers along the axon-shaft (\\\"trails\\\"). Using a combination of live imaging, super-resolution microscopy, and modeling, here we explore how these axonal actin dynamics can lead to processive transport. We found abundant actin nucleation, along with a slow, anterogradely-biased flow of actin in axon-shafts. Starting with first principles of monomer/filament assembly - and incorporating imaging data - we generated a quantitative model simulating axonal hotspots and trails. Our simulations predict that the axonal actin dynamics indeed lead to an anterogradely-biased flow of the population, at rates consistent with slow transport. Collectively, the data point to a surprising scenario where local assembly and biased polymerization generate the slow axonal transport of actin. This mechanism is distinct from polymer-sliding, and seems well suited to convey highly dynamic cytoskeletal cargoes.\\n\\nAcknowledgementsThis work was supported by an NIH grant to SR (R01NS075233).

    "abstract": "BackgroundHernia repair is a common surgical procedure with mesh often used. Current mesh materials have a high incidence of repair failures, due to poor tissue integration, and complications such as seroma and pain. Polypropylene (PP) mesh is the standard material in hernia repair secondary to its material durability; however, failures still approach 15%. In this first time animal study, we hypothesized that squid ring teeth (SRT), a biologically-derived high strength protein, coated polypropylene (SRT-PP) mesh, would offer enhanced tissue integration and strength compared to standard PP mesh, while proving biocompatibility for in vivo use.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsPolypropylene mesh was coated with SRT. Mechanical properties and cell proliferation studies of the composite mesh were performed in vitro. Rats underwent inlay mesh implantation in an anterior abdominal wall defect model. Repair was assessed clinically and radiographically, with integration evaluated by histology and mechanical testing.\\n\\nResultsCell proliferation was enhanced on SRT-PP composite mesh. This was corroborated by abdominal wall histology, dramatically diminished cranio-caudal mesh contraction, improved strength testing, and higher tissue failure strain following in vivo implantation. There was no increase in complications with SRT, with regard to seroma or visceral adhesion. No foreign body reactions were noted on liver histology.\\n\\nConclusionSRT-PP mesh showed better tissue integration than PP mesh. SRT is a high strength protein that is applied as a coating to augment mesh-tissue integration leading to improvements in abdominal wall stability with potential to reduce re-intervention for failures.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGamma valerolactone (GVL) is a promising technology for degradation of biomass for biofuel production; however, GVL has adverse toxicity effects on fermentative microbes. Using a combination of chemical genomics and chemical proteomics we sought to understand the mechanism toxicity and resistance to GVL with the goal of engineering a GVL-tolerant, xylose-fermenting yeast.\\n\\nResultsChemical genomic profiling of GVL predicted that this chemical affects membranes and membrane-bound processes. We show that GVL causes rapid, dose-dependent cell permeability, and is synergistic with ethanol. Chemical genomic profiling of GVL revealed that deletion of the functionally related enzymes Pad1p and Fdc1p, which act together to decarboxylate phenolic acids to vinyl derivatives, increases yeast tolerance to GVL. Further, overexpression of Pad1p sensitizes cells to GVL toxicity. To improve GVL tolerance, we deleted PAD1 and FDC1 in a xylose-fermenting yeast strain. The modified strain exhibited increased anaerobic growth, sugar utilization, and ethanol production in synthetic hydrolysate with 1.5% GVL, and under other conditions. Chemical proteomic profiling of the engineered strain revealed that enzymes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis were more abundant in the presence of GVL compared to the background strain. The engineered GVL strain contained greater amounts of ergosterol than the background strain.\\n\\nConclusionsWe found that GVL exerts toxicity to yeast by compromising cellular membranes, and that this toxicity is synergistic with ethanol. Deletion of PAD1 and FDC1 conferred GVL resistance to a xylose-fermenting yeast strain by increasing ergosterol content in cells. The GVL-tolerant strain fermented sugars in the presence of GVL levels that were inhibitory to the unmodified strain. This strain represents a xylose fermenting yeast specifically tailored to GVL produced hydrolysates",

Deletion of clk-1 was lethal in mice, and its mutation in C. elegans mildly extended lifespan, slowed physiological rate and led to sickness. We found that if growth retardation was taken into account the average lifespan of clk-1 mutants would not be prolonged or would be shortened. In addition, recent study showed that knocking down of clk-1 shortened lifespan. Although the extension of lifespan in clk-1 mutants was mild and was not observed sometimes, some progenies indeed had prolonged maximum lifespan even if retardation of growth was taking into account. These paradoxes implicate the existence of individual specificity in the aging process even in the same cohort, just like a drug is beneficial for some people while for others it is detrimental. We further categorized lifespan curves into five kinds of patterns according to the lifespan alternations observed in organisms: N (normal); L (long-lived); S (short-lived); F (flattened); ST (steepened), and found that the curve of clk-1 mutants fit into the F pattern.

    "abstract": "At zygotic genome activation (ZGA), changes in chromatin structure are associated with new transcription immediately following the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). The nuclear architectural proteins, cohesin and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), contribute to chromatin structure and gene regulation. We show here that normal cohesin function is important for ZGA in zebrafish. Depletion of cohesin subunit Rad21 delays ZGA without affecting cell cycle progression. In contrast, CTCF depletion has little effect on ZGA whereas complete abrogation is lethal. Genome wide analysis of Rad21 binding reveals a change in distribution from pericentromeric satellite DNA, and few locations including the miR-430 locus (whose products are responsible for maternal transcript degradation), to genes, as embryos progress through the MZT. After MZT, a subset of Rad21 binding occurs at genes dysregulated upon Rad21 depletion and overlaps pioneer factor Pou5f3, which activates early expressed genes. Rad21 depletion disrupts the formation of nucleoli and RNA polymerase II foci, suggestive of global defects in chromosome architecture. We propose that Rad21/cohesin redistribution to active areas of the genome is key to the establishment of chromosome organization and the embryonic developmental program.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDuring the first few hours of existence, early zygotic cellular events are regulated by maternally inherited molecules. From a defined timepoint, the zygotic genome gradually becomes active and is transcribed. How the zygotic genome is first held inactive before becoming rapidly activated is poorly understood. Both gene repression and activation mechanisms are involved, but one aspect that has not yet been investigated is how 3-dimensional chromosome structure influences genome activation. In this study, we used zebrafish embryos to model zygotic genome activation.\\n\\nThe multi-subunit protein complex, cohesin, and the DNA-binding protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) both have well known and overlapping roles in 3-dimensional genome organization. We depleted cohesin subunit Rad21, or CTCF, to determine their effects on zygotic genome activation. Moderate Rad21 depletion delayed transition to zygotic gene expression, without disrupting the cell cycle. By contrast, moderate CTCF depletion had very little effect; however, strong depletion of CTCF was lethal. We surveyed genome-wide binding of Rad21 before and after the zygotic genome is activated, and determined what other chromatin factors and transcription factors coincide with Rad21 binding. Before genome activation, Rad21 was located at satellite DNA and a few noncoding genes, one of which (miR-430) is responsible for degrading maternal transcripts. Following genome activation, there was a mass relocation of Rad21 to genes, particularly active genes and those that are targets of transcriptional activators when the zygotic genome is switched on. Depletion of Rad21 also affected global chromosome structure.\\n\\nOur study shows that cohesin binding redistributes to active RNA Polymerase II genes at the onset of zygotic gene transcription. Furthermore, we suggest that cohesin contributes to dynamic changes in chromosome architecture that occur upon zygotic genome activation.",

Among convergent taxa, adaptations may be largely equivalent with the taxa operating in a similar set of environmental conditions, divergent with the taxa operating in different sets of environmental conditions, or superior with one taxon operating within an extended range of environmental conditions than the other. With this framework in mind, we sought to characterize the adaptations of two convergent nectarivorous bird families, the New World hummingbirds (Trochilidae) and Old World sunbirds (Nectariniidae), by comparing their biogeography. Looking at their elevational and latitudinal gradients, hummingbirds not only extend into but also maintain species richness in more extreme environments. We suspect that hummingbirds have a superior key adaptation that sunbirds lack, namely a musculoskeletal architecture that allows for hovering. Through biogeographic comparisons, we have been able to assess and understand adaptations as evolutionary technologies among two convergent bird families, a process that should work for most taxa.",

    "abstract": "Executive SummaryForests are important determinants of the carbon cycle, and they provide countless ecosystem services to support billions of people worldwide. Global-scale forest restoration is one of our most effective weapons in the fight against biodiversity loss, rural poverty and climate change. In this report, we generate a spatial map of tree density within the potential forest restoration areas delineated by the IUCN/WRIs \\\"Atlas of Forest Landscape Restoration Opportunities\\\" to estimate the potential number of trees that could be restored at a global scale. We also estimate the number of trees that might be saved by avoiding deforestation in currently forested areas.\\n\\nWe show that the restoration areas have the capacity to support a total of 1.33 trillion trees. However, given that a considerable proportion of these areas already contain forests, we estimate that 589 billion new trees (larger than 10 cm diameter) could be restored within these areas, which would have the potential to store 65-91 Gigatonnes of carbon after reaching forest maturation. These values will increase marginally over time, as deforestation is responsible for the removal of living trees within the restoration areas. However, if only 50% or 25% of the mosaic areas (the largest of the designated restoration types) are available for reforestation, this total number will fall to approximately 360, or 246 billion trees, respectively, with corresponding decreases in potential carbon storage. Given that anthropogenic carbon emissions are currently in the order of 9-12 Gigatonnes per year, effective global-scale restoration might potentially have a valuable impact on global-scale climate mitigation over the rest of this century.\\n\\nThis report was produced with funding from WWF-UK as part of the Trillion Trees programme with the Wildlife Conservation Society and BirdLife International",

    "abstract": "Faithful inheritance of genetic information through sexual reproduction relies on the formation of crossovers between homologous chromosomes during meiosis, which in turn relies on the formation and repair of numerous double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). As DSBs pose a potential threat to the genome, mechanisms that ensure timely and error-free DSB repair are crucial for successful meiosis. Here we identify NBS-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of the NBS1 subunit of the conserved MRE11-RAD50-NBS1/Xrs2 (MRN) complex, as a key mediator of DSB repair via homologous recombination (HR) during meiosis. Loss of nbs-1 leads to: severely reduced loading of recombinase RAD-51, ssDNA binding protein RPA and pro-crossover factor COSA-1 during meiotic prophase progression; aggregated and fragmented chromosomes at the end of meiotic prophase; and 100% progeny lethality. These phenotypes reflect a role for NBS-1 in processing of meiotic DSBs for HR that is shared with its interacting partners MRE-11-RAD-50 and COM-1 (ortholog of Com1/Sae2/CtIP). Unexpectedly, in contrast to MRE-11 and RAD-50, NBS-1 is not required for meiotic DSB formation. Meiotic defects of the nbs-1 mutant are partially suppressed by abrogation of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, indicating a role for NBS-1 in antagonizing NHEJ during meiosis. Our data further reveal that NBS-1 and COM-1 play distinct roles in promoting HR and antagonizing NHEJ. We propose a model in which different components of the MRN-C complex work together to couple meiotic DSB formation with efficient and timely engagement of HR, thereby ensuring crossover formation and restoration of genome integrity prior to the meiotic divisions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDouble-strand breaks (DSBs) are deleterious DNA lesions, and impairment of the DSB repair machinery can lead to devastating diseases such as the Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS). During meiosis, DSBs represent a \\\"necessary evil\\\": they are required to promote formation of crossovers between homologous chromosomes. Crossovers in turn ensure correct chromosome inheritance during gamete formation, which is essential for viability and normal development of embryos. During meiosis, numerous DSBs are actively created, so meiotic cells must ensure that all breaks are properly repaired to ensure crossover formation and restore genomic integrity. Here we identify C. elegans NBS-1 as essential to properly process meiotic DSBs, both to promote crossover formation and antagonize an error-prone DSB repair pathway, thereby ensuring faithful chromosome inheritance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCNV analysis is an integral component to the study of human genomes in both research and clinical settings. Array-based CNV analysis is the current first-tier approach in clinical cytogenetics. Decreasing costs in high-throughput sequencing and cloud computing have opened doors for the development of sequencing-based CNV analysis pipelines with fast turnaround times. We carry out a systematic and quantitative comparative analysis for several low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) strategies to detect CNV in the human genome.\\n\\nMethodsWe compared the CNV detection capabilities of WGS strategies (short-insert, 3kb-, and 5kb-insert mate-pair) each at 1x, 3x, and 5x coverages relative to each other and to 17 currently used high-density oligonucleotide arrays. For benchmarking, we used a set of Gold Standard (GS) CNVs generated for the 1000-Genomes-Project CEU subject NA12878.\\n\\nResultsOverall, low-coverage WGS strategies detect drastically more GS CNVs compared to arrays and are accompanied with smaller percentages of CNV calls without validation. Furthermore, we show that WGS (at [&ge;]1x coverage) is able to detect all seven GS deletion-CNVs >100 kb in NA12878 whereas only one is detected by most arrays. Lastly, we show that the much larger 15 Mbp Cri-du-chat deletion can be readily detected with short-insert paired-end WGS at even just 1x coverage.\\n\\nConclusionsCNV analysis using low-coverage WGS is efficient and outperforms the array-based analysis that is currently used for clinical cytogenetics.",

    "abstract": "Cell division during the reproductive phase of the Streptomyces life-cycle requires tight coordination between synchronous formation of multiple septa and DNA segregation. One remarkable difference with most other bacterial systems is that cell division in Streptomyces is positively controlled by the recruitment of FtsZ by SsgB. Here we show that deletion of ylmD (SCO2081) or ylmE (SCO2080), which lie in operon with ftsZ in the dcw cluster of actinomycetes, has major consequences for sporulation-specific cell division in Streptomyces coelicolor. Electron and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that ylmE mutants have a highly aberrant phenotype with defective septum synthesis, and produce very few spores with low viability and high heat sensitivity. FtsZ-ring formation was also highly disturbed in ylmE mutants. Deletion of ylmD had a far less severe effect on sporulation. Interestingly, the additional deletion of ylmD restored sporulation to the ylmE null mutant. YlmD and YlmE are not part of the divisome, but instead localize diffusely in aerial hyphae, with differential intensity throughout the sporogenic part of the hyphae. Taken together, our work reveals a function for YlmD and YlmE in the control of sporulation-specific cell division in S. coelicolor, whereby the presence of YlmD alone results in major developmental defects.",

We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) brain responses to frequency deviants in matched, regularly-patterned (REG) versus random (RAND) tone-pip sequences. Listeners were naive and distracted by an incidental visual task. Stimuli were very rapid so as to limit conscious reasoning about the sequence order and tap automatic processing of regularity.\\n\\nDeviants within REG sequences evoked a substantially larger response (by 71%) than matched deviants in RAND sequences from 80 ms after deviant onset. This effect was underpinned by distinct sources in right temporal pole and orbitofrontal cortex in addition to the standard bilateral temporal and right pre-frontal network for generic frequency deviance-detection. These findings demonstrate that the human brain rapidly acquires a detailed representation of regularities within the sensory input and evaluates incoming information according to the context established by the specific pattern.",

    "abstract": "Motor contagions refer to implicit effects on ones actions induced by observation of others actions. Motor contagions are believed to be induced simply by action observation and cause an observers action to become similar to the observed action. In contrast, here we report a new motor contagion that is induced only when the observation is accompanied by prediction errors-differences between actions one observes and those he/she predicts or expects. Moreover, this contagion may not manifest as a similarity between ones own and observed actions. In our experiment, observation of the same action induced distinct motor contagions, depending on whether prediction errors are present or not. In the absence of prediction errors, similarly to previous reports, participants actions changed to become similar to the observed action, while in the presence of prediction errors, their actions changed to diverge away from it. Our results suggest distinct effects of action observation and action prediction on human actions.",

Here we systematically investigated how locomotion modulates visual responses across six visual areas and three cortical layers using a massive dataset from the Allen Brain Institute. Although running has been shown to increase firing in V1, we found that it suppressed firing in higher-order visual areas. Despite this reduction in gain, visual responses during running could be decoded more accurately than visual responses during stationary periods.

One such predictive computation is retinal sensitization, a form of short-term plasticity seen in multiple species that elevates local sensitivity following strong local stimulation. Here we perform a causal circuit analysis of retinal sensitization using simultaneous intracellular and multielectrode recording in the salamander. We show, using direct current injection into inhibitory sustained amacrine cells that a decrease in amacrine transmission is necessary, sufficient and occurs at the right time and manner to cause sensitization in ganglion cells. Because of neural dynamics and nonlinear pathways, a computational model is essential to explain how a change in steady inhibitory transmission causes sensitization. Whereas adaptation of excitation removes an expected result in order to transmit novelty, adaptation of inhibition provides a general mechanism to enhance the sensitivity to the sensory feature conveyed by an inhibitory pathway, creating a prediction of future input.",

    "abstract": "Human object-selective cortex shows a large-scale organization characterized by the high-level properties of both animacy and object-size. To what extent are these neural responses explained by primitive perceptual features that distinguish animals from objects and big objects from small objects? To address this question, we used a texture synthesis algorithm to create a novel class of stimuli--texforms--which preserve some mid-level texture and form information from objects while rendering them unrecognizable. We found that unrecognizable texforms were sufficient to elicit the large-scale organizations of object-selective cortex along the entire ventral pathway. Further, the structure in the neural patterns elicited by texforms was well predicted by curvature features and by intermediate layers of a deep convolutional neural network, supporting the mid-level nature of the representations. These results provide clear evidence that a substantial portion of ventral stream organization can be accounted for by coarse texture and form information, without requiring explicit recognition of intact objects.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhile neural responses to object categories are remarkably systematic across human visual cortex, the nature of these responses been hotly debated for the past 20 years. In this paper, a new class of stimuli (\\\"texforms\\\") is used to examine how mid-level features contribute to the large-scale organization of the ventral visual stream. Despite their relatively primitive visual appearance, these unrecognizable texforms elicited the entire large-scale organizations of the ventral stream by animacy and object size. This work demonstrates that much of ventral stream organization can be explained by relatively primitive mid-level features, without requiring explicit recognition of the objects themselves.",

    "abstract": "The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) measures resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) signal of each voxel. However, the unit of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal is arbitrary and hence ALFF is sensitive to the scale of raw signal. A well-accepted standardization procedure is to divide each voxels ALFF by the global mean ALFF. However, this makes the individual voxels ALFF dependent on the global mean. Although Fractional ALFF (fALFF), proposed as a ratio of the ALFF to the total amplitude within the full frequency band, offers possible solution of the standardization, it actually mixes with the fluctuation power within the full frequency band and thus cannot reveal the true amplitude characteristics of a given frequency band. We proposed a new standardized, stand-alone, single-voxel metrics for RS-fMRI, namely percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF). PerAF is an analog to the percent signal change that has been widely used in the task fMRI communities, which allows it to be a straightforward measurement of BOLD signal fluctuations during resting state. We further conducted a test-retest reliability analysis comparing the relevant metrics, which indicated that PerAF was generally more reliable than the ALFF and fALFF. In a real RS-fMRI application, we further demonstrated that with and without standardization by global mean PerAF yielded prominently different results when comparing eyes open with eyes closed resting conditions, suggesting that future study should provide both with and without global mean standardization. The above results suggest that PerAF is a more reliable, straightforward and promising measurement for voxelwise brain activity-based RS-fMRI studies. For prompting future application of PerAF, we also implemented this method into a user-friendly toolbox REST-PerAF.",

    "abstract": "Undisclosed exploitation of flexibility in data acquisition and analysis blurs the important distinction between exploratory and hypothesis-driven findings and inflates false-positive rates1-4. Indeed, recent replication attempts have revealed low levels of replicability, pointing to high rates of false-positives in the literature5-10. A contemporary solution to this problem is pre-registration: commitment to aspects of methods and analysis before data acquisition11. This solution is valid only to the extent that the commitment stage is time-locked to precede data collection. To date, time-locking can only be guaranteed by introducing a third party such as peer reviewers at an early stage, making this solution less appealing for many12. Here we adapt a cryptographic method13 to encode information of study protocol within random aspects of the data acquisition process. This way, the structure of variability in the data time-locks the commitment stage with respect to data acquisition. Being independent of any third party, this method fully preserves scientific autonomy and confidentiality. We provide code for easy implementation and a detailed example from the field of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).",
