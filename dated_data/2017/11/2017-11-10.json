    "abstract": "Patient classification has widespread biomedical and clinical applications, including diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response prediction. A clinically useful prediction algorithm should be accurate, generalizable, be able to integrate diverse data types, and handle sparse data. A clinical predictor based on genomic data needs to be easily interpretable to drive hypothesis-driven research into new treatments. We describe netDx, a novel supervised patient classification framework based on patient similarity networks. netDx meets the above criteria and particularly excels at data integration and model interpretability. As a machine learning method, netDx demonstrates consistently excellent performance in a cancer survival benchmark across four cancer types by integrating up to six genomic and clinical data types. In these tests, netDx has significantly higher average performance than most other machine-learning approaches across most cancer types and its best model outperforms all other methods for two cancer types. In comparison to traditional machine learning-based patient classifiers, netDx results are more interpretable, visualizing the decision boundary in the context of patient similarity space. When patient similarity is defined by pathway-level gene expression, netDx identifies biological pathways important for outcome prediction, as demonstrated in diverse data sets of breast cancer and asthma. Thus, netDx can serve both as a patient classifier and as a tool for discovery of biological features characteristic of disease. We provide a software complete implementation of netDx along with sample files and automation workflows in R.",

    "abstract": "The identification of cell type marker genes, genes highly enriched in specific cell types, plays an important role in the study of the nervous system. In particular, marker genes can be used to identify cell types to enable studies of their properties. Marker genes can also aid the interpretation of bulk tissue expression profiles by revealing cell type specific changes.\\n\\nWe assembled a database, NeuroExpresso, of publicly available mouse brain cell type-specific gene expression datasets. We then used stringent criteria to select marker genes highly expressed in individual cell types. We found a substantial number of novel markers previously unknown in the literature and validated a subset of them using in silico analyses and in situ hybridization.

    "abstract": "Fractones are extracellular matrix structures in the neural stem cell niche of the subventricular zone (SVZ), where they appear as round deposits named bulbs or thin branching lines called stems. Their cellular origin and what determines their localization at this site is poorly studied and it remains unclear whether they influence neural stem and progenitor cells formation, proliferation and/or maintenance. To address these questions, we analyzed whole mount preparations of the lateral ventricle by confocal microscopy using different extracellular matrix and cell markers. We found that bulbs are rarely connected to stems and that they contain laminin 5 and 2 chains, respectively. Fractone bulbs were profusely distributed throughout the SVZ and appeared associated with the center of pinwheels, a critical site for adult neurogenesis. We demonstrate that bulbs appear at the apical membrane of ependymal cells at the end of the first week after birth. The use of transgenic mice lacking laminin 5 gene expression (Lama5) in endothelium and in FoxJ1-expressing ependymal cells, revealed ependymal cells as the source of laminin 5-containing fractone bulbs. Loss of laminin 5 from bulbs correlated with a 60% increase in cell proliferation, as determined by PH3 staining, and with a selective reduction in the number of quiescent neural stem cells in the SVZ. These results indicate that fractones are a key component of the SVZ and suggest that laminin 5 modulates the physiology of the neural stem cell niche.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOur work unveils key aspects of fractones, extracellular matrix structures present in the SVZ that still lack a comprehensive characterization. We show that fractones extensively interact with neural stem cells, whereas some of them are located precisely at pinwheel centers, which are hotspots for adult neurogenesis. Our results also demonstrate that fractones increase in size during aging and that their interactions with NSPCs become more complex in old mice. Lastly, we show that fractone bulbs are produced by ependymal cells and that their laminin content regulates neural stem cells.",

Similar methods have not been established for signal transduction networks, where the representation of internal states leads to scalability issues in both model formulation and execution. While rule- and agent-based methods allow efficient model definition and execution, respectively, model parametrisation introduces an additional layer of uncertainty due to the sparsity of reliably measured parameters. Here, we present a scalable method for parameter-free simulation of mechanistic signal transduction networks. It is based on rxncon and uses a bipartite Boolean logic with separate update rules for reactions and states. Using two generic update rules, we enable translation of any rxncon model into a unique Boolean model, which can be used for network validation and simulation - allowing the prediction of system level function directly from molecular mechanistic data. Through scalable model definition and simulation, and the independence of quantitative parameters, it opens up for simulation and validation of mechanistic genome-scale models of signal transduction networks.",

    "abstract": "Human-pathogenic bacteria are found in a variety of niches, including free-living, zoonotic, and microbiome environments. Identifying bacterial adaptions that enable invasive disease is an important means of gaining insight into the molecular basis of pathogenesis and understanding pathogen emergence. Staphylococcus saprophyticus, a leading cause of urinary tract infections, can be found in the environment, food, animals, and the human microbiome. We identified a selective sweep in the gene encoding the Aas adhesin, a key virulence factor that binds host fibronectin. We hypothesize that the mutation under selection (aas_2206A>C) facilitates colonization of the urinary tract, an environment where bacteria are subject to strong shearing forces. The mutation appears to have enabled emergence and expansion of a human pathogenic lineage of S. saprophyticus. These results demonstrate the power of evolutionary genomic approaches in discovering the genetic basis of virulence and emphasize the pleiotropy and adaptability of bacteria occupying diverse niches.\\n\\nImportanceStaphylococcus saprophyticus is an important cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) in women, which are common, can be severe, and are associated with significant impacts to public health. In addition to being a cause of human UTI, S. saprophyticus can be found in the environment, in food, and associated with animals. After discovering that UTI strains of S. saprophyticus are for the most part closely related to each other, we sought to determine whether these strains are specially adapted to cause disease in humans. We found evidence suggesting that a mutation in the gene aas is advantageous in the context of human infection. We hypothesize that the mutation allows S. saprophyticus to survive better in the human urinary tract. These results show how bacteria found in the environment can evolve to cause disease.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance constitutes one of the most pressing public health concerns. Antimicrobial peptides of multicellular organisms are considered part of a solution to this problem, and AMPs produced by bacteria such as colistin are last resort drugs. Importantly, antimicrobial peptides differ from many antibiotics in their pharmacodynamic characteristics. Here we implement these differences within a theoretical framework to predict the evolution of resistance against antimicrobial peptides and compare it to antibiotic resistance. Our analysis of resistance evolution finds that pharmacodynamic differences all combine to produce a much lower probability that resistance will evolve against antimicrobial peptides. The finding can be generalized to all drugs with pharmacodynamics similar to AMPs. Pharmacodynamic concepts are familiar to most practitioners of medical microbiology, and data can be easily obtained for any drug or drug combination. Our theoretical and conceptual framework is therefore widely applicable and can help avoid resistance evolution if implemented in antibiotic stewardship schemes or the rational choice of new drug candidates.",

    "abstract": "The brain represents visual objects with topographic cortical patterns. To address how distributed visual representations enable object categorization, we established predictive encoding models based on a deep residual neural network, and trained them to predict cortical responses to natural movies. Using this predictive model, we mapped human cortical representations to 64,000 visual objects from 80 categories with high throughput and accuracy. Such representations covered both the ventral and dorsal pathways, reflected multiple levels of object features, and preserved semantic relationships between categories. In the entire visual cortex, object representations were modularly organized into three categories: biological objects, non-biological objects, and background scenes. In a finer scale specific to each module, object representations revealed sub-modules for further categorization. These findings suggest that increasingly more specific category is represented by cortical patterns in progressively finer spatial scales. Such a nested hierarchy may be a fundamental principle for the brain to categorize visual objects with various levels of specificity, and can be explained and differentiated by object features at different levels.",

    "abstract": "1.1.1 BackgroundMost healthcare data sources store information within their own unique schemas, making reliable and reproducible research challenging. Consequently, researchers have adopted various data models to improve the efficiency of research. Transforming and loading data into these models is a labor-intensive process that can alter the semantics of the original data. Therefore, we created a data model with a hierarchical structure that simplifies the transformation process and minimizes data alteration.\\n\\n1.2 MethodsThere were two design goals in constructing the tables and table relationships for the Generalized Data Model (GDM). The first was to focus on clinical codes in their original vocabularies to retain the original semantic representation of the data. The second was to retain hierarchical information present in the original data while retaining provenance. The model was tested by transforming synthetic Medicare data; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked to Medicare claims; and electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We also tested a subsequent transformation from the GDM into the Sentinel data model.\\n\\n1.3 ResultsThe resulting data model contains 19 tables, with the Clinical Codes, Contexts, and Collections tables serving as the core of the model, and containing most of the clinical, provenance, and hierarchical information. In addition, a Mapping table allows users to apply an arbitrarily complex set of relationships among vocabulary elements to facilitate automated analyses.\\n\\n1.4 ConclusionsThe GDM offers researchers a simpler process for transforming data, clear data provenance, and a path for users to transform their data into other data models. The GDM is designed to retain hierarchical relationships among data elements as well as the original semantic representation of the data, ensuring consistency in protocol implementation as part of a complete data pipeline for researchers.",

    "abstract": "Withdrawal of the growth factor interleukin 3 from IL3-dependent myeloid cells causes them to undergo Bax/Bak1-dependent apoptosis, whereas factor-deprived Bax-/-Bak1-/- cells remain viable, but arrest and shrink. It was reported that withdrawal of IL3 from Bax-/-Bak1-/- cells caused decreased expression of the glucose transporter Glut1, leading to reduced glucose uptake, so that arrested cells required Atg5-dependent autophagy for long-term survival. In other cell types, a decrease in Glut1 is mediated by the thioredoxin-interacting protein Txnip, which is induced in IL3-dependent myeloid cells when growth factor is removed. We mutated Atg5 and Txnip by CRISPR/Cas9 and found that Atg5-dependent autophagy was not necessary for the long-term viability of cycling or arrested Bax-/-Bak1-/- cells, and that Txnip was not required for the decrease in Glut1 expression in response to IL3 withdrawal. Surprisingly, Atg5-deficient Bax/Bak1 double mutant cells survived for several weeks in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), without high concentrations of added glucose or glutamine. When serum was withdrawn, the provision of an equivalent amount of glucose present in 10% FBS (~0.5 mM) was sufficient to support cell survival for more than a week, in the presence or absence of IL3. Thus, Bax-/-Bak1-/- myeloid cells deprived of growth factor consume extracellular glucose to maintain long-term viability, without a requirement for Atg5-dependent autophagy.",

How DDR pathways in irradiated cells stimulate BE in non-targeted cells is mostly unknown. We show here that extracellular vesicles from irradiated cells (EV-IR) induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage when internalized by un-irradiated cells. We found that EV-IR from Abl-NLS-mutated cells could not induce ROS or DNA damage, and restoration of nuclear Abl rescued those defects. Expanding a previous finding that Abl stimulates miR-34c expression, we show here that nuclear Abl also drives the vesicular secretion of miR-34c. Ectopic miR-34c expression, without irradiation, generated EV-miR-34c capable of inducing ROS and DNA damage. Furthermore, EV-IR from miR34-knockout cells could not induce ROS and raised {gamma}H2AX to lesser extent than EV-IR from miR34-wild type cells. These results establish a novel role for the Abl-miR-34c DDR pathway in stimulating radiation-induced bystander effects.",

We establish that the method has temporal and spatial resolutions comparable to the high-throughput sequencing approaches, while being faster than alternative locus-specific methods. Furthermore, the approach is capable of allele discrimination. We apply this method to determine relative replication timing across timing transition zones in cultured human cells. Finally, multiple samples can be analysed in parallel, allowing us to rapidly screen kinetochore mutants for perturbation to centromere replication timing.

    "abstract": "Human object-selective cortex shows a large-scale organization characterized by the high-level properties of both animacy and object-size. To what extent are these neural responses explained by primitive perceptual features that distinguish animals from objects and big objects from small objects? To address this question, we used a texture synthesis algorithm to create a novel class of stimuli--texforms--which preserve some mid-level texture and form information from objects while rendering them unrecognizable. We found that unrecognizable texforms were sufficient to elicit the large-scale organizations of object-selective cortex along the entire ventral pathway. Further, the structure in the neural patterns elicited by texforms was well predicted by curvature features and by intermediate layers of a deep convolutional neural network, supporting the mid-level nature of the representations. These results provide clear evidence that a substantial portion of ventral stream organization can be accounted for by coarse texture and form information, without requiring explicit recognition of intact objects.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhile neural responses to object categories are remarkably systematic across human visual cortex, the nature of these responses been hotly debated for the past 20 years. In this paper, a new class of stimuli (\\\"texforms\\\") is used to examine how mid-level features contribute to the large-scale organization of the ventral visual stream. Despite their relatively primitive visual appearance, these unrecognizable texforms elicited the entire large-scale organizations of the ventral stream by animacy and object size. This work demonstrates that much of ventral stream organization can be explained by relatively primitive mid-level features, without requiring explicit recognition of the objects themselves.",

Yet little is known about protein expression in the cell-free systems. Here we take a systems approach to uncover underlying dynamics of cell-free protein expression. We construct a set of T7 promoter variants to express proteins at different transcription rates in a reconstituted and E. coli extract-based cell-free systems. We find that the maximum expression level and the rate of protein synthesis as responses to the transcription rate change are different in the two cell-free systems, suggesting they are driven by different expression dynamics. We confirm this by constructing a simple mathematical model for each cell-free system, which well reproduce the experimental results and also identify different limiting factors for better protein expression in the two cell-free systems. In particular, they revealed there is a negative feedback effect in the mRNA-protein translation by the PURE system and also identified different limiting factors for better protein expression in the two cell-free systems.",

    "abstract": "Mountain lions (Puma concolor) were once endemic across the United States. The Northeastern population of mountain lions has been largely nonexistent since the early 1800s and was officially declared extinct in 2011. This regionally extinct mountain lion is Pennsylvania State Universitys official mascot, where it is referred to as the  Nittany Lion. Our goal in this study was to use recent methodological advances in ancient DNA and massively parallel sequencing to reconstruct complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes of multiple Nittany Lions by sampling from preserved skins. This effort is part of a broader Nittany Lion Genome project intended to involve undergraduates in ancient DNA and bioinformatics research and to engage the broader Penn State community in discussions about conservation biology and extinction. Complete mtDNA genome sequences were obtained from five individuals. When compared to previously published sequences, Nittany Lions are not more similar to each other than to individuals from the Western U.S. and Florida. Supporting previous findings, North American mountain lions overall were more closely related to each other than to those from South America and had lower genetic diversity. This result emphasizes the importance of continued conservation in the Western U.S. and Florida to prevent further regional extinctions.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a rapid, cost-effective, non-invasive biodiversity monitoring tool which utilises DNA left behind in the environment by organisms for species detection. The method is used as a species specific survey tool for rare or invasive species across a broad range of ecosystems. Recently, eDNA and  metabarcoding have been combined to describe whole communities rather than focusing on single target species. However, whether metabarcoding is as sensitive as targeted approaches for rare species detection remains to be evaluated. The great crested newt Triturus cristatus is a flagship pond species of international conservation concern and the first UK species to be routinely monitored using eDNA. We evaluate whether eDNA metabarcoding has comparable sensitivity to targeted real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for T. cristatus detection. Extracted eDNA samples (N = 532) were screened for T. cristatus by qPCR and analysed for all vertebrate species using High-Throughput Sequencing technology. With qPCR and a detection threshold of 1/12 positive qPCR replicates, newts were detected in 50% of ponds. Detection decreased to 32% when the threshold was increased to 4/12 positive qPCR replicates. With metabarcoding, newts were detected in 34% of ponds without a detection threshold, and in 28% of ponds when a threshold (0.028%) was applied. Therefore, qPCR provided greater detection than metabarcoding but metabarcoding detection with no threshold was equivalent to qPCR with a stringent detection threshold. The proportion of T. cristatus sequences in each sample was positively associated with the number of positive qPCR replicates (qPCR score) suggesting eDNA metabarcoding may be indicative of eDNA concentration. eDNA metabarcoding holds enormous potential for holistic biodiversity assessment and routine freshwater monitoring. We advocate this community approach to freshwater monitoring to guide management and conservation, whereby entire communities can be initially surveyed to best inform use of funding and time for species-specific surveys.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing technology has facilitated the discovery of a large number of somatic mutations in enhancers (SMEs), whereas the utility of SMEs in tumorigenesis has not been fully explored. Here we present Ennet, a method to comprehensively investigate SMEs enriched networks (SME-networks) in cancer by integrating SMEs, enhancer-gene interactions and gene-gene interactions. Using Ennet, we performed a pan-cancer analysis in 2004 samples from 8 cancer types and found many well-known cancer drivers were involved in the SME-networks, including ESR1, SMAD3, MYC, EGFR, BCL2 and PAX5. Meanwhile, Ennet also identified many new networks with less characterization but have potentially important roles in cancer, including a large SME-network in medulloblastoma (MB), which contains genes enriched in the glutamate receptor and neural development pathways. Interestingly, SME-networks are specific across cancer types, and the vast majority of the genes identified by Ennet have few mutations in gene bodies. Collectively, our work suggests that using enhancer-only somatic mutations can be an effective way to discover potential cancer-driving networks. Ennet provides a new perspective to explore new mechanisms for tumor progression from SMEs.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions, which are beneficial for both interacting species, are recurrently present in ecosystems. Observations of natural systems showed that, if we draw mutualistic relationships as binary links between species, the resulting bipartite network of interactions displays a widespread particular ordering called nestedness [1]. On the other hand, theoretical works have shown that a nested structure has a positive impact on a number of relevant features ranging from species coexistence [2], to a higher structural stability of communities and biodiversity [3,4]. However, how nestedness emerges and what are its determinants, are still open challenges that have led to multiple debates to date [5-7]. Here, we show, by applying a theoretical approach to the analysis of 167 real mutualistic networks, that nestedness is not an irreducible feature, but a consequence of the degree sequences of both guilds of the mutualistic network. Remarkably, we find that an outstanding majority of the analyzed networks does not show statistical significant nestedness. These findings point to the need of revising previous claims about the role of nestedness and might contribute to expand our understanding of how evolution shapes mutualistic interactions and communities by placing the focus on the local properties rather than on global quantities.",

Although Z test is widely used in NIPT nowadays, there is still necessity to improve its accuracy for removing a) false negatives and false positives, and b) the ratio of unclassified data, so as to reduce the potential harm to patients caused by these inaccuracies as well as the induced cost of retests.\\n\\nEmploying multiple Z tests with machine-learning algorithm could provide a better prediction on NIPT data. Combining the multiple Z values with indexes of clinical signs and quality control, features were collected from the known samples and scaled for model training in support vector machine (SVM) discrimination. The trained model was applied to predict the unknown samples, which showed significant improvement. In 4752 qualified NIPT data, our method reached 100% accuracies on all three chromosomes, including 151 data that were grouped as unclassified by one-Z-value based method. Moreover, four false positives and four false negatives were corrected by using this machine-learning model.\\n\\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to employ support vector machine in NIPT data analysis.

    "abstract": "The Chromo-like superfamily of SH3-fold {beta}-barrel domains recognize epigenetic marks in eukaryotic proteins. Their provenance has been placed either in archaea, based on apparent structural similarity to chromatin-compacting Sul7d and Cren7 proteins, or in bacteria based on the presence of sequence homologs. Using sequence and structural evidence we establish that the archaeal Cren7/Sul7 proteins emerged from a zinc ribbon (ZnR) ancestor. Further, we show that the ancestral eukaryotic Chromo-like domains evolved from bacterial precursors acquired from early endosymbioses, which already possessed an aromatic cage for recognition of modified amino-groups. These bacterial versions are part of a radiation of secreted SH3-fold domains, which spawned both chromo-like domains and classical SH3 domains in the context of peptide-recognition in the peptidoglycan. This establishes that Cren7/Sul7 converged to a \\\"SH3\\\"-like state from a ZnR precursor via the loss of metal-chelation and acquisition of stronger hydrophobic interactions; it is unlikely to have participated in the evolution of the chromo-like domains. We show that archaea possess several Cren7/Sul7-related proteins with intact Zn-chelating ligands, which we predict to play previously unstudied roles in cell-division comparable to the PRC barrel.",

We demonstrated that conditioned medium (CM) from macrophages exposed to apoptotic cancer cells inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and invasion of cancer cells with the acquisition of cancer-stem-like traits. Apoptotic 344SQ (ApoSQ) cell-induced PPAR{gamma} activity in macrophages caused increased PTEN levels, secreted in exosomes. ApoSQ-exposed CM from PTEN knockdown cells failed to enhance PTEN in recipient 344SQ cells, restore cellular polarity, and exert anti-EMT and anti-invasive effects. The CM which deficient of PPAR{gamma} ligands could not reverse the suppression of PPAR{gamma} activity and PTEN and consequently failed to the prevent EMT process. Moreover, single injection of ApoSQ cells inhibited lung metastasis in syngeneic mice with enhanced PPAR{gamma}/PTEN signaling both in tumor-associated macrophages and tumor cells. PPAR{gamma} antagonist GW9662 reversed PTEN signaling and anti-metastatic effect. Thus, apoptotic cancer cell therapy may offer a new strategy for the prevention of metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Considerable evidence has shown that prefrontal neurons expressing D1-type dopamine receptors (D1DRs) are critical for working memory, flexibility, and timing. This line of work predicts that frontal neurons expressing D1DRs mediate cognitive processing. During timing tasks, one form this cognitive processing might take is time-dependent ramping activity -- monotonic changes in firing rate over time. Thus, we hypothesized the prefrontal D1DR+ neurons would strongly exhibited time-dependent ramping during interval timing. We tested this idea using an interval-timing task in which we used optogenetics to tag D1DR+ neurons in the mouse medial frontal cortex (MFC). While 23% of MFC D1DR+ neurons exhibited ramping, this was significantly less than untagged MFC D1DR+ neurons. By contrast, MFC D1DR+ neurons had strong delta-frequency (1-4 Hz) coherence with other MFC ramping neurons. This coherence was phase-locked to cue onset and was strongest early in the interval. To test the significance of these interactions, we optogenetically stimulated MFC D1DR+ neurons early vs. late in the interval. We found that 2-Hz stimulation early in the interval was particularly effective in rescuing timing-related behavioral performance deficits in dopamine-depleted animals. These findings provide insight into MFC networks and have relevance for disorders such as Parkinsons disease and schizophrenia.\\n\\nSignificance StatementPrefrontal D1DRs are involved in cognitive processing and cognitive dysfunction in human diseases such as Parkinsons disease and schizophrenia. We use optogenetics to identify these neurons, as well as neurons that are putatively connected to MFC D1DR+ neurons. We study these neurons in detail during an elementary cognitive task. These data could have relevance for cognitive deficits for Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia, and other diseases involving frontal dopamine.",

This study explores the process of cardiac cell diversification in the Drosophila heart, focusing on the two major cardioblast subpopulations: generic working myocardial cells and inflow valve-forming ostial cardioblasts. By screening a large collection of randomly induced mutants we identified several genes involved in cardiac patterning. Further analysis revealed an unexpected, specific requirement of EGF signaling for the specification of generic cardioblasts and a subset of pericardial cells. We demonstrate that the Tbx20 ortholog Midline acts as a direct target of the EGFR effector Pointed to repress ostial fates. Furthermore, we identified Edl/Mae, an antagonist of the ETS factor Pointed, as a novel cardiac regulator crucial for ostial cardioblast specification. Combining these findings we propose a regulatory model in which the balance between activation of Pointed and its inhibition by Edl controls cardioblast subtype-specific gene expression.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSequence-level searches on large collections of RNA-seq experiments, such as the NIH Sequence Read Archive (SRA), would enable one to ask many questions about the expression or variation of a given transcript in a population. Bloom filter-based indexes and variants, such as the Sequence Bloom Tree, have been proposed in the past to solve this problem. However, these approaches suffer from fundamental limitations of the Bloom filter, resulting in slow build and query times, less-than-optimal space usage, and large numbers of false positives.\\n\\nResultsThis paper introduces Mantis, a space-efficient data structure that can be used to index thousands of rawread experiments and facilitate large-scale sequence searches on those experiments. Mantis uses counting quotient filters instead of Bloom filters, enabling rapid index builds and queries, small indexes, and exact results, i.e., no false positives or negatives. Furthermore, Mantis is also a colored de Bruijn graph representation, so it supports fast graph traversal and other topological analyses in addition to large-scale sequence-level searches.\\n\\nIn our performance evaluation, index construction with Mantis is 4.4x faster and yields a 20% smaller index than the state-of-the-art split sequence Bloom tree (SSBT). For queries, Mantis is 6x -108x faster than SSBT and has no false positives or false negatives. For example, Mantis was able to search for all 200,400 known human transcripts in an index of 2652 human blood, breast, and brain RNA-seq experiments in one hour and 22 minutes; SBT took close to 4 days and AllSomeSBT took about eight hours.\\n\\nMantis is written in C++11 and is available at https://github.com/splatlab/mantis.",

Key to this is the the accurate identification of exon-exon junctions from RNA sequenced (RNA-seq) reads. A number of RNA-seq aligners capable of splitting reads across these splice junctions (SJs) have been developed, however, it has been shown that while they correctly identify most genuine SJs available in a given sample, they also often produce large numbers of incorrect SJs. Herein we describe the extent of this problem using popular RNA-seq mapping tools, and present a new method, called Portcullis, to rapidly filter false SJs junctions from spliced alignments produced by any RNA-seq mapper capable of creating SAM/BAM files. We show that Portcullis distinguishes between genuine and false positive junctions to a high-degree of accuracy across different species, samples, expression levels, error profiles and read lengths. Portcullis makes efficient use of memory and threading and, to our knowledge, is currently the only SJ prediction tool that reliably scales for use with large RNAseq datasets and large highly fragmented genomes, whilst delivering highly accurate SJs.\\n\\nAvailabilityPortcullis is available under the GPLv3 license at: http://maplesond.github.io/portcullis/\\n\\nContactdaniel.mapleson@earlham.ac.uk",

    "abstract": "Emerging Linked-Read technologies (aka Read-Cloud or barcoded short-reads) have revived interest in standard short-read technology as a viable way to understand large-scale structure in genomes and metagenomes. Linked-Read technologies, such as the 10X Chromium system, use a microfluidic system and a set of specially designed 3 barcodes (aka UIDs) to tag short DNA reads which were originally sourced from the same long fragment of DNA; subsequently, these specially barcoded reads are sequenced on standard short read platforms. This approach results in interesting compromises. Each long fragment of DNA is covered only sparsely by short reads, no information about the relative ordering of reads from the same fragment is preserved, and typically each 3 barcode matches reads from 2-20 long fragments of DNA. However, compared to long read platforms like those produced by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore the cost per base to sequence is far lower, far less input DNA is required, and the per base error rate is that of Illumina short-reads.\\n\\nThe use of Linked-Reads presents a new set of algorithmic challenges. In this paper, we formally describe one particular issue common to all applications of Linked-Read technology: the deconvolution of reads with a single 3 barcode into clusters that correspond to a single long fragment of DNA. We introduce Minerva, A graph-based algorithm that approximately solves the barcode deconvolution problem for metagenomic data (where reference genomes may be incomplete or unavailable). Additionally, we develop two demonstrations where the deconvolution of barcoded reads improves downstream results: improving the specificity of taxonomic assignments, and by improving clustering of related sequences. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of barcode deconvolution in metagenomics.",

    "abstract": "Multi-omic studies promise the improved characterization of biological processes across molecular layers. However, methods for the unsupervised integration of the resulting heterogeneous datasets are lacking. We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), a computational method for discovering the principal sources of variation in multi-omic datasets. MOFA infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation, and the detection of outlier samples. We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex-vivo drug responses. MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used MOFA to analyse single-cell multiomics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The growing number of annotated biological sequences available makes it possible to learn genotype-phenotype relationships from data with increasingly high accuracy. When large quantities of labeled samples are available for training a model, convolutional neural networks can be used to predict the phenotype of unannotated sequences with good accuracy. Unfortunately, their performance with medium- or small-scale datasets is mitigated, which requires inventing new data-efficient approaches. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach between convolutional neural networks and kernel methods to model biological sequences. Our method enjoys the ability of convolutional neural networks to learn data representations that are adapted to a specific task, while the kernel point of view yields algorithms that perform significantly better when the amount of training data is small. We illustrate these advantages for transcription factor binding prediction and protein homology detection, and we demonstrate that our model is also simple to interpret, which is crucial for discovering predictive motifs in sequences.

    "abstract": "Large scale mutagenesis experiments are becoming possible owing to the advancement in the sequencing technologies and high throughput screening. Deep mutational scans perform exhaustive single-point muta-tions on a protein and probe their phenotypic effects. Performing a full scan with site-directed mutations of all the amino acid residues in a protein may not be practical, and may not even be required, especially if predictive computational models can be developed. Computational models are however naive to cellular response in the myriads of assay-conditions. In order to develop the realistic paradigm of assay context-aware predictive hybrid models, we combine minimal deep mutational studies with computational models and pre-dict the phenotypic outcomes quantitatively. Structural, sequence and co-evolutionary information along with partial deep mutational scan data was included to capture the phenotypic relevance of the mutations to the specific screening criterion. The model reliably predicts the fitness outcomes of hundreds of randomly selected amino acid mutations in {beta}-lactamase, when the phenotypic fitness data from as few as 15% of the full mutation is available. Interestingly, the predictive capabilities are better with a random set of mutations rather than with a systematic substitution of all amino acids to alanine, asparagine and histidine (ANH). The model can potentially be extended for predicting the phenotypic outcomes at other concentrations of the stressor by carefully analyzing the dose-response curves of a representative set of mutations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMutations are the minor changes in protein sequences, with incommensurately high consequences for their function. Many severe diseases can occur with simple single point mutations. An interesting way of studying these mutations is not to isolate the protein from its natural conditions, but rather study how the fitness of the cell improves or decreases in response to these mutations. Whether it is for understanding disease biology or for bio-engineering applications it is important to quantify the impact of mutations on the cellular fitness. An experimental paradigm has evolved which has improved the ability to sample several hundred thousands of mutation-fitness relations using high throughput screening. However, since these are very specialized experiments, the question is if the number of such experiments required can be minimized, by using computer models to complement the rest of the fitness predictions. In this work we introduce this new paradigm which uses computer model trained on a partial deep mutation scan data, to predict the fitness variations in a full mutations scan that could also be repeated under multiple experimental conditions like drug concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Research in the area of transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) often relies on computational models of current flow in the brain. Models are built based on the magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the human head to capture detailed individual anatomy. To simulate current flow on an individual, the subjects MRI is segmented, virtual electrodes are placed on this anatomical model, the volume is tessellated into a mesh, and a finite element model (FEM) is solved numerically to estimate the current flow. Various software tools are available for each step, as well as processing pipelines that connect these tools for automated or semi-automated processing. The goal of the present tool - ROAST - is to provide an end-to-end pipeline that can automatically process individual heads with realistic volumetric anatomy leveraging open-source software and custom scripts to improve segmentation and execute electrode placement. The electric field estimated with the open-source tools used by ROAST differ little from the results obtained with commercial meshing and FEM solving software. We also do not find large differences between the various automated segmentation methods used by ROAST and SimNIBS, a well-established open-source modeling pipeline. However, we do find large differences when volumetric segmentation are converted into surfaces that are used in SimNIBS to generate volumetric meshes. Evaluation on intracranial recordings from human subjects suggests that ROAST outperforms newer versions of SimNIBS in predicting field distribution and magnitudes, but that an older version of SimNIBS performs similarly. We hope that the detailed comparisons presented here of various choices in this modeling pipeline can provide guidance for future tool development. We release ROAST as an open-source, easy-to-install and fully-automated pipeline for individualized TES modeling at https://www.parralab.org/roast/.",

We establish a new Tool, Timer-of-cell-kinetics-and-activity (Tocky [toki], time in Japanese). Tocky uses the Fluorescent Timer protein, which spontaneously shifts its emission spectrum from blue-to-red, in combination with computer algorithms to reveal the dynamics of differentiation in vivo. Using a transcriptional target of T cell receptor (TCR)-signaling, we establish Nr4a3-Tocky to follow downstream effects of TCR signaling. Nr4a3-Tocky reveals the temporal sequence of events during regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation and shows that persistent TCR signals occur during Treg generation. Remarkably, antigen-specific T cells at the site of autoimmune inflammation also show persistent TCR signaling. In addition, by generating Foxp3-Tocky, we reveal the in vivo dynamics of demethylation of the Foxp3 gene. Thus, Tocky is a Tool for cell biologists to address previously inaccessible questions by directly revealing dynamic processes in vivo.\\n\\nSummaryThe authors establish a new Tool, Timer-of-cell-kinetics-and-activity (Tocky) revealing the temporal dynamics of cellular activation and differentiation in vivo.

However, only few studies have attempted to assess the underlying factors that explain this debt, and none has gone further to explore this issue from a biogeographical perspective. Here I examine how effects of species migration and persistence on the current climatic debt vary spatially in forest herbaceous communities throughout the French territory. I show that Mediterranean communities are responding to climate warming through both high species migration and persistence effects, while alpine forest is the only ecosystem where species migration overtakes species persistence mechanisms. Such an approach seems promising in assessing the underlying mechanisms of the biodiversity response to climate change locally, and it can be applied for conservation issues to assess biodiversity sensitivity and optimize its management.",

    "abstract": "Understanding selection on ecological interactions that take place in dispersal-limited communities is an important challenge for ecology and evolutionary biology. The problem is that local demographic stochasticity generates eco-evolutionary dynamics that are too complicated to make tractable analytical investigations. Here, we circumvent this problem by approximating the selection gradient on a quantitative trait that influences local community dynamics, assuming that such dynamics are deterministic with a stable fixed point, but incorporating the kin selection effects arising from demographic stochasticity. Our approximation reveals that selection depends on how an individual expressing a trait-change influences: (1) its own fitness and the fitness of its current relatives; and (2) the fitness of its downstream relatives through modifications of local ecological conditions (i.e., through ecological inheritance). Mathematically, the effects of ecological inheritance on selection are captured by dispersal-limited versions of press-perturbations of community ecology. We use our approximation to investigate the evolution of helping within- and harming between-species when these behaviours influence demography. We find helping evolves more readily when competition is for material resources rather than space because then, the costs of kin competition are paid by downstream relatives. Similarly, harming between species evolves when it alleviates downstream relatives from inter-specific competition. Beyond these examples, our approximation can help better understand the influence of ecological inheritance on a variety of eco-evolutionary dynamics, from plant-pollinator to predator-prey coevolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Eneolithic (~ 5,500 yrBP) site of Verteba Cave in Western Ukraine contains the largest collection of human skeletal remains associated with the archaeological Cucuteni-Tripolye Culture. Their subsistence economy is based largely on agro-pastoralism and had some of the largest and most dense settlement sites during the Middle Neolithic in all of Europe. To help understand the evolutionary history of the Tripolye people, we performed mtDNA analyses on ancient human remains excavated from several chambers within the cave.\\n\\nResultsBurials at Verteba Cave are largely commingled and secondary in nature. A total of 68 individual bone specimens were analyzed. Most of these specimens were found in association with well-defined Tripolye artifacts. We determined 28 mtDNA D-Loop (368 bp) sequences and defined 8 sequence types, belonging to haplogroups H, HV, W, K, and T. These results do not suggest continuity with local pre-Eneolithic peoples, but rather complete population replacement. We constructed maximum parsimonious networks from the data and generated population genetic statistics. Nucleotide diversity ({pi}) is low among all sequence types and our network analysis indicates highly similar mtDNA sequence types for samples in chamber G3. Using different sample sizes due to the uncertainly in number of individuals (11, 28, or 15), we found Tajimas D statistic to vary. When all sequence types are included (11 or 28), we do not find a trend for demographic expansion (negative but not significantly different from zero); however, when only samples from Site 7 (peak occupation) are included, we find a significantly negative value, indicative of demographic expansion.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results suggest individuals buried at Verteba Cave had overall low mtDNA diversity, most likely due to increased conflict among sedentary farmers and nomadic pastoralists to the East and North. Early Farmers tend to show demographic expansion. We find different signatures of demographic expansion for the Tripolye people that may be caused by existing population structure or the spatiotemporal nature of ancient data. Regardless, peoples of the Tripolye Culture are more closely related to early European farmers and lack genetic continuity with Mesolithic hunter-gatherers or pre-Eneolithic groups in Ukraine.",

We report here that a Helicobacter pylori cytoplasmic chemoreceptor, TlpD, is required for gland colonization in the stomach. tlpD mutants demonstrate gland colonization defects characterized by a reduction in the percent of glands colonized, but not in number of bacteria per gland. Consistent with TlpDs reported role in reactive oxygen species (ROS) avoidance, tlpD mutants showed hallmarks of exposure to large amounts of ROS. To assess the role of host-generated ROS in TlpD-dependent gland colonization, we utilized mice that lack either the ability to generate epithelial hydrogen peroxide or immune cell superoxide. tlpD gland colonization defects were rescued to wild-type H. pylori levels in both of these mutants. These results suggest that multiple types of innate immune generated ROS production limit gland colonization and that bacteria have evolved specific mechanisms to migrate through this gauntlet to establish in the glands.\\n\\nClassification: Biological sciences; microbiology\\n\\nSignificance statementMicrobial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract occurs at distinct sites within the tissue including glandular structures found in the stomach and intestine. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that glands supply niches that promote chronic microbial colonization, a process that is critical for symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria to maintain themselves. In this report, we show that host-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) constrain gland colonization by the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. A bacterial cytoplasmic chemoreceptor, TlpD, allows H. pylori to avoid ROS and enhances H. pyloris ability to colonize a broad swath of glands. We propose that hosts limit gland access and spread by producing ROS, and bacteria counter with chemotactic responses that allow navigation through this gauntlet.",

    "abstract": "As the spread of antibiotic resistance outstrips the introduction of new antibiotics, reusing existing antibiotics is increasingly important. One promising method is to combine antibiotics with synergistically acting adjuvants that inhibit resistance mechanisms, allowing drug killing. Here we use co-amoxiclav (a commonly used and clinically important drug combination of the {beta}-lactam antibiotic amoxicillin and the {beta}-lactamase inhibitor clavulanate) to ask whether treatment efficacy and resistance evolution can be decoupled via component dosing modifications.\\n\\nA simple mathematical model predicts that different ratios of these two drug components can produce distinct evolutionary responses despite similar initial levels of control. We test this hypothesis by selecting Escherichia coli with a plasmid encoded {beta}-lactamase (ESBL CTX-M-14), against different proportions of amoxicillin and clavulanate. Consistent with our theory, we found that while resistance evolved under all conditions, the component ratio influenced both the rate and mechanism of resistance evolution. Specifically, we found that the current clinical practice of high amoxicillin to clavulanate ratios resulted in the most rapid failure due to the evolution of gene dosing responses. Increased plasmid copy number allowed E. coli to increase {beta}-lactamase dosing and effectively titrate out the low quantities of clavulanate, restoring amoxicillin resistance. In contrast, we found high clavulanate ratios were more robust - plasmid copy number did not increase, although porin or efflux resistance mechanisms were found, as in all drug ratios. Our results indicate that by changing the ratio of adjuvant to antibiotic we can slow and steer the path of resistance evolution. We therefore suggest the use of increased clavulanate dosing regimens to slow the rate of resistance evolution.",

We investigated this possibility in a collision detecting neuron of the locust optic lobe that receives both feed-forward excitation and inhibition. We identified a small population of neurons mediating feed-forward inhibition, with wide visual receptive fields and whose responses depend both on the size and speed of moving stimuli. By studying responses to simulated objects approaching on a collision course, we determined that they jointly encode the angular size of expansion of the stimulus. Feed-forward excitation on the other hand encodes a function of the angular velocity of expansion and the targeted collision detecting neuron combines these two variables non-linearly in its firing output. Thus, feed-forward inhibition actively contributes to the detailed firing rate time course of this collision detecting neuron, a feature critical to the appropriate execution of escape behaviors. These results suggest that feed-forward inhibition could similarly convey time-varying stimulus information in other neuronal circuits.",

    "abstract": "Reverse replay of hippocampal place cells occurs frequently at rewarded locations, suggesting its contribution to goal-directed pathway learning. Symmetric spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) in CA3 likely potentiates recurrent synapses for both forward (start to goal) and reverse (goal to start) replays during sequential activation of place cells. However, how reverse replay selectively strengthens forward pathway is unclear. Here, we show computationally that firing sequences bias synaptic transmissions to the opposite direction of propagation under symmetric, but not asymmetric, STDP in the co-presence of short-term synaptic plasticity. We demonstrate that a significant bias can be created in biologically realistic simulation settings, and that this bias enables reverse replay to enhance goal-directed spatial memory on a T-maze. Our model for the first time provides the mechanistic account for the way reverse replay contributes to hippocampal sequence learning for reward-seeking spatial navigation.",

Here, we describe a novel resting-state network based on the delayed connectivity between the brain and the slow electrical rhythm (0.05 Hz) generated in the stomach. The gastric network cuts across classical resting-state networks with little overlap with autonomic regulation areas. This network is composed of regions with convergent functional properties involved in mapping bodily space through touch, action or vision, as well as mapping external space in bodily coordinates. The network is characterized by a precise temporal sequence of activations within a gastric cycle, beginning with somato-motor cortices and ending with the extrastriate body area and dorsal precuneus. Our results demonstrate that canonical resting-state networks based on instantaneous connectivity represent only one of the possible partitions of the brain into coherent networks based on temporal dynamics.",

Here we describe an approach based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) that finds the optimal transform to apply to both stimulus and response to reveal correlations between the two. Compared to prior methods based on forward or backward models for stimulus-response mapping, CCA finds significantly higher correlation scores, thus providing increased sensitivity to relatively small effects, and supports classifier schemes that yield higher classification scores. CCA strips the brain response of variance unrelated to the stimulus, and the stimulus representation of variance that does not affect the response, and thus improves our observation of the relation between stimulus and response.",

In this paper we explore mathematically a simple version of unstable tumor progression using the formalism of Adaptive Dynamics (AD) where selection and mutation are explicitly coupled.

To study telomere elongation in vivo we have established a live-cell imaging assay to track individual telomerase RNPs in HeLa cells. Using this assay and the drug imetelstat, which is a competitive inhibitor of telomeric DNA binding, we demonstrate that stable association of telomerase with the single-stranded overhang of the chromosome end requires telomerase-DNA base-pairing. Furthermore, we show that telomerase processivity contributes to telomere elongation in vivo.

Our in-house HCV-Ab test had a positive predictive value of 87% when compared to repeat HCV-Ab testing in a regional reference laboratory, highlighting the potential for false positives to arise based on a single round of antibody-based screening. Of those confirmed Ab-positive, 70% were HCV RNA positive. HCV-Ag screening performed well, with 100% positive predictive value compared to detection of HCV RNA. There was a strong correlation between quantitative HCV-Ag and HCV RNA viral load (p<0.0001). Among the 359 cases of infection, the median age was 37 years, 85% were male, and 36% were in prison. Among 250 infections for which genotype was available, HCV genotype-1 (n=110) and genotype-3 (n=111) accounted for the majority. 117/359 (33%) attended a clinic appointment and 48 (13%) had curative treatment defined as sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12).\\n\\nConclusionsHCV-Ab tests should be interpreted with caution as an indicator of population prevalence of HCV infection, both as a result of the detection of individuals who have cleared infection and due to false positive test results. We demonstrate that active HCV infection is over-represented among men and in the prison population. A minority of patients with a diagnosis of HCV infection access clinical care and therapy; enhanced efforts are required to target diagnosis and providing linkage to clinical care within high risk populations.\\n\\nABBREVIATIONS",

To our surprise, we found clear evidence of multiple paleo-polyploidies, with one being recent (~ 13-15 millions of years ago or Mya), another one occurring about ~125-142 Mya, during the evolution of lycophytes, and at least 2 or 3 events being more ancient. Besides, comparison of reconstructed ancestral genomes of lycophytes and angiosperms shows that lycophytes were likely much more affected by paleo-polyploidies than seed plants.

    "abstract": "Metabolic homeostasis is sustained by complex biological networks responding to nutrient availability. Disruption of this equilibrium involving intricate interactions between genetic and environmental factors can lead to metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. To identify the genetic factors controlling metabolism, we applied a quantitative genetic strategy using a Caenorhabditis elegans population consisting of 199 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) originally derived from crossing parental strains Bristol N2 and Hawaii CB4856. We focused on the genetic factors that control metabolite levels and measured fatty acid (FA) and amino acid (AA) composition in the 199 RILs using targeted metabolomics. For both FA and AA profiles, we observed large variation in metabolite levels with 32-82% heritability between the RILs. We performed metabolite-metabolite correlation analysis and detected strongly co-correlated metabolite clusters. To identify natural genetic variants responsible for the observed metabolite variations, we performed QTL mapping and detected 36 significant metabolite QTL (mQTL). We focused on the mQTL that displayed high significant linkage and heritability, including an mQTL for the FA C14:1 on chromosome I, and another mQTL for the FA C18:2 on chromosome IV. Using introgression lines (ILs) we were able to narrow down both mQTL to a 1.4 Mbp and a 3.6 Mbp region, respectively. Overall, this systems approach provides us with a powerful platform to study the genetic basis of C. elegans metabolism. It also allows us to investigate additional interventions, such as nutrients and stresses that maintain or disturb the regulatory network controlling metabolic homeostasis, and identify gene-by-environment interactions.",

However, most widely used RNA-seq protocols fail to provide crucial information regarding transcription start sites. Here we present a protocol, Tn5Prime, that takes advantage of the Tn5 transposase based Smartseq2 protocol to create RNA-seq libraries that capture the 5 end of transcripts. The Tn5Prime method dramatically streamlines the 5 capture process and is both cost effective and reliable. By applying Tn5Prime to bulk RNA and single cell samples we were able to define transcription start sites as well as quantify transcriptomes at high accuracy and reproducibility. Additionally, similar to 3 end based high-throughput methods like Drop-Seq and 10X Genomics Chromium, the 5 capture Tn5Prime method allows the introduction of cellular identifiers during reverse transcription, simplifying the analysis of large numbers of single cells. In contrast to 3 end based methods, Tn5Prime also enables the assembly of the variable 5 ends of antibody sequences present in single B-cell data. Therefore, Tn5Prime presents a robust tool for both basic and applied research into the adaptive immune system and beyond.",

At the core of the transmission cycle lies Plasmodium sexual reproduction leading to zygote formation and mosquito midgut colonisation by ookinetes. Whilst in vitro ookinete culture from the murine and avian malaria parasites, Plasmodium berghei and P. gallinaceum, has greatly increased our knowledge of transmission biology; efforts to mimic the process in the human parasite P. falciparum have, to date, had only limited success. Using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry with antibodies specific to the male gametocyte and developing ookinetes, we sought to evaluate P. falciparum ookinete production using previously published in vitro protocols. We then compared in vitro versus in vivo ookinete production in both P. falciparum and P. berghei parasites, exploring potential barriers to complete development. Finally, we sought to test a wide range of literature-led culture conditions towards further optimisation of in vitro P. falciparum ookinete production. Despite extensive testing, our efforts to replicate published methods did not produce appreciable quantities of fully formed P. falciparum ookinetes in vitro. In parallel, however, gametocyte cultures that failed to differentiate fully in vitro successfully developed into ookinetes in vivo with an efficiency approximating that of P. berghei. Flow cytometry analysis showed that this disparity likely lies with the poor fertilization of P. falciparum gametes in vitro. Attempts to improve gametocyte fertility or define conditions more permissive to fertilisation/ookinete survival in vitro were also unsuccessful. Current in vitro conditions for P. falciparum ookinete production are not optimal for gamete fertilisation either due to the lack of parasite-species-specific mosquito factors missing from in vitro culture, or non-permissive cues contaminating culture preparations.",

    "abstract": "Training and immobilization are powerful drivers of use-dependent plasticity in human primary motor hand area (M1HAND). Here we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to clarify how training and immobilisation of a single finger interact within M1HAND. Healthy volunteers trained to track a moving target with a finger for one week. The tracking skill acquired with the trained finger was transferred to a non-trained finger of the same hand. The cortical representations of the trained and non-trained finger muscle converged in proportion with skill transfer. Finger immobilisation alone attenuated the corticomotor representation and pre-existing tracking skill of the immobilized finger. The detrimental effects of finger immobilization were blocked by concurrent training of the non-immobilized finger. Conversely, immobilization of the non-trained fingers accelerated learning during the first two days of training. The results provide novel insight into use-dependent cortical plasticity, revealing synergistic rather than competitive interaction patterns within M1HAND.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between sensorimotor variability and falls in elderly has not been well investigated. We designed and used a motor task having shared biomechanics of walking and obstacle negotiation to quantify sensorimotor variability related to locomotion across age. We also applied sensory psychophysics to pinpoint specific sensory systems associated with sensorimotor variability. We found that sensorimotor variability in foot placement increases continuously with age. We further showed that increased sensory variability, specifically increased proprioceptive variability, the vital cause of more variable foot placement in the elderly. Notably, elderly participants relied more on the vision to judge their own foots height compared to the young, suggesting a shift in multisensory integration strategy to compensate for degenerated proprioception. We further modelled the probability of tripping-over based on the relationship between sensorimotor variability and age and found a good correspondence between model prediction and community-based data. We revealed increased sensorimotor variability, modulated by sensation precision, a potentially vital mechanism of raised tripping-over and thus fall events in the elderly. Therefore, our tasks, which quantify sensorimotor variability, can be used for trip-over probability assessment and, with adjustments, potentially applied as a training program to mitigate trip-over risk.",

Recent studies that show theta waves propagating across the hippocampus suggest that turbulence is a natural description for collective neural activity. We formulate the fundamental principles of a turbulence model and demonstrate turbulent behavior by analyzing rat hippocampal LFP traces. LFP spectra and bispectra exhibit fundamental turbulent properties: weak nonlinear coupling, energy cascade, and stationary spectra of the Kolmogorov-Zakharov type (power-law). Weak turbulence holds the promise of quantitative physical models of hippocampal dynamics, in the service of understanding the mechanisms of multi-scale integration of brain activity to cognition.",

    "abstract": "Despite large experimental and computational efforts aiming to dissect the mechanisms underlying disease risk, mapping cis-regulatory elements to target genes remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a matrix factorization framework to integrate physical and functional interaction data of genomic segments. The framework was used to predict a regulatory network of chromatin interaction edges linking more than 20,000 promoters and 1.8 million enhancers across 127 human reference epigenomes, including edges that are present in any of the input datasets. Our network integrates functional evidence of correlated activity patterns from epigenomic data and physical evidence of chromatin interactions. An important contribution of this work is the representation of heterogeneous data with different qualities as networks. We show that the unbiased integration of independent data sources suggestive of regulatory interactions produces meaningful associations supported by existing functional and physical evidence, correlating with expected independent biological features.",

    "abstract": "Cote dIvoire has one of the largest HIV epidemics in West Africa with around half million people living with HIV. Key populations like gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are often disproportionately burdened with HIV due to specific acquisition and transmission risks. Quantifying the MSM population sizes at subnational level is critical to improving the HIV prevention interventions. While survey-based direct estimates of MSM numbers are available at a few urban centers in C{circumflex}ote dIvoire, no data on MSM population size exists at other areas without any community infrastructure to facilitate sufficient access to the MSM community. We use this limited data in a Bayesian regression setup to produce first empirically calculated estimates of the numbers of MSM in all areas of C{circumflex}ote dIvoire prioritized in the HIV response. Our hierarchical model imputes missing covariates using geospatial information and allows for proper uncertainty quantification leading to meaningful confidence bounds for the predicted MSM population size estimates. The intended impact of this process is to increase uptake and use of high quality, comprehensive epidemiologic and interventional data in program planning. These estimates will help design future surveys and support the planning of the scale and content of HIV prevention and treatment programs for MSM in C{circumflex}ote dIvoire.",

    "abstract": "The spread of antibiotic resistance, a major threat to human health, is poorly understood. Empirically, resistant strains gradually increase in prevalence as antibiotic consumption increases, but current mathematical models predict a sharp transition between full sensitivity and full resistance. In other words, we do not understand what drives persistent coexistence between resistant and sensitive strains of disease-causing bacteria in host populations. Without knowing what drives patterns of resistance, we cannot accurately predict the impact of potential strategies for managing resistance. Here, we show that within-host dynamics--bacterial growth, strain competition, and host immune responses--promote frequency-dependent selection for resistant strains, explaining patterns of resistance at the population level. By capturing these processes in a parsimonious mathematical framework, we resolve a long-standing conflict between theory and observation. Our models capture widespread coexistence for multiple bacteria-drug combinations across 30 European countries and explain associations between carriage prevalence and resistance prevalence among bacterial subtypes. A mechanistic understanding of resistance evolution is needed to accurately forecast the impact and effectiveness of resistance-management strategies.",

In this study, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis were randomly mutated, and then were positively and negatively selected for binding cancer and normal cells. With repetitive mutation and selection both bacteria successfully evolved to increase affinity to the pancreatic cancer cell line (Mia PaCa-2) but not normal cells (HPDE: immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line). The mutant E. coli and B. subtilis strains could bind to Mia PaCa-2 cells about 10 and 25 times more than to HPDE cells. The selected E. coli, strain had mutations in biofilm-related genes and the regulatory region for a type I pilus gene. Consistent with type I pili involvement, mannose could inhibit the binding to cells. However, the results suggest that weak but specific binding is involved in the initial step of adhesion. To kill Mia PaCa-2 cells, hemolysin was expressed in the mutant strain. The hemolysin that was released from the mutant strain could kill Mia PaCa-2 cells. This type of mutation/selection strategy may be applicable to other combinations of cancer cells and bacterial species.",

    "abstract": "During the first weeks of life, microbial colonization of the gut impacts human immune system maturation and other developmental processes. In premature infants, aberrant colonization has been implicated in the onset of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening intestinal disease. To study the premature infant gut colonization process, genome-resolved metagenomics was conducted on 343 fecal samples collected during the first three months of life from 35 premature infants housed in a neonatal intensive care unit, 14 of which developed NEC, and metaproteomic measurements were made on 87 samples. Microbial community composition and proteomic profiles remained relatively stable on the time scale of a week, but the proteome was more variable. Although genetically similar organisms colonized many infants, most infants were colonized by distinct strains with metabolic profiles that could be distinguished using metaproteomics. Microbiome composition correlated with infant, antibiotics administration, and NEC diagnosis. Communities were found to cluster into seven primary types, and community type switched within infants, sometimes multiple times. Interestingly, some communities sampled from the same infant at subsequent time points clustered with those of other infants. In some cases, switches preceded onset of NEC; however, no species or community type could account for NEC across the majority of infants. In addition to a correlation of protein abundances with organism replication rates, we found that organism proteomes correlated with overall community composition. Thus, this genome-resolved proteomics study demonstrates that the contributions of individual organisms to microbiome development depend on microbial community context.\\n\\nImportance\\n\\nHumans are colonized by microbes at birth, a process that is important to health and development. However, much remains to be known about the fine-scale microbial dynamics that occur during the colonization period. We conducted a genome-resolved study of microbial community composition, replication rates, and proteomes during the first three months of life of both healthy and sick premature infants. Infants were found to be colonized by similar microbes, but each underwent a distinct colonization trajectory.\\n\\nInterestingly, related microbes colonizing different infants were found to have distinct proteomes, indicating that microbiome function is not only driven by which organisms are present, but also largely depends on microbial responses to the unique set of physiological conditions in the infant gut.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities within the soil of Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands drive biogeochemical cycles and provide several other ecosystems services. However, there exists a lack of understanding of how microbial communities respond to nutrient gradients and human activity in these systems. This research sought to address the lack of understanding through exploration of relationships between nutrient gradients, microbial community diversity, and microbial networks. Significant differences in microbial community structure were found among coastal wetlands within the western basin of Lake Erie and all other wetlands studied (three regions within Saginaw Bay and one region in the Beaver Archipelago). These diversity differences coincided with higher nutrient levels within the Lake Erie region. Site-to-site variability also existed within the majority of the regions studied, suggesting site-scale heterogeneity may impact microbial community structure. Several subnetworks of microbial communities and individual community members were related to chemical gradients among wetland regions, revealing several candidate indicator communities and taxa which may be useful for Great Lakes coastal wetland management. This research provides an initial characterization of microbial communities among Great Lakes coastal wetlands and demonstrates that microbial communities could be negatively impacted by anthropogenic activities.",

    "abstract": "HIV transmission networks are highly clustered, and accurate identification of these clusters is essential for effective targeting of public health interventions. This clustering affects the transmission dynamics of the HIV epidemic, which affects the pathogen phylogenies reconstructed from patient samples. We present a new method for identifying transmission clusters by detecting the changes in transmission rate provoked by the introduction of the epidemic into a new cluster. The method employs a multi-state birth-death (MSBD) model where each state represents a cluster. Transmission rates in each cluster decrease exponentially over time, simulating susceptible depletion in the cluster. This model is fitted to the pathogen phylogeny using a Maximum Likelihood approach. Using simulated datasets we show that the MSBD method is able to reliably infer both the cluster repartition and the transmission parameters from a pathogen phylogeny. In contrast to existing cutpoint-based methods for cluster identification, which are dependent on a parameter set by the user, the MSBD method is consistently reliable. It also performs better on phylogenies containing nested clusters. We present an application of our method to the inference of transmission clusters using sequences obtained from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. The MSBD method is available as an R package.",
