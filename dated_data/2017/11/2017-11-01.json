    "abstract": "FGIN-1-27 is an agonist at the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a cholesterol transporter that is associated with neurosteroidogenesis. This protein has been identified as a peripheral binding site for benzodiazepines; in anamniotes, however, a second TSPO isoform that is absent in amniotes has been implicated in erythropoiesis. Functional conservation of the central benzodiazepine-binding site located in the GABAA receptors has been demonstrated in anamniotes and amniotes alike; however, it was not previously demonstrated for TSPO. The present investigation explored the behavioral effects of FGIN-1-27 on an anxiety test in zebrafish (Danio rerio, Family: Cyprinide) and on a mixed anxiety/panic test on wall lizards (Tropidurus oreadicus, Family: Tropiduridae). Results showed that FGIN-1-27 reduced anxiety-like behavior in the zebrafish light/dark preference test similar to diazepam, but with fewer sedative effects. Similarly, FGIN-1-27 also reduced anxiety- and fear-like behaviors in the defense test battery in wall lizards, again producing fewer sedative-like effects than diazepam; the benzodiazepine was also unable to reduce fear-like behaviors in this species. These results A) underline the functional conservation of TSPO in defensive behavior in anamniotes; B) strengthen the proposal of using anamniote behavior as models in behavioral pharmacology; and C) suggest TSPO/neurosteroidogenesis as a target in treating anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "1The synaptic connectivity of cortex is plastic, with experience shaping the ongoing interactions between neurons. Theoretical studies of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have focused on either just pairs of neurons or large-scale simulations where analytic insight is lacking. A simple account for how fast spike time correlations affect both micro- and macroscopic network structure remains lacking. We develop a low-dimensional mean field theory showing how STDP gives rise to strongly coupled assemblies of neurons with shared stimulus preferences, with the connectivity actively reinforced by spike train correlations during spontaneous dynamics. Furthermore, the stimulus coding by cell assemblies is actively maintained by these internally generated spiking correlations, suggesting a new role for noise correlations in neural coding. Assembly formation has been often associated with firing rate-based plasticity schemes; our theory provides an alternative and complementary framework, where temporal correlations and STDP form and actively maintain learned structure in cortical networks.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary transitions between fresh and salt water happen infrequently among bacterioplankton. Within the ubiquitous and highly abundant heterotrophic Alphaproteobacteria order Pelagibacterales (SAR11), most members live in marine habitats, but the LD12 subclade has evolved as a unique freshwater lineage. LD12 cells occur as some of the most dominant freshwater bacterioplankton, yet this group has remained elusive to cultivation, hampering a more thorough understanding of its biology. Here, we report the first successful isolation of an LD12 representative, strain LSUCC0530, using high throughput dilution to extinction cultivation methods, and its complete genome sequence. Growth experiments corroborate ecological data suggesting active populations of LD12 in brackish water up to salinities of ~5. LSUCC0530 has the smallest closed genome thus far reported for a SAR11 strain (1.16 Mbp). The genome affirms many previous metabolic predictions from cultivation-independent analyses, like a complete Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas glycolysis pathway, but also provides novel insights, such as the first isocitrate dehydrogenase in LD12, a likely homologous recombination of malate synthase from outside of the SAR11 clade, and analogous substitutions of ion transporters with others that occur throughout the rest of the SAR11 clade. Growth data support metagenomic recruitment results suggesting temperature-based ecotype diversification within LD12. Key gene losses for osmolyte uptake provide a succinct hypothesis for the evolutionary transition of LD12 from salt to fresh water. For strain LSUCC0530, we propose the provisional nomenclature Candidatus Fonsibacter ubiquis.",

    "abstract": "Ancient DNA studies have established that European Neolithic populations were descended from Anatolian migrants who received a limited amount of admixture from resident hunter-gatherers. Many open questions remain, however, about the spatial and temporal dynamics of population interactions and admixture during the Neolithic period. Using the highest-resolution genome-wide ancient DNA data set assembled to date--a total of 177 samples, 127 newly reported here, from the Neolithic and Chalcolithic of Hungary (6000-2900 BCE, n = 98), Germany (5500-3000 BCE, n = 42), and Spain (5500-2200 BCE, n = 37)--we investigate the population dynamics of Neolithization across Europe. We find that genetic diversity was shaped predominantly by local processes, with varied sources and proportions of hunter-gatherer ances try among the three regions and through time. Admixture between groups with different ancestry profiles was pervasive and resulted in observable population transformation across almost all cultural transitions. Our results shed new light on the ways that gene flow reshaped European populations throughout the Neolithic period and demonstrate the potential of time-series-based sampling and modeling approaches to elucidate multiple dimensions of historical population interactions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMost amino acids are encoded by multiple synonymous codons. However synonymous codons are not used equally and this biased codon use varies between different organisms. It has previously been shown that both selection acting to increase codon translational efficiency and selection acting to decrease codon biosynthetic cost contribute to differences in codon bias. However, it is unknown how these two factors interact or how they affect molecular sequence evolution.\\n\\nResultsThrough analysis of 1,320 bacterial genomes we show that bacterial genes are subject to multi-objective selection-driven optimisation of codon use. Here, selection acts to simultaneously decrease transcript biosynthetic cost and increase transcript translational efficiency, with highly expressed genes under the greatest selection. This optimisation is not simply a consequence of the more translationally efficient codons being less expensive to synthesise. Instead, we show that tRNA gene copy number alters the cost-efficiency trade-off of synonymous codons such that for many species such that selection acting on transcript biosynthetic cost and translational efficiency act in opposition. Finally, we show that genes highly optimised to reduce cost and increase efficiency show reduced rates of synonymous and non-synonymous mutation.\\n\\nConclusionsThis analysis provides a simple mechanistic explanation for variation in evolutionary rate between genes that depends on selection-driven cost-efficiency optimisation of the transcript. These findings reveal how optimisation of resource allocation to mRNA synthesis is a critical factor that determines both the evolution and composition of genes.",

    "abstract": "The metazoan genome is compartmentalized in megabase-scale areas of highly interacting chromatin known as topologically associating domains (TADs), typically identified by computational analyses of Hi-C sequencing data. TADs are demarcated by boundaries that are largely conserved across cell types and even across species, although, increasing evidence suggests that the seemingly invariant TAD boundaries may exhibit plasticity and their insulating strength can vary. However, a genome-wide characterization of TAD boundary strength in mammals is still lacking. A systematic classification and characterization of TAD boundaries may generate new insights into their function. In this study, we first use fused two-dimensional lasso as a machine learning method to improve Hi-C contact matrix reproducibility, and, subsequently, we categorize TAD boundaries based on their insulation score. We demonstrate that higher TAD boundary insulation scores are associated with elevated CTCF levels and that they may differ across cell types. Intriguingly, we observe that super-enhancer elements are preferentially insulated by strong boundaries, i.e. boundaries of higher insulation score. Furthermore, we perform a pan-cancer analysis to demonstrate that strong TAD boundaries and super-enhancer elements are frequently co-duplicated in cancer patients. Taken together, our findings suggest that super-enhancers insulated by strong TAD boundaries may be exploited, as a functional unit, by cancer cells to promote oncogenesis.",

In C. elegans, locomotor wave generation has been poorly understood; in particular, it is unclear where in the circuit rhythms are generated, and whether there exists more than one such generator. We used optogenetic and ablation experiments to probe the nature of rhythm generation in the locomotor circuit. We found that multiple sections of forward locomotor circuitry are capable of independently generating rhythms. By perturbing different components of the motor circuit, we localize the source of secondary rhythms to cholinergic motor neurons in the midbody. Using rhythmic optogenetic perturbation we demonstrate bidirectional entrainment of oscillations between different body regions. These results show that, as in many other vertebrates and invertebrates, the C. elegans motor circuit contains multiple oscillators that coordinate activity to generate behavior.",

TRIBE expresses an RBP of interest fused to the catalytic domain (cd) of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR and performs Adenosine-to-Inosine editing on RNA targets of the RBP. However, target identification is limited by the low editing efficiency of the ADARcd. Here we describe HyperTRIBE, which carries a previously characterized hyperactive mutation (E488Q) of the ADARcd. HyperTRIBE identifies dramatically more editing sites, many of which are also edited by TRIBE but at a much lower editing frequency. HyperTRIBE therefore more faithfully recapitulates the known binding specificity of its RBP than TRIBE. In addition, separating RNA binding from the enhanced editing activity of the HyperTRIBE ADAR catalytic domain sheds light on the mechanism of ADARcd editing as well as the enhanced activity of the HyperADARcd.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that neurons in sensorimotor circuits involved in perceptual decision-making also play a role in decision confidence. In these studies, confidence is often considered to be an optimal readout of the probability that a decision is correct. However, the information leading to decision accuracy and the report of confidence often co-varied, leaving open the possibility that there are actually two dissociable signal types in the brain: signals that correlate with decision accuracy (optimal confidence) and signals that correlate with subjects behavioral reports of confidence (subjective confidence). We recorded neuronal activity from a sensorimotor decision area, the superior colliculus (SC) of monkeys, while they performed two different tasks. In our first task, decision accuracy and confidence co-varied, as in previous studies. In our second task, we implemented a novel motion discrimination task with stimuli that were matched for decision accuracy but produced different levels of confidence as reflected by behavioral reports. We used a multivariate decoder to predict monkeys choices from neuronal population activity. As in previous studies on perceptual decision-making mechanisms, we found that neuronal decoding performance increased as decision accuracy increased. However, when decision accuracy was matched, performance of the decoder was similar between high and low subjective confidence conditions. These results show that the SC likely signals optimal decision confidence similar to previously reported cortical mechanisms, but is unlikely to play a critical role in subjective confidence. The results also motivate future investigations to determine where in the brain signals related to subjective confidence reside.\\n\\nSignificance StatementConfidence is thought to reflect the rational or optimal belief concerning ones choice accuracy. Here, we introduce a novel version of the dot-motion discrimination task with stimulus conditions that produce similar accuracy but different subjective behavioral reports of confidence. We decoded decision performance of this task from neuronal signals in the superior colliculus (SC), a subcortical region involved in decision-making. We found that SC activity signaled a perceptual decision for visual stimuli, with the strength of this activity reflecting decision accuracy, but not the subjective level of confidence as reflected by behavioral reports. These results demonstrate an important role for the SC in perceptual decision-making and challenge current ideas about how to measure subjective confidence in monkeys and humans.",

This study examined fundamental aspects of speech motor control in participants with the 16p11.2 deletion. To assess capacity for control of voice, we examined how accurately and quickly subjects changed the pitch of their voice within a trial to correct for a transient perturbation of the pitch of their auditory feedback. When compared to sibling controls, 16p11.2 deletion carriers show an over-exaggerated pitch compensation response to unpredictable mid-vocalization pitch perturbations. We also examined sensorimotor adaptation of speech by assessing how subjects learned to adapt their sustained productions of formants (speech spectral peak frequencies important for vowel identity), in response to consistent changes in their auditory feedback during vowel production. Deletion carriers show reduced sensorimotor adaptation to sustained vowel identity changes in auditory feedback. These results together suggest that 16p11.2 deletion carriers have fundamental impairments in the basic mechanisms of speech motor control and these impairments may partially explain the deficits in speech and language in these individuals.",

We applied this framework to four proteins corresponding to six human genes: UBE2I (encoding SUMO E2 conjugase), SUMO1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier), TPK1 (thiamin pyrophosphokinase), and CALM1/2/3 (three genes encoding the protein calmodulin). The resulting maps recapitulate known protein features, and confidently identify pathogenic variation. Assays potentially amenable to deep mutational scanning are already available for 57% of human disease genes, suggesting that DMS could ultimately map functional variation for all human disease genes.",

    "abstract": "Humans and other group-living animals tend to distribute their social effort disproportionately. Individuals predominantly interact with a small number of close companions while maintaining weaker social bonds with less familiar group members. By incorporating this behaviour into a mathematical model we find that a single parameter, which we refer to as social fluidity, controls the rate of social mixing within the group. We compare the social fluidity of 13 species by applying the model to empirical human and animal social interaction data. To investigate how social behavior influences the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak we derive an analytical expression of the relationship between social fluidity and the basic reproductive number of an infectious disease. For highly fluid social behaviour disease transmission is revealed to be density-dependent. For species that form more stable social bonds, the model describes frequency-dependent transmission that is sensitive to changes in social fluidity.",

    "abstract": "Drug toxicity is a major source of attrition in drug discovery and development. Pharmaceutical companies routinely use preclinical data to predict clinical outcomes and continue to invest in new assays to improve predictions. However, there are many open questions about how to make the best use of available data, combine diverse data, quantify risk, and communicate risk and uncertainty to enable good decisions. The costs of suboptimal decisions are clear: resources are wasted and patients may be put at risk. We argue that Bayesian methods provide answers to all of these problems and use hERG-mediated QT prolongation as a case study. Benefits of Bayesian machine learning models include intuitive probabilistic statements of risk that incorporate all sources of uncertainty, the option to include diverse data and external information, and visualisations that have a clear link between the output from a statistical model and what this means for risk. Furthermore, Bayesian methods are easy to use with modern software, making their adoption for safety screening straightforward. We include R and Python code to encourage the adoption of these methods.",

    "abstract": "The competent state is a developmentally distinct phase, in which bacteria are able to take up and integrate exogenous DNA into their genome. Bacillus subtilis is one of the naturally competent bacterial species and the domesticated laboratory strain 168 is easily transformable. In this study, we report a reduced transformation frequency of B. subtilis mutants lacking functional and structural flagellar components. This includes hag, the gene encoding the flagellin protein forming the filament of the flagellum. We confirm that the observed decrease of the transformation frequency is due to reduced expression of competence genes, particularly of the main competence regulator comK. The impaired competence is due to an increase in the phosphorylated form of the response regulator DegU, which is involved in regulation of both flagellar motility and competence. Altogether, our study identified a close link between motility and natural competence in B. subtilis suggesting that hindrance in motility has great impact on differentiation of this bacterium not restricted only to the transition towards sessile growth stage.\\n\\nOriginality-Significance statementUnderstanding how versatile bacterial phenotypes influence each other is important for our basic understanding of microbial ecology.

    "abstract": "A typical use case of ontologies is the calculation of similarity scores between items that are annotated with classes of the ontology. For example, in differential diagnostics and disease gene prioritisation, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is often used to compare a query phenotype profile against gold-standard phenotype profiles of diseases or genes. The latter have long been constructed as flat lists of ontology classes, which, as we show in this work, can be improved by exploiting existing structure and information in annotation datasets or full text disease descriptions.\\n\\nWe derive a study-wise annotation model of diseases and genes and show that this can improve the performance of semantic similarity measures. Inferred weights of individual annotations are one reason for this improvement, but more importantly using the study-wise structure further boosts the results of the algorithms according to precision-recall analyses. We test the study-wise annotation model for diseases annotated with classes from the HPO and for genes annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) classes. We incorporate this annotation model into similarity algorithms and show how this leads to improved performance.\\n\\nThis work adds weight to the need for enhancing simple list-based representations of disease or gene annotations. We show how study-wise annotations can be automatically derived from full text summaries of disease descriptions and from the annotation data provided by the GO Consortium and how semantic similarity measure can utilise this extended annotation model.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a cytoplasmic HDAC isoform able to remove acetyl groups from cellular substrates such as -tubulin. In addition to the two deacetylase domains, HDAC6 has a C-terminal zinc-finger ubiquitin (Ub)-binding domain (ZnF-UBP) able to recognize free Ub. HDAC6-Ub interaction is thought to function in regulating the elimination of misfolded proteins during stress response through the aggresome pathway. Small molecules inhibiting deacetylation by HDAC6 were shown to reduce aggresomes, but the interplay between HDAC6 catalytic activity and Ub-binding function is not fully understood. Here we describe two methods to measure the HDAC6-Ub interaction in vitro using full-length HDAC6. Both methods were effective for screening inhibitors of the HDAC6-Ub protein-protein interaction independently of the catalytic activity. Our results suggest a potential role for the HDAC6 deacetylase domains in modulating HDAC6-Ub interaction. This new aspect of HDAC6 regulation can be targeted to address the roles of HDAC6-Ub interaction in normal and disease conditions.",

To assess brain-wide transcriptional diversity, we sequenced the transcriptomes of the largest collection of genetically and anatomically identified neuronal classes. Using improved expression metrics that distinguish information content from signal-to-noise-ratio, we found that homeobox transcription factors contain the highest information about cell types and have the lowest noise. Genes that contribute the most to neuronal diversity tend to be long and enriched in factors specifically involved in neuronal function. Genome accessibility measurements reveal that long genes have more candidate regulatory elements arrayed in more distinct patterns. These elements frequently overlap interspersed repeats (mobile elements) and the pattern of repeats is predictive of gene expression. New regulatory sites resulting from elongation of neuronal genes by mobile elements may be an evolutionary force enhancing nervous system complexity.",

We functionally validated our RNA-seq findings with a HIF-1 transcription factor activity reporter line and pharmaceutical inhibition of HIF-1 in mammosphere and organoid formation assays.\\n\\nResults2.5M cadmium reduced primary and secondary mammosphere formation and branching structure organoid formation rates by 33%, 40%, and 83%, respectively. Despite no changes in mammosphere formation, 0.25M cadmium treatment inhibited branching organoid formation in hydrogels by 68%. RNA-seq revealed that cadmium treatment downregulated genes associated with extracellular matrix formation and EMT, while upregulating genes associated with metal response including metallothioneins and zinc transporters. In the RNA-seq data, cadmium treatment also downregulated HIF-1 target genes including LOXL2, ZEB1, and VIM. Cadmium treatment significantly inhibited HIF-1 activity in a luciferase assay, and the HIF-1 inhibitor acriflavine ablated mammosphere and organoid formation.\\n\\nDiscussionThese findings show that cadmium, at doses relevant to human exposure, inhibited human mammary gland development, potentially through disruption of HIF-1 activity. These findings do not support cadmium being a breast cancer initiator via induction of stem cell proliferation, but instead implicate cadmium as an inhibitor of mammary gland morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "With growing interest in monitoring mutational processes in normal tissues, tumor heterogeneity, and cancer evolution under therapy, the ability to accurately and economically detect ultra-rare mutations is becoming increasingly important. However, this capability has often been compromised by significant sequencing, PCR and DNA preparation error rates. Here, we describe FERMI (Fast Extremely Rare Mutation Identification) - a novel method designed to eliminate majority of these sequencing and library preparation errors in order to significantly improve rare somatic mutation detection. This method leverages barcoded targeting probes to capture and sequence DNA of interest with single copy resolution. The variant calls from the barcoded sequencing data then further filtered in a position-dependent fashion against an adaptive, context-aware null model in order to distinguish true variants. As a proof of principle, we employ FERMI to probe bone marrow biopsies from leukemia patients, and show that rare mutations and clonal evolution can be tracked throughout cancer treatment, including during historically intractable periods like minimum residual disease. Importantly, FERMI is able to accurately detect nascent clonal expansions within leukemias in a manner that may facilitate the early detection and characterization of cancer relapse.",

We establish that the method has temporal and spatial resolutions comparable to the high-throughput sequencing approaches, while being faster than alternative locus-specific methods. Furthermore, the approach is capable of allele discrimination. We apply this method to determine relative replication timing across timing transition zones in cultured human cells. Finally, multiple samples can be analysed in parallel, allowing us to rapidly screen kinetochore mutants for perturbation to centromere replication timing.

    "abstract": "The relationship between cellular architecture and cellular state and function is apparent, but not yet completely understood. Precise characterization of cellular state is important in many fields, from pathology to synthetic biology. High-content high-throughput microscopy is now more than ever accessible to researchers. This allows for collection of large amount of cellular images. Naturally, the analysis of this data cannot be left to manual investigation and needs to resort to the use of efficient computing algorithms for cellular detection, segmentation, and tracking. Annotation is required for building high quality algorithms. Medical professionals and researchers spend a lot of effort and time in annotating cells. This task has proved to be very repetitive and time consuming. The experts time is valuable and should be used effectively. Our hypothesis is that active deep learning will help to share some of the burden that researchers face in their everyday work. In this paper, we focus specifically on the problem of cellular segmentation.\\n\\nWe approach the segmentation task using a classification framework. Each pixel in the image is classified based on whether the patch around it resides on the interior, boundary or exterior of the cell. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to perform the classification task. Active learning is the method used to reduce the annotation burden. Uncertainty sampling, a popular active learning framework is used in conjunction with CNN to segment the cells in the image. Three datasets of mammalian nuclei and cytoplasm are used for this work. We show that active deep learning significantly reduces the number of training samples required and also improves the quality of segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Classic pulse-chase studies have shown that actin is conveyed in slow axonal transport, but the mechanistic basis for this movement is unknown. Recently, we reported that axonal actin was surprisingly dynamic, with focal assembly/dis-assembly events (\\\"hotspots\\\") and elongating polymers along the axon-shaft (\\\"trails\\\"). Using a combination of live imaging, super-resolution microscopy, and modeling, here we explore how these axonal actin dynamics can lead to processive transport. We found abundant actin nucleation, along with a slow, anterogradely-biased flow of actin in axon-shafts. Starting with first principles of monomer/filament assembly - and incorporating imaging data - we generated a quantitative model simulating axonal hotspots and trails. Our simulations predict that the axonal actin dynamics indeed lead to an anterogradely-biased flow of the population, at rates consistent with slow transport. Collectively, the data point to a surprising scenario where local assembly and biased polymerization generate the slow axonal transport of actin. This mechanism is distinct from polymer-sliding, and seems well suited to convey highly dynamic cytoskeletal cargoes.\\n\\nAcknowledgementsThis work was supported by an NIH grant to SR (R01NS075233).

Here we examine somite scaling and find that somite size at specification scales with the length of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) despite considerable variation in PSM length across developmental stages and in surgically size-reduced embryos. Measurement of clock period, axis elongation speed, and clock gene expression patterns demonstrate that existing models fail to explain scaling. We posit a \\\"clock and scaled gradient\\\" model, in which somite boundaries are set by a dynamically scaling signaling gradient across the PSM. Our model not only explains existing data, but also makes a unique prediction that we experimentally confirm--the formation of periodic \\\"echoes\\\" in somite size following perturbation of the size of one somite.

Perinatally and early postnatal (E18-P15) the climbing fibers translocate to the Purkinje cell dendrites, and as the granular layer develops the mossy fibers translocate from the Purkinje cell somata and synapse with granule cell dendrites. In this report we describe a novel earlier stage in the development. Immunostaining for a neurofilament-associated antigen (NAA) reveals the early axon distributions with remarkable clarity. Axons from the trigeminal system enter the cerebellar primordium as early as embryo age (E)9. By using a combination of axon tract tracing, analysis of neurogenin1 null mice - which do not develop trigeminal ganglia - and mouse embryos maintained in vitro - we show that the first axons to innervate the cerebellar primordium are direct projections from the trigeminal ganglia. The data show that the early trigeminal projections are in situ before the Purkinje cells are born, and double immunostaining for NAA and markers of the different domains in the cerebellar primordium reveal that they first target the cerebellar nuclear neurons of the nuclear transitory zone (E9-E10), and only later (E10-E11) extend collateral branches to the Purkinje cell plate.",

    "abstract": "LIS1 mutations cause lissencephaly (LIS), a severe developmental brain malformation. Much less is known about its role in the mature nervous system. LIS1 regulates the microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein 1 (dynein), and as LIS1 and dynein are both expressed in the adult nervous system, Lis1 could potentially regulate dynein-dependent processes such as axonal transport. We therefore knocked out Lis1 in adult mice using tamoxifen-induced, Cre-ER-mediated recombination. When an actin promoter was used to drive Cre-ER expression (Act-Cre-ER), heterozygous Lis1 KO caused no obvious change in viability or behavior, despite evidence of widespread recombination by a Cre reporter three weeks after tamoxifen exposure. In contrast, homozygous Lis1 KO caused the rapid onset of neurological symptoms in both male and female mice. One tamoxifen-dosing regimen caused prominent recombination in the midbrain/hindbrain, PNS, and cardiac/skeletal muscle within a week; these mice developed severe symptoms in that time frame and were euthanized. A different tamoxifen regimen resulted in delayed recombination in midbrain/hindbrain, but not in other tissues, and also delayed the onset of symptoms. This indicates that Lis1 loss in the midbrain/hindbrain causes the severe phenotype. In support of this, brainstem regions known to house cardiorespiratory centers showed signs of axonal dysfunction in KO animals. Transport defects, neurofilament alterations, and varicosities were observed in axons in cultured DRG neurons from KO animals. Because no symptoms were observed when a cardiac specific Cre-ER promoter was used, we propose a vital role for Lis1 in autonomic neurons and implicate defective axonal transport in the KO phenotype.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMammalian Lis1 is best known for its role in brain development. Lis1 binds to and regulates the microtubule motor, cytoplasmic dynein. We show that Lis1 function is needed post-developmentally and provide evidence that loss of Lis1 in the hindbrain leads to death. The effect is dose dependent in mice, as loss of only one allele does not produce an overt phenotype. However, since LIS1 haploinsufficiency causes lissencephaly (LIS) in humans, our study raises the possibility that post-developmental axonal transport defects could contribute to worsening symptoms in children with LIS1 mutations. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis is that Lis1 regulates dynein-dependent axon transport in the mature nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes are important regulators of diverse biological function, including gene expression, rendering them potential targets for intervention in a number of diseases, with a handful of compounds approved for treatment of certain hematologic cancers. Among the human zinc-dependent HDACs, the most recently discovered member, HDAC11, is the only member assigned to subclass IV, the smallest protein, and the least well understood with regards to biological function. Here we show that HDAC11 cleaves long chain acyl modifications on lysine side chains with remarkable efficiency compared to acetyl groups. We further show that several common types of HDAC inhibitors, including the approved drugs romidepsin and vorinostat, do not inhibit this enzymatic activity. Macrocyclic hydroxamic acid-containing peptides, on the other hand, potently inhibit HDAC11 demyristoylation activity. These findings should be taken carefully into consideration in future investigations of the biological function of HDAC11 and will serve as a foundation for the development of selective chemical probes targeting HDAC11.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are essential to neuronal structure and function. Axonal and dendritic microtubules are enriched in post-translational modifications that impact microtubule dynamics, transport, and microtubule-associated proteins. Acetylation of -tubulin lysine 40 (K40) is a prominent, conserved modification of neuronal microtubules. However, the cellular role of microtubule acetylation remains controversial. To resolve how microtubule acetylation might affect neuronal morphogenesis we mutated endogenous -tubulin in vivo using a new fly strain that facilitates the rapid knock-in of designer -tubulin alleles. Leveraging our new strain, we found that microtubule acetylation, as well as polyglutamylation and (de)tyrosination, is not essential for survival. However, we found that dendrite branch refinement in sensory neurons relies on -tubulin K40. Mutagenesis of K40 reveals moderate yet significant changes in dendritic lysosome transport, microtubule polymerization, and Futsch distribution in dendrites but not axons. Our studies point to an unappreciated role for -tubulin K40 and acetylation in dendrite morphogenesis. While our results are consistent with the idea that microtubule acetylation patterns microtubule function within neurons, they also suggest there may be a structural requirement for -tubulin K40.\\n\\nSummary StatementNeurons are enriched in post-translationally modified microtubules. Targeted mutagenesis of endogenous -tubulin in flies reveals that dendrite branch refinement is altered by acetylation-blocking mutations.",

    "abstract": "Dynamin-like guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) are gamma interferon (IFN{gamma})-inducible host defense proteins that can associate with cytosol-invading bacterial pathogens. Mouse GBPs promote the lytic destruction of targeted bacteria in the host cell cytosol but the antimicrobial function of human GBPs and the mechanism by which these proteins associate with cytosolic bacteria are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that human GBP1 is unique amongst the seven human GBP paralogs in its ability to associate with at least two cytosolic Gram-negative bacteria, Burkholderia thailandensis and Shigella flexneri. Rough lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mutants of S. flexneri co-localize with GBP1 less frequently than wildtype S. flexneri, suggesting that host recognition of O-antigen promotes GBP1 targeting to Gram-negative bacteria. The targeting of GBP1 to cytosolic bacteria, via a unique triple-arginine motif present in its C-terminus, promotes the co-recruitment of four additional GBP paralogs (GBP2, GBP3, GBP4 and GBP6). GBP1-decorated Shigella replicate but fail to form actin tails leading to their intracellular aggregation. Consequentially, wildtype but not the triple-arginine GBP1 mutant restricts S. flexneri cell-to-cell spread. Furthermore, human-adapted S. flexneri, through the action of one its secreted effectors, IpaH9.8, is more resistant to GBP1 targeting than the non-human-adapted bacillus B. thailandensis. These studies reveal that human GBP1 uniquely functions as an intracellular  glue trap inhibiting the cytosolic movement of normally actin-propelled Gram-negative bacteria. In response to this powerful human defense program S. flexneri has evolved an effective counter-defense to restrict GBP1 recruitment.\\n\\nImportanceSeveral pathogenic bacterial species evolved to invade, reside and replicate inside the cytosol of their host cells. One adaptation common to most cytosolic bacterial pathogens is the ability to co-opt the hosts actin polymerization machinery, in order to generate force for intracellular movement. This actin-based motility enables Gram-negative bacteria such as Shigella to propel themselves into neighboring cells thereby spreading from host cell to host cell without exiting the intracellular environment. Here, we show that the human protein GBP1 acts as a cytosolic  glue trap capturing cytosolic Gram-negative bacteria through a unique protein motif and preventing disseminated infections in cell culture models. To escape from this GBP1-mediated host defense, Shigella employs a virulence factor that prevents or dislodges the association of GBP1 with cytosolic bacteria. Thus, therapeutic strategies to restore GBP1 binding to Shigella may lead to novel treatment options for shigellosis in the future.",

In this study, we evaluated the performance of seven widely used docking methods (AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, DOCK 6, PLANTS, rDock, GEMDOCK and GOLD) on a dataset of 57 peptide-ligand complexes. Though these methods have been developed for docking ligands to proteins but we evaluate their ability to dock ligands to peptides. First, we compared TOP docking pose of these methods with original complex and achieved average RMSD from 4.74[A] for AutoDock to 12.63[A] for GEMDOCK. Next we evaluated BEST docking pose of these methods and achieved average RMSD from 3.82[A] for AutoDock to 10.83[A] for rDock. It has been observed that ranking of docking poses by these methods is not suitable for peptide-ligand docking as performance of their TOP pose is much inferior to their BEST pose. AutoDock clearly shows better performance compared to the other six docking methods based on their TOP docking poses. On the other hand, difference in performance of different docking methods (AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, PLANTS and DOCK 6) was marginal when evaluation was based on their BEST docking pose. Similar trend has been observed when performance is measured in terms of success rate at different cut-off values.

    "abstract": "A growing number of academic and community clinics are conducting genomic testing to inform treatment decisions for cancer patients (1). In the last 3-5 years, there has been a rapid increase in clinical use of next generation sequencing (NGS) based cancer molecular diagnostic (MolDx) testing (2). The increasing availability and decreasing cost of tumor genomic profiling means that physicians can now make treatment decisions armed with patient-specific genetic information. Accumulating research in the cancer biology field indicates that there is significant potential to improve cancer patient outcomes by effectively leveraging this rich source of genomic data in treatment planning (3). To achieve truly personalized medicine in oncology, it is critical to catalog cancer sequence variants from MolDx testing for their clinical relevance along with treatment information and patient outcomes, and to do so in a way that supports large-scale data aggregation and new hypothesis generation. One critical challenge to encoding variant data is adopting a standard of annotation of those variants that are clinically actionable. Through the NIH-funded Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) (4), in collaboration with NLMs ClinVar database and >50 academic and industry based cancer research organizations, we developed the Minimal Variant Level Data (MVLD) framework to standardize reporting and interpretation of drug associated alterations (5). We are currently involved in collaborative efforts to align the MVLD framework with parallel, complementary sequence variants interpretation clinical guidelines from the Association of Molecular Pathologists (AMP) for clinical labs (6). In order to truly democratize access to MolDx data for care and research needs, these standards must be harmonized to support sharing of clinical cancer variants. Here we describe the processes and methods developed within the ClinGens Somatic WG in collaboration with over 60 cancer care and research organizations as well as CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited clinical testing labs to develop standards for cancer variant interpretation and sharing.",

    "abstract": "Cytosine methylation is essential for normal mammalian development, yet also provides a major mutagenic stimulus. Methylcytosine (5mC) is prone to spontaneous deamination, which introduces cytosine to thymine transition mutations (C>T) upon replication1. Cells endure hundreds of 5mC deamination events each day and an intricate repair network is engaged to restrict this damage. Central to this network are the DNA glycosylases MBD42 and TDG3,4, which recognise T:G mispairing and initiate base excision repair (BER). Here we describe a novel cancer predisposition syndrome resulting from germline biallelic inactivation of MBD4 that leads to the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). These leukaemias have an extremely high burden of C>T mutations, specifically in the context of methylated CG dinucleotides (CG>TG). This dependence on 5mC as a source of mutations may explain the remarkable observation that MBD4-deficient AMLs share a common set of driver mutations, including biallelic mutations in DNMT3A and hotspot mutations in IDH1/IDH2. By assessing serial samples taken over the course of treatment, we highlight a critical interaction with somatic mutations in DNMT3A that accelerates leukaemogenesis and accounts for the conserved path to AML. MBD4-deficiency was also detected, rarely, in sporadic cancers, which display the same mutational signature. Collectively these cancers provide a model of 5mC-dependent hypermutation and reveal factors that shape its mutagenic influence.",

We profiled metabolites in islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors, and found altered levels of mitochondrial metabolites in T2D. Analysis of genes encoding proteins localized to mitochondria (MitoCarta) by RNA-seq in an extended sample of islets revealed genes whose expression was associated with glycaemia- and/or BMI. Expression of two of these, -methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT), was influenced by genetic variation (cis-eQTL). Silencing of AMACR and MUT in insulin-secreting cells reduced hormone secretion by 40-50%.

    "abstract": "During cerebellar development, cerebellar nuclei (CN) neurons and Purkinje cells are the earliest born among the different neuronal subtypes. Purkinje cells are the sole output of the cerebellar cortex and project to the CN. The CN represents the main output of the cerebellum, which is generated from the rhombic lip and the ventricular zone. We used immunohistochemistry, embryonic cultures, dye tracers and in situ hybridization to examine the origin of a new subset of CN neurons from the mesencephalon during early cerebellar development. Our results show that a subset of CN neurons, which are immunopositive for -synuclein (SNCA) and Otx2, originate from the mesencephalon and cross the isthmus toward the rostral end of the nuclear transitory zone. Double immunostaining of the SNCA with Otx2 or p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75ntr) indicates that these cells are derived from neural crest cells. We also showed that this population of neurons with nerve fibers terminates at the subpial surface of putative lobules VI/VII. The SNCA+/Otx2+/p75+ cells, which divide the cerebellar primordium into rosterodorsal and caudoventral compartments, show increased cleaved caspase-3 activation, which suggests temporary presence of these cells due to apoptosis. These results strongly suggest that early CN neurons originate from the mesencephalic neural crest population and cross the isthmus to contribute as a subset of the CN. Their temporary presence in the nuclear transitory zone suggests that these neurons/fibers play a regulatory role as a signaling center to attract early afferent pioneer axons and provide neuronal migratory pathway during early cerebellar development.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDuring cerebellar development two germinal zones are involved in cerebellar neurogenesis: the rhombic lip and the ventricular zone, which are located in the developing cerebellum itself. Our findings indicate that a subset of cerebellar nuclei neurons have an external origin, the mesencephalon, and they are the earliest born neurons that enter to the developing cerebellum. In this study, we focused on the origin of these cells and traced their migratory pathway from the mesencephalon while crossing the isthmus, followed them when they entered to the developing cerebellum. We also demonstrated their potential role on later born cells during cerebellar development.",

Moreover, land managers and planners are often unable to gain timely access to maps they need to support their routine decision-making. This deficiency is partly due to a lack of suitable data on ecosystem change, driven mostly by the considerable technical expertise needed to make ecosystem maps from remote sensing data.\\nC_LIO_LIWe have developed a free and open-access online remote sensing and environmental modelling application, REMAP (the remote ecosystem monitoring and assessment pipeline; https://remap-app.org) that enables volunteers, managers, and scientists with little or no experience in remote sensing to develop high-resolution classified maps of land cover and land use change over time.\\nC_LIO_LIREMAP utilizes the geospatial data storage and analysis capacity of the Google Earth Engine, and requires only spatially resolved training data that define map classes of interest (e.g., ecosystem types). The training data, which can be uploaded or annotated interactively within REMAP, are used in a random forest classification of up to 13 publicly available predictor datasets to assign all pixels in a focal region to map classes. Predictor datasets available in REMAP represent topographic (e.g. slope, elevation), spectral (Landsat Archive image composites) and climatic variables (precipitation, temperature) that can inform on the distribution of ecosystems and land cover classes.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ability of REMAP to develop and export high-quality classified maps in a very short (<10 minute) time frame represents a considerable advance towards globally accessible and free application of remote sensing technology. By enabling access to data and simplifying remote sensing classifications, REMAP can catalyse the monitoring of land use and change to support environmental conservation, including developing inventories of biodiversity, identifying hotspots of ecosystem diversity, ecosystem-based spatial conservation planning, mapping ecosystem loss at local scales, and supporting environmental education initiatives.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "While hybridization between species is increasingly appreciated to be a common occurrence, little is known about the forces that govern the subsequent evolution of hybrid genomes. We considered this question in three independent, naturally-occurring hybrid populations formed between swordtail fish species Xiphophorus birchmanni and X. malinche. To this end, we built a fine-scale genetic map and inferred patterns of local ancestry along the genomes of 690 individuals sampled from the three populations. In all three cases, we found hybrid ancestry to be more common in regions of high recombination and where there is linkage to fewer putative targets of selection. These same patterns are also apparent in a reanalysis of human-Neanderthal admixture. Our results lend support to models in which ancestry from the \\\"minor\\\" parental species persists only where it is rapidly uncoupled from alleles that are deleterious in hybrids, and show the retention of hybrid ancestry to be at least in part predictable from genomic features. Our analyses further indicate that in swordtail fish, the dominant source of selection on hybrids stems from deleterious combinations of epistatically-interacting alleles.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryThe persistence of hybrid ancestry is predictable from local recombination rates, in three replicate hybrid populations as well as in humans.",

    "abstract": "Measuring natural selection through the use of multiple regression has transformed our understanding of selection, although the methods used remain sensitive to the effects of multicollinearity due to highly correlated traits. While measuring selection on principal component scores is an apparent solution to this challenge, this approach has been heavily criticized due to difficulties in interpretation and relating PC axes back to the original traits. We describe and illustrate how to transform selection gradients for PC scores back into selection gradients for the original traits, addressing issues of multicollinearity and biological interpretation. We demonstrate this approach with empirical data and examples from the literature, highlighting how selection estimates for PC scores can be interpreted while reducing the consequences of multicollinearity.",

    "abstract": "Host immunity exerts strong selection on pathogens, but it does not act in a uniform manner across individual hosts. By providing a direct approach for understanding host-specific selection pressures, patterns of intra-host pathogen diversity complement population genetic analyses performed on broad geographic scales. Here, we perform a combined analysis of inter- and intra-host diversity for the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum with haplotype sequences of three antigens sampled from over 4,500 natural infections in sub-Saharan Africa using targeted deep sequencing. We find that multi-strain infections in young children contain non-random combinations of parasite genotypes, and identify individual amino acid positions that may contribute to strain-specific blocking of infections. These results demonstrate for the first time that natural host defenses to Plasmodium detectably impact which infections proceed to the blood stage within a given host. This selection partially explains the extreme amino acid diversity observed at many parasite antigens and suggests that vaccines targeting such proteins should account for the impact of allele-specific immunity.",

    "abstract": "Inferring the evolution of characters in Isoetes has been problematic, as these plants are morphologically conservative and yet highly variable and homoplasious within that conserved base morphology. However, molecular phylogenies have given us a valuable tool to test hypothesis of character evolution within the genus. One such hypothesis is that extant Isoetes have undergone a morphological reduction from larger arborescent lycophyte ancestors. In this work we examine the reduction in lobe numbers on the underground trunk, or corm, over evolutionary time. Using reversible-jump MCMC and Bayesian inference, our results support the hypothesis of a directional reduction in lobe number in Isoetes, with the best-supported model of character evolution being one of irreversible reduction. Furthermore, the most probable ancestral corm lobe number of extant Isoetes is three, and a reduction to two lobes has occurred at least six times. From our results, we can infer that corm lobation, like many other traits in Isoetes, shows a degree of homoplasy, yet also shows ongoing evolutionary reduction.",

Currently-available methods of computational gene prediction, while on the whole successful, often disagree on the model for a given predicted gene, with some or all of the variant gene models failing to match the biologically observed structure. Many prediction methods can be bolstered by using experimental data such as RNA-seq and mass spectrometry. However, these resources are not always available, and rarely give a comprehensive portrait of an organisms transcriptome due to temporal and tissue-specific expression profiles.\\n\\nResultsOrthology between genes provides evolutionary evidence to guide the construction of gene models. OMGene (Optimise My Gene) aims to optimise gene models in the absence of experimental data by optimising the derived amino acid alignments for gene models within orthogroups. Using RNA-seq data sets from plants and fungi, considering intron/exon junction representation and exon coverage, and assessing the intra-orthogroup consistency of subcellular localisation predictions, we demonstrate the utility of OMGene for improving gene models in annotated genomes.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show that significant improvements in the accuracy of gene model annotations can be made in both established and de novo annotated genomes by leveraging information from multiple species.",

    "abstract": "Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (ACT) is a key limiting factor in setting optimal chemotherapy regimes for cancer patients, with almost half of patients expected to ultimately develop congestive heart failure given high drug doses. However, the genetic basis of sensitivity to anthracyclines such as doxorubicin remains unclear. To begin addressing this, we created a panel of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from 45 individuals and performed RNA-seq after 24h exposure to varying levels of doxorubicin. The transcriptomic response to doxorubicin is substantial, with the majority of genes being differentially expressed across treatments of different concentrations and over 6000 genes showing evidence of differential splicing. Overall, our observations indicate that splicing fidelity decreases in the presence of doxorubicin. We detect 376 response-expression QTLs and 42 response-splicing QTLs, i.e. genetic variants that modulate the individual transcriptomic response to doxorubicin in terms of expression and splicing changes respectively. We show that inter-individual variation in transcriptional response is predictive of cell damage measured in vitro using a cardiac troponin assay, which in turn is shown to be associated with in vivo ACT risk. Finally, the molecular QTLs we detected are enriched in lower ACT GWAS p-values, further supporting the in vivo relevance of our map of genetic regulation of cellular response to anthracyclines.",

This study compares new and previously well established methods aimed at reducing bias in bioinformatics analysis (QIIME 1 and DADA2) and bacterial DNA extraction of human fecal samples in 16S rRNA marker gene surveys.\\n\\nResultsAnalysis of a mock DNA community using DADA2 identified more chimeras (QIIME 1: 0.70% of total reads vs DADA2: 1.96%), fewer sequence variants, (QIIME 1: 1297.4 + 98.88 vs. DADA2: 136.27 + 11.35, mean + SD) and correct taxa at a higher resolution of classification (i.e. genus-level) than open reference OTU picking in QIIME 1. Additionally, the extraction of whole cell mock community bacterial DNA using four commercially available kits resulted in varying DNA yield, quality and bacterial community composition. Of the four kits compared, ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit provided the greatest yield, with a slight enrichment of Enterococcus. However, QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit resulted in the highest DNA quality. Mo Bio PowerFecal DNA Kit had the most dramatic effect on the mock community composition, resulting in an increased proportion of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and genus Eshcerichia as well as members of genera Lactobacillus and Pseudomonas. The presence of a sterile fecal matrix had a slight, but inconsistent effect on the yield, quality and taxa identified after extraction with all four DNA extraction kits. Extraction of bacterial DNA from native stool samples revealed a distinct effect of the DNA stabilization reagent DNA/RNA Shield on community composition, causing an increase in the detected abundance of members of orders Bifidobacteriales, Bacteroidales, Turicibacterales, Clostridiales and Enterobacteriales.\\n\\nConclusionThese results confirm that the DADA2 algorithm is superior to sequence clustering by similarity to determine microbial community structure. Additionally, commercially available kits used for bacterial DNA extraction from fecal samples have some effect on the proportion of high abundance members detected in a microbial community, but it is less significant than the effect of using DNA stabilization reagent, DNA/RNA Shield.",

    "abstract": "Frontal eye field (FEF) in macaque monkeys contributes to visual attention, visual-motor transformations and production of eye movements. Traditionally, neurons in FEF have been classified by the magnitude of increased discharge rates following visual stimulus presentation, during a waiting period, and associated with eye movement production. However, considerable heterogeneity remains within the traditional visual, visuomovement and movement categories. Cluster analysis is a data-driven method of identifying self-segregating groups within a dataset. Because many cluster analysis techniques exist and cluster outcomes vary with analysis assumptions, consensus clustering aggregates over multiple cluster analyses, identifying robust groups. To describe more comprehensively the neuronal composition of FEF, we applied a consensus clustering technique for unsupervised categorization of patterns of spike rate modulation measured during a memory-guided saccade task. We report ten functional categories, expanding on the traditional three. Categories were distinguished by latency, magnitude, and sign of visual response, presence of sustained activity, and dynamics, magnitude and sign of saccade-related modulation. Consensus clustering can include other metrics and can be applied to datasets from other brain regions to provides better information guiding microcircuit models of cortical function.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe contribution of a brain region cannot be understood without knowing the diversity, arrangement, and circuitry of constituent neurons. Traditional descriptions of frontal eye field include visual, visuo-saccadic, and saccadic categories. Here, we employ a novel consensus clustering method to identify more reliably functional categories in neural data. While confirming the traditional categories, consensus clustering distinguishes additional, previously unappreciated diversity in neural activity patterns. Such information is necessary to formulate correct microcircuit models of cortical function.",

In such a scenario, a reliable mechanism to predict the onset of seizure beforehand is much desirable. In this study, A reliable real-time technique for prediction of epileptic seizures is presented. Mean Phase Coherence (MPC), as a measure of phase synchronization, is used to predict impending seizures in a multi-channel EEG data. It was found that during the pre-ictal stages, MPC values and thus phase synchronization between various channels was found to drop significantly below the level in a non-ictal EEG signal.

    "abstract": "There is a current interest in quantifying brain dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) based on neuroimaging data such as fMRI. Many methods have been proposed, and are being applied, revealing new insight into the brains dynamics. However, given that the ground truth for DFC in the brain is unknown, many concerns remain regarding the accuracy of proposed estimates. Since there exists many DFC methods it is difficult to assess differences in dynamic brain connectivity between studies. Here, we evaluate five different methods that together represent a wide spectrum of current approaches to estimating DFC (sliding window, tapered sliding window, temporal derivative, spatial distance and jackknife correlation). In particular, we were interested in each methods ability to track changes in covariance over time, which is a key property in DFC analysis. We found that all tested methods correlated positively with each other, but there were large differences in the strength of the correlations between methods. To facilitate comparisons with future DFC methods, we propose that the described simulations can act as benchmark tests for evaluation of methods. In this paper, we present dfcbenchmarker, which is a Python package where researchers can easily submit and compare their own DFC methods to evaluate its performance.",

    "abstract": "An important yet unresolved question is whether or not metacognition consists of domain-general or domain-specific mechanisms. While most studies on this topic suggest a dissociation between metacognitive abilities at the neural level, there are conflicting reports at the behavioral level. Specifically, while McCurdy et al. (2013) found a positive correlation between metacognitive efficiency for visual perception and memory, Baird et al. (2013) didnt find this correlation. One possible explanation for this disparity is that the former included two-alternative-forced choice (2AFC) judgments in both their visual and memory tasks, whereas the latter used 2AFC for one task and yes/no (YN) judgments for the other. In support of this hypothesis, we ran two online experiments meant to mirror McCurdy et al. (2013) and Baird et al. (2013) with considerable statistical power (n=100), and replicated the main findings of both studies. This suggests the finding of McCurdy et al (2013) was not a  fluke (i.e. false positive). In a third experiment with the same sample size, which included YN judgments for both tasks, we did not find a correlation between metacognitive functions, suggesting that the conflict between McCurdy et al. (2013) and Baird et al. (2013) stemmed from the use of YN judgments in the latter study. Our results underscore the need to avoid conflating 2AFC and YN judgments, which is a common problem.",

    "abstract": "We examine the problem of rapidly and efficiently estimating a neurons linear receptive field (RF) from responses to high-dimensional stimuli. This problem poses important statistical and computational challenges. Statistical challenges arise from the need for strong regularization when using correlated stimuli in high-dimensional parameter spaces, while computational challenges arise from extensive time and memory costs associated with evidence-optimization and inference in high-dimensional settings. Here we focus on novel methods for scaling up automatic smoothness determination (ASD), an empirical Bayesian method for RF estimation, to high-dimensional settings. First, we show that using a zero-padded Fourier domain representation and a \\\"coarse-to-fine\\\" evidence optimization strategy gives substantial improvements in speed and memory, while maintaining exact numerical accuracy. We then introduce a suite of scalable approximate methods that exploit Kronecker and Toeplitz structure in the stimulus autocovariance, which can be related to the method of expected log-likelihoods [1]. When applied together, these methods reduce the cost of estimating an RF with tensor order D and d coefficients per tensor dimension from O(d3D) time and O(d2D) space for standard ASD to O(Dd log d) time and O(Dd) space. We show that evidence optimization for a linear RF with 160K coefficients using 5K samples of data can be carried out on a laptop in < 2s.",

We quantified thermoregulatory responses to high air temperature (Ta) in ~100-g representatives of three orders: African cuckoo (Cuculus gularis, Cuculiformes), lilac-breasted roller (Coracias caudatus, Coraciiformes), and Burchells starling (Lamprotornis australis, Passeriformes). All three species initiated respiratory mechanisms to increase evaporative heat dissipation when body temperature (Tb) approached 41.5{degrees}C in response to increasing Ta, with gular flutter observed in cuckoos and panting in rollers and starlings. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and evaporative water loss (EWL) increased by quantitatively similar magnitudes in all three species, although maximum rates of EWL were proportionately lower in starlings. Evaporative cooling efficiency [defined as the ratio of evaporative heat loss (EHL) to metabolic heat production (MHP)] generally remained below 2.0 in cuckoos and starlings, but reached a maximum of ~3.5 in rollers. The high value for rollers reveals a very efficient evaporative cooling mechanism, and is similar to EHL/MHP maxima for similarly sized columbids which very effectively dissipate heat via cutaneous evaporation. This unexpected phylogenetic variation among the orders tested in the physiological mechanisms of heat dissipation is an important step toward determining the evolution of heat tolerance traits in desert birds.\\n\\nSummary statementWe show that avian evaporative cooling efficiency and heat tolerance display substantial taxonomic variation that are, unexpectedly, not systematically related to the use of panting versus gular flutter processes.",

    "abstract": "We propose a data-driven approach to represent neuronal network dynamics as a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM). Our approach learns the PGM structure by employing dimension reduction to network response dynamics evoked by stimuli applied to each neuron separately. The outcome model captures how stimuli propagate through the network and thus represents functional dependencies between neurons, i.e., functional connectome. The benefit of using a PGM as the functional connectome is that posterior inference can be done efficiently and circumvent the complexities in direct inference of response pathways in dynamic neuronal networks. In particular, posterior inference reveals the relations between known stimuli and downstream neurons or allows to query which stimuli are associated with downstream neurons. For validation and as an example for our approach we apply our methodology to a model of Caenorhabiditis elegans nervous system which structure and dynamics are well-studied. From its dynamical model we collect time series of the network response and use singular value decomposition to obtain a low-dimensional projection of the time series data. We then extract dominant patterns in each data matrix to get pairwise dependency information and create a graphical model for the full somatic nervous system. The PGM enables us to obtain and verify underlying neuronal pathways dominant for known behavioral scenarios and to detect possible pathways for novel scenarios.",

    "abstract": "It has been argued that sexual allocation is greater for female function than male function in plants in general and specifically for the large dioecious Cape genus Leucadendron. Here, we use new interpretations of published information to support the hypothesis of equality between sexes in this genus. The explanations are based on the fire ecology of the Cape that results in reproductive synchrony, reproductive doubling and competitive symmetry. Firstly, strict post-fire seedling establishment of the reseeder life-history in the Cape results in single-aged populations. Consequently, the reproductive and vegetative schedules of males must synchronously track that of females. This implies equal allocation to sex. Secondly, after fires, dioecious females have double the seedling to adult ratio of co-occurring hermaphrodites. This indicates that being liberated from male function allows females access to resources that double their fitness compared to hermaphrodites. Therefore, male and female costs of reproduction are equal in hermaphrodites. Thirdly, competitive symmetry must occur because males and female plants will frequently encounter each other as close near neighbours. Competitive asymmetry would both reduce mating opportunities and skew local sex ratios. The evidence to date is for 1:1 sex ratios in small plots and this indicates competitive symmetry and a lack of dimorphic niches. Finally, vegetatively dimorphic species must also allocate equally to sex, or else sexual asynchrony, lack of reproductive doubling or competitive asymmetry will occur.",

    "abstract": "Balancing the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) is necessary for successful behavior. Using a visual search task with interleaved cues emphasizing speed or accuracy, we recently reported diverse contributions of frontal eye field (FEF) neurons instantiating salience evidence and response preparation. Here we report replication of visual search SAT performance in two macaque monkeys, new information about variation of saccade dynamics with SAT, extension of the neurophysiological investigation to describe processes in the superior colliculus, and description of the origin of search errors in this task. Saccade vigor varied idiosyncratically across SAT conditions and monkeys, but tended to decrease with response time. As observed in the FEF, speed-accuracy tradeoff was accomplished through several distinct adjustments in the superior colliculus. Visually-responsive neurons modulated baseline firing rate and the time course of salience evidence. Unlike FEF, the magnitude of visual responses in SC did not vary across SAT conditions, but the time to locate the target was longer in Accurate as compared to Fast trials. Also unlike FEF, the activity of SC movement neurons when saccades were initiated was equivalent in Fast and Accurate trials. Search errors occurred when visual salience neurons in FEF and SC treated distractors as targets, even in the Accurate condition. Saccade-related neural activity in SC but less FEF varied with saccade peak velocity. These results extend our understanding of the cortical and subcortical contributions to SAT.\\n\\nSignificance statementNeurophysiological mechanisms of speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) have only recently been investigated. This paper reports the first replication of SAT performance in nonhuman primates, the first report of variation of saccade dynamics with SAT, the first description of superior colliculus contributions to SAT, and the first description of the origin of errors during SAT. These results inform and constrain new models of distributed decision-making.",

While the impact of forces on cell proliferation has been fairly well characterized, the inverse relationship is much less understood. Here we investigated how traction forces vary during cell cycle progression. Cell shape was constrained on micropatterned substrates in order to distinguish variations in cell contractility from cell size increase. We performed traction force measurements of asynchronously dividing cells expressing a cell-cycle reporter, to obtain measurements of contractile forces generated during cell division. We found that forces tend to increase as cells progress through G1, before reaching a plateau in S phase, and then decline during G2. This biphasic behaviour revealed a previously undocumented specific and opposite regulation of cell contractility during each cell cycle stage.",

    "abstract": "As a sensitive signaling system, the mitotic checkpoint ensures faithful chromosome segregation by delaying anaphase onset when even a single kinetochore is unattached. The key signal amplification reaction for the checkpoint is the conformational conversion of open MAD2 (O-MAD2) into closed MAD2 (C-MAD2). The reaction was suggested to be catalyzed by an unusual catalyst, a MAD1:C-MAD2 tetramer, but how the catalysis is executed and regulated remains elusive. Here we report that in addition to the well-characterized middle region (MIM), both amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) of MAD1 also contribute to the mitotic checkpoint. In contrast to MIM that stably associates with C-MAD2, MAD1-NTD and CTD surprisingly bind to both O-MAD2 and C-MAD2, suggesting their interactions with substrates and products of the O-C conversion. MAD1-NTD also interacts with CTD. MPS1 kinase interacts with and phosphorylates both NTD and CTD. The phosphorylation reduces the NTD:CTD interaction and CTD interaction with MPS1. Mutating CTD phosphorylation sites including Thr716 compromises MAD2 binding and the checkpoint responses. Ser610 and Tyr634 also contribute to the checkpoint. Our results have uncovered previously unknown interactions of MAD1-NTD and CTD with MAD2 conformers and their regulation by MPS1 kinase, providing novel insights into the mitotic checkpoint signaling.",

MC1R mutations affecting human skin and hair color also have pleiotropic effects on the immune response and analgesia. Variants affecting human pigmentation in utero alter the congenital phenotype of both oculocutaneous albinism and congenital melanocytic naevi, and have a possible effect on birthweight.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsBy in situ hybridization, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, we show that MC1R is widely expressed during human, chick and mouse embryonic and fetal stages in many somatic tissues, particularly in the musculoskeletal and nervous systems, and conserved across evolution in these three amniotes. Its dynamic pattern differs from that of TUBB3, a gene overlapping the same locus in humans and encoding class III {beta}-tubulin. The MSH peptide and the transcript for its precursor, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), are similarly present in numerous extra-cutaneous tissues. MC1R genotyping of variants p.(V60M) and p.(R151C) was undertaken for 867 healthy children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parent and Children (ALSPAC) cohort, and birthweight modelled using multiple logistic regression analysis. A significant positive association initially found between R151C and birth weight, independent of known birth weight modifiers, was not reproduced when combined with data from an independent genome-wide association study of 6,459 additional members of the same cohort.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data clearly show a new and hitherto unsuspected role for MC1R in non-cutaneous solid tissues before birth.",

    "abstract": "Cancers develop through somatic mutagenesis, however germline genetic variation can markedly contribute to tumorigenesis via diverse mechanisms. We discovered and phased 88 million germline single nucleotide variants, short insertions/deletions, and large structural variants in whole genomes from 2,642 cancer patients, and employed this genomic resource to study genetic determinants of somatic mutagenesis across 39 cancer types. Our analyses implicate damaging germline variants in a variety of cancer predisposition and DNA damage response genes with specific somatic mutation patterns. Mutations in the MBD4 DNA glycosylase gene showed association with elevated C>T mutagenesis at CpG dinucleotides, a ubiquitous mutational process acting across tissues. Analysis of somatic structural variation exposed complex rearrangement patterns, involving cycles of templated insertions and tandem duplications, in BRCA1-deficient tumours. Genome-wide association analysis implicated common genetic variation at the APOBEC3 gene cluster with reduced basal levels of somatic mutagenesis attributable to APOBEC cytidine deaminases across cancer types. We further inferred over a hundred polymorphic L1/LINE elements with somatic retrotransposition activity in cancer. Our study highlights the major impact of rare and common germline variants on mutational landscapes in cancer.",

Second, we incorporated these oligonucleotides into a phage library. Third, we screened the six PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domains of Scribble and DLG1 for binding and identified known and novel ligands from the human proteome, and whether these interactions may be regulated by ligand phosphorylation. We demonstrate that the Scribble PDZ domains preferentially bind to ligands with phosphomimetic mutations at two distinct positions, and show that the equilibrium dissociation constant for Scribble PDZ1 with the C-terminal peptide of RPS6KA2 is enhanced over four-fold by phosphorylation.

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis and vascular remodeling are driven by a wide range of endothelial cell behaviors, such as cell divisions, cell movements, cell shape and polarity changes. To decipher the cellular and molecular mechanism of cell movements, we have analyzed the dynamics of different junctional components during blood vessel anastomosis in vivo. We show that endothelial cell movements are associated with oscillating lamellipodia-like structures, which are orientated in the direction of these movements. These structures emerge from endothelial cell junctions and we thus call them junction-based lamellipodia (JBL). High-resolution time-lapse imaging shows that JBL are formed by F-actin based protrusions at the front end of moving cells. These protrusions also contain diffusely distributed VE-cadherin, whereas the junctional protein ZO-1 (Zona occludens 1) remains at the junction. Subsequently, a new junction is formed at the front of the JBL and the proximal junction is pulled towards the newly established distal junction. JBL function is highly dependent on F-actin dynamics. Inhibition of F-actin polymerization prevents JBL formation, whereas Rac-1 inhibition interferes with JBL oscillations. Both interventions disrupt endothelial junction formation and cell elongation. To examine the role of VE-cadherin (encoded by cdh5 gene) in this process, we generated a targeted mutation in VE-cadherin gene (cdh5ubs25), which prevents VE-cad/F-actin interaction. Although homozygous ve-cadherin mutants form JBL, these JBL are less dynamic and do not promote endothelial cell elongation. Taken together, our observations suggest a novel oscillating ratchet-like mechanism, which is used by endothelial cells to move along or over each other and thus provides the physical means for cell rearrangements.",

    "abstract": "Current single particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques can produce images of large protein assemblies and macromolecular complexes at atomic level detail without the need for crystal growth. However, proteins of smaller size, typical of those found throughout the cell, are not presently amenable to detailed structural elucidation by cryo-EM. Here we use protein design to create a modular, symmetrical scaffolding system to make protein molecules of typical size amenable to cryo-EM. Using a rigid continuous alpha-helical linker, we connect a small 17 kDa protein (DARPin) to a protein subunit that was designed to self-assemble into a cage with cubic symmetry. We show that the resulting construct is amenable to structural analysis by single particle cryo-EM, allowing us to identify and solve the structure of the attached small protein at near-atomic detail, ranging from 3.5 to 5 [A] resolution. The result demonstrates that proteins considerably smaller than the theoretical limit of 50 kDa for cryo-EM can be visualized clearly when arrayed in a rigid fashion on a symmetric designed protein scaffold. Furthermore, because the amino acid sequence of a DARPin can be chosen to confer tight binding to various other protein or nucleic acid molecules, the system provides a future route for imaging diverse macromolecules, potentially broadening the application of cryoEM to proteins of typical size in the cell.\\n\\nSignificance statementNew electron microscopy methods are making it possible to view the structures of large proteins and nucleic acid complexes at atomic detail, but the methods are difficult to apply to molecules smaller than about 50 kDa, which is larger than the size of the average protein in the cell. The present work demonstrates that a protein much smaller than that limit can be successfully visualized when it is attached to a large protein scaffold designed to hold 12 copies of the attached protein in symmetric and rigidly defined orientations.

Despite production of large amounts of recombinant GAA annually, the structure of GAA has not been reported until now. Here, we describe the first structure of GAA, at 1.7[A] resolution. Three structures of GAA complexes reveal the molecular basis for the hundreds of mutations that lead to Pompe disease and for pharmacological chaperoning in the protein. The GAA structure reveals a surprising second sugar-binding site 34[A] from the active site, suggesting a possible mechanism for processing of large glycogen substrates.

Here, we use atomic force microscopy for the mechanical characterization of red blood cell (RBC) EVs from healthy individuals as well as from a patient with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) due to ankyrin deficiency. We show that the EVs are packed with proteins, yet their response to indentation is similar to that of a fluid lipid vesicle lacking proteins. The bending modulus of RBC EVs of healthy donors is ~15 kbT, agreeing well with the bending modulus of the RBC membrane. Surprisingly, whereas RBCs become more rigid in HS, the excreted vesicles of a patient with this blood disorder have a significantly (~50%) lower bending modulus than donor EVs. These results shed new light on the mechanism and effects of EV budding and may underlie the reported increase in vesiculation and stiffening of RBCs in hereditary spherocytosis patients.",

We show that the ratio of the number of non-synonymous and synonymous polymorphisms is negatively correlated to the number of synonymous polymorphisms, even when the non-independence is accounted for. The relationship is such that the proportion of effectively neutral non-synonymous mutations increases by ~45% as Ne is halved. However, we also show that this relationship is steeper than expected from an independent estimate of the distribution of fitness effects from the site frequency spectrum. We investigate a number of potential explanations for this and show, using simulation, that this is consistent with a model of genetic hitch-hiking: genetic hitch-hiking depresses diversity at neutral and weakly selected sites, but has little effect on the diversity of strongly selected sites.",

    "abstract": "The present study was designed to identify genomic loci modulating the susceptibility of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in the BXD recombinant inbred mouse strain set. IOP was elevated by injecting magnetic microspheres into the anterior chamber and blocking the trabecular meshwork using a handheld magnet to impede drainage. The IOP was then measured over the next 21 days. Only animals with IOP greater than 25 mmHg for two consecutive days or an IOP above 30 mmHg on a single day after microsphere-injection were used in this study. On day 21, mice were sacrificed and the optic nerve was processed for histology. Axons were counted for both the injected and the control eye in 49 BXD strains, totaling 181 normal counts and 191 counts associated with elevated IOP. The axon loss for each strain was calculated and the data were entered into genenetwork.org. The average number of normal axons in the optic nerve across all strains was 54,788 {+/-} 16% (SD), which dropped to 49,545 {+/-} 20% in animals with artificially elevated IOP. Interval mapping demonstrated a relatively similar genome-wide map for both conditions with a suggestive Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) on proximal Chromosome 3. When the relative axon loss was used to generate a genome-wide interval map, we identified one significant QTL (p<0.05) on Chromosome 18 between 53.6 and 57 Mb. Within this region, the best candidate gene for modulating axon loss was Aldh7a1. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ALDH7A1 expression in mouse RGCs. ALDH7A1 variants were not significantly associated with glaucoma in the NEIGHBORHOOD GWAS dataset, but this enzyme was identified as part of the butanoate pathway previously associated with glaucoma risk. Our results suggest that genomic background influences susceptibility to RGC degeneration and death in an inducible glaucoma model.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) comprises at least 90% of total RNA extracted from mammalian tissue or cell line samples. Informative transcriptional profiling using massively parallel sequencing technologies requires either enrichment of mature poly-adenylated transcripts or targeted depletion of the rRNA fraction. The latter method is of particular interest because it is compatible with degraded samples such as those extracted from FFPE and also captures transcripts that are not poly-adenylated such as some non-coding RNAs. Here we provide a cross-site study that evaluates the performance of ribosomal RNA removal kits from Illumina, Takara/Clontech, Kapa Biosystems, Lexogen, New England Biolabs and Qiagen on intact and degraded RNA samples. We find that all of the kits are capable of performing significant ribosomal depletion, though there are differences in their ease of use. All kits were able to remove ribosomal RNA to below 20% with intact RNA and identify [~]14,000 protein coding genes from the Universal Human Reference RNA sample at >1FPKM. Analysis of differentially detected genes between kits suggests that transcript length may be a key factor in library production efficiency. These results provide a roadmap for labs on the strengths of each of these methods and how best to utilize them.",

    "abstract": "Cells adapt to shifts in their environment by remodeling transcription. Measuring changes in transcription at the genome scale is now routine, but defining the functional significance of individual genes within large gene expression datasets remains a major challenge. We applied a network-based algorithm to interrogate publicly available transcription data to predict genes that serve major functional roles in Caulobacter crescentus stress survival. This approach identified GsrN, a conserved small RNA that is directly controlled by the general stress sigma factor, {sigma}{tau}, and functions as a potent post-transcriptional regulator of survival under multiple stress conditions. GsrN expression is both necessary and sufficient to protect cells from hydrogen peroxide, where it functions by base pairing with the leader of katG mRNA and promoting catalase/peroxidase expression. We conclude that GsrN convenes a post-transcriptional layer of gene expression that serves a central functional role in stress physiology.",

Following branching, the 5'-exon remains paired to U5 snRNA loop 1, but the mechanism of 3'-splice site recognition during exon ligation has remained unclear. Here we present the 3.7[A] cryo-EM structure of the yeast P complex spliceosome immediately after exon ligation. The 3'-splice site AG dinucleotide is recognised through non-Watson-Crick pairing with the 5'-splice site and the branch point adenosine. A conserved loop of Prp18 together with the -finger and the RNaseH domain of Prp8 clamp the docked 3'-splice site and 3'-exon. The step 2 factors Prp18 and Slu7 and the C-terminal domain of Yju2 stabilise a conformation competent for 3'-splice site docking and exon ligation. The structure accounts for the strict conservation of the GU and AG dinucleotides of the introns and provides insight into the catalytic mechanism of exon ligation.",

    "abstract": "Combinatorial expansion by the cerebellar granule cell layer (GCL) is fundamental to theories of cerebellar contributions to motor control and learning. Granule cells sample approximately four mossy fiber inputs and are thought to form a combinatorial code useful for pattern separation and learning. We constructed a spatially realistic model of the cerebellar granule cell layer and examined how GCL architecture contributes to granule cell (GrC) combinatorial diversity. We found that GrC combinatorial diversity saturates quickly as mossy fiber input diversity increases, and that this saturation is in part a consequence of short dendrites, which limit access to diverse inputs and favor dense sampling of local inputs. This local sampling also produced GrCs that were combinatorially redundant, even when input diversity was extremely high. In addition, we found that mossy fibers clustering, which is a common anatomical pattern, also led to increased redundancy of GrC input combinations. We related this redundancy to hypothesized roles of temporal expansion of GrC information encoding in service of learned timing, and show that GCL architecture produces GrC populations that support both temporal and combinatorial expansion. Finally, we used novel anatomical measurements from mice of either sex to inform modeling of sparse and filopodia-bearing mossy fibers, finding that these circuit features uniquely contribute to enhancing GrC diversification and redundancy. Our results complement information theoretic studies of granule layer structure and provide insight into the contributions of granule layer anatomical features to afferent mixing.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCerebellar granule cells are among the simplest neurons, with tiny somata and on average just four dendrites. These characteristics, along with their dense organization, inspired influential theoretical work on the granule cell layer (GCL) as a combinatorial expander, where each granule cell represents a unique combination of inputs. Despite the centrality of these theories to cerebellar physiology, the degree of expansion supported by anatomically realistic patterns of inputs is unknown. Using modeling and anatomy, we show that realistic input patterns constrain combinatorial diversity by producing redundant combinations, which nevertheless could support temporal diversification of like-combinations, suitable for learned timing. Our study suggests a neural substrate for producing high levels of both combinatorial and temporal diversity in the GCL.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLesion load is a common biomarker in multiple sclerosis, yet it has historically shown modest associations with clinical outcomes. Lesion count, which encapsulates the natural history of lesion formation and is thought to provide complementary information, is difficult to assess in patients with confluent (i.e. spatially overlapping) lesions. We introduce a statistical technique for cross-sectionally counting pathologically distinct lesions.\\n\\nMethodsMRI is used to assess the probability of lesion at each location. The texture of this map is quantified using a novel technique, and clusters resembling the center of a lesion are counted.\\n\\nResultsValidity was demonstrated by comparing the proposed count to a gold-standard count in 60 subjects observed longitudinally. The counts were highly correlated (r = .97, p < .001) and not significantly different (t59 = -0.83, p > .40). Reliability was determined using 14 scans of a clinically stable subject acquired at 7 sites, and variability of lesion count was equivalent to that of lesion load. Accounting for lesion load and age, lesion count was negatively associated (t58 = -2.73, p < .01) with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Average lesion size had a higher association with EDSS (r =.35, p < .01) than lesion load (r = .10, p > .40) or lesion count (r = -.12, p > .30) alone.\\n\\nConclusionThese findings demonstrate that it is possible to recover important aspects of the natural history of lesion formation without longitudinal data, and suggest that lesion size provides complementary information about disease.\\n\\nGrant SupportThe project described was supported in part by the NIH grants R01 NS085211, R21 NS093349, and R01 NS094456 from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

    "abstract": "Voltage-dependent inward currents responsible for the depolarizing phase of action potentials were characterized in smooth muscle cells of 4th order arterioles in mouse skeletal muscle. Currents through L-type Ca2+ channels were expected to be dominant; however, action potentials were not eliminated in nominally Ca2+-free bathing solution or by addition of L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (10 M). Instead, Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 M) reduced the maximal velocity of the upstroke at low, but not at normal (2 mM), Ca2+ in the bath. The magnitude of TTX-sensitive currents recorded with 140 mM Na+ was about 20 pA/pF. TTX-sensitive currents decreased five-fold when Ca2+ increased from 2 to 10 mM. The currents reduced three-fold in the presence of 10 mM caffeine, but remained unaltered by 1 mM of isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX). In addition to L-type Ca2+ currents (15 pA/pF in 20 mM Ca2+), we also found Ca2+ currents that are resistant to 10 M nifedipine (5 pA/pF in 20 mM Ca2+). Based on their biophysical properties, these Ca2+ currents are likely to be through voltage-gated T-type Ca2+ channels. Our results suggest that Na+ and at least two types (T- and L-) of Ca2+ voltage-gated channels contribute to depolarization of smooth muscle cells in skeletal muscle arterioles. Voltage-gated Na+ channels appear to be under a tight control by Ca2+ signaling.",

One way to estimate head-direction is by integrating head angular-velocity over time. However, this process results in error accumulation resembling a random walk, proportional to [Formula], which constitutes a mark for a path integration process. In the present study we analyzed previously recorded data to quantify the drift in head-direction cells of rat pups before and after eye-opening. We found that in rat pups before eye-opening the drift propagated as a random walk, while in rats after eye-opening the drift was lower. This suggests that a path-integration process underlies the estimation of head-direction, such that before eye-opening the head-direction system runs in an open-loop manner and accumulates error. After eye-opening, visual-input, such as arena shape, helps to correct errors and thus compute the sense of direction accurately.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Sox family of transcription factors are present and conserved in the genomes of all metazoans examined to data and are known to play important developmental roles in vertebrates and insects. However, outside the commonly studied Drosophila model little is known about the extent or conservation of the Sox family in other arthropod species. Here we characterise the Sox family in two chelicerate species, the spiders Parasteatoda tepidariorum and Stegodyphus mimosarum, which have experienced a whole genome duplication (WGD) in their evolutionary history.\\n\\nResultsWe find that virtually all of the duplicate Sox genes have been retained in these spiders after the WGD. Analysis of the expression of Sox genes in P. tepidariorum embryos indicates that it is likely that some of these genes have neofunctionalised after duplication. Our expression analysis also strengthens the view that an orthologue of vertebrate Group B1 genes, SoxNeuro, is implicated in the earliest events of CNS specification in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In addition, a gene in the Dichaete/Sox21b class is dynamically expressed in the spider segment addition zone, suggestive of an ancient regulatory mechanism controlling arthropod segmentation as recently suggested for flies and beetles. Together with the recent analysis of Sox gene expression in the embryos of other arthropods, our findings are also indicative of conserved functions for some of these genes, including a role for SoxC and SoxD genes in CNS development, SoxF in limb development and a tantalising suggestion that SoxE genes may be involved in gonadogenesis across the metazoa.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study provides a new chelicerate perspective to understanding the evolution and function of Sox genes and how the retention of duplicates of such important tool-box genes after WGD has contributed to different aspects of spider embryogenesis. Future characterisation of the function of these genes in spiders will help us to better understand the evolution of the regulation of important developmental processes in arthropods and other metazoans including neurogenesis and segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Complexity is a fundamental attribute of life. Complex systems are made of parts that together perform functions that a single component, or subsets containing individual components, cannot. Examples of complex molecular systems include protein structures such as the F1Fo-ATPase, the ribosome, or the flagellar motor: each one of these structures requires most or all of its components to function properly. Given the ubiquity of complex systems in the biosphere, understanding the evolution of complexity is central to biology. At the molecular level, operons are a classic example of a complex system. An operons genes are co-transcribed under the control of a single promoter to a polycistronic mRNA molecule, and the operons gene products often form molecular complexes or metabolic pathways. With the large number of complete bacterial genomes available, we now have the opportunity to explore the evolution of these complex entities, by identifying possible intermediate states of operons. In this work, we developed a maximum parsimony algorithm to reconstruct ancestral operon states, and show a simple vertical evolution model of how operons may evolve from the individual component genes. We describe several ancestral states that are plausible functional intermediate forms leading to the full operon. We also offer Reconstruction of Ancestral Gene blocks Using Events or ROAGUE as a software tool for those interested in exploring gene block and operon evolution.\\n\\nThe software accompanying this paper is available under GPLv3 license in: https://github.com/nguyenngochuy91/Ancestral-Blocks-Reconstruction.\\n\\nAll figures in this paper are available in enlarged downloadable form from:https://github.com/nguyenngochuy91/Ancestral-Blocks-Reconstruction/tree/master/images",

Genetic variation in a single OR frequently associated with odorant perception, and we validated 10 cases in which in vitro OR function correlated with in vivo odorant perception using a functional assay. This more than doubles the published examples of this phenomenon. For eight of these 10 cases, reduced receptor function associated with reduced intensity perception. In addition, we used participant genotypes to quantify genetic ancestry and found that, in combination with single OR genotype, age and gender, we can explain between 10 and 20% of the perceptual variation in 15 olfactory phenotypes, highlighting the importance of single OR genotype, ancestry, and demographic factors in variation of olfactory perception.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Central corneal thickness (CCT) is one of the most heritable ocular traits and it is also a phenotypic risk factor for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). The present study uses the BXD Recombinant Inbred (RI) strains to identify novel quantitative trait loci (QTLs) modulating CCT in the mouse with the potential of identifying a molecular link between CCT and risk of developing POAG.\\n\\nMethods: The BXD RI strain set was used to define mammalian genomic loci modulating CCT, with a total of 818 corneas measured from 61 BXD RI strains (between 60-100 days of age). The mice were anesthetized and the eyes were positioned in front of the lens of the Phoenix Micron IV Image-Guided OCT system or the Bioptigen OCT system. CCT data for each strain was averaged and used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) modulating this phenotype using the bioinformatics tools on GeneNetwork (www.genenetwork.org). The candidate genes and genomic loci identified in the mouse were then directly compared with the summary data from a human primary open-angle glaucoma (POGA) genome wide association study (NEIGHBORHOOD) to determine if any genomic elements modulating mouse CCT are also risk factors for POAG.\\n\\nResults: This analysis revealed one significant QTL on Chr 13 and a suggestive QTL on Chr 7. The significant locus on Chr 13 (13 to 19 Mb) was examined further to define candidate genes modulating this eye phenotype. For the Chr 13 QTL in the mouse, only one gene in the region (Pou6f2) contained nonsynonymous SNPs. Of these five nonsynonymous SNPs in Pou6f2, two resulted in changes in the amino acid proline which could result in altered secondary structure affecting protein function. The 7 Mb region under the mouse Chr 13 peak distributes over 2 chromosomes in the human: Chr 1 and Chr 7. These genomic loci were examined in the NEIGHBORHOOD database to determine if they are potential risk factors for human glaucoma identified using meta-data from human GWAS. The top 50 hits all resided within one gene (POU6F2), with the highest significance level of p = 10-6 for SNP rs76319873. POU6F2 is found in retinal ganglion cells and in corneal limbal stem cells. To test the effect of POU6F2 on CCT we examined the corneas of a Pou6f2-null mice and the corneas were thinner than those of wild-type littermates. In addition, these POU6F2 RGCs die early in the DBA/2J model of glaucoma than most RGCs.\\n\\nConclusions: Using a mouse genetic reference panel, we identified a transcription factor, Pou6f2, that modulates CCT in the mouse. POU6F2 is also found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells and these RGCs are sensitive to injury.\\n\\nAuthors SummaryGlaucoma is a complex group of diseases with several known causal mutations and many known risk factors. One well-known risk factor for developing primary open angle glaucoma is the thickness of the central cornea. The present study leverages a unique blend of systems biology methods using BXD recombinant inbred mice and genome-wide association studies from humans to define a putative molecular link between a phenotypic risk factor (central corneal thickness) and glaucoma. We identified a transcription factor, POU6F2, that is found in the developing retinal ganglion cells and cornea. POU6F2 is also present in a subpopulation of retinal ganglion cells and in stem cells of the cornea. Functional studies reveal that POU6F2 is associated the central corneal thickness and with susceptibility of retinal ganglion cells to injury.",

    "abstract": "In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for thousands of phenotypes in large biobanks, most binary traits have substantially fewer cases than controls. Both of the widely used approaches, linear mixed model and the recently proposed logistic mixed model, perform poorly - producing large type I error rates - in the analysis of phenotypes with unbalanced case-control ratios. Here we propose a scalable and accurate generalized mixed model association test that uses the saddlepoint approximation (SPA) to calibrate the distribution of score test statistics. This method, SAIGE, provides accurate p-values even when case-control ratios are extremely unbalanced. It utilizes state-of-art optimization strategies to reduce computational time and memory cost of generalized mixed model. The computation cost linearly depends on sample size, and hence can be applicable to GWAS for thousands of phenotypes by large biobanks. Through the analysis of UK Biobank data of 408,961 white British European-ancestry samples for >1400 binary phenotypes, we show that SAIGE can efficiently analyze large sample data, controlling for unbalanced case-control ratios and sample relatedness.",

    "abstract": "A better understanding of antitumor immune responses is key to advancing the field of cancer immunotherapy. Endogenous immunity in cancer patients, such as circulating anticancer antibodies or tumor-reactive B cells, has been historically yet incompletely described. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-draining (sentinel) lymph node (SN) is a rich source for tumor-reactive B cells that give rise to systemic IgG anticancer antibodies circulating in the bloodstream of breast cancer patients. Using a synergistic combination of high-throughput B-cell sequencing and quantitative immunoproteomics, we describe the prospective identification of tumor-reactive SN B cells (based on clonal frequency) and also demonstrate an unequivocal link between affinity-matured expanded B-cell clones in the SN and antitumor IgG in the blood. This technology could facilitate the discovery of antitumor antibody therapeutics and conceivably identify novel tumor antigens. Lastly, these findings highlight the unique and specialized niche the SN can fill in the advancement of cancer immunotherapy.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEUsing high-throughput molecular cloning and antibody proteomics to study coordinated antitumor immunity in breast cancer patients, we simultaneously demonstrate that the sentinel lymph node is a localized source of expanded antitumor B cells undergoing affinity maturation and that their secreted antibodies are abundant as systemic IgG circulating in blood.",

    "abstract": "Chemoreceptors are localized at the cell poles of Escherichia coli and other rod-shaped bacteria. Over the years different mechanisms have been put forward to explain this polar localization; from stochastic clustering, membrane curvature driven localization, interactions with the Tol-Pal complex, to nucleoid exclusion. To evaluate these mechanisms, we monitored the cellular localization of the aspartate chemoreceptor Tar in different deletion mutants. We did not find any indication for either stochastic cluster formation or nucleoid exclusion. However, the presence of a functional Tol-Pal complex appeared to be essential to retain Tar at cell poles. This finding also implies that the curvature of cell poles does not attract chemoreceptor complexes. Interestingly, Tar still accumulated at midcell in tol and in pal deletion mutants. In these mutants, the protein appears to gather at the base of division septa, a region characterised by strong membrane curvature. Chemoreceptors, like Tar, form trimer-of-dimers that bend the cell membrane due to a rigid tripod structure with an estimated curvature of approximately 37 nm. This curvature approaches the curvature of the cell membrane generated during cell division, and localization of chemoreceptor tripods at curved membrane areas is therefore energetically favourable as it lowers membrane tension. Indeed, when we introduced mutations in Tar that abolish the rigid tripod structure, the protein was no longer able to accumulate at midcell or cell poles. These findings favour a model where chemoreceptor localization in E. coli is driven by strong membrane curvature and association with the Tol-Pal complex.\\n\\nImportanceBacteria have exquisite mechanisms to sense and to adapt to the environment they live in. One such mechanism involves the chemotaxis signal transduction pathway, in which chemoreceptors specifically bind certain attracting or repelling molecules and transduce the signals to the cell. In different rod-shaped bacteria, these chemoreceptors localize specifically to cell poles. Here, we examined the polar localization of the aspartate chemoreceptor Tar in E. coli, and found that membrane curvature at cell division sites and interaction with the Tal-pol protein complex, localize Tar at cell division sites, the future cell poles. This study shows how membrane curvature can guide localization of proteins in a cell.",

    "abstract": "Avoiding distraction by salient irrelevant stimuli is critical to accomplishing daily tasks. Regions of prefrontal cortex control attention by enhancing the representation of task-relevant information in sensory cortex, which can be measured directly in modulation of both single neurons and averaging of the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram [1,2]. However, when irrelevant information is particularly conspicuous, it may distract attention and interfere with the selection of behaviorally relevant information. Many studies have shown that that distraction can be minimized via top-down control [3-5], but the cognitive and neural mechanisms giving rise to this control over distraction remain uncertain and vigorously debated [6-8]. Bridging neurophysiology to electrophysiology, we simultaneously recorded neurons in prefrontal cortex and event-related potentials (ERPs) over extrastriate visual cortex to track the processing of salient distractors during a visual search task. Critically, we observed robust suppression of salient distractor representations in both cortical areas, with suppression arising in prefrontal cortex before being manifest in the ERP signal over extrastriate cortex. Furthermore, only prefrontal neurons that participated in selecting the task-relevant target also showed suppression of the task-irrelevant distractor. This suggests a common prefrontal mechanism for target selection and distractor suppression, with input from prefrontal cortex being responsible for both selecting task-relevant and suppressing task-irrelevant information in sensory cortex. Taken together, our results resolve a long-standing debate over the mechanisms that prevent distraction, and provide the first evidence directly linking suppressed neural firing in prefrontal cortex with surface ERP measures of distractor suppression.",

    "abstract": "Sensory neurons innervating the dental pulp have unique morphological and functional characteristics compared to neurons innervating other tissues. Stimulation of dental pulp afferents whatever the modality or intensity of the stimulus, even light mechanical stimulation that would not activate nociceptors in other tissues, produces an intense pain. These specific sensory characteristics could involve receptors of the Transient Receptor Potential channels (TRP) family. In this study, we evaluated 1) the expression of TRPA1 and TRPM8 receptors in trigeminal ganglion neurons innervating the dental pulp compared to sensory neurons innervating the oral mucosa or the skin of the face, and 2) the involvement of these receptors in dental pulp sensitivity to cold stimulation. We showed a similar expression of TRPM8 and CGRP in sensory neurons innervating the dental pulp, the skin or the oral mucosa. However, the proportion of neurons expressing TRPA1 was higher in the neuronal population innervating the mucosa (43%) than in the neuronal population innervating the dental pulp (19%) or the skin (24%). Moreover, neurons innervating the dental pulp had a higher proportion of large neurons (24%) compared to neurons innervating the skin (8%) or the mucosa (10%). The evaluation of the relation between TRPM8, TRPA1 and cold stimulation in trigeminal ganglion neuron culture, showed that a significant proportion of neurons innervating the skin (10%) or the mucosa (37%) were sensitive to cold stimulation but insensitive to TRPM8 and TRPA1 activation, indicating that perception of stimuli would be in part independent to TRPA1 and TRPM8 receptors. Similarly, the application of a cold stimulation on the tooth induced an overexpression of cFos in the trigeminal nucleus that was not prevented by administration of a TRPA1 antagonist or the genetic deletion of TRPM8. However, the pretreatment with the local anesthetic carbocaine abolish the cold-induced cFos overexpression. In conclusion, the unique sensory characteristics of the dental pulp would be independent to TRPA1 and TRPM8 expression and functionality.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacotherapy is substantially hindered by poor drug targeting, resulting in low specificity and efficacy. Here, we tested a novel, non-invasive targeting approach (termed functional-pharmacology), which couples drug administration with a task that activates the drugs sites-of-action in the brain, thus possibly improving absorption and efficacy. Methylphenidate (MPH) or Placebo were administered to healthy subjects, which then performed a cognitive induction or a control task. N-Back fMRI before and after drug-task coupling measured therapeutic effects. Only following MPH, subjects that performed better in the cognitive induction task showed greater improvements in N-back performance. Moreover, only under MPH-Cognitive induction condition, there existed a significant correlation between improved recruitment of N-Back rDLPFC activation, and a concurrent improvement in task performance. Importantly, mediation analysis suggested a causal role of rDLPFC activation in these coupling effects. Our results support the functional-pharmacology concept feasibility and efficacy, hence opening a new horizon for patient-tailored, context-driven drug therapy.",

    "abstract": "Potential clinical benefits of CBD-rich Cannabis extracts over purified CBD in treatment-resistant epilepsy: observational data meta-analysis\\n\\nDifferent therapies involving cannabinoid compounds have become popular on the past few years, particularly the use of canabidiol (CBD) based products for the treatment of child refractory epilepsy. In this segment we highlight genetic disorders such as the Dravet Syndrome, which has received a lot of attention in Brazil. Our country has been giving visibility for this issue after the public discussion regarding the patient Anne Fischer, who benefited from a treatment with hemp based products, imported from the United States of America as a nutritional supplement, and still unregistered in Brazil. To this moment there is no cannabinoid based product registered for clinical indication for epilepsy, so patients have at their disposal products considered nutritional supplements, in general produced from a type of Cannabis known as \\\"hemp\\\", which are commercialized in Brazil through medical prescription. Despite several anecdotal evidences from patients and family members, until now there is no consensus on medical literature over the efficacy and safety of these products. Some observational studies are available on scientific literature, but there is still a scarcity of clinical studies conducted under the logic, rigor and organization necessary for clinical trial dedicated to the register of a pharmaceutical product. The objective of this paper is to describe the analysis of several observational clinical studies available on the literature regarding the treatment of child refractory epilepsy with cannabinoid based products. Beyond attempting to establish the safety and efficacy of such products, when possible, the present analysis also intended to investigate if there is enough evidence between the different aspects of safety and efficacy between CBD enriched extracts compared to purified CBD products. Results: a systematic search for papers in the \\\"PubMed\\\" search system with the words \\\"Dravet\\\", \\\"Lennox-Gastaut\\\" and \\\"epilepsy\\\" combined with the terms \\\"Cannabis\\\", \\\"cannabinoid\\\" and \\\"child\\\" yielded 30 papers. From those, 24 were not considered for the systematic review, for not having valid content (13), for being opinion only papers (6), showed not clinical data (4) and reported different subjects (1), resulting in 6 valid papers published between 2013 and 2016. One additional study was in press at the moment of the search was added manually (1) resulting in 7 valid references for analysis, with an average impact factor of 5,9 (2,3 to 21,8). Public data from partial reports of controlled randomized studies conducted in order to register a medication (2) were also considered, when appropriated and were mentioned in the text. The categorical data were analyzed by the Fischer test. Overall, the papers analyzed report observational clinical data of 442 patients, treated with CBD rich extracts or purified CBD, with he average daily dose between 1 and 50 mg/kg, with treatment length from 3 to 12 months (average of 6,2 months). A considerable amount of 66% (292/442) of the patients reported improvement in the frequency of convulsive crisis. There were more reports of improvement from patients treated with purified CBD (242/285) than patients treated with purified CBD (68/157), with statistical significance (p<0,0001). Nevertheless, when the standard clinical threshold of a \\\"50% reduction or more in the frequency of convulsive crisis\\\" was applied, only 40% of the individuals are considered respondent, and there were no difference (p=0,57) between the treatments with extract (64/168) and purified CBD (65/157). However, even that both treatments have similar efficacy, the patients treated with CBD enriched extracts reported a lower average dose than purified CBD patients. The average CBD equivalent dose on the extracts was 7,1 mg/kg/day, while the purified CBD was 22,9 mg/kg/day, suggesting that CBD is about 3x more potent in the extract than in its purified form. Looking only at the data relative to genetic originated disorders, there is evidence of a superior efficacy on Dravet Syndrome patients (37/72, p=0,01), but not for Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (78/188, p=0,18), compared to the number of refractory epilepsy respondents in general (107/305). There is also an advantage of the CBD enriched extracts related to the occurrence of side effects. The report of mild side effects (109/285 vs. 291/346, p<0,0001) and severe (23/285 vs. 77/346, p<0,0001) are more frequent in products containing purified CBD than on CBD enriched extracts. Important to mention that these are the numbers of total reports of side effects, it is not possible to infer which fraction of these numbers are related to the treatment. In conclusion, this meta analysis suggests that treatments using CBD enriched extracts are more potent and have a better profile of adverse effects (but not more efficacy) than products containing purified CBD, at least in this population of patients with refractory epilepsy. The lack of standardization between extracts containing Cannabis does not allow us to infer directly which characteristics of the product that confer this therapeutic advantage, but it is likely related to other compounds present in the formulation that act sinergistically with CBD. Controlled studies with standardized Cannabis based extracts are necessary to confirm these observations.\\n\\n*Presented as an abstract and lecture to the 2017 CannMed event, at the Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA, in may 2017.",
