    "abstract": "When a decision is made based on a series of samples of evidence, the threshold for decision may change over time. Here we propose a fast heuristic algorithm that estimates the time-varying thresholds without making an assumption on their shape. The algorithm gives an approximate best estimate of the time-varying thresholds for all time considered when all other parameters are fixed. The algorithm outperforms conventional methods that gradually adjust the threshold estimates during fitting, when fitting time is limited.",

    "abstract": "During tissue development, multipotent progenitors differentiate into specific cell types in characteristic spatial and temporal patterns. We address the mechanism linking progenitor identity and differentiation rate in the neural tube, where motor neuron (MN) progenitors differentiate more rapidly than other progenitors. Using single cell transcriptomics, we define the transcriptional changes associated with the transition of neural progenitors into MNs. Reconstruction of gene expression dynamics from these data indicate a pivotal role for the MN determinant Olig2 just prior to MN differentiation. Olig2 represses expression of the Notch signaling pathway effectors Hes1 and Hes5. Olig2 repression of Hes5 appears to be direct, via a conserved regulatory element within the Hes5 locus that restricts expression from MN progenitors. These findings reveal a tight coupling between the regulatory networks that control patterning and neuronal differentiation, and demonstrate how Olig2 acts as the developmental pacemaker coordinating the spatial and temporal pattern of MN generation.",

    "abstract": "Plants often grow in clusters of various sizes and have a variable number of flowers per inflorescence. This small-scale spatial clustering affects insect foraging strategies and plant reproductive success. In our study, we aimed to determine how visitation rate and foraging behaviour of pollinators depend on the number of flowers per plant and on the size of clusters of multiple plants using Dracocephalum moldavica (Lamiaceae) as a target species. We measured flower visitation rate by observations of insects visiting single plants and clusters of plants with different numbers of flowers. Detailed data on foraging behaviour within clusters of different sizes were gathered for honeybees, Apis mellifera, the most abundant visitor of Dracocephalum in the experiments. We found that the total number of flower visitors increased with the increasing number of flowers on individual plants and in larger clusters, but less then proportionally. Although individual honeybees visited more flowers in larger clusters, they visited a smaller proportion of flowers, as has been previously observed. Consequently, visitation rate per flower and unit time peaked in clusters with an intermediate number of flowers. These patterns do not conform to expectations based on optimal foraging theory and the ideal free distribution model. We attribute this discrepancy to incomplete information about the distribution of resources. Detailed observations and video recordings of individual honeybees also showed that the number of flowers had no effect on handling time of flowers by honeybees. We evaluated the implications of these patterns for insect foraging biology and plant reproduction.",

While alternative splice forms can allow a single gene to encode several functional isoforms the question of how much spurious splicing is tolerated is still heavily debated.\\n\\nHere we gathered a compendium of 1,682 publicly available C. elegans RNA-seq datasets to increase the dynamic range of detection of RNA isoforms and obtained robust measurements of the relative abundance of each splicing event. While most of the splicing reads come from reproducibly detected splicing events, a large fraction of purported junctions are only supported by a very low number of reads. We devised an automated curation method that takes into account the expression level of each gene to discriminate robust splicing events from potential biological noise. We found that rarely used splice sites disproportionately come from highly expressed genes and are significantly less conserved in other nematode genomes than splice sites with a higher usage frequency.\\n\\nOur increased detection power confirmed trans-splicing for at least 84% of C. elegans protein coding genes. The genes for which trans-splicing was not observed are overwhelmingly low expression genes, suggesting that the mechanism is pervasive but not full captured by organism-wide RNA-Seq.\\n\\nWe generated annotated gene models including quantitative exon usage information for the entire C. elegans genome.

We demonstrate that these functional boundaries serve as a functional fingerprint of the individual animals, and can be achieved under anesthesia or awake conditions (rest, naturalistic viewing), though differences between awake and anesthetized states precluded the detection of individual differences across states. Comparison of awake and anesthetized states suggested a more nuanced picture of changes in connectivity for higher order association areas, as well as visual and motor cortex. These results establish feasibility and data requirements for the generation of reproducible individual-specific parcellations in NHP, as well as provide insights into the impact of scan state and motivate efforts toward harmonizing protocols.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptional regulatory structure of plant genomes remains poorly defined relative to animals. It is unclear how many cis-regulatory elements exist, where these elements lie relative to promoters, and how these features are conserved across plant species. We employed the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) in four plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, Solanum lycopersicum, and Oryza sativa) to delineate open chromatin regions and transcription factor (TF) binding sites across each genome. Despite 10-fold variation in intergenic space among species, the majority of open chromatin regions lie within 3 kb upstream of a transcription start site in all species. We find a common set of four TFs that appear to regulate conserved gene sets in the root tips of all four species, suggesting that TF-gene networks are generally conserved. Comparative ATAC-seq profiling of Arabidopsis root hair and non-hair cell types revealed extensive similarity as well as many cell type-specific differences. Analyzing TF binding sites in differentially accessible regions identified a MYB-driven regulatory module unique to the hair cell, which appears to control both cell fate regulators and abiotic stress responses. Our analyses revealed common regulatory principles among species and shed light on the mechanisms producing cell type-specific transcriptomes during development.",

Both cis- and trans-acting changes could accumulate and participate in complex interactions, so to isolate the cis-regulatory component of patterning evolution, we measured allele-specific spatial gene expression patterns in D. melanogaster x D. simulans hybrid embryos. RNA-seq of cryosectioned slices revealed 55 genes with strong spatially varying allele-specific expression, and several hundred more with weaker but significant spatial divergence. For example, we found that hunchback (hb), a major regulator of developmental patterning, had reduced expression specifically in the anterior tip of D. simulans embryos. Mathematical modeling of hb cis-regulation suggested that a mutation in a Bicoid binding site was responsible, which we verified using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. In sum, even comparing morphologically near-identical species we identified a substantial amount of spatial variation in gene expression, suggesting that development is robust to many such changes, but also that natural selection may have ample raw material for evolving new body plans via cis-regulatory divergence.",

    "abstract": "Individual alpha frequency (IAF) is a promising electrophysiological marker of interindividual differences in cognitive function. IAF has been linked with trait-like differences in information processing and general intelligence, and provides an empirical basis for the definition of individualised frequency bands. Despite its widespread application, however, there is little consensus on the optimal method for estimating IAF, and many common approaches are prone to bias and inconsistency. Here, we describe an automated strategy for deriving two of the most prevalent IAF estimators in the literature: peak alpha frequency (PAF) and centre of gravity (CoG). These indices are calculated from resting-state power spectra that have been smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter (SGF). We evaluate the performance characteristics of this analysis procedure in both empirical and simulated EEG datasets. Applying the SGF technique to resting-state data from n = 63 healthy adults furnished 61 PAF, and 62 CoG estimates. The statistical properties of these estimates were consistent with previous reports. Simulation analyses revealed that the SGF routine was able to reliably extract target alpha components, even under relatively noisy spectral conditions. The routine consistently outperformed a simpler method of automated peak detection that did not involve spectral smoothing. The SGF technique is fast, open-source, and available in two popular programming languages (MATLAB and Python), and thus can easily be integrated within the most popular M/EEG toolsets (EEGLAB, FieldTrip and MNE-Python). As such, it affords a convenient tool for improving the reliability and replicability of future IAF-related research.",

    "abstract": "Bio-macromolecules carry out complicated functions through structural changes. To understand their mechanism of action, the structure of each step has to be characterized. While classical structural biology techniques allow the characterization of a few  structural snapshots along the enzymatic cycle (usually of stable conformations), they do not cover all (and often fast interconverting) structures in the ensemble, where each may play an important functional role. Recently, several groups have demonstrated that structures of different conformations in solution could be solved by measuring multiple distances between different pairs of residues using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and using them as constrains for hybrid/integrative structural modeling. However, this approach is limited in cases where the conformational dynamics is faster than the techniques temporal resolution. In this study, we combine existing tools that elucidate sub-millisecond conformational dynamics together with hybrid/integrative structural modeling to study the conformational states of the transcription bubble in the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP)-promoter open complex (RPo). We measured microsecond alternating laser excitation sALEX)-smFRET of differently labeled lacCONS promoter dsDNA constructs. We used a combination of burst variance analysis (BVA), photon-by-photon hidden Markov modelling (H2MM) and the FRET-restrained positioning and screening (FPS) approach to identify two conformational states for RPo. The experimentally-derived distances of one conformational state match the known crystal structure of bacterial RPo. The experimentally-derived distances of the other conformational state have characteristics of a scrunched RPo. These findings support the hypothesis that sub-millisecond dynamics in the transcription bubble are responsible for transcription start site selection.",

    "abstract": "The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the influenza A virus replicates and transcribes the viral genome segments in the nucleus of the host cell. To transcribe these viral genome segments, the RdRp  snatches capped RNA oligonucleotides from nascent host cell mRNAs and aligns these primers to the ultimate or penultimate nucleotide of the segments for the initiation of viral mRNA synthesis. It has been proposed that this initiation process is not processive and that the RdRp uses a prime-realign mechanism during transcription. Here we provide in vitro evidence for the existence of this transcriptional prime-realign mechanism, but show that it only functions efficiently for primers that are short or can not stably base pair with the template. In addition, we demonstrate that transcriptional elongation is dependent on the priming loop of the PB1 subunit of the RdRp. We propose that the prime-realign mechanism may be used to rescue abortive transcription initiation events or cope with sequence variation among primers. Overall, these observations advance our mechanistic understanding of how the influenza A virus initiates transcription correctly and efficiently.\\n\\nImportanceThe influenza A virus causes severe disease in humans and is considered a major global health threat. The virus replicates and transcribes its genome using an enzyme called the RNA polymerase. To ensure that the genome is amplified faithfully and abundant viral mRNAs are made for viral protein synthesis, the viral RNA polymerase must transcribe the viral genome efficiently. In this report, we characterise a structure inside the polymerase that contributes to the efficiency of viral mRNA synthesis.",

The control mtDNA methylation profile exhibited a two-peak frequency distribution, with most CpG sites showing either no methylation, or a methylation above 7%.

    "abstract": "Deciphering the potential of non-coding loci to influence gene regulation has been the subject of intense research, with important implications in understanding genetic underpinnings of human diseases. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) can measure regulatory activity of thousands of DNA-sequences and their variants in a single experiment. With increasing number of publically available MPRA datasets, one can now develop data-driven models which, given a DNA-sequence, predict its regulatory activity. Here, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of several MPRA datasets in a variety of cellular contexts. We first applied an ensemble of methods to predict MPRA output in each context and observed that the most predictive features are consistent across datasets. We then demonstrate that predictive models trained in one cellular context can be used to predict MPRA output in another, with loss of accuracy attributed to cell-type specific features. Finally, we show that our approach achieves top performance in the Fifth Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation \"Regulation Saturation\" Challenge for predicting effects of single nucleotide variants. Overall, our analysis provides insights into how MPRA data can be leveraged to highlight functional regulatory regions throughout the genome and can guide effective design of future experiments by better prioritizing regions of interest.",

    "abstract": "Sensory maps are representations of the sensory epithelia in the brain. Despite the intuitive explanatory power behind sensory maps as being neuronal precursors to sensory perception, and sensory cortical plasticity as a neural correlate of perceptual learning, molecular mechanisms that regulate map plasticity are not well understood. Here we perform a meta-analysis of transcriptional and translational changes during altered whisker use to nominate the major molecular correlates of experience-dependent map plasticity in the barrel cortex. We argue that brain plasticity is a systems level response, involving all cell classes, from neuron and glia to non-neuronal cells including endothelia. Using molecular pathway analysis, we further propose a gene regulatory network that could couple activity dependent changes in neurons to adaptive changes in neurovasculature, and finally we show that transcriptional regulations observed in major brain disorders target genes that are modulated by altered sensory experience. Thus understanding the molecular mechanisms of experience-dependent plasticity of sensory maps might help to unravel the cellular events that shape brain plasticity in health and disease.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIExperience alters gene transcription in all major cell types of the brain\\nC_LIO_LIGene expression profile during brain plasticity is cell-type specific\\nC_LIO_LITemporal profile of gene expression is dynamic, regulated by recent experience\\nC_LIO_LINeural activity-dependent gene regulation might cause neurovascular reorganization\\nC_LIO_LIGenes that are regulated by experience are commonly dysregulated in brain disorders\\nC_LI",

Among the signals of ancestry deviation that we find in the Fula, an historically pastoralist ethnic group from the Gambia, are the region that encodes the lactose persistence phenotype, LCT/MCM6, which has the highest proportion of Eurasian ancestry in the genome. The region with the lowest proportion of non-African ancestry is across DARC, which encodes the Duffy null phenotype and is protective for Plasmodium vivax malaria.

    "abstract": "A game theoretic treatment is introduced to explore the role of nutrition of the gut bacterial microflora as a potential pro-biotic therapy. Rational design of functional foods and nutraceuticals has far reaching public health and therapeutic benefits. Understanding ecological dynamics and how phenotypic manipulations of microbe-microbe interactions of the gut microbiota can provide direct health benefit is currently a fundamental question in bioengineering and more widely in the food, diet and health industries. This work considers a hypothetical adjustment of the microbiome by introducing a transgenic bacterial species that contributes to increased exposure of omega 3 fats in the gut by converting them from the omega 6 fats, dominant in the Western diet. The ratio of the two fats circulating in blood are risk markers, indicators of metabolic syndrome and related conditions. In this work, we consider nutritional exposure to a pro-biotic, a live culture of transgenic bacteria contributing omega 3 fats from omega 6 in the diet. Maintaining a long-term co-existence between native (indigenous) and transgenic bacteria is a challenge. Game theory is the appropriate tool for handling this conflict. The long-term co-existence is guaranteed if the two strains engage in the Snowdrift game. Our game theoretic treatment provides the basis of a model mechanism for prophylactic nutritional therapy for metabolic syndrome by the transgenic bacteria, providing support of indigenous gut microbiota and additional supplementation of a pro-biotic.",

We functionally validated our RNA-seq findings with a HIF-1 transcription factor activity reporter line and pharmaceutical inhibition of HIF-1 in mammosphere and organoid formation assays.\\n\\nResults2.5M cadmium reduced primary and secondary mammosphere formation and branching structure organoid formation rates by 33%, 40%, and 83%, respectively. Despite no changes in mammosphere formation, 0.25M cadmium treatment inhibited branching organoid formation in hydrogels by 68%. RNA-seq revealed that cadmium treatment downregulated genes associated with extracellular matrix formation and EMT, while upregulating genes associated with metal response including metallothioneins and zinc transporters. In the RNA-seq data, cadmium treatment also downregulated HIF-1 target genes including LOXL2, ZEB1, and VIM. Cadmium treatment significantly inhibited HIF-1 activity in a luciferase assay, and the HIF-1 inhibitor acriflavine ablated mammosphere and organoid formation.\\n\\nDiscussionThese findings show that cadmium, at doses relevant to human exposure, inhibited human mammary gland development, potentially through disruption of HIF-1 activity. These findings do not support cadmium being a breast cancer initiator via induction of stem cell proliferation, but instead implicate cadmium as an inhibitor of mammary gland morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Primary infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) results in a lifelong infection due to its ability to establish latent infection, one characterized viral reservoir being hematopoietic cells. Although reactivation from latency causes serious disease in immunocompromised individuals, our molecular understanding of latency is limited. Here, we delineate viral gene expression during natural HCMV persistent infection by analyzing the massive RNA-seq atlas generated by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. This systematic analysis reveals that HCMV persistence in-vivo is prevalent in diverse tissues. Unexpectedly, we find only viral transcripts that resemble gene expression during stages of lytic infection with no evidence of any highly restricted latency-associated viral gene expression program. To further define the transcriptional landscape during HCMV latent infection, we also used single cell RNA-seq and a tractable experimental latency model. In contrast to current views on latency, we also find no evidence for a specific restricted latency-associated viral gene expression program. Instead, we reveal that latency-associated gene expression largely mirrors a late lytic viral program albeit at much lower levels of expression. Overall, our work has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of HCMV persistence and suggests that latency is governed mainly by quantitative changes, with a limited number of qualitative changes, in viral gene expression.",

PRC2 catalyzes mono-, di-and trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27), with H3K27me2/3 being strongly associated with silenced genes. We demonstrate that EZH1 and EZH2, the two mutually exclusive catalytic subunits of PRC2, are differentially activated by various mechanisms. While both PRC2-EZH1 and PRC2-EZH2 are able to catalyze monomethylation, only PRC2-EZH2 is strongly activated by allosteric modulators and specific chromatin substrates to catalyze di-and trimethylation of H3K27. However, we also show that a PRC2 associated protein, AEBP2, can stimulate the activity of both complexes through a mechanism independent of and additive to allosteric activation. These results have strong implications regarding the cellular requirements for and accompanying adjustments in PRC2 activity, given the difference in the expression of EZH1 and EZH2 upon cellular differentiation.",

Using data from a Barley breeding program in Finland, we construct an in-silico experiment to study the viability of GxE prediction under practical constraints. We show that the response to the environment of a new generation of untested Barley cultivars can be predicted in new locations and years using genomic data, machine learning and historical weather observations for the new locations. Our results highlight the need for models of GxE: non-linear effects clearly dominate linear ones and the interaction between the soil type and daily rain is identified as the main driver for GxE for Barley in Finland. Our study implies that genomic selection can be used to capture the yield potential in GxE effects for future growth seasons, providing a possible means to achieve yield improvements, needed for feeding the growing population.",

    "abstract": "High throughput amplicon sequencing (HTAS) of conserved DNA regions is a powerful technique to characterize microbial communities. Recently, spike-in mock communities have been used to measure accuracy of sequencing platforms and data analysis pipelines. To assess the ability of sequencing platforms and data processing pipelines using fungal ITS amplicons, we created two ITS spike-in control mock communities composed of cloned DNA in plasmids: a biological mock community (BioMock), consisting of ITS sequences from fungal taxa, and a synthetic mock community (SynMock), consisting of non-biological ITS-like sequences. Using these spike-in controls we show that: 1) a non-biological synthetic control (e.g., SynMock) is the best solution for parameterizing bioinformatics pipelines, 2) pre-clustering steps for variable length amplicons are critically important, 3) a major source of bias is attributed to initial PCR reactions and thus HTAS read abundances are typically not representative of starting values. We developed AMPtk, a versatile software solution equipped to deal with variable length amplicons and quality filter HTAS data based on spike-in controls. While we describe herein a non-biological synthetic mock community for ITS sequences, the concept and AMPtk software can be widely applied to any HTAS dataset to improve data quality.\\n\\nAvailability and Implementation - AMPtk is publically available at https://github.com/nextgenusfs/amptk.

    "abstract": "The parasite Giardia lamblia interacts with its host by directly attaching the lumen of the small intestine. Attachment is mediated by a cytoskeletal structure termed the ventral disc and proceeds in four distinct stages: skimming, seal formation, cell body contacts, and bare area contacts. The precise mechanism of disc-mediated attachment is unclear and attachment models rely heavily on whether or not the ventral disc is a dynamic structure. We sought to investigate the second stage of attachment in which a seal is formed beneath the ventral disc. Three-dimensional, live imaging of Giardia expressing specific ventral disc markers to the lateral crest, ventral groove, and disc body indicate dynamic movement in all of these regions. We observe seal formation by the lateral crest and determine that movement of the ventral groove region aids lateral crest seal formation. We also report the discovery of a new protein that is necessary for ventral disc formation and functional attachment (DAP_7268). Lastly, we observed that attachment largely depends on ventral disc ultrastructure as flattened discs display hindered attachment proficiency whether or not they retain the ability to form a seal. We propose a synthesized mechanism for attachment that includes flagellar hydrodynamic flow to help generate suction as well as disc conformational dynamics to aid in both hydrodynamic flow and the maintenance of negative pressure.",

However, it remains unclear how neurons can provide a stable representation of external stimuli given their history-dependent responses. Here we show that a stable representation is maintained if efficiency is optimized by a population of neurons rather than by neurons individually. We show that spike-frequency adaptation and E/I balanced recurrent connectivity emerge as solutions to a global cost-accuracy tradeoff. The network will re-distribute sensory responses from highly excitable neurons to less excitable neurons as the cost of neural activity increases. This does not change the representation at the population level, despite causing dynamic changes in individual neurons. By applying this framework to an orientation coding network, we reconcile neural and behavioral findings. Our approach underscores the common mechanisms behind the diversity of neural adaptation and its role in producing a reliable representation of the stimulus while minimizing metabolic cost.",

    "abstract": "Metabolite-responsive RNA regulators with kinetically-controlled responses are widespread in nature. By comparison, very limited success has been achieved creating kinetic control mechanisms for synthetic RNA aptamer devices. Here, we show that kinetically-controlled RNA aptamer ribosensors can be engineered using a novel approach for multi-state, co-transcriptional folding design. The design approach was developed through investigation of 29 candidate p-aminophenylalanine-responsive ribosensors. We show that ribosensors can be transcribed in situ and used to analyze metabolic production directly from engineered microbial cultures, establishing a new class of cell-free biosensors. We found that kinetically-controlled ribosensors exhibited 5-10 fold greater ligand sensitivity than a thermodynamically-controlled device. And, we further demonstrated that a second aptamer, promiscuous for aromatic amino acid binding, could be assembled into kinetic ribosensors with 45-fold improvements in ligand selectivity. These results have broad implications for engineering RNA aptamer devices and overcoming thermodynamic constraints on molecular recognition through the design of kinetically-controlled responses.",

    "abstract": "IscX (or YfhJ) is a protein of unknown function which takes part in the iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery, a highly specialised and essential metabolic pathway. IscX binds to iron with low affinity and interacts with IscS, the desulfurase central to cluster assembly. Previous studies have suggested a competition between IscX and CyaY, the bacterial ortholog of frataxin, for the same binding surface of IscS. This competition could suggest a link between the two proteins with a functional significance. Using a hybrid approach, we show here that IscX is a modulator of the inhibitory properties of CyaY: by competing for the same site on IscS, the presence of IscX rescues the rates of enzymatic cluster formation which are inhibited by CyaY. The effect is stronger at low iron concentrations, whereas it becomes negligible at high iron concentrations. These results strongly suggest that iron-sulfur cluster assembly is an exquisite example of an enzymatic process which requires a double regulation under the control of iron as the effector.",

    "abstract": "Kinetoplastids have a nucleus that contains the nuclear genome and a kinetoplast that contains the mitochondrial genome. These single-copy organelles must be duplicated and segregated faithfully to daughter cells at each cell division. In Trypanosoma brucei, although duplication of both organelles starts around the same time, segregation of the kinetoplast precedes that of the nucleus. Cytokinesis subsequently takes place so that daughter cells inherit a single copy of each organelle. Very little is known about the molecular mechanism that governs the timing of these events. Furthermore, it is thought that T. brucei lacks a spindle checkpoint that delays the onset of nuclear division in response to spindle damage. Here we show that a mitotic cyclin CYC6 has a dynamic localization pattern during the cell cycle, including kinetochore localization from G2 to metaphase. Using CYC6 as a molecular cell cycle marker, we confirmed that T. brucei cannot delay the onset of anaphase in response to a bipolar spindle assembly defect. Interestingly, expression of a stabilized form of CYC6 caused the nucleus to arrest in a metaphase-like state without preventing cytokinesis. We propose that trypanosomes have an ability to regulate the timing of nuclear division by modulating the CYC6 protein level, without a spindle checkpoint.",

    "abstract": "Poly(ADP ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) target cancer cells deficient in homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In preclinical models, PARPi resistance is tied to altered nucleolytic processing (resection) at the 5 ends of a DSB. For example, loss of 53BP1 or Rev7/MAD2L2/FANCV derepresses resection to drive PARPi resistance, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. Long-range resection can be catalyzed by two machineries: the exonuclease Exo1, or the combination of a RecQ helicase and Dna2. Here, we develop a single cell microscopy assay that allows the distinct phases and machineries of resection to be interrogated simultaneously in living S. pombe cells. Using this assay, we find that the 53BP1 orthologue and Rev7 specifically repress long-range resection through the RecQ helicase-dependent pathway, thereby preventing hyper-resection. These results suggest that \\\"rewiring\\\" of BRCA1-deficient cells to employ an Exo1-independent hyper-resection pathway is a driver of PARPi resistance.",

Severe AS is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting approximately 5% of those over 70 years of age1,2,3. Little is known about the genetics of AS, although recently a variant at the LPA locus4 and a rare MYH6 missense variant were found to associate with AS5. We report a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) with a follow-up in up to 7,307 AS cases and 801,073 controls. We identified two new AS loci, on chromosome 1p21 near PALMD (rs7543130; OR=1.20, P=1.2x10-22) and on chromosome 2q22 in TEX41 (rs1830321; OR=1.15, P=1.8x10-13).

    "abstract": "The egg production of poultry depends on follicular development and selection. However, the mechanism of selecting the priority of hierarchical follicles is completely unknown. Smad9 is one of the important transcription factors in BMP/Smads pathway and involved in goose follicular initiation. To explore its potential role in goose follicle hierarchy determination, we first blocked Smad9 expression using BMP typereceptor inhibitor LDN-193189 both in vivo and in vitro. Unexpectedly, LDN-193189 administration could dramatically suppress Smad9 level and elevate egg production (7.08 eggs / bird, P< 0.05) of animals, and the estradiol (E2) and luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) level were significantly increased (P< 0.05), but the progesterone (P4) and follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) mRNA remain unchanged. Surprisingly, Smad9 knockdown notably attenuated (P< 0.05) in E2, P4, FSHR and LHR level in goose granulosa cells (gGCs). Further chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay of gGCs revealed that Smad9, served as a sensor of balance, bound to the LHR promoter regulating its transcription. These findings demonstrated that Smad9 is differentially expressed in goose follicles, and acts as a key player in controlling goose follicular selection.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTTo study the hierarchical development mechanism of avian follicle, new strategies can be found to improve the egg production of low-yielding poultry, such as geese.",

The complexity of SSc cardiac manifestations is not fully captured by the current clinical SSc classification, which is based on extent of skin involvement and specific autoantibodies. Therefore, we sought to develop a clinically relevant SSc cardiac disease classification to improve clinical care and increase understanding of SSc cardiac disease pathobiology. We hypothesized that machine learning could identify novel SSc cardiac disease subgroups, and that gene expression assessment of skin could provide insights into molecular pathogenesis of these SSc pheno-groups.\\n\\nMethodsWe used unsupervised model-based clustering (phenomapping) of SSc patient echocardiographic and clinical data to identify clinically relevant SSc pheno-groups in a discovery cohort (n=316), and validated these findings in an external SSc validation cohort (n=67). Cox regression was used to evaluate survival differences among groups. Gene expression profiles from skin biopsies from a subset of SSc patients (n=68) and controls (n=18) were analyzed with weighted gene co-expression network analyses to identify gene modules that were associated with cardiac pheno-groups and echocardiographic parameters.\\n\\nResultsFour SSc cardiac pheno-groups were identified with distinct profiles. Pheno-group #1 displayed a predominant cutaneous phenotype without cardiac involvement; pheno-group #2 had long-standing SSc with limited skin and cardiac involvement; pheno-group #3 had diffuse skin involvement, a high frequency of interstitial lung disease (88%), and significant right heart remodeling/dysfunction; and pheno-group #4 had prolonged SSc disease duration, limited skin involvement, and marked biventricular cardiac involvement.

A metabolome analysis resulted in the identification of 83 putative compounds, one of them was the nine carbon saturated dicarboxylic acid azelaic acid which for several reasons was decided to further study. Firstly azelaic acid, which is a straight chained nine-carbon (C9) saturated dicarboxylic acid, has been reported in plants as mobile signal that primes systemic defenses. Secondly its structure, which is associated with fatty acid biosynthesis, is similar to other known bacterial QS signals like the Diffusible Signal Facor (DSF). Analytical and structural studies by NMR spectroscopy confirmed that in the PSA spent supernatant azelaic acid was present. Quantification studies further revealed that 20 {micro}g/L of azelaic acid was present and was also found in spent supernatants of several other P. syringae pathovars.

Prediction errors provide a possible explanation for repetition suppression, where evoked neural activity is attenuated across repeated presentations of the same stimulus. The predictive coding account argues repetition suppression arises because repeated stimuli are expected, whereas non-repeated stimuli are unexpected and thus elicit larger neural responses. Here we employed electroencephalography in humans to test the predictive coding account of repetition suppression by presenting sequences of visual gratings with orientations that were expected either to repeat or change in separate blocks of trials. We applied multivariate forward modelling to determine how orientation selectivity was affected by repetition and prediction. Unexpected stimuli were associated with significantly enhanced orientation selectivity, whereas selectivity was unaffected for repeated stimuli. Our results suggest that repetition suppression and expectation have separable effects on neural representations of visual feature information.",

The endodermis is initially specified in meristem but further differentiates to form Casparian strips (CSs), the apoplastic barrier in the mature zone for the selective transport between stele and outer tissues, and thus is regarded as plant inner skin. In the Arabidopsis thaliana root the transcription factors SHORTROOT (SHR) regulate asymmetric cell division in cortical initials to separate endodermal and cortex cell layer. In this paper, we utilized synthetic approach to examine the reconstruction of fully functional Casparian strips in plant roots. Our results revealed that SHR serves as a master regulator of a hierarchical signaling cascade that, combined with stele-derived small peptides, is sufficient to rebuild the functional CS in non-endodermal cells. This is a demonstration of the deployment of two parallel signaling systems, in which both apoplastic and symplastic communication were employed, for coordinately specifying the endodermal cell fate.",

Here, we adapt optimization algorithms from machine learning to rapidly screen and design gene circuits capable of performing arbitrary functions. We demonstrate the power of this approach by designing circuits (1) that recapitulate important in vivo phenomena, such as oscillators, and (2) to perform complex tasks for synthetic biology, such as counting noisy biological events.

Spectral analysis was applied to responses recorded from sensors overlying six hierarchical cortical sources involved in visual processing. Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of evoked and induced source-space responses was used to investigate propofols effects on connectivity between regions.\\n\\nResultsPropofol produced a wideband reduction in evoked power following TMS in five out of six electrodes. Bayesian Model Selection supported a DCM with hierarchical feedforward and feedback connections to best fit the data. DCM of induced responses revealed that the primary effect of propofol was impaired feedforward responses in cross frequency theta/alpha-gamma coupling and within frequency theta coupling (F contrast, Family Wise Error corrected p<0.05). An exploratory analysis (thresholded at uncorrected p<0.001) also suggested that propofol impaired feedforward and feedback beta band coupling.

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding the factors that influence human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake is critically important to design effective vaccination programmes. In Switzerland, completed HPV vaccination by age 16 years among women ranges from 30 to 79% across 26 cantons (states). Our objective was to identify factors that are associated with the spatial variation in HPV vaccination uptake.\\n\\nMethods and findingsWe used data from the Swiss National Vaccination Coverage Survey 2009-2016 on HPV vaccination status ([&ge;]1 dose) of 14-17 year old girls, their municipality of residence and their nationality for 21 of 26 cantons (N=8,965). We examined covariates at municipality level: language, degree of urbanisation, socio-economic position, religious denomination, results of a vote about vaccination laws; and, at cantonal level, availability of school-based vaccination and survey period. We used a series of conditional auto regressive (CAR) models to assess the effects of covariates while accounting for variability between cantons and municipal-level spatial autocorrelation. In the best-fit model, school-based vaccination (adjusted odds ratio, OR: 2.51, 95% credible interval, CI: 1.77-3.56) was associated with increased uptake, while lower acceptance of vaccination laws was associated with lower HPV vaccination uptake (OR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.50-0.73). Overall, the covariates explained 88% of the municipal-level variation in uptake.\\n\\nConclusionsIn Switzerland, cantons play a prominent role in the variation in HPV vaccination uptake, especially through the provision of school-based vaccination delivery. HPV vaccination uptake is also strongly associated with inhabitants attitudes towards vaccination. To increase uptake, efforts should be made both to mitigate vaccination scepticism and to encourage school-based vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Antigenic targets of influenza vaccination are currently seen to be polarised between (i) highly immunogenic (and protective) epitopes of high variability, and (ii) conserved epitopes of low immunogenicity. This requires vaccines directed against the variable sites to be continuously updated, with the only other alternative being seen as the artificial boosting of immunity to invariant epitopes of low natural efficacy. However, theoretical models suggest that the antigenic evolution of influenza is best explained by postulating the existence of highly immunogenic epitopes of limited variability. Here we report the identification of such an epitope of limited variability in the head domain of the H1 haemagglutinin protein. We show that the epitope mediates immunity to historical influenza strains not previously seen by a cohort of young children. Furthermore, vaccinating mice with these epitope conformations can induce immunity to all the human H1N1 influenza strains that have circulated since 1918. The identification of epitopes of limited variability offers a mechanism by which a universal influenza vaccine can be created; these vaccines would also have the potential to protect against newly emerging influenza strains.",

    "abstract": "Most emerging human infectious diseases have an animal origin. Yet, while zoonotic diseases originate from a primary reservoir, most theoretical studies have principally focused on single-host processes, either exclusively humans or exclusively animals, without considering the importance of animal to human transmission for understanding the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases. Here we aim to investigate the importance of spillover transmission for explaining the number and the size of outbreaks. We propose a simple stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with a recurrent infection of an incidental host from a reservoir (e.g. humans by a zoonotic species), considering two modes of transmission, (1) animal-to-human and (2) human-to-human. The model assumes that (i) epidemiological processes are faster than other processes such as demographics or pathogen evolution and (ii) that an epidemic occurs until there are no susceptible individuals left. The results show that during an epidemic, even when the pathogens are barely contagious, multiple outbreaks are observed due to spillover transmission. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the only consideration of direct transmission between individuals is not sufficient to explain the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in an incidental host.",

    "abstract": "Admixture between populations provides opportunity to study biological adaptation and phenotypic variation. Admixture studies rely on local ancestry inference for admixed individuals, which consists of computing at each locus the number of copies that originate from ancestral source populations. Existing software packages for local ancestry inference are tuned to provide accurate results on human data and recent admixture events. Here, we introduce Loter, an open-source software package that does not require any biological parameter besides haplotype data in order to make local ancestry inference available for a wide range of species. Using simulations, we compare the performance of Loter to HAPMIX, LAMP-LD, and RFMix. HAPMIX is the only software severely impacted by imperfect haplotype reconstruction. Loter is the less impacted software by increasing admixture time when considering simulated and admixed human genotypes. For simulations of admixed Populus genotypes, Loter and LAMP-LD are robust to increasing admixture times by contrast to RFMix. When comparing length of reconstructed and true ancestry tracts, Loter and LAMP-LD provide results whose accuracy is again more robust than RFMix to increasing admixture times. We apply Loter to individuals resulting from admixture between Populus trichocarpa and Populus balsamifera and lengths of ancestry tracts indicate that admixture took place around 100 generations ago. We expect that providing a rapid and parameter-free software for local ancestry inference will make more accessible genomic studies about admixture processes.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation for partner quality in mutualisms is an evolutionary paradox. One possible resolution to this puzzle is that there is a tradeoff between partner quality and other fitness-related traits. Here, we tested whether a susceptibility to parasitism is one such tradeoff in the mutualism between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia). We performed two greenhouse experiments with the legume Medicago truncatula. In the first, we inoculated each plant with the rhizobia Ensifer meliloti and with one of 40 genotypes of the parasitic root-knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla. In the second experiment, we inoculated all plants with rhizobia and half of the plants with a genetically variable population of nematodes. Using the number of nematode galls as a proxy for infection severity, we found that plant genotypes differed in susceptibility to nematode infection, and nematode genotypes differed in infectivity. Second, we showed that there was a genetic correlation between the number of mutualistic structures formed by rhizobia (nodules) and the number of parasitic structures formed by nematodes (galls). Finally, we found that nematodes disrupt the rhizobia mutualism: nematode-infected plants formed fewer nodules and had less nodule biomass than uninfected plants. Our results demonstrate that there is genetic conflict between attracting rhizobia and repelling nematodes in Medicago. If genetic conflict with parasitism is a general feature of mutualism, it could account for the maintenance of genetic variation in partner quality and influence the evolutionary dynamics of positive species interactions.\\n\\nImpact summaryCooperative species interactions, known as mutualisms, are vital for organisms from plants to humans. For example, beneficial microbes in the human gut are a necessary component of digestive health. However, parasites often infect their hosts via mechanisms that are extraordinarily similar to those used by mutualists, which may create a tradeoff between attracting mutualists and resisting parasites. In this study, we investigated whether this tradeoff exists, and how parasites impact mutualism function in the barrelclover Medicago truncatula, a close relative of alfalfa. Legumes like Medicago depend on nitrogen provided by mutualistic bacteria (rhizobia) to grow, but they are also infected by parasitic worms called nematodes, which steal plant nutrients. Both microorganisms live in unique structures (nodules and galls) on plant roots. We showed that the benefits of mutualism and the costs of parasitism are predicted by the number of mutualistic structures (nodules) and the number of parasitic structures (galls), respectively. Second, we found that there is a genetic tradeoff between attracting mutualists and repelling parasites in Medicago truncatula: plant genotypes that formed more rhizobia nodules also formed more nematode galls. Finally, we found that nematodes disrupt the rhizobia mutualism. Nematode-infected plants formed fewer rhizobia nodules and less total nodule biomass than uninfected plants. Our research addresses an enduring evolutionary puzzle: why is there so much variation in the benefits provided by mutualists when natural selection should weed out low-quality partners? Tradeoffs between benefits provided by mutualists and their susceptibility to parasites could resolve this paradox.",

    "abstract": "To mitigate the effects of heat and drought stress, a better understanding of the genetic control of physiological responses to these environmental conditions is needed. To this end, we evaluated an upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) mapping population under water-limited and well-watered conditions in a hot, arid environment. The elemental concentrations (ionome) of seed samples from the population were profiled in addition to those of soil samples taken from throughout the field site to better model environmental variation. The elements profiled in seeds exhibited moderate to high heritabilities, as well as strong phenotypic and genotypic correlations between elements that were not altered by the imposed irrigation regimes. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping results from a Bayesian classification method identified multiple genomic regions where QTL for individual elements colocalized, suggesting that genetic control of the ionome is highly interrelated. To more fully explore this genetic architecture, multivariate QTL mapping was implemented among groups of biochemically related elements. This analysis revealed both additional and pleiotropic QTL responsible for coordinated control of phenotypic variation for elemental accumulation. Machine learning algorithms that utilized only ionomic data predicted the irrigation regime under which genotypes were evaluated with very high accuracy. Taken together, these results demonstrate the extent to which the seed ionome is genetically interrelated and predictive of plant physiological responses to adverse environmental conditions.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryThe cotton seed ionome has a shared genetic basis that provides insight into the physiological status of the plant.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHigh-resolution genome-wide measurement of DNA methylation (DNAm) has become a widely used assay in biomedical research. A major challenge in measuring DNAm is variability introduced from intra-sample cellular heterogeneity, which is a convolution of DNAm profiles across cell types. When this source of variability is confounded with an outcome of interest, if unaccounted for, false positives ensue. This is particularly problematic in epigenome-wide association studies for human disease performed on whole blood, a heterogeneous tissue. To account for this source of variability, a first step is to determine the actual cell proportions of each sample. Currently, the most effective approach is based on fitting a linear model in which one assumes the DNAm profiles of the representative cell types are known. However, we can only make this assumption when a dedicated experiment is performed to provide a plug-in estimate for these profiles. Although this method works well in practice, technology-specific biases lead to platform-dependent plug-in profiles. As a result, to apply the current methods across technologies we are required to repeat these costly experiments for each platform.\\n\\nResultsHere, we present a method that accurately estimates cell proportions agnostic to platform by first using experimental data to identify regions in which each cell type is clearly methylated or unmethlyated and model these as latent states. While the continuous measurements used in the linear model approaches are affected by platform-specific biases, the latent states are biologically driven and therefore technology independent, implying that experimental data only needs to be collected once. We demonstrate that our method accurately estimates the cell composition from whole blood samples and is applicable across multiple platforms, including microarray and sequencing platforms.",

    "abstract": "Coastal sediments are rich in conductive minerals, which could impact microbial processes for which acetate is a central intermediate. In the methanogenic zone, acetate is consumed by methanogens and/or syntrophic acetate oxidizing (SAO) consortia. SAO consortia live under extreme thermodynamic pressure and their survival depends on successful partnership. Here we demonstrate that conductive minerals facilitate a SAO partnership between Geobacter and Methanosarcina from the coastal sediments of the Bothnian Bay, Baltic Sea. Bothnian methanogenic sediments showed a high apparent isotopic fractionation (c 1.07) characteristic of CO2-reductive methanogenesis. The native community was represented by electrogens such as Geobacter and methanogens like Methanosarcina. Upon the addition of conductive particles (activated carbon and magnetite) methanogenesis from acetate increased four fold. Geobacter (96% related to G. psychrophilus) and Methanosarcina (99% related to M. subterranea) dominated the conductive particle-spiked SAO communities. Using NanoSIMS we demonstrated that during SAO, Geobacter incorporated 82% of the labeled acetate as compared to only 18% by Methanosarcina. At the same time Geobacter converted 27% of the 13C-acetate to 13CO2 as detected by IRMS. Indigenous soluble shuttles were not involved in SAO, since spiking fresh cultures with spent-media filtrate had no effect on methanogenic rates. Our results demonstrate that Geobacter oxidizes acetate to CO2 while transferring electrons extracellularly via conductive particles to Methanosarcina, which utilizes them for CO2 reduction to methane. In natural environments, mediation of SAO by conductive particles between electrogens and methanogens could impact the iron and methane cycles.\\n\\nSignificanceAcetate oxidizing bacteria are known to thrive in mutualistic consortia in which H2 or formate is shuttled to a methane-producing Archaea partner. Here we discovered that they could instead transfer electrons via conductive minerals. Mineral-SAO (syntrophic acetate oxidation) could be a vital pathway for CO2-reductive methanogenesis in the environment, especially in sediments rich in conductive minerals. Mineral-SAO is therefore of potential importance for both iron and methane cycles in sediments and soils. Additionally, our observations imply that agricultural runoff or amendments with conductive chars could trigger a significant increase in methane emissions.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic bacterial uropathogen Proteus mirabilis can communicate identity through the export of the self-identity protein, IdsD, via the type VI secretion (T6S) system. Expression of the ids genes provides a fitness advantage during polymicrobial infections in a mouse infection model. Here we provide an answer to the unresolved question of how the activity of a T6S substrate, such as IdsD, is regulated before export. We demonstrate that IdsD is found in clusters that form independently of the T6S machinery and activity. We show that the protein IdsC, which is a member of the proposed DUF4123 chaperone family, is essential for the stability of these clusters as well as the IdsD protein itself. And we provide evidence that amino acid disruptions in IdsC are sufficient to disrupt IdsD export but not IdsD localization into stable subcellular clusters, strongly supporting that IdsC functions in at least two different ways: IdsD stabilization and IdsD export. We propose that IdsC, and likely other DUF4123-containing proteins, function to regulate T6S substrates before export by both stabilizing the protein and mediating export at the T6S machinery.",

    "abstract": "Altered states of consciousness, such as psychotic or pharmacologically-induced hallucinations, provide a unique opportunity to examine the mechanisms underlying conscious perception. However, the phenomenological properties of these states are difficult to isolate experimentally from other, more general physiological and cognitive effects of psychoactive substances or psychopathological conditions. Thus, simulating phenomenological aspects of altered states in the absence of these other more general effects provides an important experimental tool for consciousness science and psychiatry. Here we describe such a tool, the Hallucination Machine. It comprises a novel combination of two powerful technologies: deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and panoramic videos of natural scenes, viewed immersively through a head-mounted display (panoramic VR). By doing this, we are able to simulate visual hallucinatory experiences in a biologically plausible and ecologically valid way. Two experiments illustrate potential applications of the Hallucination Machine. First, we show that the system induces visual phenomenology qualitatively similar to classical psychedelics. In a second experiment, we find that simulated hallucinations do not evoke the temporal distortion commonly associated with altered states. Overall, the Hallucination Machine offers a valuable new technique for simulating altered phenomenology without directly altering the underlying neurophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Genomes contain millions of short (<100 codons) open reading frames (sORFs), which are usually dismissed during gene annotation. Nevertheless, peptides encoded by such sORFs can play important biological roles, and their impact on cellular processes has long been underestimated. Here, we analyzed approximately 70,000 transcribed sORFs in the model plant Physcomitrella patens (moss). Several distinct classes of sORFs that differ in terms of their position on transcripts and the level of evolutionary conservation are present in the moss genome. Over 5000 sORFs were conserved in at least one of ten plant species examined. Mass spectrometry analysis of proteomic and peptidomic datasets suggested that 584 sORFs located on distinct parts of mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are translated, including 73 conservative sORFs. Translational analysis of the sORFs and main ORFs at a single locus suggested the existence of genes that code for multiple proteins and peptides with tissue-specific expression. Alternative splicing is likely involved in the excision of translatable sORFs from such transcripts. We identified a group of sORFs homologous to known protein domains and suggested they function as small interfering peptides. Functional analysis of candidate lncRNA-encoded peptides showed it to be involved in regulating growth and differentiation in moss. The high evolutionary rate and wide translation of sORFs suggest that they may provide a reservoir of potentially active peptides and their importance as a raw material for gene evolution. Our results thus open new avenues for discovering novel, biologically active peptides in the plant kingdom.",

    "abstract": "SummarySedentary plant-parasitic cyst nematodes are obligate biotrophs that infect the roots of their host plant. Their parasitism is based on modification of root cells to form a hypermetabolic syncytium from which the nematodes draw their nutrients. The aim of this study was to identify nematode susceptibility genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and to characterize their roles in supporting the parasitism of Heterodera schachtii. By selecting genes that were most strongly upregulated in response to cyst nematode infection, we identified HIPP27 (HEAVY METAL-ASSOCIATED ISOPRENYLATED PLANT PROTEIN 27) as a host susceptibility factor required for beet cyst nematode infection and development. Detailed expression analysis revealed that HIPP27 is a cytoplasmic protein and that HIPP27 is strongly expressed in leaves, young roots and nematode-induced syncytia. Loss-of-function Arabidopsis hipp27 mutants exhibited severely reduced susceptibility to H. schachtii and abnormal starch accumulation in syncytial and peridermal plastids. Our results suggest that HIPP27 is a susceptibility gene in Arabidopsis whose loss-of-function reduces plant susceptibility to cyst nematode infection without increasing susceptibility to other pathogens or negatively affecting plant phenotype.",

Taking advantage of five published single-cell whole-genome and whole-exome cancer datasets, we studied the impact of sequencing depth and sampling effort towards single-cell variant detection, including structural and driver mutations, genotyping accuracy, clonal inference and phylogenetic reconstruction, using recent tools specifically designed for single-cell data.\\n\\nResultsAltogether, our results suggest that, for relatively large sample sizes (25 or more cells), sequencing single tumor cells at depths >5x does not drastically improve somatic variant discovery, the characterization of clonal genotypes or the estimation of phylogenies from single tumor cells.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that sequencing many individual tumor cells at a modest depth represents an effective alternative to explore the mutational landscape and clonal evolutionary patterns of cancer genomes, without the excessively high costs associated with high-coverage genome sequencing.",

We show that CapA is an abundant satDNA in Platyrrhini, whereas in the genomes of most eutherian mammals, including humans, this sequence is present only as a single copy located within a large intron of the NOS1AP (nitric oxid synthase 1 adaptor protein) Gene. Our data suggest that this intronic CapA-like sequence gave rise to the CapA satDNA and we discuss possible mechanisms implicated in this event.

Here, we investigated the dynamical properties of mouse olfactory bulb circuitry. Neurochemical activation or optogenetic stimulation of sensory afferents evoked persistent (minutes) gamma oscillations in the local field potential. These oscillations arose from slower, GABA(A) receptor-independent intracolumnar oscillators coupled by GABA(A)-ergic synapses into a faster, broadly coherent network oscillation. Consistent with the theoretical properties of coupled-oscillator networks, the spatial extent of zero-phase coherence was bounded in slices by the reduced density of lateral interactions. The intact in vivo network, however, exhibits long-range lateral interactions theoretically sufficient to enable zero-phase coherence across the complete network. These coupled-oscillator dynamics thereby establish a common clock, robust to biological heterogeneities, that is capable of supporting gamma-band phase coding across the spiking output of olfactory bulb principal neurons.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCell differentiation is driven by changes in transcription factor (TF) activity and subsequent alterations in transcription. To study this process, differences in TF binding between cell types can be deduced by methods that probe chromatin accessibility. We used cell type-specific nuclei purification followed by the Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) to delineate differences in chromatin accessibility and TF regulatory networks between stem cells of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and differentiated leaf mesophyll cells of Arabidopsis thaliana.\\n\\nResultsChromatin accessibility profiles of SAM stem cells and leaf mesophyll cells were highly similar at a qualitative level, yet thousands of regions of quantitatively different chromatin accessibility were also identified. We found that chromatin regions preferentially accessible in mesophyll cells tended to also be substantially accessible in the stem cells as compared to the genome-wide average, whereas the converse was not true. Analysis of genomic regions preferentially accessible in each cell type identified hundreds of overrepresented TF binding motifs, highlighting a set of TFs that are likely important for each cell type. Among these, we found evidence for extensive co-regulation of target genes by multiple TFs that are preferentially expressed in one cell type or the other. For example, a set of zinc-finger TFs appear to control a suite of growth-and development-related genes specifically in stem cells, while another TF set co-regulates genes involved in light responses and photosynthesis specifically in mesophyll cells. Interestingly, the TFs within both of these sets also show evidence of extensively co-regulating each other.\\n\\nConclusionsQuantitative analysis of chromatin accessibility differences between stem cells and differentiated mesophyll cells allowed us to identify TF regulatory networks and downstream target genes that are likely to be functionally important in each cell type. Our findings that mesophyll cell-enriched accessible sites tend to already be substantially accessible in stem cells, but not vice versa, suggests that widespread regulatory element accessibility may be important for the developmental plasticity of stem cells. This work also demonstrates the utility of cell type-specific chromatin accessibility profiling in quickly developing testable models of regulatory control differences between cell types.",

However, the complexity of potential epistatic interactions has limited approaches to this problem at any level. To develop practical strategies, we carried out a comprehensive experimental study of epistasis between all mutations that link two phenotypically distinct variants of the Entacmaea quadricolor fluorescent protein. The data demonstrate significant high-order epistatic interactions between mutations, but also reveals extraordinary sparsity, enabling novel experimental strategies and sequence-based statistical methods for learning the relevant epistasis. The sequence space linking the parental fluorescent proteins is functionally connected through paths of single mutations; thus, high-order epistasis in proteins is consistent with evolution through stepwise variation and selection. This work initiates a path towards characterizing epistasis in proteins in general.",

Coupling comparative genomics with biochemical and genetic approaches, we show that the alcoholic fermentation pathway was profoundly remodeled in the W/S clade, as genes required for alcoholic fermentation were lost and subsequently re-acquired from bacteria through horizontal gene transfer. We further show that the reinstated fermentative pathway is functional and that an enzyme required for sucrose assimilation is also of bacterial origin, reinforcing the adaptive nature of the genetic novelties identified in the W/S clade.
