    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is considered as a major source of innovation in bacteria, and as such is expected to drive adaptation to new ecological niches. However, among the many genes acquired through HGT along the diversification history of genomes, only a fraction may have actively contributed to sustained ecological adaptation. We used a phylogenetic approach accounting for the transfer of genes (or groups of genes) to estimate the history of genomes in Agrobacterium biovar 1, a diverse group of soil and plant-dwelling bacterial species. We identified clade-specific blocks of co-transferred genes encoding coherent biochemical pathways that may have contributed to the evolutionary success of key Agrobacterium clades. This pattern of gene co-evolution rejects a neutral model of transfer, in which neighbouring genes would be transferred independently of their function and rather suggests purifying selection on collectively coded acquired pathways. The acquisition of these synapomorphic blocks of co-functioning genes probably drove the ecological diversification of Agrobacterium and defined features of ancestral ecological niches, which consistently hint at a strong selective role of host plant rhizospheres.",

    "abstract": "The evolution and diversification of cell types is a key means by which animal complexity evolves. Recently, hierarchical clustering and phylogenetic methods have been applied to RNA-seq data to infer cell type evolutionary history and homology. A major challenge for interpreting this data is that cell type transcriptomes may not evolve independently due to correlated changes in gene expression. This non-independence can arise for several reasons, such as when different tissues share common regulatory sequences for regulating genes expressed in multiple tissues, i.e. pleiotropic effects of mutations. We develop a model to estimate the level of correlated transcriptome evolution (LCE) and apply it to different datasets. The results reveal pervasive correlated transcriptome evolution among different cell and tissue types. In general, tissues related by morphology or developmental lineage exhibit higher LCE than more distantly related tissues. Analyzing new data collected from bird skin appendages suggests that LCE decreases with the phylogenetic age of tissues compared, with recently evolved tissues exhibiting the highest LCE. Furthermore, we show correlated evolution can alter patterns of hierarchical clustering, causing different tissue types from the same species to cluster together. Using a dataset with sufficient taxon sampling, we performed a gene-wise estimation of LCE, identifying genes that most strongly contribute to the correlated evolution signal. Removing genes with high LCE allows for accurate reconstruction of evolutionary relationships among tissue types. Our study provides a statistical method to measure and account for correlated gene expression evolution when interpreting comparative transcriptome data.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) can be developed by computational approaches that infer regulator-target gene interactions from transcriptional assays. Successful algorithms that generate predictive, accurate TRNs enable the identification of regulator-target relationships in conditions where experimentally determining regulatory interactions is a challenge. Improving the ability of TRNs to successfully predict known regulator-target relationships in model species will enhance confidence in applying these approaches to determine regulator-target interactions in non-model species where experimental validation is challenging. Many transcriptional profiling experiments are performed across multiple time points; therefore we sought to improve regulator-target predictions by adjusting how time is incorporated into the network. We created ExRANGES, which incorporates Expression in a Rate-Normalized GEne Specific manner that adjusts how expression data is provided to the network algorithm. We tested this on a two different network construction approaches and found that ExRANGES prioritizes targets differently than traditional expression and improves the ability of these networks to accurately predict known regulator targets. ExRANGES improved the ability to correctly identify targets of transcription factors in large data sets in four different model systems: mouse, human, Arabidopsis, and yeast. Finally, we examined the performance of ExRANGES on a small data set from field-grown Oryza sativa and found that it also improved the ability to identify known targets even with a limited data set.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTo understand how organisms can turn a collection of genes into a physiological response, we need to understand how certain genes are turned on and off. In model organisms, the ability to identify direct targets of transcription factors via ChIP-Seq in a high-throughput manner has advanced our understanding of transcriptional regulatory networks and how organisms regulate gene expression. However, for non-model organisms, it remains a challenge to identify TF-target relationships through experimental approaches such as ChIP-Seq. Without this information, the ability to understand regulatory control is limited. Computational approaches to identify regulator-target relationships in silico from easily attainable transcriptional data offer a solution. Several approaches exist for identifying gene regulatory networks, including many that take advantage of time series data. Most of these approaches weigh the relationship between regulators and putative targets at all time points equally. However, many regulators may control a single target in response to different inputs. In our approach, we focus on the association between regulators and targets primarily at times when there is a significant change in expression. ExRANGES essentially weights the expression value of each time point by the slope change after that time point so that relationships between regulators and targets are emphasized at the time points when the transcript levels are changing. This change in input into network identification algorithms improves the ability to predict regulator-target interactions and could be applied to many different algorithms We hope this improvement will increase the ability to identify regulators of interest in non-model species.",

Using developmental, genetic, and illness-based RNA sequencing expression analysis, we characterized the human brain transcriptome around these loci and found enrichment for developmentally regulated genes with novel examples of shifting isoform usage across pre- and post-natal life. We found widespread expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), including many with transcript specificity and previously unannotated sequence that were independently replicated. We leveraged this eQTL database to show that 48.1% of risk variants for schizophrenia associated with nearby expression. Within patients and controls, we implemented a novel algorithm for RNA quality adjustment, and identified 237 genes significantly associated with diagnosis that replicated in an independent case-control dataset. These genes implicated synaptic processes and were strongly regulated in early development (p < 10-20). These data offer new targets for modeling schizophrenia risk in cellular systems.",

In practice, however, it is hardly possible to measure fitness for all genotypes in a natural population. Here, we present quantitative tools to make inferences about epistatic gene interactions when the fitness landscape is only incompletely determined due to imprecise measurements or missing observations. We demonstrate that genetic interactions can often be inferred from fitness rank orders, where all genotypes are ordered according to fitness, and even from partial fitness orders. We provide a complete characterization of rank orders that imply higher order epistasis. Our theory applies to all common types of gene interactions and facilitates comprehensive investigations of diverse genetic interactions. We analyzed various genetic systems comprising HIV-1, the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium vivax, the fungus Aspergillus niger, and the TEM-family of {beta}-lactamase associated with antibiotic resistance. For all systems, our approach revealed higher order interactions among mutations.",

We use Moore and Shannons \\\"network reliability\\\" statistic to measure the epidemic potential of a network. A number of networks are generated using exponential random graph models based on the properties of the contact network structure of one of the Add Health surveys. The expected number of infections on the original Add Health network is significantly different from that on any of the models derived from it. Because individual-level transmissibility and network structure are not separately identifiable parameters given population-level attack rate data it is possible to re-calibrate the transmissibility to fix this difference. However, the temporal behavior of the outbreak remains significantly different. Hence any estimates of the effectiveness of time dependent interventions on one network are unlikely to generalize to the other. Moreover, we show that in one case even a small perturbation to the network spoils the re-calibration. Unfortunately, the set of sufficient statistics for specifying a contact network model is not yet known. Until it is, estimates of the outcome of a dynamical process on a particular network obtained from simulations on a different network are not reliable.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing transcriptomes in non-model organisms has resulted in a massive increase in our understanding of biological phenomena. This boon, largely made possible via high-throughput sequencing, means that studies of functional, evolutionary and population genomics are now being done by hundreds or even thousands of labs around the world. For many, these studies begin with a de novo transcriptome assembly, which is a technically complicated process involving several discrete steps. The Oyster River Protocol (ORP), described here, implements a standardized and benchmarked set of bioinformatic processes, resulting in an assembly with enhanced qualities over other standard assembly methods. Specifically, ORP produced assemblies have higher TransRate scores and mapping rates, which is largely a product of the fact that it leverages a multi-assembler and kmer assembly process, thereby bypassing the shortcomings of any one approach. These improvements are important, as previously unassembled transcripts are included in ORP assemblies, resulting in a significant enhancement of the power of downstream analysis. Further, as part of this study, we show that assembly quality is unrelated to taxonomy, nor is it related to the number of reads generated, above 30 million reads.\\n\\nCode AvailabilityThe version controlled open-source code is available at https://github.com/macmanes-lab/Oyster_River_Protocol.

    "abstract": "Hippocampal damage results in profound retrograde, but no anterograde amnesia in contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Although the content learned in the latter have been discussed, the compensating regions were seldom proposed and never empirically addressed. Here, we employed network analysis of pCREB expression quantified from brain slices of rats with dorsal hippocampal lesion (dHPC) after undergoing CFC session. Using inter-regional correlations of pCREB-positive nuclei between brain regions, we modelled functional networks using different thresholds. The dHPC network showed small-world topology, equivalent to SHAM (control) network. However, diverging hubs were identified in each network. In a direct comparison, hubs in both networks showed consistently higher centrality values compared to the other network. Further, the distribution of correlation coefficients was different between the groups, with most significantly stronger correlation coefficients belonging to the SHAM network. These results suggest that dHPC network engaged in CFC learning is partially different, and engage alternative hubs. We next tested if pre-training lesions of dHPC and one of the new dHPC network hubs (perirhinal, Per; or disgranular retrosplenial, RSC, cortices) would impair CFC. Only dHPC-RSC, but not dHPC-Per, impaired CFC. Interestingly, only RSC showed a consistently higher centrality in the dHPC network, suggesting that the increased centrality reflects an increased functional dependence on RSC. Our results provide evidence that, without hippocampus, the RSC, an anatomically central region in the medial temporal lobe memory system might support CFC learning and memory.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYWhen determined cognitive performances are not affected by brain lesions of regions generally involved in that performance, the interpretation is that the remaining regions can compensate the damaged one. In contextual fear conditioning, a memory model largely used in laboratory rodents, hippocampal lesions produce amnesia for events occurred before, but not after the lesion, although the hippocampus is known to be important for new learning. Addressing compensation in animal models has always been challenging as it requires large-scale brain mapping. Here, we quantified 30 brain regions and used mathematical tools to model how a brain network can compensate hippocampal loss and learn contextual fear. We described that the damaged network preserved general interactivity characteristics, although different brain regions were identified as highly important for the network (e.g. highly connected). Further, we empirically validated our network model by performing double lesions of the hippocampus and the alternative hubs observed in the network models. We verified that double lesion of the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex, one of the hubs, impaired contextual fear learning. We provide evidence that without hippocampus, the remaining network relies on alternative important regions from the memory system to coordinate contextual fear learning.",

    "abstract": "By killing cattle and otherwise complicating management, the many species of larkspur (Delphinium spp.) present a serious, intractable, and complex challenge to livestock grazing management in the western United States. Among the many obstacles to improving our understanding of cattle-larkspur dynamics has been the difficulty of testing different grazing management strategies in the field, as the risk of dead animals is too great. Agent-based models (ABMs) provide an effective method of testing alternate management strategies without risk to livestock. ABMs are especially useful for modeling complex systems such as livestock grazing management, and allow for realistic bottom-up encoding of cattle behavior. Here, we introduce a spatially-explicit, behavior-based ABM of cattle grazing in a pasture with a dangerous amount of Geyers larkspur (D. geyeri). This model tests the role of herd cohesion and stocking density in larkspur intake, finds that both are key drivers of larkspur-induced toxicosis, and indicates that alteration of these factors within realistic bounds can mitigate risk. Crucially, the model points to herd cohesion, which has received little attention in the discipline, as playing an important role in lethal acute toxicosis. As the first ABM to model grazing behavior at realistic scales, this study also demonstrates the tremendous potential of ABMs to illuminate grazing management dynamics, including fundamental aspects of livestock behavior amidst ecological heterogeneity.",

While existing techniques summarize constraint for entire genes, single metrics cannot capture the fine-scale variability in constraint within each protein-coding gene. To provide greater resolution, we have created a detailed map of constrained coding regions (CCRs) in the human genome by leveraging coding variation observed among 123,136 humans from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). The most constrained coding regions in our map are enriched for both pathogenic variants in ClinVar and de novo mutations underlying developmental disorders. CCRs also reveal protein domain families under high constraint, suggest unannotated or incomplete protein domains, and facilitate the prioritization of previously unseen variation in studies of disease. Finally, a subset of CCRs with the highest constraint likely exist within genes that cause yet unobserved human phenotypes owing to strong purifying selection.",

By interacting with the GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) receptor, GA regulates the expression of a wide range of genes through different pathways. Here we report the systematic identification and classification of GID1s in 52 plants genomes, encompassing from bryophytes and lycophytes, to several monocots and eudicots. We investigated the evolutionary relationship of GID1s using a comparative genomics framework and found strong support a previously proposed phylogenetic classification of this family in land plants. We identified lineage-specific expansions of particular subfamilies (i.e. GID1ac and GID1b) in different eudicot lineages (e.g. GID1b in legumes). Further, we found both, shared and divergent structural features between GID1ac and GID1b subgroups in eudicots, which provide mechanistic insights on their functions. Gene expression data from several species show that at least one GID1 gene is expressed in every sampled tissue, with a strong bias of GID1b expression towards underground tissues and dry legume seeds (typically with low GA levels). Taken together, our results support that GID1ac retained canonical GA signaling roles, whereas GID1b specialized in conditions of low GA concentrations. We propose that this functional specialization occurred initially at the gene expression level and was later fine-tuned by specific mutations that conferred greater GA affinity to GID1b, including a Phe residue in the GA-binding pocket. Finally, we discuss the importance of our findings to understand the diversification of GA perception mechanisms in land plants.",

We use for this purpose the panel of 60 human cell lines (NCI-60) provided by the National Cancer Institute. Our study suggests that utilization of mathematical tools for network-based analysis can provide novel insights into drug response and cancer biology. We adopted a discrete notion of Ricci curvature to measure the robustness of biological networks constructed with a pre-treatment gene expression dataset and coupled the results with the GI50 response of the cell lines to the drugs. The link between network robustness and Ricci curvature was implemented using the theory of optimal mass transport. Our hypothesis behind this idea is that robustness in the biological network contributes to tumor drug resistance, thereby enabling us to predict the effectiveness and sensitivity of drugs in the cell lines. Based on the resulting drug response ranking, we assessed the impact of genes that are likely associated with individual drug response. For important genes identified, we performed a gene ontology enrichment analysis using a curated bioinformatics database which resulted in very plausible biological processes associated with drug response across cell lines and cell types from the biological and literature viewpoint. These results demonstrate the potential of using the mathematical network analysis in assessing drug response and in identifying relevant genomic biomarkers and biological processes for precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis and treatment of respiratory disorders are challenging and would benefit from new approaches to systematically assess ciliary beating dynamics and to test new drugs. A novel approach based on multiscale differential dynamic microscopy (multi-DDM) is shown to quantitatively assess collective beating of cilia in a non-biased automated manner, in human airway epithelial cells (HAECs) derived from subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) and grown in 2D air-liquid interface culture. Multi-DDM can readily detect changes in both ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and cilia coordination that result from perturbations to the mucosal layer. The efficacy of three CFTR-modulating treatments is investigated: ivacaftor (VX-770) with lumacaftor (VX-809), VX-809 alone and Thymosin alpha 1 (T1) alone. All three treatments restore coordination of cilia beating in the CF cells, albeit to varying degrees. We argue cilia are affected by these treatments through the physical properties of the mucus. Phenotyping cilia dynamics through multi-DDM provides novel insight into the response of ciliary beating following treatment with drugs, and has application in the broader context of respiratory disease and for drug screening.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryA semi-automated and unbiased assay based on multiscale differential dynamic microscopy (multi-DDM) detects changes in the coordination and frequency of ciliary beating in F508del/F508del primary human airway cells under different conditions and in response to CFTR-modulating compounds.",

Here, we measured the predictability of genome-wide evolutionary changes associated with a recent host shift in the Melissa blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa). We asked whether and to what extent genome-wide patterns of evolutionary change in nature could be predicted (1) by comparisons among instances of repeated evolution, and (2) from SNP x performance associations in a lab experiment. We delineated the genetic loci (SNPs) most strongly associated with host use in two L. melissa lineages that colonized alfalfa. Whereas most SNPs were strongly associated with host use in none or one of these lineages, we detected a ~two-fold excess of SNPs associated with host use in both lineages. Similarly, we found that host-associated SNPs in nature could also be partially predicted from SNP x performance (survival and weight) associations in a lab rearing experiment. But the extent of overlap, and thus degree of predictability, was somewhat reduced. Although we were able to predict (to a modest extent) the SNPs most strongly associated with host use in nature (in terms of parallelism and from the experiment), we had little to no ability to predict the direction of evolutionary change during the colonization of alfalfa. Our results show that different aspects of evolution associated with recent adaptation can be more or less predictable, and highlight how stochastic and deterministic processes interact to drive patterns of genome-wide evolutionary change.",

To determine its mechanism of action, we solved an atomic-resolution structure of ISRIB bound in a deep cleft within decameric human eIF2B by electron cryo-microscopy. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that formation of fully active, decameric eIF2B holoenzyme depended on the assembly of two identical tetrameric subcomplexes, and that ISRIB promoted this step by cross-bridging a central symmetry interface. Regulation of eIF2B assembly emerges as a rheostat for eIF2B activity that tunes translation during the ISR and that can be further modulated by ISRIB.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe identification of disease-related microRNAs(miRNAs) is an essential but challenging task in bioinformatics research. Similarity-based link prediction methods are often used to predict potential associations between miRNAs and diseases. In these methods, all unobserved associations are ranked by their similarity scores. Higher score indicates higher probability of existence. However, most previous studies mainly focus on designing advanced methods to improve the prediction accuracy while neglect to investigate the link predictability of the networks that present the miRNAs and diseases associations. In this work, we construct a bilayer network by integrating the miRNA-disease network, the miRNA similarity network and the disease similarity network. We use structural consistency as an indicator to estimate the link predictability of the related networks. On the basis of the indicator, a derivative algorithm, called structural perturbation method (SPM), is applied to predict potential associations between miRNAs and diseases.\\n\\nResultsThe link predictability of bilayer network is higher than that of miRNA-disease network, indicating that the prediction of potential miRNAs-diseases associations on bilayer network can achieve higher accuracy than based merely on the miRNA-disease network. A comparison between the SPM and other algorithms reveals the reliable performance of SPM which performed well in a 5-fold cross-validation. We test fifteen networks. The AUC values of SPM are higher than some well-known methods, indicating that SPM could serve as a useful computational method for improving the identification accuracy of miRNA-disease associations. Moreover, in a case study on breast neoplasm, 80% of the top-20 predicted miRNAs have been manually confirmed by previous experimental studies.\\n\\nAvailability and Implementationhttps://github.com/lecea/SPM-code.git\\n\\nContactlinyuan.lv@gmail.com, zouquan@nclab.net.\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

However, it is still debated whether the rhythmic activity emerges from network morphology developed in neurogenesis or as a result of neuronal dynamics realized under certain conditions. In this research we found, that in neural networks formed in mature hippocampal cultures with high cellular density the spiking activity self-organized and converged to long, complex and rhythmically repeated superbursts. The superburst lasted tens of seconds and consisted of hundreds of short (50-100 ms) small bursts with a high spiking rate of 139.0 {+/-} 78.6 Hz that can be associated with high-frequency oscillations in the hippocampus. In turn, the interval between peak burst activities in the range of 100-150 ms can be treated as a theta rhythm (11.2 {+/-} 1.5 Hz). Distribution of spikes within the bursts was non-random, representing a set of well-defined space-time base patterns or motifs. We found that the long superburst can be classified into two types. Each type was associated with a unique direction of spike propagation and, hence, can be encoded by a binary sequence with random switching between the two \\\"functional\\\" states. Such precisely structured bidirectional rhythmic activity developed in self-organizing cultured networks were quite similar to what observed in the in vivo experiments.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of high-throughput experimental methods has resulted in an abundance of large-scale molecular and functional interaction networks. The connectivity of these networks provide a rich source of information for inferring functional annotations for genes and proteins. An important challenge has been to develop methods for combining these heterogeneous networks to extract useful protein feature representations for function prediction. Most of the existing approaches for network integration use shallow models that cannot capture complex and highly-nonlinear network structures. Thus, we propose deepNF, a network fusion method based on Multimodal Deep Autoencoders to extract high-level features of proteins from multiple heterogeneous interaction networks. We apply this method to combine STRING networks to construct a common low-dimensional representation containing high-level protein features. We use separate layers for different network types in the early stages of the multimodal autoencoder, later connecting all the layers into a single bottleneck layer from which we extract features to predict protein function. We compare the cross-validation and temporal holdout predictive performance of our method with state-of-the-art methods, including the recently proposed method Mashup. Our results show that our method outperforms previous methods for both human and yeast STRING networks. We also show substantial improvement in the performance of our method in predicting GO terms of varying type and specificity.\\n\\nAvailabilitydeepNF is freely available at: https://github.com/VGligorijevic/deepNF",

We compare the recovery rate of Y-chromosome capture (YCC) alone, whole-genome capture followed by YCC (WGC+Y) versus non-enriched (pre-capture) libraries.\\n\\nResultsWe recovered 17-4,152 times more targeted unique Y-chromosome sequences after capture, where 0.01-6.2% (WGC+Y) and 0.01-23.5% (YCC) of the sequence reads were on-target, compared to 0.0002-0.004% pre-capture. In samples with endogenous DNA content greater than 0.1%, we found that WGC followed by YCC (WGC+Y) yields lower enrichment due to the loss of complexity in consecutive capture experiments, whereas in samples with lower endogenous content, WGC+Y yielded greater enrichment than YCC alone. Finally, increasing recovery of informative sites enabled us to assign Y-chromosome haplogroups to some of the archeological remains and gain insights about their paternal lineages and origins.\\n\\nConclusionsWe present to our knowledge the first in-solution capture-enrichment method targeting the human Y-chromosome in aDNA sequencing libraries. YCC and WGC+Y enrichments lead to an increase in the amount of Y-DNA sequences, as compared to libraries not enriched for the Y-chromosome. Our probe design effectively recovers regions of the Y-chromosome bearing phylogenetically informative sites, allowing us to identify paternal lineages with less sequencing than needed for pre-capture libraries. Finally we recommend considering the endogenous content in the experimental design and avoiding consecutive rounds of capture for low-complexity libraries, as clonality increases considerably with each round.",

    "abstract": "Many biological processes can be described geometrically in a simple way: stem cell differentiation can be represented as a branching tree and cell division can be depicted as a cycle. In this paper we introduce the geometric hidden Markov model (GHMM), a dynamical model whose goal is to capture the low-dimensional characteristics of biological processes from multivariate time series data. The framework integrates a graph-theoretical algorithm for dimensionality reduction with a latent variable model for sequential data. We analyzed time series data generated by an in silico model of a biomolecular circuit, the represillator. The trained model has a simple structure: the latent Markov chain corresponds to a two-dimensional lattice. We show that the short-term and long-term predictions of the GHMM reflect the oscillatory behaviour of the genetic circuit. Analysis of the inferred model with a community detection methods leads to a coarse-grained representation of the process.",

Clinicians could intervene during what may be a crucial stage for preventing permanent kidney injury if patients with incipient AKI and those at high risk of developing AKI could be identified.\\n\\nMethodsWe used a machine learning technique, boosted ensembles of decision trees, to train an AKI prediction tool on retrospective data from inpatients at Stanford Medical Center and intensive care unit patients at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. We tested the algorithms ability to detect AKI at onset, and to predict AKI 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours before onset, and compared its 3-fold cross-validation performance to the SOFA score for AKI identification in terms of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC).\\n\\nResultsThe prediction algorithm achieves AUROC of 0.872 (95% CI 0.867, 0.878) for AKI onset detection, superior to the SOFA score AUROC of 0.815 (P < 0.01).

While this stochastic behavior has been heavily exploited, full characterization of the underlying models can potentially drive forward further imaging methodologies. Under the assumption that fluorophores move between fluorescing and dark states as continuous time Markov processes, the goal is to use a sequence of images to select a model and estimate the transition rates. We use a hidden Markov model to relate the observed discrete time signal to the hidden continuous time process. With imaging involving several repeat exposures of the fluorophore, we show the observed signal depends on both the current and past states of the hidden process, producing emission probabilities that depend on the transition rate parameters to be estimated. To tackle this unusual coupling of the transition and emission probabilities, we conceive transmission (transition-emission) matrices that capture all dependencies of the model. We provide a scheme of computing these matrices and adapt the forward-backward algorithm to compute a likelihood which is readily optimized to provide rate estimates. When confronted with several model proposals, combining this procedure with the Bayesian Information Criterion provides accurate model selection.",

    "abstract": "Computational prediction of protein-protein complex structures facilitates a fundamental understanding of biological mechanisms and enables therapeutics design. Binding-induced conformational changes challenge all current computational docking algorithms by exponentially increasing the conformational space to be explored. To restrict this search to relevant space, some computational docking algorithms exploit the inherent flexibility of the protein monomers to simulate conformational selection from pre-generated ensembles. As the ensemble size expands with increased protein flexibility, these methods struggle with efficiency and high false positive rates. Here, we develop and benchmark a method that efficiently samples large conformational ensembles of flexible proteins and docks them using a novel, six-dimensional, coarse-grained score function. A strong discriminative ability allows an eight-fold higher enrichment of nearnative candidate structures in the coarse-grained phase compared to a previous method. Further, the method adapts to the diversity of backbone conformations in the ensemble by modulating sampling rates. It samples 100 conformations each of the ligand and the receptor backbone while increasing computational time by only 20-80%. In a benchmark set of 88 proteins of varying degrees of flexibility, the expected success rate for blind predictions after resampling is 77% for rigid complexes, 49% for moderately flexible complexes, and 31% for highly flexible complexes. These success rates on flexible complexes are a substantial step forward from all existing methods. Additionally, for highly flexible proteins, we demonstrate that when a suitable conformer generation method exists, RosettaDock 4.0 can dock the complex successfully.\\n\\nSignificancePredicting binding-induced conformational plasticity in protein backbones remains a principal challenge in computational protein-protein docking. To date, there are no methods that can reliably dock proteins that undergo more than 1 [A] root-mean-squared-deviation of the backbones of the interface residues upon binding. Here, we present a method that samples backbone motions and scores conformations rapidly, obtaining-for the first time-successful docking of nearly 50% of flexible target complexes with backbone conformational change up to 2.2 [A] RMSD. This method will be applicable to a broader range of protein docking problems, which in turn will help us understand biomolecular assembly and protein function.",

    "abstract": "By incorporating the information of human chromosome inferred from Hi-C experiments into a heteropolymer model of chromatin chain, we generate a conformational ensemble to investigate its spatiotemporal dynamics. The heterogeneous loci interactions result in hierarchical organization of chromatin chain, which obeys compact space-filling (SF) statistics at intermediate length scale. Remarkably, the higher order architecture of the chromatin, characterized by the single universal Flory exponent ({nu} = 1/3) for condensed homopolymers, provides quantitative account of the dynamical properties of the chromosome. The local chromosome structures, exemplified by topologically associated domains (~ 0.1 - 1 Mb), display dynamics with fast relaxation time ([lsim] 50 sec), whereas the long-range spatial reorganization of the entire chromatin [Formula] occurs on a much longer time scale ({gtrsim} hour), suggestive of glass-like behavior. This key finding provides the dynamic basis of cell-to-cell variability. Active forces, modeled using stronger isotropic white noises, accelerate the relaxation dynamics of chromatin domain described by the low frequency modes. Surprisingly, they do not significantly change the local scale dynamics from those under passive condition. By linking the spatiotemporal dynamics of chromosome with its organization, our study highlights the importance of physical constraints in chromosome architecture on the sluggish dynamics.\\n\\nSignificance StatementChromosomes are giant chain molecules made of hundreds of megabase-long DNA intercalated with proteins. Structure and dynamics of interphase chromatin in space and time hold the key to understanding the cell type-dependent gene regulation. In this study, we establish that the crumpled and space-filling organization of chromatin fiber in the chromosome territory, characterized by a single universal exponent used to describe polymer sizes, is sufficient to explain the complex spatiotemporal hierarchy in chromatin dynamics as well as the subdiffusive motion of the chromatin loci. While seemingly a daunting problem at a first glance, our study shows that relatively simple principles, rooted in polymer physics, can be used to grasp the essence of dynamical properties of the interphase chromatin.",

Biochemical studies have revealed key molecular components of transcription and their interactions, but the dynamics of transcription initiation in cells is still poorly understood. This state of affairs is being remedied with experiments that observe transcriptional dynamics in single cells using fluorescent reporters. Quantitative information about transcription initiation dynamics can also be extracted from experiments that use electron micrographs of RNA polymerases caught in the act of transcribing a gene (Miller spreads). Inspired by these data we analyze a general stochastic model of transcription initiation and elongation, and compute the distribution of transcription initiation times. We show that different mechanisms of initiation leave distinct signatures in the distribution of initiation times that can be compared to experiments. We analyze published micrographs of RNA polymerases transcribing ribosomal RNA genes in E.coli and compare the observed distributions of inter-polymerase distances with the predictions from previously hypothesized mechanisms for the regulation of these genes.

However, the potential of preclinical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor cancer growth and metastasis in non-mammalian in vivo models is not commonly used. We have here used MRI to measure primary neuroblastoma tumour size and presence of metastatic dissemination in a chick embryo model.

We measured the effect of microRNA overexpression on WT-CLS1, BT-12, and CHLA-06-ATRT.\\n\\nResultsWe found that WT-CLS1 demonstrates the histological, mutational, and transcriptional hallmarks of rhabdoid tumor. Because the microRNAs let-7 and miR-16 can target cyclin D genes, we next overexpressed each of these microRNAs in WT-CLS1. We found that miR-16 reduced cell accumulation.

    "abstract": "Patients diagnosed with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) have limited targeted therapeutic options. We report here the identification and characterisation of the transcriptional regulator, BCL11A, as a LUSC oncogene. Analysis of cancer genomics datasets revealed BCL11A to be upregulated in LUSC but not lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We demonstrated that knockdown of BCL11A in LUSC cell lines abolished xenograft tumour growth and its overexpression in vivo led to lung airway hyperplasia and the development of reserve cell hyperplastic lesions. In addition, deletion of Bcl11a in the tracheal basal cells abolished the development of tracheosphere organoids while its overexpression led to solid tracheospheres with a squamous phenotype. At the molecular level we found BCL11A to be a target of SOX2 and we show that it is required for the oncogenic role of SOX2 in LUSC. Furthermore, we showed that BCL11A and SOX2 interact at the protein level and that together they co-regulated the expression of several transcription factors. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of SETD8, a gene co-regulated by BCL11A and SOX2, alone or in combination with cisplatin treatment, shows significant selectivity to LUSC in comparison to LUAD cells. Collectively, these results indicate that the disruption of the BCL11A-SOX2 transcriptional program provides a future framework for the development of targeted therapeutic intervention for LUSC patients.",

    "abstract": "Activin A is a member of the TGF-{beta} superfamily and activates the transcription factors SMAD2/3 through the ALK4 type 1 receptor. Activin A has also been shown to activate SMAD1/5/8 through mutated variants of the type 1 receptor ALK2. Interestingly, we here show that both activin A and activin B could activate SMAD1/5/8 through endogenous wild type ALK2 in multiple myeloma cells. Knockdown of the type 2 receptor BMPR2 strongly potentiated activin A- and activin B-induced SMAD1/5/8 activation and subsequent cell death. Furthermore, activity of BMP6, BMP7 or BMP9, which also signal via ALK2, was potentiated by BMPR2 knockdown. Similar results were seen in HepG2 liver carcinoma cells. We propose that BMPR2 inhibited ALK2-mediated signaling by preventing ALK2 from oligomerizing with the type 2 receptors ACVR2A and ACVR2B, necessary for ALK2 activation by activins and several BMPs in these cells. In conclusion, BMPR2 could be explored as a possible target for therapy in patients with multiple myeloma.\\n\\nSummary StatementThe activation of SMAD1/5/8 via endogenous wild type ALK2 by activin A, activin B, and certain BMPs was enhanced when BMPR2 levels were knocked down.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, subsets of exported mRNAs are organized into large ribonucleoprotein (megaRNP) granules. How megaRNPs exit the nucleus is unclear, as their diameters are much larger than the nuclear pore complex (NPC) central channel. We previously identified a non-canonical nuclear export mechanism in Drosophila (Speese et al., Cell 2012) and mammals (Ding et al., in preparation), in which megaRNPs exit the nucleus by budding across nuclear envelope (NE) membranes. Here, we present evidence for a similar pathway in the nucleus of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, which contain morphologically similar granules bearing mRNAs. Wild-type yeast displayed these granules at very low frequency, but this frequency was dramatically increased when the non-essential NPC protein Nup116 was deleted. These granules were not artifacts of defective NPCs; a mutation in the exportin XPO1 (CRM1), in which NPCs are normal, induced similar megaRNP upregulation. We hypothesize that a non-canonical nuclear export pathway, analogous to those observed in Drosophila and in mammalian cells, exists in yeast, and that this pathway is upregulated for use when NPCs or nuclear export are impaired.\\n\\nSUMMARYDing et al., describe a non-canonical mRNA export pathway in budding yeast similar to that observed in Drosophila. This pathway appears upregulated when the NPC is impaired, nuclear envelope integrity is disrupted, or the export factor Xpo1 (CRM1) is defective.",

All the mutant INSR bound antibody. Eight mutants showed antibody-induced autophosphorylation while co-treatment with antibody and insulin increased maximal phosphorylation. After simultaneous knockdown of mouse Insr and expression of mutant INSR in 3T3-L1 adipocytes two antibodies activated signaling via AKT preferentially over signaling via ERK1/2 for seven mutants. Two antibodies (83-7 and 83-14) stimulated glucose uptake via P193L, S323L, F382V, and D707A mutant INSR, with antibody response greater than insulin response for D707A.

Together with global binding analysis obtained by foxd3 biotin-ChIP and single cell profiles of foxd3-expressing premigratory NC, our analysis shows that during early steps of NC formation, foxd3 acts globally as a pioneer factor to prime the onset of genes regulating NC specification and migration by re-arranging the chromatin landscape, opening cis-regulatory elements and reshuffing nucleosomes. Strikingly, foxd3 then switches from an activator to its canonical role as a transcriptional repressor. Taken together, these results demonstrate that foxd3 acts bimodally in the neural crest as a switch from permissive to repressive nucleosome/chromatin organisation to maintain stemness and define cell fates.",

    "abstract": "Incidence rates of non-communicable diseases in women are increasing worldwide and now contributing more to mortality and morbidity than reproductive health. Despite this universal trend, there is no recognition by the WHO of this phenomenon in womens health. Additionally, thyroid cancer is considered a non-sex specific cancer despite female incidence rates being triple those of males. To understand why there are such conceptual limitations to womens health, biomedicine - and its prevalence in western public health authorities - will be analysed from an anthropological perspective. In mind of these conceptual limitations, insights from evolutionary perspectives on health are introduced as well as how they may alleviate the conceptual barriers in the current biomedical paradigm. Using the example of breast cancer, the difference between a reproductive cancer in women, and cancer located in the reproductive tract will be explored. From this, the possibility that a cancer outside the reproductive tract can be directly influenced by reproductive function is explored in the specific case of thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer and current public health approaches to preventing malignancies of the thyroid are examined to show the limitations of their scope. Furthermore, evidence supporting the direct link between thyroid function and reproductive function is presented. Current academic studies into the link between thyroid cancer and womens reproductive function are analysed to show they are subject to the same conceptual limitations of womens reproductive function as found previously in biomedicine. To conclude, I will introduce a new hypothesis for exploring the impact of womens reproductive function on thyroid cancer incidence rates. This hypothesis will allow womens health to be viewed holistically, and allows reproductive function to be investigated beyond parity. Thus, the conceptual limitations of womens health in the public health paradigm will be alleviated.",

    "abstract": "Division of labor between reproductive queens and non-reproductive workers that perform brood care is the hallmark of insect societies. However, the molecular basis of this fundamental dichotomy remains poorly understood, in part because the caste of an individual cannot typically be experimentally manipulated at the adult stage. Here we take advantage of the unique biology of the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi, where reproduction and brood care behavior can be experimentally manipulated in adults. To study the molecular regulation of reproduction and brood care, we induced transitions between both states, and monitored brain gene expression at multiple time points. We found that introducing larvae that inhibit reproduction and induce brood care behavior caused much faster changes in adult gene expression than removing larvae. The delayed response to the removal of the larval signal prevents untimely activation of reproduction in O. biroi colonies. This resistance to change when removing a signal also prevents premature modifications in many other biological processes. Furthermore, we found that the general patterns of gene expression differ depending on whether ants transition from reproduction to brood care or vice versa, indicating that gene expression changes between phases are cyclic rather than pendular. Our analyses also identify genes with large and early expression changes in one or both transitions. These genes likely play upstream roles in regulating reproduction and behavior, and thus constitute strong candidates for future molecular studies of the evolution and regulation of reproductive division of labor in insect societies.",

With this in mind, we sought to determine if contemporary strains are established within the county or are annually imported. As part of this effort, we developed a new protocol for tiled amplicon sequencing of WNV to efficiently attain greater than 99% coverage of 14 WNV genomes collected directly from positive mosquito pools distributed throughout Maricopa County between 2014 and 2017. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses revealed that the contemporary genomes fall within two major lineages, NA/WN02 and SW/WN03. We found that all of the Arizona strains possessed a mutation known to be under positive selection (NS5-K314R), which has arisen independently four times. The SW/WN03 strains exhibited transient behavior, with at least 10 separate introductions into Arizona when considering both historical and contemporary strains. However, NA/WN02 strains are geographically differentiated and appear to be established in Arizona, with likely origins in New York. The clade of New York and Arizona strains looks to be the most ancestral extant lineage of WNV still circulating in the United States. The establishment of WNV strains in Maricopa County provides the first evidence of local overwintering by a WNV strain over the course of several years in Arizona.",

However, metabolic syndrome is mediated by a dysregulation of adiposity and therefore it is critical to study adipose tissue in order to understand the effects of this syndrome on epigenomes. To determine if natural variation in DNA methylation was associated with metabolic syndrome traits, we profiled global methylation levels in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue. We measured association between 32 clinical traits related to diabetes and obesity in 201 people from the Metabolic Syndrome In Men cohort. We performed epigenome-wide association studies between DNA methylation levels and traits, and identified associations for 13 clinical traits in 21 loci. We prioritized candidate genes in these loci using eQTL, and identified 18 high confidence candidate genes, including known and novel genes associated with diabetes and obesity traits. Using methylation deconvolution, we examined which cell types may be mediating the associations, and concluded that most of the loci we identified were specific to adipocytes. We determined whether the abundance of cell types varies with metabolic traits, and found that macrophages increased in abundance with the severity of metabolic syndrome traits. Finally, we developed a DNA methylation based biomarker to assess type II diabetes risk in adipose tissue. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that profiling DNA methylation in adipose tissue is a powerful tool for understanding the molecular effects of metabolic syndrome on adipose tissue, and can be used in conjunction with traditional genetic analyses to further characterize this disorder.",

Genomes of plant pathogens often encode major effect loci for the ability to successfully infect a specific host. Hence, heterogeneity in the host genotypes and abiotic factors leads to locally adapted pathogen populations. However, the genetic basis of local adaptation is poorly understood. We analyzed global field populations of Rhynchosporium commune, the pathogen causing barley scald disease, to identify candidate genes for local adaptation. Whole genome sequencing data generated for 125 isolates showed that the pathogen is subdivided into three genetic clusters associated with distinct geographic and climatic regions. Using haplotype-based selection scans applied independently to each genetic cluster, we found strong evidence for selective sweeps throughout the genome. Comparisons of loci under selection among clusters revealed little overlap, suggesting that ecological differences associated with each cluster led to variable selection regimes. The strongest signals of selection were found predominantly in the two clusters composed of isolates from Central Europe and Ethiopia. The strongest selective sweep regions encoded proteins with functions related to both biotic and abiotic stresses. We found that selective sweep regions were enriched in genes encoding functions in cellular localization, protein transport activity, and DNA damage responses. In contrast to the prevailing view that a small number of gene-for-gene interactions govern plant pathogen evolution, our analyses suggest that the evolutionary trajectory is largely determined by spatially heterogeneous biotic and abiotic selection pressures.",

Here we use a ribosome profiling strategy to investigate the translational landscape of human mRNAs with structured 5 untranslated regions (5-UTR).

We show that rG4-forming sequences are determinants of 5-UTR translation, suggesting that the folding of rG4 structures thwarts the translation of protein coding sequences (CDS) by stimulating the translation of repressive upstream open reading frames (uORFs). To support our model, we demonstrate that depletion of two rG4s-specialised DEAH-box helicases, DHX36 and DHX9, shifts translation towards rG4-containing uORFs reducing the translation of selected transcripts comprising proto-oncogenes, transcription factors and epigenetic regulators. Transcriptome-wide identification of DHX9 binding sites using individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) demonstrate that translation regulation is mediated through direct physical interaction between the helicase and its rG4 substrate. Our findings unveil a previously unknown role for non-canonical structures in governing 5-UTR translation and suggest that the interaction of helicases with rG4s could be considered as a target for future therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Recognition of nucleic acids results in the production of type I interferons (IFN), which activate the JAK/STAT pathway and promote the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). In a search for modulators of this pathway, we discovered a previously unknown requirement for cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) in the production of type I IFN following nucleic acid sensing and virus infection. Inhibition of CDK activity or knockdown of CDK levels leads to a striking block in STAT activation and ISG expression. CDKs are not required for the initial nucleic acid sensing leading to IFN-{beta} mRNA induction, nor for the response to exogenous IFN-/{beta}, but are critical for IFN-{beta} release into culture supernatants, suggesting a post-transcriptional role for CDKs in type I IFN production. In the absence of CDK activity, we demonstrate a translational block specific for IFN-{beta}, in which IFN-{beta} mRNA is removed from the actively translating polysomes, while the distribution of other cellular mRNAs or global translation rates are unaffected. Our findings reveal a critical role for CDKs in the translation of IFN-{beta}.",

From this data, we modelled a continuous lymphoid-to-NLT trajectory for Treg, and reconstructed the mechanisms of cell migration and NLT adaption. This revealed a shared transcriptional programme of NLT priming in both skin and colon-associated lymph nodes, followed by tissue-specific adaptation. Predicted migration kinetics were validated using a melanoma-induction model, emphasizing the relevance of key regulators and receptors, including Batf, Rora, Ccr8, Samsn1. Finally, we profiled human blood and NLT Treg and Tmem cells, identifying cross-mammalian conserved tissue signatures.

Although such devices have been developed by various labs, key parameters - the accuracy and precision of flow rate and the operational range - are not explicitly characterized. Here we report the development of multiplexed milliliter-scale chemostats where flow rates for eight chambers can be independently controlled to vary within a wide range, corresponding to population doubling times of 3~ 13 hours. Importantly, flow rates are precise and accurate without the use of expensive feedback systems. Among the eight chambers, the maximal coefficient of variation in flow rate is less than 3%, and average flow rates are only slightly below targets, i.e., 3-6% for 13-hour and 0.6-1.0% for 3-hour doubling times. This deficit is largely due to evaporation and should be correctable. We experimentally demonstrate that our device allows accurate and precise quantification of population phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is a common and often disabling condition, and is thought to involve a combination of peripheral and central neurobiological factors. However, the extent and nature of changes in the brain is poorly understood. Here, we investigated brain network architecture using resting state fMRI data collected from chronic back pain patients in UK and Japan (41 patients, 56 controls). Using a machine learning approach (support vector machine), we found that brain network patterns reliably classified chronic pain patients in a third, independent open data set with an accuracy of 63%, whilst 68% was attained in cross validation of all data. We then developed a deep learning classifier using a conditional variational autoencoder, which also yield yielded 63% generalisation and 68% cross-validation accuracy. Given the existence of reliable network changes, we next studied the graph topology of the network, and found consistent evidence of hub disruption based on clustering and betweenness centrality of brain nodes in pain patients. To examine this in more detail, we developed a multislice modularity algorithm to identify a consensus pattern of modular reorganisation of brain nodes across the entire data set. This revealed evidence of significant changes in the modular identity of several brain regions, most notably including broad regions of bilateral sensorimotor cortex, subregions of which also contributed to classifier performance. These results provide evidence of consistent and characteristic brain network changes in chronic pain, and highlight extensive reorganisaton of the network architecture of sensorimotor cortex.",

Here, we challenge this notion by demonstrating functional Nav1.4-Nav1.6 and Nav1.8 channels in human embryonic stem cell derived and mouse RPE. Importantly, we show that Navs are involved in photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis: blocking their activity significantly reduces the efficiency of this process. Consistent with this role, Nav1.8 co-localizes with the endosomal marker Rab7 and, during phagocytosis, with opsin. Nav1.4 localizes strongly to the cell-cell junctions together with the gap junction protein Connexin 43. During phagocytosis, both are localized to the phagosomes with a concurrent decrease in the junctional localization. Our study demonstrates that Navs give the capacity of fast electrical signaling to RPE and that Navs play a novel role in photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis.",

Here we use optical tweezers to characterize the motors mechanochemistry. Analysis of the motor response to external force at various nucleotide concentrations identifies phosphate release as the likely force-generating step. Analysis of SpoIIIE pausing indicates that pauses are off-pathway events. Characterization of SpoIIIE slipping behavior reveals that individual motor subunits engage DNA upon ATP binding. Furthermore, we find that SpolIIEs velocity exhibits an intriguing bi-phasic dependence on force. We hypothesize that this behavior is an adaptation of ultra-fast motors tasked with translocating DNA from which they must also remove DNA-bound protein roadblocks.

STIM1 also directly interacts with end binding protein 1 (EB1) at microtubule (MT) plus-ends and resembles comet-like structures during time-lapse imaging. Nevertheless, the role of STIM1-EB1 interaction in regulating SOCE remains unresolved. Using live-cell imaging combined with pharmacological perturbation and a reconstitution approach, we revealed that EB1 binding constitutes a diffusion trap mechanism restricting STIM1 targeting to ER-PM junctions. We further showed that STIM1 oligomers retain EB1 binding ability in ER Ca2+-depleted cells. EB1 binding delayed the translocation of STIM1 oligomers to ER-PM junctions and recaptured STIM1 to prevent excess SOCE and ER Ca2+ overload. Thus, the counterbalance of EB1 binding and PM targeting of STIM1 shapes the kinetics and amplitude of local SOCE in regions with growing MTs, and contributes to precise spatiotemporal regulation of Ca2+ signaling crucial for cellular functions and homeostasis.\\n\\nSummarySTIM1 activates store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) by translocating to endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane junctions.

    "abstract": "A dynamic systems approach can predict steady states in predator-prey interactions, but there are very few empirical tests of predictions from predator-prey models. Here, we examine the empirical evidence for the low-density steady state predicted by a Lotka-Volterra model of a crab-clam predator-prey system using data from long-term monitoring, a field survey, and a field experiment. We show that Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972 likely resulted in a phase shift to a low-density state for the soft-shell clam Mya arenaria, which was once a biomass dominant in Chesapeake Bay. This storm altered predator-prey dynamics between M. arenaria and the blue crab Callinectes sapidus, shifting from a system controlled from the bottom-up by prey resources, to a system controlled from the top-down by predation pressure on bivalves. Predator-prey models with these two species alone were capable of reproducing observations of clam densities and mortality rates, consistent with the idea that C. sapidus are a major driver of M. arenaria population dynamics. Over 40 y post-storm, M. arenaria densities hover near a low-density steady state predicted from the predator-prey model. Relatively simple models can predict phase shifts and identify alternative stable states, as shown by agreement between model predictions and field data in this system. The preponderance of multispecies interactions exhibiting nonlinear dynamics indicates that this may be a general phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Soft-shell clams, Mya arenaria, and razor clams, Tagelus plebeius, in Chesapeake Bay have declined since the 1970s, with severe declines since the 1990s. These declines are likely caused by multiple factors including warming, predation, habitat loss, recruitment limitation, disease, and harvesting. A bivalve survey in Chesapeake Bay examined influential factors on bivalve populations, focusing on predation (crabs, fish, and cownose rays), habitat (mud, sand, gravel, shell, or seagrass), environment (temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen), recruitment, and disease. M. arenaria and T. plebeius were found more often in habitats with complex physical structures (seagrass, shell) than any other habitat. Pulses in bivalve density associated with recruitment were attenuated through the summer and fall when predators are most active, indicating that predators likely influence temporal dynamics in these species. Presence of Mya arenaria, which is near the southern extent of its range in Chesapeake Bay, was negatively correlated with water temperature. Recruitment of M. arenaria in Rhode River, MD, declined between 1980 and 2016. Infection by the parasitic protist Perkinsus sp. was associated with stressful environmental conditions, bivalve size, and environmental preferences of Perkinsus sp, but was not associated with bivalve densities. It is likely that habitat loss, low recruitment, and predators are major factors keeping T. plebeius and M. arenaria at low densities in Chesapeake Bay. Persistence at low densities may be facilitated by habitat complexity (presence of physical structures), whereas further reductions in habitats such as seagrass and shell hash could result in local extinction of these important bivalve species.",

Here, we aimed to estimate a lower temporal bound for the emergence of conceptual representations by defining two criteria that characterize such representations: 1) conceptual object representations should generalize across different exemplars of the same object, and 2) these representations should reflect high-level behavioral judgments. To test these criteria, we compared magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings between two groups of participants (n = 16 per group) exposed to different exemplar images of the same object concepts. Further, we disentangled low-level from high-level MEG responses by estimating the unique and shared contribution of models of behavioral judgments, semantics, and different layers of deep neural networks of visual object processing. We find that 1) both generalization across exemplars as well as generalization of object-related signals across time increase after 150 ms, peaking around 230 ms; 2) behavioral judgments explain the most unique variance in the response after 150 ms.

    "abstract": "The symbiosis between cnidarian hosts and microalgae of the genus Symbiodinium provides the foundation of coral reefs in oligotrophic waters. Understanding the nutrient-exchange between these partners is key to identifying the fundamental mechanisms behind this symbiosis. However, deciphering the individual role of host and algal partners in the uptake and cycling of nutrients has proven difficult, given the endosymbiotic nature of this relationship. In this study, we highlight the advantages of the emerging model system Aiptasia to investigate the metabolic diversity and specificity of cnidarian - dinoflagellate symbiosis. For this, we combined traditional measurements with nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and stable isotope labeling to investigate carbon and nitrogen cycling both at the organismal scale and the cellular scale. Our results suggest that the individual nutrient assimilation by hosts and symbionts depends on the identity of their respective symbiotic partner. Further,{delta} 13C enrichment patterns revealed that alterations in carbon fixation rates only affected carbon assimilation in the cnidarian host but not the algal symbiont, suggesting a  selfish character of this symbiotic association. Based on our findings, we identify new venues for future research regarding the role and regulation of nutrient exchange in the cnidarian - dinoflagellate symbiosis. In this context, the model system approach outlined in this study constitutes a powerful tool set to address these questions.",

    "abstract": "Stress-induced adaptations require multiple levels of regulation in all organisms to repair cellular damage. In the present study we evaluated the genome-wide transcriptional and translational changes following heat stress exposure in the soil-dwelling model actinomycete bacterium, Streptomyces coelicolor. The combined analysis revealed an unprecedented level of translational control of gene expression, deduced through polysome profiling, in addition to transcriptional changes. Our data show little correlation between the transcriptome and  translatome; while an obvious downward trend in genome wide transcription was observed, polysome associated transcripts following heat-shock showed an opposite upward trend. A handful of key protein players, including the major molecular chaperones and proteases were highly induced at both the transcriptional and translational level following heat-shock, a phenomenon known as  potentiation. Many other transcripts encoding cold-shock proteins, ABC-transporter systems, multiple transcription factors were more highly polysome-associated following heat stress; interestingly, these protein families were not induced at the transcriptional level and therefore were not previously identified as part of the stress response. Thus, stress coping mechanisms at the level of gene expression in this bacterium go well beyond the induction of a relatively small number of molecular chaperones and proteases in order to ensure cellular survival at non-physiological temperatures.",

    "abstract": "It is generally believed that task-dependent control of body configuration ( posture) is achieved by adjusting voluntary motor activity and transcortical  long-latency reflexes. Spinal monosynaptic circuits are thought not to be engaged in such task-level control. Similarly, being in a state of motor learning has been strongly associated only with an upregulation of feedback responses at transcortical latencies and beyond. In two separate experiments, the current study examined the task-dependent modulation of stretch reflexes by perturbing the hand of human subjects while they were waiting for a  Go signal to move at the different stages of a classic kinematic learning task (visuomotor rotation). Although the subjects had to resist all haptic perturbations equally, the study leveraged that task-dependent feedback controllers may already be loaded at the movement anticipation stage. In addition to an upregulation of short- and long-latency reflex gains during early exposure to the visual distortion, I found a relative inhibition of reflex responses in the  washout stage (sensory realignment state). For more distal muscles (brachioradialis), this inhibition also extended to the monosynaptic reflex response ( R1). These R1 gains reflected individual motor learning performance in the visuomotor task. The results demonstrate that the systems  control policy in visuomotor adaptation can also include inhibition of proprioceptive reflexes, and that aspects of this policy can affect monosynaptic spinal circuits. The latter finding suggests a novel form of state-related control, probably realized by independent control of fusimotor neurons, through which segmental circuits can tune to higher-level features of a sensorimotor task.\\n\\nAdditional InformationO_ST_ABSConflict of interestC_ST_ABSThe author declares no conflict of interest.\\n\\nAuthor contributionsM.D. devised, designed and implemented the project, analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript.

    "abstract": "Acute psychosocial stress is associated with physiological, subjective and cognitive changes. In particular, attention, which is considered one of the main processes driving cognition, has been related to different stress outcomes, such as anxiety, cortisol levels and autonomic responses, individually. Nonetheless, their specific contributions to and association with attention is still not fully understood. To study this association, 42 male participants were asked to perform an attentional task just before and immediately after being exposed to either an experimental treatment designed to induce psychosocial stress using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) or a matching stress-free control condition. The salivary cortisol concentration, heart rate, and self-reported anxiety were measured to assess the physiological response to stress and the subjective experience during the protocol. As expected, psychosocial stress induced increases in heart rate, salivary cortisol levels and anxiety. The behavioral analysis revealed that members of the control group performed better on the attentional task after the protocol, while members of the TSST group showed no changes. Moreover, after dividing the stress group into sub-groups of participants with high and low anxiety, we observed that participants in the high-anxiety group not only failed to perform better but also performed worse. Finally, after testing several single-level mediation models, we found that anxiety is sufficient to explain the changes in attention and that it mediates the effects between heart rate and cortisol levels on attention. Our results suggest that the immediate effects of acute psychosocial stress on attention are highly dependent on the participants subjective experience, which, in turn, is affected and can mediate stress-related physiological changes.",

Two stimuli with the background and inner contour luminances covarying independently were successively presented, and in separate experiments, the observer judged which member of the pairs interior regions contained a stronger hue or was brighter. Braided-contour control stimuli that generated little or no perceptual filling-in were also used to assess whether observers were judging the interior regions and not the contours themselves. Three nested models of the contributions of the background and inner contour to the judgments were fit to the data by maximum likelihood and evaluated by likelihood ratio tests. Both stimulus components contributed to both the hue and brightness of the interior region with increasing luminance of the inner contour generating an assimilative filling-in for the hue judgments but a contrast effect for the brightness judgments. Control analyses showed negligible effects for the order of the luminance of the background or inner contour on the judgments. An additive contribution of both components was rejected in favor of a saturated model in which the responses depended on the levels of both stimulus components. For the hue judgments, increased background luminance led to greater hue filling-in at higher luminances of the interior contour. For the brightness judgments, the higher background luminance generated less brightness filling-in at higher luminances of the interior contour. The results indicate different effects of the inner contour and background on the induction of the brightness and coloration percepts of the WCE, suggesting that they are mediated by different mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionNormal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is not simply the result of a disturbance in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation, but often includes cardiovascular comorbidity and abnormalities within the cerebral mantle. In this study, we have examined the relationship between the global autoregulation pressure reactivity index (PRx), the profile of disturbed CSF circulation and pressure-volume compensation, and their possible effects on outcome after surgery.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsWe studied a cohort of 131 patients, investigated for possible NPH. Parameters describing CSF compensation and circulation were calculated during the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infusion test and PRx was calculated from CSF pressure and arterial pressure recordings. A simple scale was used to mark the patients outcome 6 months after surgery (improvement, temporary improvement, and no improvement).\\n\\nResultsPRx was negatively correlated with Rout (R=-0.18; p=0.044); patients with normal CSF circulation tended to have worse autoregulation. The correlation for patients who were surgically-managed (N=83) was: R=-0.28; p=0.03, and stronger in patients who improved after surgery (N=64; R=-0.36; p=0.03). In patients who did not improve, the correlation was not significantly different from zero (N= 19; R=0.17; p=0.15). There was a trend towards higher values for PRx in non-responders than in responders (PRx =0.16+/- 0.04 vs 0.09 +/-0.02 respectively; p=0.061), associated with higher MAP values (107.2+/-8.2 in non-responders vs 89.5+/-3.5 in responders; p=0.195). The product of MAP* (1+PRx), proposed as a measure of combined arterial hypertension and deranged autoregulation, showed a significant association with outcome (greater value in non-responders; p=0.013).\\n\\nConclusionAutoregulation proves to associate with cerebrospinal fluid circulation, and appears strongest in shunt responders. Outcome following CSF diversion is possibly most favorable when CSF outflow resistance is increased and global cerebral autoregulation is intact, in combination with arterial normotension.",

    "abstract": "The antithetic integral feedback motif recently introduced in [6] is known to ensure robust perfect adaptation for the mean dynamics of a given molecular species involved in a complex stochastic biomolecular reaction network. However, it was observed that it also leads to a higher variance in the controlled network than that obtained when using a constitutive (i.e. open-loop) control strategy. This was interpreted as the cost of the adaptation property and may be viewed as a performance deterioration for the overall controlled network. To decrease this variance and improve the performance, we propose to combine the antithetic integral feedback motif with a negative feedback strategy. Both theoretical and numerical results are obtained. The theoretical ones are based on a tailored moment closure method allowing one to obtain approximate expressions for the stationary variance for the controlled network and predict that the variance can indeed be decreased by increasing the strength of the negative feedback. Numerical results verify the accuracy of this approximation and show that the controlled species variance can indeed be decreased, sometimes below its constitutive level. Three molecular networks are considered in order to verify the wide applicability of two types of negative feedback strategies. The main conclusion is that there is a trade-off between the speed of the settling-time of the mean trajectories and the stationary variance of the controlled species; i.e. smaller variance is associated with larger settling-time.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHomeostasis, the ability of living organisms to regulate their internal state, is of fundamental importance for their adaptation to environmental changes and their survival. This is the reason why complex regulatory genetic networks evolved and allowed for the emergence of more and more complex organisms. Recently, the theoretical study of those regulatory networks using ideas and concepts from control theory and the design of novel ones have gained a lot of attention. Synthetic regulatory circuits are seen as elementary building blocks for the design of complex networks that need to incorporate some regulating elements to be fully functional. This is for instance the case in metabolic engineering where the production of biomolecules, such as drugs or biofuels, need to be optimized and tightly regulated. A particular circuit, the so-called antithetic integral controller, is now known to ensure homeostasis even when regulatory circuits are subject to randomness. However, it is also known that this circuit increases variability in the network. The effects of a correcting negative feedback loop on the variance are discussed here and it is shown that variability can be reduced this way. Notably, we show that there is a tradeoff between speed of the network and variability.",
