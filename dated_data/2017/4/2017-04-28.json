    "abstract": "MotivationCurrent bioinformatics methods to detect changes in gene isoform usage in distinct phenotypes compare the relative expected isoform usage in phenotypes. These statistics model differences in isoform usage in normal tissues, which have stable regulation of gene splicing. Pathological conditions, such as cancer, can have broken regulation of splicing that increases the heterogeneity of the expression of splice variants. Inferring events with such differential heterogeneity in gene isoform usage requires new statistical approaches.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce Splice Expression Variability Analysis (SEVA) to model increased heterogeneity of splice variant usage between conditions (e.g., tumor and normal samples). SEVA uses a rank-based multivariate statistic that compares the variability of junction expression profiles within one condition to the variability within another. Simulated data show that SEVA is unique in modeling heterogeneity of gene isoform usage, and benchmark SEVAs performance against EBSeq, DiffSplice, and rMATS that model differential isoform usage instead of heterogeneity. We confirm the accuracy of SEVAin identifying known splice variants in head and neck cancer and perform cross-study validation of novel splice variants. A novel comparison of splice variant heterogeneity between subtypes of head and neck cancer demonstrated unanticipated similarity between the heterogeneity of gene isoform usage in HPV-positive and HPV-negative subtypes and anticipated increased heterogeneity among HPV-negative samples with mutations in genes that regulate the splice variant machinery.\\n\\nConclusionThese results show that SEVA accurately models differential heterogeneity of gene isoform usage from RNA-seq data.\\n\\nAvailabilitySEVA is implemented in the R/Bioconductor package GSReg.\\n\\nContactbahman@jhu.edu, favorov@sensi.org, ejfertig@jhmi.edu",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide proximity ligation based assays such as Hi-C have revealed that eukaryotic genomes are organized into structural units called topologically associating domains (TADs). From a visual examination of the chromosomal contact map, however, it is clear that the organization of the domains is not simple or obvious. Instead, TADs exhibit various length scales and, in many cases, a nested arrangement. Here, by exploiting the resemblance between TADs in a chromosomal contact map and densely connected modules in a network, we formulate TAD identification as an optimization problem and propose an algorithm, MrTADFinder, to identify TADs from intra-chromosomal contact maps. MrTADFinder is based on the network-science concept of modularity. A key component of it is deriving an appropriate background model for contacts in a random chain, by numerically solving a set of matrix equations. The background model preserves the observed coverage of each genomic bin as well as the distance dependence of the contact frequency for any pair of bins exhibited by the empirical map. Also, by introducing a tunable resolution parameter, MrTADFinder provides a self-consistent approach for identifying TADs at different length scales, hence the acronym \\\"Mr\\\" standing for Multiple Resolutions. We then apply MrTADFinder to various Hi-C datasets. The identified domains are marked by boundary signatures in chromatin marks and transcription factor (TF) that are consistent with earlier work. Moreover, by calling TADs at different length scales, we observe that boundary signatures change with resolution, with different chromatin features having different characteristic length scales. Furthermore, we report an enrichment of HOT regions near TAD boundaries and investigate the role of different TFs in determining boundaries at various resolutions. To further explore the interplay between TADs and epigenetic marks, we examine how somatic mutations are distributed across boundaries (as tumor mutational burden is known to be coupled to chromatin structure), finding a clear stepwise pattern. Overall, MrTADFinder provides a novel computational framework to explore the multi-scale structures in Hi-C contact maps.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe accommodation of the roughly 2m of DNA in the nuclei of mammalian cells results in an intricate structure, in which the topologically associating domains (TADs) formed by densely interacting genomic regions emerge as a fundamental structural unit. Identification of TADs is essential for understanding the role of 3D genome organization in gene regulation. By viewing the chromosomal contact map as a network, TADs correspond to the densely connected regions in the network. Motivated by this mapping, we propose a novel method, MrTADFinder, to identify TADs based on the concept of modularity in network science. Using MrTADFinder, we identify domains at various resolutions, and further explore the interplay between domains and other chromatin features like transcription factors binding and histone modifications at different resolutions. Overall, MrTADFinder provides a new computational framework to investigate the multiple length scales that are built inside the organization of the genome.",

Participants interacted with bi-variate reward functions on a two-dimensional grid, with the goal of either gaining the largest average score or finding the largest payoff. By providing an opportunity to learn the underlying reward function through spatial correlations, we model to what extent people form beliefs about unexplored payoffs and how that guides search behavior. Participants adapted to assigned payoff conditions, performed better in smooth than in rough environments, and--surprisingly--sometimes performed equally well in short as in long search horizons. Our modeling results indicate a preference for local search options, which when accounted for, still suggests participants were best-described as forming local inferences about unexplored regions, combined with a search strategy that directly traded off between exploiting high expected rewards and exploring to reduce uncertainty about the spatial structure of rewards.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPA fundamental challenge in ecology continues to be identifying mechanisms that stabilize community dynamics. By altering the interactions within a community, eco-evolutionary feedbacks may play a role in community stability. Indeed, recent empirical and theoretical studies demonstrate that these feedbacks can stabilize or destabilize communities, and moreover, that this sometimes depends on the relative rate of ecological to evolutionary processes. So far, theory on how eco-evolutionary feedbacks impact stability exists for only for a few special cases. In our work, we develop a general theory for determining the effects of eco-evolutionary feedbacks on stability in communities with an arbitrary number of interacting species and evolving traits for when evolution is slow and fast. We characterize how eco-evolutionary feedbacks lead to stable communities that would otherwise be unstable, and vice versa. We show how this characterization provides a partitioning of the roles of direct and indirect feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes on stability, and how this partitioning depends on the rate of evolution relative to the ecological time scales. Applying our methods to models of competing species and food chains, we demonstrate how the functional form of trade offs, genetic correlations between traits, and the rate of evolution determine whether eco-evolutionary feedbacks stabilize or destabilize communities.",

This bioinformatics-based study focuses on eight of the cathepsin B-like cysteine proteases (CPs) of the worm to explore their pathogenic potential. CP1 - CP6, which harbored the active site cysteine residue for enzymatic activity, were relevantly observed to have N-terminal signal peptide for extracellular localization. The secretory CPs could be releasing indigenous worm heparin at the host-pathogen interface for anticoagulation purposes. CP2 and CP3 showed a novel hemoglobinase motif that could be a prerequisite for hemoglobin degradation. CP1 and CP6 shared similar enzymatic-pocket features with cathepsin B and cruzain that cleave high molecular weight kininogen for blood-thinning activity. CP1, CP2, CP3, CP5 and CP6 were predicted to bind heparin, at their C terminal domain, like human cathepsin B and cruzain non-covalently bind heparin to enhance their activity. NA CPs action in concert with heparin, have implications for anti-heparin and heparin analog design against hookworm infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMalignant tumors are typically caused by a conglomeration of genomic aberrations--including point mutations, small insertions, small deletions, and large copy-number variations. In some cases, specific chemotherapies and targeted drug treatments are effective against tumors that harbor certain genomic aberrations. However, predictive aberrations (biomarkers) have not been identified for many tumors. One way to address this problem is to examine the downstream, transcriptional effects of genomic aberrations and to identify characteristic patterns. Even though two tumors harbor different genomic aberrations, the transcriptional effects of those aberrations may be similar. These patterns could be used to inform treatment choices.\\n\\nResultsWe hypothesized that by grouping genomic aberrations according to their downstream transcriptional effects, we could identify drug-repurposing candidates that coincide with prior knowledge. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a computational pipeline that uses supervised machine learning to identify similarities among mutually exclusive genomic aberrations based on their transcriptional effects. We used data from 9300 tumors across 25 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas to evaluate our approach. Our pipeline recapitulates known relationships in cancer pathways, and it identifies gene pairs known to predict responses to the same treatments.\\n\\nConclusionWe show that transcriptional data offer promise as a way to group genomic aberrations according to their downstream effects, and these groupings recapitulate known relationships. Our approach shows potential to help pharmacologists and clinical trialists narrow the search space for candidate gene/drug associations, including for rare mutations, and for identifying potential drug-repurposing opportunities.",

    "abstract": "In gravity below Earth normal, a person should be able to take higher leaps in running. We asked ten subjects to run on a treadmill in five levels of simulated reduced gravity and optically tracked center of mass kinematics. Subjects consistently reduced ballistic height compared to running in normal gravity. We explain this trend by considering the vertical takeoff velocity (defined as maximum vertical velocity). Energetically optimal gaits should balance energetic costs of ground-contact collisions (favouring lower takeoff velocity), and step frequency penalties such as leg swing work (favouring higher takeoff velocity, but less so in reduced gravity). Measured vertical takeoff velocity scaled with the square root of gravitational acceleration, following energetic optimality predictions and explaining why ballistic height decreases in lower gravity. The success of work-based costs in predicting this behaviour challenges the notion that gait adaptation in reduced gravity results from an unloading of the stance phase. Only the relationship between takeoff velocity and swing cost changes in reduced gravity; the energetic cost of the down-to-up transition for a given vertical takeoff velocity does not change with gravity. Because lower gravity allows an elongated swing phase for a given takeoff velocity, the motor control system can relax the vertical momentum change in the stance phase, so reducing ballistic height, without great energetic penalty to leg swing work. While it may seem counterintuitive, using less \\\"bouncy\\\" gaits in reduced gravity is a strategy to reduce energetic costs, to which humans seem extremely sensitive.\\n\\nSummary StatementDuring running, humans take higher leaps in normal gravity than in reduced gravity, in order to optimally balance the competing costs of stance and leg-swing work.",

    "abstract": "Identifying adaptive loci can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying local adaptation. Genotype-environment association (GEA) methods, which identify these loci based on correlations between genetic and environmental data, are particularly promising. Univariate methods have dominated GEA, despite the high dimensional nature of genotype and environment. Multivariate methods, which analyze many loci simultaneously, may be better suited to these data since they consider how sets of markers covary in response to environment. These methods may also be more effective at detecting adaptive processes that result in weak, multilocus signatures. Here, we evaluate four multivariate methods, and five univariate and differentiation-based approaches, using published simulations of multilocus selection. We found that Random Forest performed poorly for GEA. Univariate GEAs performed better, but had low detection rates for loci under weak selection. Constrained ordinations showed a superior combination of low false positive and high true positive rates across all levels of selection. These results were robust across the demographic histories, sampling designs, sample sizes, and levels of population structure tested. The value of combining detections from different methods was variable, and depended on study goals and knowledge of the drivers of selection. Reanalysis of genomic data from gray wolves highlighted the unique, covarying sets of adaptive loci that could be identified using redundancy analysis, a constrained ordination. Although additional testing is needed, this study indicates that constrained ordinations are an effective means of detecting adaptation, including signatures of weak, multilocus selection, providing a powerful tool for investigating the genetic basis of local adaptation.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of the cytoskeleton and cell shape relies on the coordinated activation of RhoGTPase molecular switches. Among them, Rac1 participates to the orchestration in space and time of actin branching and protrusion/retraction cycles of the lamellipodia at the cell front during mesenchymal migration. Biosensor imaging has revealed a graded concentration of active GTP-loaded Rac1 in protruding regions of the cell. Here, using single molecule imaging and super-resolution microscopy, we reveal an additional supramolecular organization of Rac1. We find that, similarly to H-Ras, Rac1 partitions and is immobilized into nanoclusters of 50-100 molecules each. These nanoclusters assemble due to the interaction of the polybasic tail of Rac1 with the phosphoinositide lipids PIP2 and PIP3. The additional interactions with GEFs, GAPs, downstream effectors, and possibly other partners are responsible for an enrichment of Rac1 nanoclusters in protruding regions of the cell. Using optogenetics and micropatterning tools, we find that activation of Rac1 leads to its immobilization in nanoclusters and that the local level of Rac1 activity matches the local density of nanoclusters. Altogether, our results show that subcellular patterns of Rac1 activity are supported by gradients of signaling nanodomains of heterogeneous molecular composition, which presumably act as discrete signaling platforms. This finding implies that graded distributions of nanoclusters might encode spatial information.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells is a highly organized surface where hundreds of incoming signals are transduced to the intracellular space. How cells encode faithfully this myriad of signals is a fundamental question. Here we show that Rac1, a critical membrane-bound protein involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, forms small aggregates together with other regulating proteins. These supramolecular assemblies, called nanoclusters, are the \\\"quantal\\\" units of signaling. By increasing the local concentration, nanoclusters set thresholds for downstream signaling and ensure the fidelity of information transduction. We found that Rac1 nanoclusters are distributed as spatial gradients matching the patterns of Rac1 activity. We propose that cells can encode positional information through distributed signaling quanta, hereby ensuring spatial fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence imaging is a method of real-time molecular tracking in vivo that has enabled many clinical technologies. Imaging in the shortwave infrared region (SWIR, 1-2 m) promises higher contrast, sensitivity, and penetration depths compared to conventional visible and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging. However, adoption of SWIR imaging in clinical settings has been limited, due in part to the absence of FDA-approved fluorophores with peak emission in the SWIR. Here, we show that commercially available NIR dyes, including the FDA-approved contrast agent indocyanine green (ICG), exhibit optical properties suitable for in vivo SWIR fluorescence imaging. Despite the fact that their emission reaches a maximum in the NIR, these dyes can be imaged non-invasively in vivo in the SWIR spectral region, even beyond 1500 nm. We demonstrate real-time fluorescence angiography at wavelengths beyond 1300 nm using ICG at clinically relevant doses. Furthermore, we show tumortargeted SWIR imaging with trastuzumab labeled with IRDye 800CW, a NIR dye currently being tested in multiple phase II clinical trials. Our findings suggest that high-contrast SWIR fluorescence imaging can be implemented alongside existing imaging modalities by switching the detection of conventional NIR fluorescence systems from silicon-based NIR cameras to emerging indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) SWIR cameras. Using ICG in particular opens the possibility of translating SWIR fluorescence imaging to human clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the abiotic and biotic factors that determine the limits to species range is an essential goal in ecology, biogeography, evolutionary biology, and conservation biology. Moreover, predictions of shifts in species distributions under future changes in climate can be improved through understanding the spatial variation in survival, growth, and reproduction. A long-standing hypothesis postulates that, for Northern Hemisphere species, abiotic factors like temperature limit northern and/or higher elevation extents, while biotic factors like competition limit the southern and/or lower elevation range edges; though amphibians may not follow this general trend. Therefore, we combined environmental suitability models and a reciprocal transplant experiment across an elevational gradient to explore the role of the abiotic environment on the range limits of a montane salamander (Plethodon montanus). We first determined suitability of the abiotic environment for P. montanus, under current (1960 - 2000) and future (2050) climate scenarios. Second, we collected juveniles from each of three elevations and transplanted them within mesocosms such that each origin population was represented within each transplant location and vice-versa. We found that environmental suitability in 2050 decreased throughout the range compared to current predictions, especially at lower elevations. Additionally, we found that individuals starting body condition and transplant location were important predictors of survival, growth, and reproduction condition; importantly, individuals transplanted to low elevation had lower survival and growth rates compared to those moved to mid or high elevations. Our study provides experimental support that the abiotic environment limits the lower elevation distribution of P. montanus and, unfortunately, our results also paint a possible bleak future for this species and likely other montane terrestrial plethodontids. The abiotic environment, which will become increasingly limited under future changes in climate, was found to have more influence on survival and growth than population identity.",

    "abstract": "Identifying genomic regions underlying adaptation in extant lineages is key to understand the trajectories along which biodiversity evolves. However, this task is complicated by evolutionary processes that obscure and mimic footprints of positive selection. Particularly the long-term effects of linked selection remain underappreciated and difficult to account for. Based on patterns emerging from recent research on the evolution of differentiation across the speciation continuum, I illustrate how long-term linked selection affects the distribution of differentiation along genomes. I then argue that a comparative population genomics framework that exploits emergent features of long-term linked selection can help overcome shortcomings of traditional genome scans for adaptive evolution, but needs to account for the temporal dynamics of differentiation landscapes.",

    "abstract": "While for the most part genome-wide metrics are currently employed in managing livestock inbreeding, genomic data offer, in principle, the ability to identify functional inbreeding. Here we present a heuristic method to identify haplotypes contained within a run of homozygosity (ROH) associated with reduced performance. Results are presented for simulated and swine data. The algorithm comprises 3 steps. Step 1 scans the genome based on marker windows of decreasing size and identifies ROH genotypes associated with an unfavorable phenotype. Within this stage, multiple aggregation steps reduce the haplotype to the smallest possible length. In step 2, the resulting regions are formally tested for significance with the use of a linear mixed model. Lastly, step 3 removes nested windows. The effect of the unfavorable haplotypes identified and their associated haplotype probabilities for a progeny of a given mating pair or an individual can be used to generate an inbreeding load matrix (ILM). Diagonals of ILM characterize the functional inbreeding load of individual (IIL). We estimated the accuracy of predicting the phenotype based on ILL. We further compared the significance of the regression coefficient for IIL on phenotypes to genome-wide inbreeding metrics. We tested the algorithm using simulated scenarios (n =12) combining different levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and number of loci impacting a quantitative trait. Additionally, we investigated 9 traits from two maternal purebred swine lines. In simulated data, as the LD in the population increased the algorithm identified a greater proportion of the true unfavorable ROH effects. For example, the proportion of highly unfavorable true ROH effects identified raised from 32 to 41 % for the low to the high LD scenario. In both simulated and real data the haplotypes identified were contained within a much larger ROH (9.12-12.1 Mb). The IIL prediction accuracy was greater than zero across all scenarios for simulated data (high LD scenario mean (95% confidence interval): 0.49 (0.47-0.52)) and for nearly all swine traits (mean {+/-} SD: 0.17{+/-}0.10). On average across simulated and swine datasets the IIL regression coefficient was more closely related to progeny performance than any genome-wide inbreeding metric. A heuristic method was developed that identified ROH genotypes with reduced performance and characterized the combined effects of ROH genotypes within and across individuals.",

In vitro and in vivo cancer cell modeling demonstrated supportive evidences including cell renewal, tumorigenicity at limiting dose, cell motility, resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and EGFR targeted therapy. In human lung cancers, high NFATc2 expression predicts poor tumor differentiation, adverse recurrence-free and overall patient survivals. Mechanistic investigations identified NFATc2 response elements in the SOX2 3 enhancer region, and NFATc2/SOX2 coupling upregulates ALDH1A1 by binding to its 5 enhancer. Through this axis, oxidative stresses and reactive oxygen species induced by cancer drug treatment are attenuated, accounting for a mutation-independent mechanism of drug resistance.

A persisting optic fissure, coloboma, is a major cause for blindness in children. Multiple factors are genetically linked to coloboma formation. However, especially the process of optic fissure fusion is still largely elusive on a cellular and molecular basis.\\n\\nWe found a coloboma phenotype in mice with a targeted inactivation of the transforming growth factor 2 (TGF{beta}2). Here the optic fissure margins got in touch, however, failed to fuse. Transcriptomic analyses indicated TGF{beta} mediated ECM remodeling during optic fissure fusion. For functional analyses, we switched model systems and made use of zebrafish. We found TGF{beta} ligands expressed in the developing zebrafish eye, and the ligand binding receptor in the optic fissure. Using a new in vivo TGF{beta} signaling reporter, we also found active TGF{beta} signaling in the margins of the optic fissure. We addressed the function of Cadherin 6 (cdh6), one of the TGF{beta} regulated genes, by knock down experiments in zebrafish and found a prominent coloboma phenotype. Cdh6 was often found involved in processes of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), strengthening our hypothesis that an EMT-like process is also necessary for optic fissure fusion. Furthermore, we found Gremlin 2b (grem2b) and Follistatin a (fsta), homologs of TGF{beta} regulated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists, expressed in the optic fissure margins, indicating the necessity of a localized inhibition of BMP signaling. Finally, we show that induced BMP expression is sufficient to inhibit optic fissure fusion. Together with our previous findings this indicates a dual role of BMP signaling during optic fissure closure.\\n\\nSummary statementTGF{beta} is crucial for optic fissure fusion, involving cdh6. TGF{beta} mediated optic fissure fusion is potentially hampered by BMP signaling, which is blocked by TGF{beta} induced BMP antagonists within the optic fissure margins.",

    "abstract": "It is well documented that the tumor microenvironment profoundly impacts the etiology and progression of breast cancer, yet the contribution of the resident microbiome within breast tissue remains poorly understood. Tumor microenvironmental conditions, such as hypoxia and dense tumor stroma, predispose progressive phenotypes and therapy resistance, however the role of bacteria in this interplay remains uncharacterized. We hypothesized that the effect of individual bacterial secreted molecules on breast cancer viability and proliferation would be modulated by these tumor-relevant stressors differentially for cells at varying stages of progression. To test this, we incubated human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231, MCF-DCIS.com) and non-malignant breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A) with N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL), a quorum-sensing molecule from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that regulates bacterial stress responses. This molecule was selected because Pseudomonas was recently characterized as a significant fraction of the breast tissue microbiome and OdDHL is documented to impact mammalian cell viability. After OdDHL treatment, we demonstrated the greatest decrease in viability with the more malignant MDAMB-231 cells and an intermediate MCF-DCIS.com (ductal carcinoma in situ) response. The responses were also culture condition (i.e. microenvironment) dependent. These results contrast the MCF-10A response, which demonstrated no change in viability in any culture condition. We further determined that the observed trends in breast cancer viability were due to modulation of proliferation for both cell types, as well as the induction of necrosis for MDA-MB-231 cells in all conditions. Our results provide evidence that bacterial quorum-sensing molecules interact with the host tissue environment to modulate breast cancer viability and proliferation, and that the effect of OdDHL is dependent on both cell type as well as microenvironment. Understanding the interactions between bacterial signaling molecules and the host tissue environment will allow for future studies that determine the contribution of bacteria to the onset, progression, and therapy response of breast cancer.",

To dissect its dynamic regulation with high temporal resolution, we introduce an optogenetic tool termed BLInCR (Blue Light-Induced Chromatin Recruitment) that combines rapid and reversible light-dependent recruitment of effector proteins with a real-time readout for transcription. We used BLInCR to control the activity of a reporter gene cluster in the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS by reversibly recruiting the viral transactivator VP16. RNA production was detectable [~]2 minutes after VP16 recruitment and readily decreased when VP16 dissociated from the cluster in the absence of light. Quantitative assessment of the activation process revealed biphasic activation kinetics with a pronounced early phase in cells treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA. Comparison with kinetic models for transcription activation suggests that the gene cluster undergoes a maturation process when activated. BLInCR will facilitate the study of transcription dynamics in living cells.",

    "abstract": "The guidance cue UNC-6/Netrin regulates both attractive and repulsive axon guidance. Our previous work showed that in C. elegans, the attractive UNC-6/Netrin receptor UNC-40/DCC stimulates growth cone protrusion, and that the repulsive receptor, an UNC-5/UNC-40 heterodimer, inhibits growth cone protrusion. We have also shown that inhibition of growth cone protrusion downstream of the UNC-5/UNC-40 repulsive receptor involves Rac GTPases, the Rac GTP exchange factor UNC-73/Trio, and the cytoskeletal regulator UNC-33/CRMP, which mediates Semaphorin-induced growth cone collapse in other systems. The multidomain flavoprotein monooxygenase (FMO) MICAL also mediates growth cone collapse in response to Semaphorin by directly oxidizing F-actin, resulting in depolymerization. The C. elegans genome does not encode a multidomain MICAL-like molecule, but does encode five flavin monooxygenases (FMO-1, -2, -3, -4, and 5) and another molecule, EHBP-1, similar to the non-FMO portion of MICAL.\\n\\nHere we show that FMO-1, FMO-4, FMO-5, and EHBP-1 may play a role in UNC-6/Netrin directed repulsive guidance mediated through UNC-40 and UNC-5 receptors. Mutations in fmo-1, fmo-4, fmo-5, and ehbp-1 showed VD/DD axon guidance and branching defects, and variably enhanced unc-40 and unc-5 VD/DD guidance defects. Developing growth cones in vivo of fmo-1, fmo-4, fmo-5, and ehbp-1 mutants displayed excessive filopodial protrusion, and transgenic expression of FMO-5 inhibited growth cone protrusion. Mutations suppressed growth cone inhibition caused by activated UNC-40 and UNC-5 signaling, and activated Rac GTPase CED-10 and MIG-2, suggesting that these molecules are required downstream of UNC-6/Netrin receptors and Rac GTPases. From these studies, we conclude that FMO-1, FMO-4, FMO-5, and EHBP-1 represent new players downstream of UNC-6/Netrin receptors and Rac GTPases that inhibit growth cone filopodial protrusion in repulsive axon guidance.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMolecular mechanisms of axon repulsion mediated by UNC-6/Netrin are not well understood. Inhibition of growth cone lamellipodial and filopodial protrusion is critical to repulsive axon guidance. Previous work identified a novel pathway involving Rac GTPases and the cytoskeletal interacting molecule UNC-33/CRMP required for UNC-6/Netrin-mediated inhibition of growth cone protrusion. In other systems, CRMP mediates growth cone collapse in response to semaphorin. Here we demonstrate a novel role of flavoprotein monooxygenases (FMOs) in repulsive axon guidance and inhibition of growth cone protrusion downstream of UNC-6/Netrin signaling and Rac GTPases. In Drosophila and vertebrates, the multidomain MICAL FMO mediates semaphorin-dependent growth cone collapse by direct oxidation and depolymerization of F-actin. The C. elegans genome does not encode a multidomain MICAL-like molecule, and we speculate that the C. elegans FMOs might have an equivalent role downstream of UNC-6/Netrin signaling. Indeed, we show that EHBP-1, similar to the non-FMO portion of MICAL, also controls repulsive axon guidance and growth cone inhibition, suggesting that in C. elegans, the functions of the multidomain MICAL molecule might be distributed across different molecules. In sum, we show conservation of function of molecules involved in semaphorin growth cone collapse with inhibition of growth cone protrusion downstream of UNC-6/Netrin signaling.",

Here, we expand on recent studies of nucleotide-resolution DSB maps in mouse spermatocytes. We find that trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 36 around DSB hotspots is highly correlated, both spatially and quantitatively, with trimethylation of H3 lysine 4, consistent with coordinated formation and action of both PRDM9-dependent histone modifications. In contrast, the DSB-responsive kinase ATM contributes independently of PRDM9 to controlling hotspot activity, and combined action of ATM and PRDM9 can explain nearly two-thirds of the variation in DSB frequency between hotspots. DSBs were modestly underrepresented in most repetitive sequences such as segmental duplications and transposons. Nonetheless, numerous DSBs form within repetitive sequences in each meiosis and some classes of repeats are preferentially targeted. Implications of these findings are discussed for evolution of PRDM9 and its role in hybrid strain sterility in mice. Finally, we document the relationship between mouse strain-specific DNA sequence variants within PRDM9 recognition motifs and attendant differences in recombination outcomes.

    "abstract": "The intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii modifies a number of host cell processes. The mechanisms by which T. gondii alters host gene expression are incompletely understood. This study focuses on how the regulators of gene expression in human host cells respond to T. gondii 24 hours following infection to cause specific patterns of transcriptional dysregulation. The most striking finding was the altered landscape of transposase-accessible chromatin by infection. We found both gains and losses of loci of open chromatin enriched in proximity to transcriptionally altered genes. Both DNA sequence motif analysis at the loci changing chromatin accessibility and network analysis of the genes with transcription and regulatory changes implicate a central role for the AP-1 transcription factor. We validated the redistribution of AP-1 in the host genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation studies of the c-Fos component of AP-1. As infection with T. gondii is associated with the cell failing to progress through the cell cycle, all of the changes observed occur in the absence of cell division and within 24 hours, an insight into the dynamism of these transcriptional regulatory events. We conclude that T. gondii infection influences transcriptional regulation through transcription factor re-targeting to modify the cis-regulatory landscape of the host nucleus.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe complex interactions between the intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii and the host cell manifest as expression changes of host genes. T. gondiis secreted effectors have been extensively studied and include factors that influence the properties of transcription factors, resulting in post-translational modifications and changes in intracellular localization. To gain insights into how T. gondii exerts specific influences on host transcriptional regulation, we used genome-wide approaches to study gene expression, cytosine modifications, and chromatin structure of the host cell 24 hours after infection. The greatest insights were gained from the mapping of loci of transposase-accessible chromatin, revealing a consistently altered pattern of a subset of loci becoming inaccessible, with the simultaneous acquisition of a new set of infection-associated loci of open chromatin. The sequences at these loci were enriched for certain transcription factor binding motifs, in particular that of AP-1, the transcription factor formed by c-Jun and c-Fos heterodimers. Network analysis revealed a central role for c-Jun and c-Fos in the infection-associated perturbations, prompting a chromatin immunoprecipitation approach that confirmed the redistribution of c-Fos in infected cells. We conclude that a T. gondii infection leads to an intragenomic redistribution of host transcription factor binding, with resulting effects on host gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell technologies are offering unprecedented insight into complex biology, revealing the behavior of rare cell populations that are typically masked in bulk population analyses. The application of these methodologies to cell fate reprogramming holds particular promise as the manipulation of cell identity is typically inefficient, generating heterogeneous cell populations. One current limitation of single-cell approaches is that lineage relationships are lost as a result of cell processing, restricting interpretations of the data collected. Here, we present a single-cell resolution lineage-tracing approach based on the combinatorial indexing of cells,  CellTagging. Application of this method, in concert with high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing, reveals the transcriptional dynamics of direct reprogramming from fibroblasts to induced endoderm progenitors. These analyses demonstrate that while many cells initiate reprogramming, complete silencing of fibroblast identity and transition to a progenitor-like state represents a rare event. Clonal analyses uncover a remarkable degree of heterogeneity arising from individual cells. Overall, very few cells fully reprogram to generate expanded populations with a low degree of clonal diversity. Extended culture of these engineered cells reveals an instability of the reprogrammed state and reversion to a fibroblast-like phenotype. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of our lineage-tracing approach to reveal dynamics of lineage reprogramming, and will be of broad utility in many cell biological applications.",

    "abstract": "Research has shown that infants are able to track a moving target efficiently - even if it is transiently occluded from sight. This basic ability allows prediction of when and where events happen in everyday life. Yet, it is unclear whether, and how, infants internally represent the time course of ongoing movements to derive predictions. In this study, 10-month-old crawlers observed the video of a same-aged crawling baby that was transiently occluded and reappeared in either a temporally continuous or non-continuous manner (i.e., delayed by 500 ms vs. forwarded by 500 ms relative to the real-time movement). Eye movement and rhythmic neural brain activity (EEG) were measured simultaneously. Eye movement analyses showed that infants were sensitive to slight temporal shifts in movement continuation after occlusion. Furthermore, brain activity related to sensorimotor rather than mnemonic processing differed between observation of continuous and non-continuous movements. Early sensitivity to an actions timing may hence be explained within the internal real-time simulation account of action observation. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that 10-month-old infants are well prepared for internal representation of the time course of observed movements that are within the infants current motor repertoire.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is widely used for RNA quantification across environmental, biological and medical sciences; it enables the description of genome-wide patterns of expression and the deduction of regulatory interactions and networks. The aim of computational analyses is to achieve an accurate output, i.e. rigorous quantification of genes/transcripts to allow a reliable prediction of differential expression (DE), despite the variable levels of noise and biases present in sequencing data. The evaluation of sequencing quality and normalization are essential components of this process.\n\nResultsWe investigate the discriminative power of existing approaches for the quality checking of mRNA-seq data and also propose additional, quantitative, quality checks. To accommodate the analysis of a nested, multi-level design using data on D. melanogaster, we incorporated the sample layout into the analysis. We describe a \"subsampling without replacement\"-based normalization and identification of DE that accounts for the experimental design i.e. the hierarchy and amplitude of effect sizes within samples. We also evaluate the differential expression call in comparison to existing approaches. To assess the broader applicability of these methods, we applied this series of steps to a published set of H. sapiens mRNA-seq samples.\n\nConclusionsThe dataset-tailored methods improved sample comparability and delivered a robust prediction of subtle gene expression changes. Overall, the proposed approach offers the potential to improve key steps in the analysis of RNA-seq data by incorporating the structure and characteristics of biological experiments into the data analysis. 38",

    "abstract": "Cytokine signalling is mediated by the activation of distinct sets of structurally homologous JAK and STAT signalling molecules, which control nuclear gene expression and cell fate. A significant expansion in the gene regulatory repertoire controlled by JAK/STAT signalling has arisen by the selective interaction of STATs with IRF transcription factors. Type I interferons (IFN), the major antiviral cytokines, trigger the formation of the ISGF3 complex containing STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9. ISGF3 regulates the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGF3 assembly depends on selective interaction between IRF9, through its IRF-association domain (IAD), with the coiled-coil domain (CCD) of STAT2. Here, we report the crystal structures of the IRF9-IAD alone and in a complex with STAT2-CCD. Despite similarity in the overall structure among respective paralogs, the surface features of the IRF9-IAD and STAT2- CCD have diverged to enable specific interaction between these family members, thus enabling ISGF3 formation and expression of ISGs.",

    "abstract": "Bimodal gene expression by genetically identical cells is a pervasive feature of signaling networks. In the galactose-utilization (GAL) pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, induction can be unimodal or bimodal depending on natural genetic variation and pre-induction conditions. Here, we find that this variation of modality is regulated by an interplay between two features of the pathway response, the fraction of cells that are in the induced subpopulation and their expression level. Combined, the variations in these features are sufficient to explain the observed effects of natural variation and pre-induction conditions on the modality of induction in both mechanistic and phenomenological models. Both natural variation and pre-induction conditions act by modulating the expression and function of the galactose sensor GAL3. The ability to alter modality may allow organisms to adapt their level of \"bet hedging\" to the conditions they experience, and thus help optimize fitness in complex, fluctuating natural environments.",

    "abstract": "Double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) can be generated by both endogenous and exogenous agents. In diploid yeast strains, such breaks are usually repaired by homologous recombination (HR), and a number of different HR pathways have been described. An early step for all HR pathways is formation of a heteroduplex, in which a single-strand from the broken DNA molecule pairs with a strand derived from an intact DNA molecule. If the two strands of DNA are not identical, within the heteroduplex DNA (hetDNA), there will be mismatches. In a wild-type strain, these mismatches are removed by the mismatch repair (MMR) system. In strains lacking MMR, the mismatches persist and can be detected by a variety of genetic and physical techniques. Most previous studies involving hetDNA formed during mitotic recombination have been restricted to a single locus with DSBs induced at a defined position by a site-specific endonuclease. In addition, in most of these studies, recombination between repeated genes was examined; in such studies, the sequence homologies were usually less than 5 kb. In the present study, we present a global mapping of hetDNA formed in a UV-treated MMR-defective mlh1 strain. Although about two-thirds of the recombination events were associated with hetDNA with a continuous array of unrepaired mismatches, in about one-third of the events, we found regions of unrepaired mismatches flanking regions without mismatches. We suggest that these discontinuous hetDNAs involve template switching during repair synthesis, repair of a double-stranded DNA gap, and/or Mlh1-independent MMR. Many of our observed events are not explicable by the simplest form of the double-strand break repair (DSBR) model of recombination. We also studied hetDNA associated with spontaneous recombination events selected on chromosomes IV and V in a wild-type strain. The interval on chromosome IV contained a hotspot for spontaneous crossovers generated by an inverted pair of transposable elements (HS4). We showed that HS4-induced recombination events are associated with the formation of very large (>30 kb) double-stranded DNA gaps.",

We generated 124 Gb of short-read DNA sequences with an estimated genome size of 1.88 Gb at a sequencing depth of 66x fold. The sequences were aligned to M. brandtii bat reference genome at a mapping rate of 96.50% covering 95.71% coding sequence region at 10x coverage. The divergence time of Myotis bat family is estimated to be 11.5 million years, and the divergence time between M. rufoniger and its closest species M. davidii is estimated to be 10.4 million years. We found 1,239 function-altering M. rufoniger specific amino acid sequences from 929 genes compared to other Myotis bat and mammalian genomes. The functional enrichment test of the 929 genes detected amino acid changes in melanin associated DCT, SLC45A2, TYRP1, and OCA2 genes possibly responsible for the M. rufonigers red fur color and a general coloration in Myotis. N6AMT1 gene, associated with arsenic resistance, showed a high degree of function alteration in M. rufoniger. We further confirmed that M. rufoniger also has bat-specific sequences within FSHB, GHR, IGF1R, TP53, MDM2, SLC45A2, RGS7BP, RHO, OPN1SW, and CNGB3 genes that have already been published to be related to bats reproduction, lifespan, flight, low vision, and echolocation. Additionally, our demographic history analysis found that the effective population size of Myotis clade has been consistently decreasing since [~]30k years ago. M. rufonigers effective population size was the lowest in Myotis bats, confirming its relatively low genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "In natural environments, bacteria preferentially live in biofilms that they build on abiotic surfaces but also on living tissues. Although fungi form extensive networks of hyphae within soils and thus could provide immense surfaces for bacteria to build biofilms and to proliferate, the extent on such phenomenon and the consequences for the fitness of both microorganisms is poorly known in soils. Here, we analyzed the process of formation of biofilms by various bacteria on hyphae of soil fungi in an in vitro setting using confocal and electron microscopy. We showed that the ability to form biofilms on fungal hyphae is widely shared among soil bacteria. In contrast, some fungi, mainly belonging to the Ascomycete class, did not allow for the formation of bacterial biofilms on their surfaces. The formation of biofilms was also strongly modulated by the presence of tree roots and by the development of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, suggesting that biofilm formation does not occur randomly in soil but that it is highly regulated by several biotic factors. Finally, our study led to the unexpected finding that networks of filaments made of extracellular DNA were used to build the skeleton of biofilms by a large array of bacteria.",

We show that the crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) compound eye responds to pulsed mid-infrared FELs (1 Hz for KU-FEL; 2 Hz for LEBRA-FEL) from 3 to 17 m. Our finding provides insight into the animals visual sensing of mid-infrared radiation, and that the sensing does not depend on thermal effects.

    "abstract": "Iron deficiency anaemia is a major global health issue, which has prompted mandatory fortification of cereal products with iron salts or elemental iron in many countries around the world. Rather than post-harvest fortification, biofortification - increasing the intrinsic nutritional quality of crops - is a more sustainable way of alleviating nutrient deficiencies. To identify target genes for biofortification of wheat (Triticum aestivum), we functionally characterized homologues of the Vacuolar Iron Transporter (VIT). The wheat genome contains two VIT paralogues, TaVIT1 and TaVIT2, which have different expression patterns, but are both low in the endosperm. TaVIT2, but not TaVIT1, was able to transport iron in a yeast complementation assay. TaVIT2 also transported manganese but not zinc. By over-expressing TaVIT2 under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, we achieved a 2-fold increase in iron in white flour fractions, exceeding minimum UK legal fortification levels. The highiron trait was consistent across independent lines and was stable in the next generation and in two different growth conditions. The single-gene approach impacted minimally on plant growth and was also effective in barley. The anti-nutrient phytate was not increased in white flour from the cisgenic wheat lines, suggesting that food products made from it could contribute to improved iron nutrition.",

    "abstract": "Loss of reproductive viability, physiologically and/or behaviorally, can have profound effects on the fitness of a captive population and conservation efforts. The southern rocky mountain (SRM) population of the boreal toad has declined over the past 35 years, making captive breeding necessary to protect and augment the species in the wild. In recent years, a notable reduction in the incidence of amplexus and viable offspring from the captive breeding population has been observed. Hormone treatment protocols to stimulate gamete release in males and females are established in this species and in vitro fertilization has been performed successfully. However, successful hormone stimulation of reproductive behaviors and natural fertilization has not been well documented. During the breeding season of 2012, 24 males and 24 female toads were selected from a population of over 600 captive animals. Both sexes were treated with Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Females were primed twice with 3.7IU/g hCG and then injected with an ovulatory dose (OvD) of 13.5 IU/ g BW (Body weight) hCG and 0.4 g/ g BW GnRH. Males were injected a single time with 10 IU/g BW hCG and 0.4 g/ g BW GnRH, 12 h after females received their OvD. In 2013, knowing the approximate time when females oviposited after hormone treatments, we tested the best time to induce amplexus and spermiation. Males were divided into 4 groups and injected at 4 different times: (a) 12 h before females OvD; (b) at the same time as OvD; (c) 12 h after OvD; (d) control injected with PBS. Results from 2012 indicated that oviposition was solely dependent on females receiving hormone treatments not males. However, in 2013 we found that the duration of amplexus significantly influenced oviposition (P>0.05), and males injected 12 h prior to females spent more time in amplexus than males injected at the same time or 12 h after the females received hormones. Promoting reproductive behaviors and synchronizing gamete deposition continues to be imprecise and may require more than exogenous hormones. The complexity of promoting breeding behaviors may require a closer assessment of the captive environment.",

    "abstract": "Erythrocytes in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are associated with reduced cell deformability and elevated blood viscosity, which contribute to impaired blood flow and other pathophysiological aspects of diabetes related vascular complications. In this study, by using a two-component red blood cell (RBC) model and systematic parameter variation, we perform detailed computational simulations to probe the alteration of the biomechanical, rheological and dynamic behavior of T2DM RBCs in response to morphological change and membrane stiffening. First, we examine the elastic response of T2DM RBCs subject to static tensile forcing and their viscoelastic relaxation response upon release of the stretching force. Second, we investigate the membrane fluctuations of T2DM RBCs and explore the effect of cell shape on the fluctuation amplitudes. Third, we subject the T2DM RBCs to shear flow and probe the effects of cell shape and effective membrane viscosity on their tank-treading movement. In addition, we model the cell dynamic behavior in a microfluidic channel with constriction and quantify the biorheological properties of individual T2DM RBCs. Finally, we simulate T2DM RBC suspensions under shear and compare the predicted viscosity with experimental measurements. Taken together these simulation results and their comparison with currently available experimental data are helpful in identifying a specific parametric model the first of its kind that best describes the main hallmarks of T2DM RBCs, which can be used in future simulation studies of hematologic complications of T2DM patients.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of forensic autosomal DNA profiles was controversial, but the problems were successfully addressed, and DNA profiling has gone on to revolutionise forensic science. Y-chromosome profiles are valuable when there is a mixture of male-source and female-source DNA, and interest centres on the identity of the male source(s) of the DNA. The problem of evaluating evidential weight is even more challenging for Y profiles than for autosomal profiles. Numerous approaches have been proposed, but they fail to deal adequately with the fact that men with matching Y-profiles are re-lated in extended patrilineal clans, many of which may not be represented in available databases. This problem has been exacerbated by recent profiling kits with high mutation rates. Because the relevant population is difficult to define, yet the number of matching relatives is fixed as population size varies, it is typically infeasible to derive population-based match probabilities relevant to a specific crime. We propose a conceptually simple solution, based on a simulation model and software to approximate the distribution of the number of males with a matching Y profile. We show that this distribution is robust to different values for the variance in reproductive success and the population growth rate. We also use importance sampling reweighting to derive the distribution of the number of matching males conditional on a database frequency, finding that this conditioning typically has only a modest impact. We illustrate the use of our approach to quantify the value of Y profile evidence for a court in a way that is both scientifically valid and easily comprehensible by a judge or juror.",

    "abstract": "In studies of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning, rewards are often delivered to subjects in a manner that confounds several processes. For example, delivery of a sugar pellet to a rodent requires movement to collect the pellet and is associated with sensory stimuli such as the sight and sound of the pellet arrival. Thus, any neurochemical events occurring in proximity to the reward may be related to multiple coincident phenomena. We used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in rats to compare nucleus accumbens dopamine responses to two different modes of delivery: sucrose pellets, which require goal-directed action for their collection and are associated with sensory stimuli, and intraoral infusions of sucrose, which are passively received and not associated with external stimuli. We found that when rewards were unpredicted both pellets and infusions evoked similar dopamine release. However, when rewards were predicted by distinct cues, greater dopamine release was evoked by pellet cues than infusion cues. Thus, dopamine responses to pellets, infusions as well as predictive cues suggest a nuanced role for dopamine in both reward seeking and reward evaluation.",

    "abstract": "longitudinals lacking (lola) is among the most complex genes in Drosophila melanogaster, encoding up to twenty protein isoforms and acting as a key transcription factor in axonal pathfinding and neural reprogramming. Most of previous studies employed loss-of-function alleles disrupting common exons of lola, making it difficult to delineate its functions. To address this issue we have generated specific mutations in each isoform using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Our targeted screen allows us to revisit the previously demonstrated roles for few isoforms and to demonstrate a specific function for one variant in axon guidance via activation of the microtubule-associated factor Futsch. Importantly, we also reveal a critical role for a second variant in preventing neurodegeneration via the control of the octopaminergic pathway. This variant is expressed almost exclusively in the octopaminergic cells and is involved in the transcriptional activation of a key enzyme of the pathway. Thus, our comprehensive study greatly expands the functional repertoire of Lola functions, and adds novel insights into the transcriptional regulatory control of neurotransmitter expression in vivo.",

    "abstract": "In many sensory systems the neural signal is coded by the coordinated response of heterogeneous populations of neurons. What computational benefit does this diversity confer on information processing? We derive an efficient coding framework assuming that neurons have evolved to communicate signals optimally given natural stimulus statistics and metabolic constraints. Incorporating nonlinearities and realistic noise, we study optimal population coding of the same sensory variable using two measures: maximizing the mutual information between stimuli and responses, and minimizing the error incurred by the optimal linear decoder of responses. Our theory is applied to a commonly observed splitting of sensory neurons into ON and OFF that signal stimulus increases or decreases, and to populations of monotonically increasing responses of the same type, ON. Depending on the optimality measure, we make different predictions about how to optimally split a population into ON and OFF, and how to allocate the firing thresholds of individual neurons given realistic stimulus distributions and noise, which accord with certain biases observed experimentally.",

    "abstract": "In a constantly changing environment the brain has to make sense of dynamic patterns of sensory input. These patterns can refer to stimuli with a complex and hierarchical structure which has to be inferred from the neural activity of sensory areas in the brain. Such areas were found to be locally recurrently structured as well as hierarchically organized within a given sensory domain. While there is a great body of work identifying neural representations of various sensory stimuli at different hierarchical levels, less is known about the nature of these representations. In this work, we propose a model that describes a way to encode and decode sensory stimuli based on the activity patterns of multiple, recurrently connected neural populations with different receptive fields. We demonstrate the ability of our model to learn and recognize complex, dynamic stimuli using birdsongs as exemplary data. These birdsongs can be described by a 2-level hierarchical structure, i.e. as sequences of syllables. Our model matches this hierarchy by learning single syllables on a first level and sequences of these syllables on a top level. Model performance on recognition tasks is investigated for an increasing number of syllables or songs to recognize and compared to state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. Finally, we discuss the implications of our model for the understanding of sensory pattern processing in the brain. We conclude that the employed encoding and decoding mechanisms might capture general computational principles of how the brain extracts relevant information from the activity of recurrently connected neural populations.",

    "abstract": "Cold induced thermogenesis is an energy demanding process that protects endotherms against a reduction in ambient temperature. Using non-targeted LC-MS based lipidomics, we identified plasma acylcarnitines as the most significantly changed lipid class in response to the cold. Here we show that acylcarnitines provide fuel for brown fat thermogenesis. In response to the cold, FFAs released from adipocytes activate the nuclear receptor HNF4 to stimulate the expression of genes involved in acylcarnitine metabolism in the liver. Conditional deletion of HNF4 in hepatocytes blocks the cold-induced changes in hepatic gene expression, lowering circulating long chain acylcarnitine (LCAC) levels, and impairing their ability to adapt to the cold. Finally, a bolus of L-carnitine or palmitoylcarnitine rescues the cold sensitivity seen with aging. Our data highlights an elegant mechanism whereby white adipose tissue provides FFAs for hepatic carnitilation to generate plasma LCAC as a fuel source for BAT thermogenesis.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIBlood acylcarnitine levels increase in response to the cold.\\nC_LIO_LIFFA mobilization in response to the cold activates hepatic HNF4 and stimulates genes involved in acylcarnitine metabolism.\\nC_LIO_LIBrown adipocytes metabolize palmitoylcarnitine.\\nC_LIO_LICarnitine administration improves thermogenic response in aged mice.\\nC_LI\\n\\nETOCSimcox et al identified acylcarnitines as a novel source of energy for thermogenesis. In response to the cold, the liver activates a transcriptional program through the transcription factor HNF4, leading to increased acylcarnitine levels.

Increasing acylcarnitine levels in old mice increases their ability to adapt to the cold.

Activation of {beta}3-adrenergic receptors stimulates FFA release and activation of the transcription factor HNF4 in the liver. This leads to increased gene expression of enzymes involved in acylcarnitine metabolism. The acylcarnitines are released in the blood to provide fuel for brown fat thermogenesis.

To address this problem, we have created a light-weight, user-friendly tool for the assembly and annotation of microbial sequencing projects.\\n\\nResultsThe Prokaryotic Assembly and Annotation Tool, Peasant, automates the processes of read quality control, genome assembly, and annotation for microbial sequencing projects. High-quality assemblies and annotations can be generated by Peasant without the need of programming expertise or high-performance computing resources. Furthermore, statistics are calculated so that users can evaluate their sequencing project. To illustrate the computational speed and accuracy of Peasant, the SRA records of 322 Illumina platform whole genome sequencing assays for Bacillus species were retrieved from NCBI, assembled and annotated on a single desktop computer. From the assemblies and annotations produced, a comprehensive analysis of the diversity of over 200 high-quality samples was conducted, looking at both the 16S rRNA phylogenetic marker as well as the Bacillus core genome.\\n\\nConclusionsPeasant provides an intuitive solution for high-quality whole genome sequence assembly and annotation for users with limited programing experience and/or computational resources.

Here we report an unexpected link between DNA damage response and angiogenic signaling that is buffered by two distinct microRNAs. We demonstrate that genotoxic stress-induced miR-494 and miR-99b inhibit the DNA repair machinery by targeting the MRE11a-RAD50-NBN (MRN) complex. Functionally, gain and loss of function experiments show that miR-494 and miR-99b affect telomerase activity, activate p21 and Rb pathways and diminish angiogenic sprouting in vitro and in vivo. Genetic and pharmacological disruption of VEGFR-2 signaling and the MRN complex reveal a surprising co-dependency of these pathways in regulating endothelial senescence and proliferation. Vascular-targeted delivery of miR-494 decreases both growth factor-induced and tumor angiogenesis in mouse models. Mechanistically, disruption of the MRN complex induced CD44, a known driver of senescence and regulator of VEGF signaling in addition to suppressing IL-13 a stimulator of VEGF signaling. Our work identifies a putative miR-facilitated mechanism by which endothelial cells can be insulated against VEGF signaling to facilitate the onset of senescence and highlight the potential of targeting DNA repair to disrupt pathological angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "One important goal of BRAIN projects is to crack the neural code -- to understand how information is represented in patterns of electrical activity generated by ensembles of neurons. Yet the major stumbling block in the understanding of neural code is neuronal variability - neurons in the brain discharge their spikes with tremendous variability in both the control resting states and across trials within the same experiments. Such on-going spike variability imposes a great conceptual challenge to the classic rate code and/or synchrony-based temporal code. In practice, spike variability is typically removed via over-the-trial averaging methods such as peri-event spike histogram. In contrast to view neuronal variability as a noise problem, here we hypothesize that neuronal variability should be viewed as the self-information processor. Under this conceptual framework, neurons transmit their information by conforming to the basic logic of the statistical Self-Information Theory: spikes with higher-probability inter-spike-intervals (ISI) contain less information, whereas spikes with lower-probability ISIs convey more information, termed as surprisal spikes. In other words, real-time information is encoded not by changes in firing frequency per se, but rather by spikes variability probability. When these surprisal spikes occur as positive surprisals or negative surprisals in a temporally coordinated manner across populations of cells, they generate cell-assembly neural code to convey discrete quanta of information in real-time. Importantly, such surprisal code can afford not only robust resilience to interference, but also biochemical coupling to energy metabolism, protein synthesis and gene expression at both synaptic sites and cell soma. We describe how this neural self-information theory might be used as a general decoding strategy to uncover the brains various cell assemblies in an unbiased manner.",
