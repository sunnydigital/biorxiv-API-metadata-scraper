    "abstract": "Recent advances have allowed for greater investigation into microbial regulation of mercury toxicity in the environment. In wetlands in particular, dissolved organic matter (DOM) may influence methylmercury (MeHg) production both through chemical interactions and through substrate effects on microbiomes. We conducted microcosm experiments in two disparate wetland environments (oligotrophic unvegetated and high-C vegetated sediments) to examine the impacts of plant leachate and inorganic mercury loadings (20 mg/L HgCl2) on microbiomes, DOM cycling, and MeHg production in the St. Louis River Estuary. Our research reveals the greater relative capacity for mercury methylation in vegetated over unvegetated sediments. Further, our work shows how mercury cycling in oligotrophic unvegetated sediments may be susceptible to DOM inputs in the St. Louis River Estuary: microcosms receiving leachate produced substantially more MeHg than unamended microcosms. We also demonstrate (1) changes in microbiome structure towards Clostridia, (2) metagenomic shifts toward fermentation, and (3) degradation of complex DOM; all of which coincide with elevated net MeHg production in unvegetated microcosms receiving leachate. Finally, we examine microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as known potential methylators and identify important organisms for future research in the Great Lakes region. Together, our work shows the influence of wetland vegetation in controlling MeHg production in the Great Lakes region and provides evidence that this may be due to both enhanced microbial activity as well as differences in microbiome composition.",

    "abstract": "How chromosomes fold into 3D structures and how genome functions are affected or even controlled by their spatial organization remain challenging questions. Hi-C experiment has provided important structural insights for chromosome, and Hi-C data are used here to construct the 3D chromatin structure which are characterized by two spatially segregated chromatin compartments A and B. By mapping a plethora of genome features onto the constructed 3D chromatin model, we show vividly the close connection between genome properties and the spatial organization of chromatin. We are able to dissect the whole chromatin into two types of chromatin domains which have clearly different Hi-C contact patterns as well as different sizes of chromatin loops. The two chromatin types can be respectively regarded as the basic units of chromatin compartments A and B, and also spatially segregate from each other as the two chromatin compartments. Therefore, the chromatin loops segregate in the space according to their sizes, suggesting the excluded volume or entropic effect in chromatin compartmentalization as well as chromosome positioning. Taken together, these results provide clues to the folding principles of chromosomes, their spatial organization, and the resulted clustering of many genome features in the 3D space.",

    "abstract": "The existence of cooperation, or the production of public goods, is an evolutionary problem. Cooperation is not favored because the Prisoners Dilemma (PD) game drives cooperators to extinction. We have re-analyzed this problem by using RNA viruses to motivate a model for the evolution of cooperation. Gene products are the public goods and group size is the number of virions co-infecting the same host cell. Our results show that if the tradeoff between replication and production of gene products is linear, PD is observed. However, if the tradeoff is nonlinear, the viruses evolve into separate lineages of ultra-defectors and ultra-cooperators as group size is increased. The nonlinearity was justified by the existence of real viral ultra-defectors, known as defective interfering (DI) particles, which gain a nonlinear advantage by being smaller. The evolution of ultra-defectors and ultra-cooperators creates the Snow Drift game, which promotes high-level production of public goods.",

Demosponges form the largest class in sponges, but previous studies have relied on the only draft demosponge genome of Amphimedon queenslandica. Here we present the 125-megabase draft genome of a contractile laboratory demosponge Tethya wilhelma, sequenced to almost 150x coverage. We explore the genetic repertoire of transporters, receptors, and neurotransmitter metabolism across early-branching metazoans in the context of the evolution of these gene families. Presence of many genes is highly variable across animal groups, with many gene family expansions and losses. Three sponge classes show lineage-specific expansions of GABA-B receptors, far exceeding the gene number in vertebrates, while ctenophores appear to have secondarily lost most genes in the GABA pathway. Both GABA and glutamate receptors show lineage-specific domain rearrangements, making it difficult to trace the evolution of these gene families. Gene sets in the examined taxa suggest that nervous systems evolved independently at least twice and either changed function or were lost in sponges. Changes in gene content are consistent with the view that ctenophores and sponges are the earliest-branching metazoan lineages and provide additional support for the proposed clade of Placozoa/Cnidaria/Bilateria.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of fitness-affecting mutations are deleterious. How natural populations evolve to cope is a question of fundamental interest. Previous studies have reported the evolution of mutational robustness, that is, natural selection favoring populations with less deleterious mutations. By definition, mutational robustness provides a short-term fitness advantage. However, this overlooks the fact that mutational robustness decreases finite asexual populations ability to purge recurrent deleterious mutations. Thus, mutational robustness also results in higher risk of long-term extinction by Mullers ratchet. Here, we explore the tension between short- and long- term response to deleterious mutations. We first show that populations can resist the ratchet if either the selection coefficient or the ratio of beneficial to deleterious mutations increases as fitness declines. We designate these properties as ratchet robustness, which fundamentally reflects a negative feedback between mutation rate and the tendency to accumulate more mutations. We also find in simulations that populations can evolve ratchet robustness when challenged by deleterious mutations. We conclude that mutational robustness cannot be selected for in the long term, but it can be favored in the short-term, purely because of temporary fitness advantage. We also discuss other potential causes of mutational robustness in nature.",

    "abstract": "In the sciences of cognition, an influential idea is that the brain makes predictions about incoming sensory information to reduce inherent ambiguity. In the visual hierarchy, this implies that information content originating in memory-the identity of a face-propagates down to disambiguate incoming stimulus information. However, understanding this powerful prediction-for-recognition mechanism will remain elusive until we uncover the content of the information propagating down from memory. Here, we address this foundational limitation with a task ubiquitous to humans-familiar face identification. We developed a unique computer graphics platform that combines a generative model of random face identity information with the subjectivity of perception. In 14 individual participants, we reverse engineered the predicted information contents propagating down from memory to identify 4 familiar faces. In a follow-up validation, we used the predicted face information to synthesize the identity of new faces and confirmed the causal role of the predictions in face identification. We show these predictions comprise both local 3D surface patches, such as a particularly thin and pointy nose combined with a square chin and a prominent brow, or more global surface characteristics, such as a longer or broader face. Further analyses reveal that the predicted contents are efficient because they represent objective features that maximally distinguish each identity from a model norm. Our results reveal the contents that propagate down the visual hierarchy from memory, showing this coding scheme is efficient and compatible with norm-based coding, with implications for mechanistic accounts of brain and machine intelligence.",

Although the positioning of this boundary is critical for leaf morphogenesis, how the boundary is established and how it influences development remains unclear. Using live-imaging and perturbation experiments we show that leaf orientation, morphology and position are pre-patterned by HD-ZIPIII and KAN gene expression in the shoot, leading to a model in which dorsoventral genes coordinate to regulate plant development by localizing auxin response between their expression domains. However we also find that auxin levels feedback on dorsoventral patterning by spatially organizing HD-ZIPIII and KAN expression in the shoot periphery. By demonstrating that the regulation of these genes by auxin also governs their response to wounds, our results also provide a parsimonious explanation for the influence of wounds on leaf dorsoventrality.\\n\\nOnce sentence summaryCell type boundaries regulate plant development",

    "abstract": "Neuronal membrane potential resonance (MPR) is associated with subthreshold and network oscillations. A number of voltage-gated ionic currents can contribute to the generation or amplification of MPR, but how the interaction of these currents with linear currents contributes to MPR is not well understood. We explored this in the pacemaker PD neurons of the crab pyloric network. The PD neuron MPR is sensitive to blockers of H- (IH) and calcium-currents (ICa). We used the impedance profile of the biological PD neuron, measured in voltage clamp, to constrain parameter values of a conductance-based model using a genetic algorithm and obtained many optimal parameter combinations. Unlike most cases of MPR, in these optimal models, the values of resonant- (fres) and phasonant- (f{varphi}=0) frequencies were almost identical. Taking advantage of this fact, we linked the peak phase of ionic currents to their amplitude, in order to provide a mechanistic explanation the dependence of MPR on the ICa gating variable time constants. Additionally, we found that distinct pairwise correlations between ICa parameters contributed to the maintenance of fres and resonance power (QZ). Measurements of the PD neuron MPR at more hyperpolarized voltages resulted in a reduction of fres but no change in QZ. Constraining the optimal models using these data unmasked a positive correlation between the maximal conductances of IH and ICa. Thus, although IH is not necessary for MPR in this neuron type, it contributes indirectly by constraining the parameters of ICa.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMany neuron types exhibit membrane potential resonance (MPR) in which the neuron produces the largest response to oscillatory input at some preferred (resonant) frequency and, in many systems, the network frequency is correlated with neuronal MPR. MPR is captured by a peak in the impedance vs. frequency curve (Z-profile), which is shaped by the dynamics of voltage-gated ionic currents. Although neuron types can express variable levels of ionic currents, they may have a stable resonant frequency. We used the PD neuron of the crab pyloric network to understand how MPR emerges from the interplay of the biophysical properties of multiple ionic currents, each capable of generating resonance. We show the contribution of an inactivating current at the resonant frequency in terms of interacting time constants. We measured the Z-profile of the PD neuron and explored possible combinations of model parameters that fit this experimentally measured profile. We found that the Z-profile constrains and defines correlations among parameters associated with ionic currents. Furthermore, the resonant frequency and amplitude are sensitive to different parameter sets and can be preserved by co-varying pairs of parameters along their correlation lines. Furthermore, although a resonant current may be present in a neuron, it may not directly contribute to MPR, but constrain the properties of other currents that generate MPR. Finally, constraining model parameters further to those that modify their MPR properties to changes in voltage range produces maximal conductance correlations.",

Although many diverse proteins are known that can bundle microtubules, biochemical mechanisms by which cells could locally control the nucleation and formation of microtubule bundles are understudied. Here, we demonstrate that concentration of tubulin into a condensed, liquid-like compartment composed of the unstructured neuronal protein tau is sufficient to nucleate microtubule bundles. We show that under conditions of macro-molecular crowding, tau forms liquid drops. Tubulin partitions into these drops, efficiently increasing tubulin concentration and driving the nucleation of microtubules. These growing microtubules form bundles enclosed in a liquid sheath of tau. Our data suggest that condensed compartments of microtubule bundling proteins could promote the local formation of microtubule bundles in neurons by acting as non-centrosomal microtubule nucleation centers, and that liquid-like tau encapsulation could provide both stability and plasticity to long axonal microtubule bundles.",

    "abstract": "As interactions between the immune system and tumour cells are governed by a complex network of cell-cell interactions, knowing the specific immune cell composition of a solid tumour may be essential to predict a patients response to immunotherapy. Here, we analyse in depth how to derive the cellular composition of a solid tumour from bulk gene expression data by mathematical deconvolution, using indication- and cell type-specific reference gene expression profiles (RGEPs) from tumour-derived single-cell RNA sequencing data. We demonstrate that tumour-derived RGEPs are essential for the successful deconvolution and that RGEPs from peripheral blood are insufficient. We distinguish nine major cell types as well as three T cell subtypes. As the ratios of CD4+, CD8+ and regulatory T cells have been shown to predict overall survival, we extended our analysis to include the estimation of prognostic ratios that may enable the application in a clinical setting. Using the tumour derived RGEPs, we can estimate, for the first time, the content of cancer associated fibroblasts, endothelial cells and the malignant cells in a patient sample by a deconvolution approach. In addition, improved tumour cell gene expression profiles can be obtained by this method by computationally removing contamination from non-malignant cells. Given the difficulty around sample preparation and storage to obtain high quality single-cell RNA-seq data in the clinical context, the presented method represents a computational solution to derive the cellular composition of a tissue sample.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe discovery of thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammals raises a question about their functionality. It has been shown that some of them function post-transcriptionally via formation of inter-molecular duplexes. Sequence alignment tools are frequently used for transcriptome-wide prediction of RNA-RNA interactions. However, such approaches have poor prediction accuracy since they ignore RNA secondary structure and interaction energy. On the other hand, application of the thermodynamics-based algorithms to long transcripts is not computationally feasible on a large scale.\\n\\nResultsHere we describe a new computational pipeline ASSA that combines sequence alignment and thermodynamics tools for efficient prediction of RNA-RNA interactions between long transcripts. ASSA outperforms four other tools in terms of the Area Under the Curve. ASSA predictions for the lncRNA HOTAIR confirm that it binds to the chromatin through hybridization with the nascent transcripts. Analysis of the 49 murine lncRNA knockdown experiments reveals one transcript that may regulate its targets via RNA-RNA interactions.\\n\\nAvailabilityASSA is available at http://assa.sourceforge.net/.\\n\\nContactivan.antonov@gatech.edu",

    "abstract": "The most prevalent post-transcriptional RNA modification, pseudouridine ({Psi}), also known as the fifth ribonucleoside, is widespread in rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs and mRNAs. Pseudouridines in RNAs are implicated in many aspects of post-transcriptional regulation, such as the maintenance of translation fidelity, control of RNA stability and stabilization of RNA structure. However, our understanding of the functions, mechanisms as well as precise distribution of pseudourdines (especially in mRNAs) still remains largely unclear. Though thousands of RNA pseudouridylation sites have been identified by high-throughput experimental techniques recently, the landscape of pseudouridines across the whole transcriptome has not yet been fully delineated. In this study, we present a highly effective model, called PULSE (PseudoUridyLation Sites Estimator), to predict novel {Psi} sites from large-scale profiling data of pseudouridines and characterize the contextual sequence features of pseudouridylation. PULSE employs a deep learning framework, called convolutional neural network (CNN), which has been successfully and widely used for sequence pattern discovery in the literature. Our extensive validation tests demonstrated that PULSE can outperform conventional learning models and achieve high prediction accuracy, thus enabling us to further characterize the transcriptome-wide landscape of pseudouridine sites. Overall, PULSE can provide a useful tool to further investigate the functional roles of pseudouridylation in post-transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "Proteins perform their functions in solution but their structures are most frequently studied inside crystals. Here we probe how the crystal packing alters microsecond dynamics, using solid-state NMR measurements and multi-microsecond MD simulations of different crystal forms of ubiquitin. In particular, NEar-Rotary-resonance Relaxation Dispersion (NERRD) experiments probe angular backbone motion, while Bloch-McConnell Relaxation Dispersion data report on fluctuations of the local electronic environment. These experiments and simulations reveal that the packing of the protein can significantly alter the thermodynamics and kinetics of local conformational exchange. Moreover, we report small-amplitude reorientational motion of protein molecules in the crystal lattice with a [~]3-5{degrees} amplitude on a tens-of-microseconds time scale in one of the crystals, but not in others. An intriguing possibility arises that overall motion is to some extent coupled to local dynamics. Our study highlights the importance of considering the packing when analyzing dynamics of crystalline proteins.",

    "abstract": "Mark-recapture distance sampling uses detections, non-detections and recorded distances of animals encountered in transect surveys to estimate abundance. However, commonly available distance sampling estimators require that distances to target animals are made without error and that animals are stationary while sampling is being conducted. In practice these requirements are often violated. In this paper, we describe a marginal likelihood framework for estimating abundance from double-observer data that can accommodate movement and measurement error when observations are made consecutively (as with front and rear observers) and when animals are randomly distributed when detected by the first observer. Our framework requires that two observers independently detect and record binned distances to observed animal groups, as we well as a binary indicator for whether animals were moving or not. We then assume that stationary animals are subject to measurement error whereas moving animals are subject to both movement and measurement error. Integrating over unknown animal locations, we construct a marginal likelihood for detection, movement, and measurement error parameters. Estimates of animal abundance are then obtained using a modified Horvitz-Thompson-like estimator. In addition, unmodelled heterogeneity in detection probability can be accommodated through observer dependence parameters. Using simulation, we show that our approach yields low bias compared to approaches that ignore movement and/or measurement error, including in cases where there is considerable detection heterogeneity. We demonstrate our approach using data from a double-observer waterfowl helicopter survey.",

However, while there is general agreement within ecology that the first author is the person who contributed the most to a particular project, there is less agreement regarding whether being last author is a position of significance and regarding what is indicated by someone being the corresponding author on a manuscript. Using an analysis of papers published in American Naturalist, Ecology, Evolution, and Oikos, I found that: 1) the number of authors on papers is increasing over time; 2) the proportion of first authors as corresponding author has increased over time, as has the proportion of last authors as corresponding author; 3) 84% of papers published in 2016 had the first author as corresponding author; and 4) geographic regions differed in the likelihood of having the first (or last) author as corresponding author. I also carried out an online survey to better understand views on last and corresponding authorship. This survey revealed that most ecologists view the last author as the \\\"senior\\\" author on a paper (that is, the person who runs the research group in which most of the work was carried out), and most ecologists view the corresponding author as the person taking full responsibility for a paper. However, there was substantial variation in views on authorship, especially corresponding authorship. Given these results, I suggest that discussions of authorship have as their starting point that the first author will be corresponding author and the senior author will be last author. I also suggest ways of deciding author order in cases where two senior authors contributed equally.",

    "abstract": "How genetic variation contributes to phenotypic variation is a central question in genetics. Association signals for a complex trait are found throughout the majority of the genome suggesting much of the genome is under some degree of genetic constraint. Here, we develop a intraspecific population genetics approach to define a measure of population structure for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Using this approach, we test for evidence of stabilizing selection at complex traits and pleiotropic loci arising from the evolutionary history of 47 complex traits and common diseases. Our approach allowed us to identify traits and regions under stabilizing selection towards both global and subpopulation optima. Strongest depletion of allelic diversity was found at disease loci, indicating stabilizing selection has acted on these phenotypes in all subpopulations. Pleiotropic loci predominantly displayed evidence of stabilizing selection, often contributed to multiple disease risks, and sometimes also affected non-disease traits such as height. Risk alleles at pleiotropic disease loci displayed a more consistent direction of effect than expected by chance suggesting that stabilizing selection acting on pleiotropic loci is amplified through multiple disease phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have been useful in identifying common genetic variants related to a variety of complex traits and diseases; however, they are often limited in their ability to inform about underlying biology. Whilst bioinformatics analyses, studies of cells, animal models and applied genetic epidemiology have provided some understanding of genetic associations or causal pathways, there is a need for new genetic studies that elucidate causal relationships and mechanisms in a cost-effective, precise and statistically efficient fashion. We discuss the motivation for and the characteristics of the Recall-by-Genotype (RbG) study design, an approach that enables genotype-directed deep-phenotyping and improvement in drawing causal inferences. Specifically, we present RbG designs using single and multiple variants and discuss the inferential properties, analytical approaches and applications of both. We consider the efficiency of the RbG approach, the likely value of RbG studies for the causal investigation of disease aetiology and the practicalities of incorporating genotypic data into population studies in the context of the RbG study design. Finally, we provide a catalogue of the UK-based resources for such studies, an online tool to aid the design of new RbG studies and discuss future developments of this approach.",

    "abstract": "Human genome sequencing has generated population variant datasets containing millions of variants from hundreds of thousands of individuals1-3. The datasets show the genomic distribution of genetic variation to be influenced on genic and sub-genic scales by gene essentiality,1,4,5 protein domain architecture6 and the presence of genomic features such as splice donor/acceptor sites.2 However, the variant data are still too sparse to provide a comparative picture of genetic variation between individual protein residues in the proteome.1,6 Here, we overcome this sparsity for [~]25,000 human protein domains in 1,291 domain families by aggregating variants over equivalent positions (columns) in multiple sequence alignments of sequence-similar (paralagous) domains7,8. We then compare the resulting variation profiles from the human population to residue conservation across all species9 and find that the same tertiary structural and functional pressures that affect amino acid conservation during domain evolution constrain missense variant distributions. Thus, depletion of missense variants at a position implies that it is structurally or functionally important. We find such positions are enriched in known disease-associated variants (OR = 2.83, p {approx} 0) while positions that are both missense depleted and evolutionary conserved are further enriched in disease-associated variants (OR = 1.85, p = 3.3x10-17) compared to those that are only evolutionary conserved (OR = 1.29, p = 4.5x10-19). Unexpectedly, a subset of evolutionary Unconserved positions are Missense Depleted in human (UMD positions) and these are also enriched in pathogenic variants (OR = 1.74, p = 0.02). UMD positions are further differentiated from other unconserved residues in that they are enriched in ligand, DNA and protein binding interactions (OR = 1.59, p = 0.003), which suggests this stratification can identify functionally important positions. A different class of positions that are Conserved and Missense Enriched (CME) show an enrichment of ClinVar risk factor variants (OR = 2.27, p = 0.004). We illustrate these principles with the G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) family, Nuclear Receptor Ligand Binding Domain family and In Between Ring-Finger (IBR) domains and list a total of 343 UMD positions in 211 domain families. This study will have broad applications to: (a) providing focus for functional studies of specific proteins by mutagenesis; (b) refining pathogenicity prediction models; (c) highlighting which residue interactions to target when refining the specificity of small-molecule drugs.",

Studying binding conformations has allowed scientists to explore some of the mechanistic underpinnings of disease caused by disruption of protein interactions. However, since experimentally determined interaction structures are only available for a small fraction of the known interactome such inquiry has largely excluded functional genomic studies of the human interactome and broad observations of the inner workings of disease. Here we present Interactome INSIDER, an information center for genomic studies using the first full-interactome map of human interaction interfaces. We applied a new, unified framework to predict protein interaction interfaces for 184,605 protein interactions with previously unresolved interfaces in human and 7 model organisms, including the entire experimentally determined human binary interactome. We find that predicted interfaces share several known functional properties of interfaces, including an enrichment for disease mutations and recurrent cancer mutations, suggesting their applicability to functional genomic studies. We also performed 2,164 de novo mutagenesis experiments and show that mutations of predicted interface residues disrupt interactions at a similar rate to known interface residues and at a much higher rate than mutations outside of predicted interfaces. To spur functional genomic studies in the human interactome, Interactome INSIDER (http://interactomeinsider.yulab.org) allows users to explore known population variants, disease mutations, and somatic cancer mutations, or upload their own set of mutations to find enrichment at the level of protein domains, residues, and 3D atomic clustering in known and predicted interaction interfaces.",

Here, we collected bacterial 16S rRNA gene community profiles from a set of 32 individuals from a single population and compare the variation to that of samples collected from different substrates and locations.

    "abstract": "Bacteria play a key role in freshwater biogeochemical cycling, but long-term trends in freshwater bacterial community composition and dynamics are not yet well characterized. We used a multi-year time series of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data from eight bog lakes to census the freshwater bacterial community and observe annual and seasonal trends in abundance. Multiple sites and sampling events were necessary to begin to fully describe the bacterial communities. Each lake and layer contained a distinct bacterial community, with distinct levels of richness and indicator taxa that likely reflected the environmental conditions of each site. The community present in each year and site was also unique. Despite high interannual variability in community composition, we detected a core community of ubiquitous freshwater taxa. Although trends in abundance did not repeat annually, each freshwater lineage within the communities had a consistent lifestyle, defined by persistence, abundance, and variability. The results of our analysis emphasize the importance of long-term observations, as analyzing only a single year of data would not have allowed us to describe the dynamics and composition of these freshwater bacterial communities to the extent presented here.\\n\\nImportanceLakes are excellent systems for investigating bacterial community dynamics because they have clear boundaries and strong environmental gradients. The results of our research demonstrate that bacterial community dynamics operate on multi-year timescales, a finding which likely applies to other ecosystems, with implications for study design and interpretation. Understanding the drivers and controls of bacterial communities on long time scales would improve both our knowledge of fundamental properties of bacterial communities, and our ability to predict community states. In this specific ecosystem, bog lakes play a disproportionately large role in global carbon cycling, and the information presented here may ultimately help refine carbon budgets for these lakes. Finally, all data and code in this study are publicly available. We hope that this will serve as a resource to anyone seeking to answer their own microbial ecology questions using a multi-year time series.",

    "abstract": "Soft rot enterobacteria (Dickeya and Pectobacterium) are major pathogens that cause diseases on plants of agricultural importance such as potato and ornamentals. Long term studies to identify virulence factors of these bacteria focused mostly on plant cell wall degrading enzymes secreted by the type II secretion system and the regulation of their expression. To identify new virulence factors we performed a Tn-seq genome-wide screen of a transposon mutant library during chicory infection followed by high-throughput sequencing. This allowed the detection of mutants with reduced but also increased fitness in the plant. Virulence factors identified differed from those previously known since diffusible ones (secreted enzymes, siderophores or metabolites) were not detected by this screen. In addition to genes encoding proteins of unknown function that could be new virulence factors, others could be assigned to known biological functions. The central role of the FlhDC regulatory cascade in the control of virulence was highlighted with the identification of new members of this pathway. Scarcity of the plant in certain amino acids and nucleic acids required presence of the corresponding biosynthetic genes in the bacteria. Their products could be targets for the development of antibacterial compounds. Among the genes required for full development in chicory we also identified six genes involved in the glycosylation of the flagellin FliC, glycosylation, which in other plant pathogenic bacteria contributes to virulence.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIdentification of virulence factors of plant pathogenic bacteria has relied on the test of individual mutants on plants, a time-consuming method. New methods like transcriptomic or proteomic can now be used but they only allow the identification of genes induced during the infection process and non-induced genes may be missed. Tn-seq is a very powerful method to identify genes required for bacterial growth in their host. We used for the first time this method in a plant pathogenic bacteria to identify genes required for the multiplication of Dickeya dadantii in chicory. We identified about 100 genes with decreased or increased fitness in the plant. Most of them had no previously described role in bacterial virulence. We unveiled important metabolic genes and regulators of motility and virulence. We showed that D. dadantii flagellin is glycosylated and that this modification confers fitness to the bacteria during plant infection. Our work opens the way to the use of Tn-seq with bacterial phytopathogens. Assay by this method of large collections of environmental pathogenic strains now available will allow an easy and rapid identification of new virulence factors.",

    "abstract": "Soft rot enterobacteria (Dickeya and Pectobacterium) are major pathogens that cause diseases on plants of agricultural importance such as potato and ornamentals. Long term studies to identify virulence factors of these bacteria focused mostly on plant cell wall degrading enzymes secreted by the type II secretion system and the regulation of their expression. To identify new virulence factors we performed a Tn-seq genome-wide screen of a transposon mutant library during chicory infection followed by high-throughput sequencing. This allowed the detection of mutants with reduced but also increased fitness in the plant. Virulence factors identified differed from those previously known since diffusible ones (secreted enzymes, siderophores or metabolites) were not detected by this screen. In addition to genes encoding proteins of unknown function that could be new virulence factors, others could be assigned to known biological functions. The central role of the FlhDC regulatory cascade in the control of virulence was highlighted with the identification of new members of this pathway. Scarcity of the plant in certain amino acids and nucleic acids required presence of the corresponding biosynthetic genes in the bacteria. Their products could be targets for the development of antibacterial compounds. Among the genes required for full development in chicory we also identified six genes involved in the glycosylation of the flagellin FliC, glycosylation, which in other plant pathogenic bacteria contributes to virulence.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIdentification of virulence factors of plant pathogenic bacteria has relied on the test of individual mutants on plants, a time-consuming method. New methods like transcriptomic or proteomic can now be used but they only allow the identification of genes induced during the infection process and non-induced genes may be missed. Tn-seq is a very powerful method to identify genes required for bacterial growth in their host. We used for the first time this method in a plant pathogenic bacteria to identify genes required for the multiplication of Dickeya dadantii in chicory. We identified about 100 genes with decreased or increased fitness in the plant. Most of them had no previously described role in bacterial virulence. We unveiled important metabolic genes and regulators of motility and virulence. We showed that D. dadantii flagellin is glycosylated and that this modification confers fitness to the bacteria during plant infection. Our work opens the way to the use of Tn-seq with bacterial phytopathogens. Assay by this method of large collections of environmental pathogenic strains now available will allow an easy and rapid identification of new virulence factors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGut microbiota composition of intensive care unit (ICU) patients suffering from Clostridium difficile-positive diarrhea (CDpD) is still poorly understood. This study aims to use 16S rDNA (and metagenome) sequencing to compare the microbiota composition of 58 (and 5) ICU patients with CDpD (CDpD group), 33 (and 4) ICU patients with C. difficile negative diarrhea (CDnD group), and 21 (and 5) healthy control subjects (control group), as well as CDpD patients in A+B+ (N=34; A/B: C. difficile TcdA/B), A-B+ (N=7), and A-B- (N=17) subgroups. For 16S rDNA data, OTU clustering (tool: UPARSE), taxonomic assignment (tool: RDP classifier), -diversity and {beta}-diversity analyses (tool: QIIME) were conducted. For metagenome data, metagenome assembly (tool: SOAP), gene calling (tools: MetaGeneMark, CD-HIT, and SoapAligner), unigene alignment (tool: DIAMOND), taxon difference analysis (tool: Metastats), and gene annotation (tool: DIAMOND) were performed.\\n\\nResultsThe microbial diversity of CDpD group was lower than that of CDnD and control groups. The abundances of 10 taxa (e.g. Deferribacteres, Cryptomycota, Acetothermia) in CDpD group were significantly higher than that in CDnD group. The abundances of Saccharomycetes and Clostridia were significantly lower in CDpD in comparison with control. A+B+, A-B+ and A-B- subgroups couldnt be separated in principal component analysis, while some taxa are significantly different between A+B+ and A-B- subgroups.\\n\\nConclusionCDpD might relate to the decrease of beneficial taxa (i.e. Saccharomycetes and Clostridia) and the increase of harmful taxa (e.g. Deferribacteres, Cryptomycota, Acetothermia) in gut microbiota in ICU patients. C. difficile type might be slightly associated with gut microbiota composition.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by prior data on local cortical shrinkage and intracortical myelination, we predicted age-related changes in topological organisation of cortical structural networks during adolescence. We estimated structural correlation from magnetic resonance imaging measures of cortical thickness at 308 regions in a sample of N=297 healthy participants, aged 14-24 years. We used a novel sliding-window analysis to measure age-related changes in network attributes globally, locally and in the context of several community partitions of the network. We found that the strength of structural correlation generally decreased as a function of age. Association cortical regions demonstrated a sharp decrease in nodal degree (hubness) from 14 years, reaching a minimum at approximately 19 years, and then levelling off or even slightly increasing until 24 years. Greater and more prolonged age-related changes in degree of cortical regions within the brain network were associated with faster rates of adolescent cortical myelination and shrinkage. The brain regions that demonstrated the greatest age-related changes were concentrated within prefrontal modules. We conclude that human adolescence is associated with biologically plausible changes in structural imaging markers of brain network organization, consistent with the concept of tuning or consolidating anatomical connectivity between frontal cortex and the rest of the connectome.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous activity measured in human subject under the absence of any task exhibits complex patterns of correlation that largely correspond to large-scale functional topographies obtained with a wide variety of cognitive and perceptual tasks. These \\\"resting state networks\\\" (RSNs) fluctuate over time, forming and dissolving on the scale of seconds to minutes. While these fluctuations, most prominently those of the default mode network, have been linked to cognitive function, it remains unclear whether they result from random noise or whether they index a non-stationary process which could be described as state switching.\\n\\nIn this study, we use a sliding windows-approach to relate temporal dynamics of RSNs to global modulations in correlation and BOLD variance. We compare empirical data, phase-randomized surrogate data, and data simulated with a stationary model. We find that RSN time courses exhibit a large amount of coactivation in all three cases, and that the modulations in their activity are closely linked to global dynamics of the underlying BOLD signal.\\n\\nWe find that many properties of the observed fluctuations in FC and BOLD, including their ranges and their correlations amongst each other, are explained by fluctuations around the average FC structure. However, we also encounter interesting characteristics that are not explained in this way. In particular, we find that the brain spends more time in the troughs of modulations than can be expected from stationary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly hypothesized that scientists are more likely to engage in data falsification and fabrication when they are subject to pressures to publish, when they are not restrained by forms of social control, when they work in countries lacking policies to tackle scientific misconduct, and when they are male. Evidence to test these hypotheses, however, is inconclusive due to the difficulties of obtaining unbiased data.\\n\\nHere we report a pre-registered test of these four hypotheses, conducted on papers that were identified in a previous study as containing problematic image duplications through a systematic screening of the journal PLoS ONE. Image duplications were classified into three categories based on their complexity, with category 1 being most likely to reflect unintentional error and category 3 being most likely to reflect intentional fabrication. Multiple parameters connected to the hypotheses above were tested with a matched-control paradigm, by collecting two controls for each paper containing duplications.\\n\\nCategory 1 duplications were mostly not associated with any of the parameters tested, in accordance with the assumption that these duplications were mostly not due to misconduct. Category 2 and 3, however, exhibited numerous statistically significant associations. Results of univariable and multivariable analyses support the hypotheses that academic culture, peer control, cash-based publication incentives and national misconduct policies might affect scientific integrity. Significant correlations between the risk of image duplication and individual publication rates or gender, however, were only observed in secondary and exploratory analyses.\\n\\nCountry-level parameters generally exhibited effects of larger magnitude than individual-level parameters, because a subset of countries was significantly more likely to produce problematic image duplications.

Here, we present a system using a fusion protein comprised of a programmable DNA modification protein, Cas9, linked to a cell cycle regulated protein, geminin, as well as green fluorescent protein (GFP) for visualization. Despite the large size of Cas9 relative to geminin, cells were observed to express Cas9-GFP-geminin at levels which oscillate with the cell cycle. These fusion proteins are also shown to retain double-strand break (DSB) activity at specific chromosomal sequences to produce both indels and targeted integration of donor ssDNA. Most importantly, the ratio of ssDNA donor integration to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) was observed to increase, suggesting that cell cycle control Cas9 expression may be an effective strategy to bias DNA repair outcomes.",

Rio de Janeiro was among the Brazilian cities which were hit the hardest, with more that a hundred thousand confirmed cases up to the end of 2016. Given the severity of the neurological damage caused by ZIKV on fetuses, we wondered whether it would also cause an increase in the number of miscarriages, especially very early ones. As early miscarriages are unlikely to be recorded as a health event, this effect - if it occurred - would only show up as a reduction in the number of live births. In this paper we show that there was a 15% drop in live births between September and December 2016 compared to the previous year, and that this sharp drop from epidemiological week 33 onward is strongly correlated with the number of recorded cases of Zika about 40 weeks earlier. We postulate that ZIKV is directly responsible for this drop in the birth rate. Further work is required to ascertain whether other factors such the fear of having a microcephaly baby or the economic crisis are having a significant effect.",

To study the heterogeneity of data across countries, cause of poisonings, and treatment facilities.\\n\\nMethodsWe searched literature databases as well as the internet for studies on case-fatality and severity scores of pesticide poisoning. Studies published between 1990 and 2014 providing information on active ingredients in pesticides or chemical groups of active ingredients were included. The variability of case-fatality-ratios was analyzed by computing the coefficient of variation as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.\\n\\nFindingsWe identified 145 studies of which 67 could be included after assessment. Case-fatality-ratio (CFR) on 68 active ingredients and additionally on 13 groups of active ingredients were reported from 20 countries. Mean CFR for group of pesticides is 12 %, for single pesticides 15 %. Of those 12 active ingredients with a CFR above 20 % only two are WHO-classified as \\\"extremely hazardous\\\" or \\\"highly hazardous\\\", respectively. Two of seven pesticides considered \\\"unlikely to present hazard in normal use\\\" show CFR above 20 %. The variability of reported case fatality was rather low.\\n\\nConclusionAlthough human pesticide poisoning is a serious public health problem an unexpected small number of publications report on the clinical outcomes. However, CFR of acute human pesticide poisoning are available for several groups of pesticides as well as for active ingredients and show little variability. Therefore the CFR might be utilized to prioritize highly hazardous pesticides especially since there is limited correspondence between the animal-test-based hazard classification and the human CFR of the respective pesticide. Reporting of available poisoning data should be improved, human case-fatality data are a reasonable tool to be included systematically in pesticide registration and regulation.",

    "abstract": "Systemic inflammation can impair cognition with relevance to dementia, delirium and post-operative cognitive dysfunction. Acute episodes of delirium also contribute significantly to rates of long-term cognitive decline, implying that de novo pathology occurs during these acute episodes. Whether systemic inflammation-induced acute dysfunction and acute brain injury occur by overlapping or discrete mechanisms has not been investigated. Here we show that systemic inflammation, induced by bacterial LPS, produces both working memory deficits and acute brain injury in the degenerating brain and that these occur by dissociable IL-1-dependent processes. In normal C57BL/6 mice, LPS (100g/kg) did not affect working memory but robustly impaired contextual fear conditioning (CFC). However prior hippocampal synaptic loss left mice selectively vulnerable to LPS-induced working memory deficits. Systemically administered IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) was protective against, and systemic IL-1{beta} replicated, these working memory deficits. Although LPS-induced deficits still occured in IL-1RI-/- mice, systemic TNF- was sufficient to induce similar deficits, indicating redundancy among these cytokines. Dexamethasone abolished systemic cytokine synthesis and was protective against working memory deficits despite failing to block brain IL-1{beta} synthesis. Direct application of IL-1{beta} to ex vivo hippocampal slices induced non-synaptic depolarisation and irrevesible loss of membrane potential in CA1 neurons from diseased animals and systemic LPS increased apoptosis in the degenerating brain, in an IL-1RI-/- dependent-fashion. The data suggest that LPS induces working memory dysfunction via circulating IL-1{beta} but dysfunction leading to neuronal death is mediated by hippocampal IL-1{beta}. The data suggest that acute systemic inflammation produces both reversible cognitive deficits, resembling delirium, and acute brain injury that may lead to long-term cognitive impairment but that these events are mechanistically dissociable. This would have significant implications for management of cognitive dysfunction and decline during acute illness.",

    "abstract": "Neurons within cortical microcircuits are interconnected with recurrent excitatory synaptic connections that are thought to amplify signals (Douglas and Martin, 2007), form selective subnetworks (Ko et al., 2011) and aid feature discrimination. Strong inhibition (Haider et al., 2013) counterbalances excitation, enabling sensory features to be sharpened and represented by sparse codes (Willmore et al., 2011). This \\\"balance\\\" between excitation and inhibition makes it difficult to assess the strength, or gain, of recurrent excitatory connections within cortical networks, which is key to understanding their operational regime and the computations they perform. Networks of neurons combining an unstable high-gain excitatory population with stabilizing inhibitory feedback are known as inhibition-stabilized networks (ISNs; Tsodyks et al. 1997). Theoretical studies using reduced network models predict that ISNs produce paradoxical responses to perturbation, but experimental perturbations failed to find evidence for ISNs in cortex (Atallah et al., 2012). We re-examined this question by investigating how cortical network models consisting of many neurons behave following perturbations, and found that results obtained from reduced network models fail to predict responses to perturbations in more realistic networks. Our models predict that a large proportion of the inhibitory network must be perturbed in order to robustly detect an ISN regime in cortex. We propose that wide-field optogenetic suppression of inhibition under a promoter targeting all inhibitory neurons may provide a perturbation of sufficient strength to reveal the operating regime of cortex. Our results suggest that detailed computational models of optogenetic perturbations are necessary to interpret the results of experimental paradigms.\\n\\nSignificance statementMany useful computational mechanisms proposed for cortex require local excitatory recurrence to be very strong, such that local inhibitory feedback is necessary to avoid epileptiform runaway activity (an \\\"inhibition-stabilized network\\\" or \\\"ISN\\\" regime). However, recent experimental results suggest this regime may not exist in cortex. We simulated activity perturbations in cortical networks of increasing realism, and found that in order to detect ISN-like properties in cortex, large proportions of the inhibitory population must be perturbed. Current experimental methods for inhibitory perturbation are unlikely to satisfy this requirement, implying that existing experimental observations are inconclusive about the computational regime of cortex. Our results suggest that new experimental designs, targetting a majority of inhibitory neurons, may be able to resolve this question.",
