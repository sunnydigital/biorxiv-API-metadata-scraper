    "abstract": "One way to analyze the relationship between species attributes and sample attributes via the matrix of species composition is to calculate the community-weighted mean of species attributes (CWM) and relate it to sample attributes by correlation, regression or ANOVA. This weighted-mean approach is frequently used by vegetation ecologists to relate species attributes like plant functional traits or Ellenberg-like species indicator values to sample attributes like measured environmental variables, biotic properties, species richness or sample scores in ordination analysis.\\n\\nThe problem with the weighted-mean approach is that, in certain cases, it yields biased results in terms of both effect size and P-values, and this bias is contingent upon the beta diversity of the species composition data. The reason is that CWM values calculated from samples of communities sharing some species are not independent of each other. This influences the number of effective degrees of freedom, which is usually lower than the actual number of samples, and the difference further increases with decreasing beta diversity of the data set. The discrepancy between the number of effective degrees of freedom and the number of samples in analysis turns into biased effect sizes and an inflated Type I error rate in those cases where the significance of the relationship is tested by standard tests, a problem which is analogous to analysis of two spatially autocorrelated variables. Consequently, results of studies using rather homogeneous (although not necessarily small) compositional data sets may be overly optimistic, and effect sizes of studies based on data sets differing by their beta diversity are not directly comparable.\\n\\nHere, I introduce guidelines on how to decide in which situation the bias is actually a problem when interpreting results, recognizing that there are several types of species and sample attributes with different properties and that ecological hypotheses commonly tested by the weighted-mean approach fall into one of three broad categories. I also compare available analytical solutions accounting for the bias (modified permutation test and sequential permutation test using the fourth-corner statistic) and suggest rules for their use.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Pornography consumption is highly prevalent, particularly among young adult males. For some individuals, problematic pornography use (PPU) is a reason for seeking treatment. Despite the pervasiveness of pornography, PPU appears under-investigated, including with respect to the underlying neural mechanisms.\\n\\nUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined ventral striatal responses to erotic and monetary stimuli, disentangling cue-related  wanting from reward-related  liking among 28 heterosexual males seeking treatment for PPU and 24 heterosexual males without PPU. Subjects engaged in an incentive delay task in the scanner, in which they received erotic or monetary rewards preceded by predictive cues. BOLD responses to erotic and monetary cues were analyzed and examined with respect to self-reported data on sexual activity collected over the 2 preceding months.\\n\\nMen with and without PPU differed in their striatal responses to cues predicting erotic pictures, but not in their responses to erotic pictures. PPU subjects when compared to control subjects showed increased activation of ventral striatum specifically for cues predicting erotic pictures but not for cues predicting monetary gains. Relative sensitivity to cues predicting erotic pictures versus monetary gains was significantly related to the increased behavioral motivation to view erotic images (suggestive of higher  wanting), severity of PPU, amount of pornography use per week and number of weekly masturbations.\\n\\nOur findings suggest that, similar to what is observed in substance and gambling addictions, the neural and behavioral mechanisms associated with the anticipatory processing of cues specifically predicting erotic rewards relate importantly to clinically relevant features of PPU. These findings suggest that PPU may represent a behavioral addiction and that interventions helpful in targeting behavioral and substance addictions warrant consideration for adaptation and use in helping men with PPU.",

Metabolism and behaviour are coordinated by neuromodulation; a number of the implicated neuromodulatory systems are homologous between mammals and the vinegar fly, an important neurogenetic model. We investigated whether silencing fly neuromodulatory networks would elicit coordinated changes in feeding, behavioural activity and metabolism. We employed transgenic lines that allowed us to inhibit broad cellular sets of the dopaminergic, serotonergic, octopaminergic, tyraminergic and neuropeptide F systems. The genetically-manipulated animals were assessed for changes in their overt behavioural responses and metabolism by monitoring eleven parameters: activity; climbing ability; individual feeding; group feeding; food discovery; both fed and starved respiration; fed and starved lipid content; and fed/starved body weight. The results from these 55 experiments indicate that individual neuromodulatory system effects on feeding behaviour, motor activity and metabolism are dissociated.",

    "abstract": "The development of network inference methodologies that accurately predict connectivity in dysregulated pathways may enable the rational selection of patient therapies. Accurately inferring an intracellular network from data remains a very challenging problem in molecular systems biology. Living cells integrate extremely robust circuits that exhibit significant heterogeneity, but still respond to external stimuli in predictable ways. This phenomenon allows us to introduce a network inference methodology that integrates measurements of protein activation from perturbation experiments. The methodology relies on logic-based networks to provide a predictive approximation of the transfer of signals in a network. The approach presented was validated in silico with a set of test networks and applied to investigate the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling of a breast epithelial cell line, MFC10A. In our analysis, we predict the potential signaling circuitry most likely responsible for the experimental readouts of several proteins in the mitogen activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathways. The approach can also be used to identify additional necessary perturbation experiments to distinguish between a set of possible candidate networks.",

Though numerical systems have been developed, there is currently no system to quantify the probability of a pedigree following certain inheritance systems. My system intends to fulfill that chasm by creating a flexible numerical system and testing it for variance. First, my system attempts to adapt inheritance system to known pedigree data. Then, it calculates the difference between the calculated values and the known pedigree data. It aggregates these values, then it uses a chi-squared analysis in order to determine the likelihood of said inheritance system.

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy is a growing field in cancer research. A privileged tumor-associated antigen that has received much attention is N-glycolyl (NeuGc) GM3. This ganglioside is present in several types of cancer, but is almost undetectable in human healthy tissues. However, its non-hydroxylated variant, NeuAc GM3, is abundant in all mammals. Due to a deletion in the human gene encoding the key enzyme for synthesis of NeuGc, humans, in contrast to other mammals, cannot synthesize NeuGc GM3. Therefore the presence of this ganglioside in human cancer cells represents an enigma. It has been shown that hypoxic conditions trigger the expression of NeuGc gangliosides, which not only serve as attractive targets for cancer therapy, but also as diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker. Here, we confirm hypoxia-induced expression of the NeuGc GM3 ganglioside also in HeLa cells and reveal several candidate proteins, in particular GM3 synthase and subunit B of respiratory complex II (SDHB), that may be involved in the generation of NeuGc GM3 by SILAC-based proteome analysis. These findings have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of how this enigmatic tumor-associated antigen is produced in humans, and also suggest a possible mechanism of action of anti-tumor antibodies that recognize hypoxia markers, such as 14F7.",

    "abstract": "The soluble domain of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COX2), located in the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, contains a binuclear copper site (CuA) through which electrons flow from cytochrome c to the core of the oxidase where oxygen reduction takes place. Being COX2 encoded in the mitochondrial genome, newly synthesized protein undergoes maturation steps in which it is translocated through and inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane, and copper ions are loaded to form the CuA site. These steps are ensured by several protein factors in a complex pathway that is not fully understood, including copper-loading and disulfide-reduction proteins plus chaperones that assist proper membrane insertion. While the structure and function of copper-loading and disulfide-reducing proteins Sco1 and Sco2 have been quite studied at atomistic level, the latest biological studies have uncovered roles for other proteins that are not yet much understood at the structural level. In particular, recent experiments showed that membrane protein COX18 is a membrane-protein insertase for COX2, whereas membrane protein COX20 is a chaperone that stabilizes COX2 during translocation through the inner mitochondrial membrane, and soluble protein COA6 is part of the copper-loading pathway in conjunction with Sco1 and Sco2. This work reports structural models for COX18, COX20 and COA6, built judiciously from homology modeling, contact prediction-based modeling and transmembrane helix predictions, while considering the underlying biology. Implications and limitations of the models are discussed, and possible experimental routes to pursue are proposed.

Using this PRIMMUS (PRoteomic analysis of Intracellular iMMUnolabeled cell Subsets) approach, we now compare protein abundance and phosphorylation changes in interphase and mitotic fractions from asynchronously growing human cells. We identify a set of 115 phosphorylation sites increased during G2, which we term  early risers. This set includes phosphorylation of S738 on TPX2, which we show is important for TPX2 function and mitotic progression. Further, we use PRIMMUS to provide a proteome-wide analysis of protein abundance remodeling between prophase, prometaphase and anaphase.",

    "abstract": "Illumina-based next generation sequencing (NGS) has accelerated biomedical discovery through its ability to generate thousands of gigabases of sequencing output per run at a fraction of the time and cost of conventional technologies. The process typically involves four basic steps: library preparation, cluster generation, sequencing, and data analysis. In 2015, a new chemistry of cluster generation was introduced in the newer Illumina machines (HiSeq 3000/4000/X Ten) called exclusion amplification (ExAmp), which was a fundamental shift from the earlier method of random cluster generation by bridge amplification on a non-patterned flow cell. The ExAmp chemistry, in conjunction with patterned flow cells containing nanowells at fixed locations, increases cluster density on the flow cell, thereby reducing the cost per run. It also increases sequence read quality, especially for longer read lengths (up to 150 base pairs). This advance has been widely adopted for genome sequencing because greater sequencing depth can be achieved for lower cost without compromising the quality of longer reads. We show that this promising chemistry is problematic, however, when multiplexing samples. We discovered that up to 5-10% of sequencing reads (or signals) are incorrectly assigned from a given sample to other samples in a multiplexed pool. We provide evidence that this \\\"spreading-of-signals\\\" arises from low levels of free index primers present in the pool. These index primers can prime pooled library fragments at random via complementary 3 ends, and get extended by DNA polymerase, creating a new library molecule with a new index before binding to the patterned flow cell to generate a cluster for sequencing. This causes the resulting read from that cluster to be assigned to a different sample, causing the spread of signals within multiplexed samples. We show that low levels of free index primers persist after the most common library purification procedure recommended by Illumina, and that the amount of signal spreading among samples is proportional to the level of free index primer present in the library pool. This artifact causes homogenization and misclassification of cells in single cell RNA-seq experiments. Therefore, all data generated in this way must now be carefully re-examined to ensure that \\\"spreading-of-signals\\\" has not compromised data analysis and conclusions. Re-sequencing samples using an older technology that uses conventional bridge amplification for cluster generation, or improved library cleanup strategies to remove free index primers, can minimize or eliminate this signal spreading artifact.",

Recent efforts have focused on understanding the structure and dynamics of these inhibitors, and the molecular mechanism behind its bioactive properties. BBI derived from Horsegram seeds is an interesting member of the class that exists as a number of isoforms that differ in length at the C- and N-terminal disordered regions. Interestingly, the length (or conversely, truncation) of the terminal regions affect whether the protein exists as a dimer or monomer. Here, we have investigated the mechanism of dimerization in Horsegram BBI. A recent study has proposed that the dimerization occur via a C-terminal hook that forms a salt bridge with the opposite monomer and is pivotal to the dimerization process. We have employed long computational simulation methods to predict the stability of the proposed C-terminal hook; we show that the terminal regions are highly disordered and the salt bridges are significantly solvent exposed. Further, using Hamiltonian replica exchange method, we have sought to obtain the conformational ensemble of the disordered terminal regions and have identified a conformational state that provides an interaction hot-spot that aids in the dimerization of HGI. Our analysis predicts an alternate model of dimerization that largely agrees with previous experimental studies and yet again, highlights the importance of intrinsically disordered region in tailoring the protein function.",

We show that coupling of intracellular signalling pathway networks makes cell phenotypic responses reliable for noisy signals.
