    "abstract": "Phage therapy has been viewed as a potential treatment for bacterial infections for over a century. Yet, the year 2016 marks the first phase I/II human trial of a phage therapeutic - to treat burn wound patients in Europe. The slow progress in realizing clinical therapeutics is matched by a similar dearth in principled understanding of phage therapy. Theoretical models and in vitro experiments find that combining phage and bacteria often leads to coexistence of both phage and bacteria or phage elimination altogether. Both outcomes stand in contrast to the stated goals of phage therapy. A potential resolution to the gap between models, experiments, and therapeutic use of phage is the hypothesis that the combined effect of phage and host immune system can synergistically eliminate bacterial pathogens. Here, we propose a phage therapy model that considers the nonlinear dynamics arising from interactions between bacteria, phage and the host innate immune system. The model builds upon earlier efforts by incorporating a maximum capacity of the immune response and density-dependent immune evasion by bacteria. We analytically identify a synergistic regime in this model in which phage and the innate immune response jointly contribute to the elimination of the target bacteria. Crucially, we find that in this synergistic regime, neither phage alone nor the innate immune system alone can eliminate the bacteria. We confirm these findings using numerical simulations in biologically plausible scenarios. We utilize our numerical simulations to explore the synergistic effect and its significance for guiding the use of phage therapy in clinically relevant applications.",

    "abstract": "AimMany important patterns and processes vary across the phylogeny and depend on phylogenetic scale. Yet, phylogenetic scale has never been formally conceptualized and its potential remains largely unexplored. Here, we formalize the concept of phylogenetic scale, review how phylogenetic scale has been considered across multiple fields, and provide practical guidelines for the use of phylogenetic scale to address a range of biological questions.\\n\\nMethodsWe summarize how phylogenetic scale has been treated in macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography, and macroecology, illustrating how it can inform, and possibly resolve, some of the longstanding controversies in these fields. To promote the concept empirically, we define phylogenetic grain and extent, scale-dependence, scaling, and the domains of phylogenetic scale. We illustrate how existing phylogenetic data and statistical tools can be employed to investigate the effects of scale on a variety of well-known patterns and processes, including diversification rates, community structure, niche conservatism, or species-abundance distributions.\\n\\nMain conclusionsExplicit consideration of phylogenetic scale can provide new and more complete insight into many longstanding questions across multiple fields (macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography, macroevolution). Building on the existing resources and isolated efforts across fields, future research centered on phylogenetic scale might enrich our understanding of the processes that together, but over different scales, shape the diversity of life.",

    "abstract": "Matrix projection models are a central tool in many areas of population biology. In most applications, one starts from the projection matrix to quantify the asymptotic growth rate of the population (the dominant eigenvalue), the stable stage distribution, and the reproductive values (the dominant right and left eigenvectors, respectively). Any primitive projection matrix also has an associated ergodic Markov chain that contains information about the genealogy of the population. In this paper, we show that these facts can be used to specify any matrix population model as a triple consisting of the ergodic Markov matrix, the dominant eigenvalue and one of the corresponding eigenvectors. This decomposition of the projection matrix separates properties associated with lineages from those associated with individuals. It also clarifies the relationships between many quantities commonly used to describe such models, including the relationship between eigenvalue sensitivities and elasticities. We illustrate the utility of such a decomposition by introducing a new method for aggregating classes in a matrix population model to produce a simpler model with a smaller number of classes. Unlike the standard method, our method has the advantage of preserving reproductive values and elasticities. It also has conceptually satisfying properties such as commuting with changes of units.",

    "abstract": "The formation of mammalian chromatin domains was investigated by analyzing the domain/isochore connection. This showed that LADs correspond to GC-poor isochores and are compositionally flat, flexible chromatin structures because of the local nucleosome depletions associated with the presence of oligo-As. In contrast, TADs correspond to GC-rich isochores that consist of single or (much more frequently) multiple, GC peaks that shape the single or multiple, loops of TADs. Indeed, the increasing nucleosome depletions linked to the GC gradients of isochore peaks lead to an increasing chromatin flexibility (accompanied by an increasing accessibility and decreasing supercoiling). In conclusion, isochores not only encode but also mold chromatin architecture; while architectural proteins play a role in closing and insulating TAD loops. An extension of this model concerns the encoding of open and closed chromosome compartments by alternating GC-rich and GC-poor isochores, the interactions among compartments defining the 3-D chromosome folding.",

Urine, which is not regulated by homeostatic mechanisms, accumulates changes and therefore is a better source for biomarker discovery. In this study, C6 cells were injected into Wistar rats brain as astrocytoma model. Urine samples were collected at day 2, day 6, day 10 and day 13 after injection, and the urinary proteomes were analyzed. On the 10th day, lesions appeared in magnetic resonance imaging. On the 13th day, clinical symptoms started. But differential urinary proteins were changed with the development of the astrocytoma, and can provide clues even on the 2nd and 6th day. Twenty-seven differential proteins with human orthologs had been reported to associate with astrocytoma. Thirty-nine proteins were verified in four more rats as candidate biomarkers of astrocytoma using multiple-reaction monitoring. A panel of differential urinary proteins may provide early biomarkers for diagnose of astrocytoma.",

The mechanism underlying the formation of ParB nucleoprotein complexes is unclear. We show here that the central DNA binding domain is essential for anchoring at parS, and that this interaction is not required for DNA condensation. Structural analysis of the C-terminal domain reveals a dimer with a lysine-rich surface that binds DNA non-specifically and is essential for DNA condensation in vitro. Mutation of either the dimerisation or the DNA binding interface eliminates ParB foci formation in vivo. Moreover, the free C-terminal domain can rapidly decondense ParB networks independently of its ability to bind DNA. Our work reveals a dual role for the C-terminal domain of ParB as both a DNA binding and bridging interface, and highlights the dynamic nature of ParB networks.",

    "abstract": "Here, we identify the plant biflavanoid hinokiflavone as an inhibitor of splicing in vitro and modulater of alternative splicing in multiple human cell lines. Hinokiflavone inhibits splicing in vitro by blocking one or more early steps of spliceosome assembly, leading to accumulation of the A complex. Multiple human cell lines treated with hinokiflavone show changes in the alternative splicing of different pre-mRNA substrates, but little or no change in transcription. They also show altered subnuclear organization, specifically of splicing factors required for A complex formation, which relocalized together with SUMO1 and SUMO2 into enlarged nuclear speckles. While most cell lines treated with hinokiflavone showed cell cycle arrest and eventual cell death, dependent on time and concentration, the promyelocytic NB4 cell line, which expresses the SUMO target PML-RARalpha fusion protein, was exquisitely sensitive to apoptosis following hinokiflavone treatment. Hinokiflavone treatment increased protein SUMOylation levels, both in in vitro splicing reactions and in cells, with little or no effect on levels of ubiquitinylated proteins. Hinokiflavone also inhibited the catalytic activity of purified E. coli expressed SUMO protease, SENP1 in vitro, indicating the increase in SUMOylated proteins results primarily from inhibition of de-SUMOylation. Using a quantitative proteomics assay we identified many SUMO2 sites whose levels increased following hinokiflavone treatment, with the major targets including 6 proteins that are associated with U2 snRNP and required for A complex formation. These data identify hinokiflavone as a SUMO protease inhibitor and indicate SUMOylation of splicing factors may be important for modulating splice site selection.",

    "abstract": "Zippering of SNARE complexes spanning docked membranes is essential for most intracellular fusion events. Here we explore how SNARE regulators operate on discrete zippering states. The formation of a metastable trans-complex, catalyzed by HOPS and its SM subunit Vps33, is followed by subsequent zippering transitions that increase the probability of fusion. Operating independently of Sec18 catalysis, Sec17 either inhibits or stimulates SNARE-mediated fusion. If HOPS or Vps33 are absent, Sec17 inhibits fusion at an early stage. Thus, HOPS and Vps33 accelerate SNARE zippering, particularly in the presence of otherwise inhibitory Sec17. Once SNAREs are partially-zipped, Sec17 promotes fusion in either the presence or absence of HOPS -- but with faster kinetics when HOPS is absent. Our data further indicate that Sec17 promotes fusion both through its direct penetration of the membrane and by enhancing C-terminal SNARE zippering. In a working model, the interplay among Sec17, Sec18, SMs, and SNARE zippering can explain why SM proteins are indispensable for SNARE-mediated fusion in vivo.\\n\\nImpact statementSec17 is shown to have divergent effects on pre-fusion SNARE complex activity, depending on the state of SNARE zippering. HOPS, an SM-tether complex, controls the outcome of Sec17-SNARE engagement. The results suggest a coherent working model for SM activity in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is the one of the most common and malignant cancer in the world. Despite many effort have been made in recent years, the survival rate of PC still remains unsatisfied. Therefore, investigating the mechanisms underlying the progression of PC might facilitate the development of novel treatments that improve patient prognosis. LncRNA Taurine Up-regulated Gene 1 (TUG1) was initially identified as a transcript up - regulated by taurine, siRNA - based depletion of TUG1 suppresses mouse retinal development, and the abnormal expression of TUG1 has been reported in many cancers. However, the biological role and molecular mechanism of TUG1 in pancreatic carcinoma (PC) still needs to be further investigated. In the current study, the expression of TUG1 in the PC cell lines and tissues was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches were applied to investigate the function of TUG1 in PC cell. Online database analysis tools showed that miR-382 could interact with TUG1 and we found an inverse correlation between TUG1 and miR-382 in PC specimens. Moreover, dual luciferase reporter assay, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) and applied biotin-avidin pulldown system further provide evidence that TUG1 directly targeted miR-382 by binding with microRNA binding site harboring in the TUG1 sequence. Furthermore, gene expression array analysis using clinical samples and RT-qPCR proposed that EZH2 was a target of miR-382 in PC. Collectively, these findings revealed that TUG1 functions as an oncogenic lncRNA that promotes tumor progression at least partially through function as an endogenous  sponge by competing for miR-382 binding to regulate the miRNA target EZH2.",

Kinase MIB-binding profiles at baseline without perturbation proteomically distinguished the four breast cancer subtypes. Kinases lacking defined functions in breast cancer were highly represented in the MIB-binding taxonomies. We show that these understudied kinases, whose disease associations and pharmacology are generally unexplored, are integrated in kinase signaling subnetworks with kinases that have been previously well characterized in breast cancer. Computationally it was possible to define subtypes using profiles of less than 50 of the more than 300 kinases bound to MIBs that included understudied as well as metabolic and lipid kinases. Furthermore, analysis of MIB-binding profiles established potential functional annotations for these understudied kinases. Thus, comprehensive MIBs-based capture of kinases provides a unique proteomics-based method for integration of poorly characterized kinases of the understudied kinome into functional subnetworks in breast cancer cells and tumors that is not possible using genomic strategies. The MIB-binding profiles readily defined subtype-selective differential adaptive kinome reprogramming in response to targeted kinase inhibition, demonstrating how MIB profiles can be used in determining dynamic kinome changes that result in subtype selective phenotypic state changes.",

In zebrafish and other teleosts there are 2 paralogs we previously named sgIIa and sgIIb.

Both sgIIb-/- and sgIIa-/- /sgIIb-/- mutant embryos were defective in hindbrain central artery development, while artery development in sgIIa-/- mutant embryos was not affected. Hindbrain arterial and venous network identities were not affected in sgIIb-/- mutant embryos, and the mRNA levels of Notch and VEGF pathway-related genes were not altered. However, the activation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways were inhibited in sgIIb-/- mutant embryos. Injection of a synthetic SNb mRNA or delivery of the protein kinase activator N-arachidonoyl-L-serine could partially rescue the central artery developmental defects in the sgIIb mutants.

    "abstract": "Next-generation deep sequencing of gene panels is being adopted as a diagnostic test to identify actionable mutations in cancer patient samples. However, clinical samples, such as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens, frequently provide low quantities of degraded, poor quality DNA. To overcome these issues, many sequencing assays rely on extensive PCR amplification leading to an accumulation of bias and artifacts. Thus, there is a need for a targeted sequencing assay that performs well with DNA of low quality and quantity without relying on extensive PCR amplification. We evaluate the performance of a targeted sequencing assay based on Oligonucleotide Selective Sequencing, which permits the enrichment of genes and regions of interest and the identification of sequence variants from low amounts of damaged DNA. This assay utilizes a repair process adapted to clinical FFPE samples, followed by adaptor ligation to single stranded DNA and a primer-based capture technique. Our approach generates sequence libraries of high fidelity with reduced reliance on extensive PCR amplification - this facilitates the accurate assessment of copy number alterations in addition to delivering accurate SNV and indel detection. We apply this method to capture and sequence the exons of a panel of 130 cancer-related genes, from which we obtain high read coverage uniformity across the targeted regions at starting input DNA amounts as low as 10 ng per sample. We further demonstrate the performance of this assay using a series of reference DNA samples, and by identifying sequence variants in DNA from matched clinical samples originating from different tissue types.",

However, little is known as to whether biological sex and the type of traumatic event influence shared or distinct biological pathways in PTSD. We performed a combined analysis of five independent PTSD blood transcriptome studies covering seven types of trauma in 229 PTSD and 311 comparison individuals to synthesize the extant data. Analyses by trauma type revealed a clear pattern of PTSD gene expression signatures distinguishing interpersonal (IP)-related traumas from combat-related traumas. Co-expression network analyses integrated all data and identified distinct gene expression perturbations across sex and modes of trauma in PTSD, including one wound-healing module down-regulated in men exposed to combat traumas, one IL12-mediated signaling module up-regulated in men exposed to IP-related traumas, and two modules associated with lipid metabolism and MAPK-activity up-regulated in women exposed to IP-related traumas. Remarkably, a high degree of sharing of transcriptional dysregulation across sex and modes of trauma in PTSD was also observed converging on common signaling cascades, including cytokine, innate immune and type I interferon pathways. Collectively, these findings provide a broad view of immune dysregulation in PTSD and demonstrate inflammatory pathways of molecular convergence and specificity, which may inform mechanisms and diagnostic biomarkers for the disorder.",

Our application generates a tiered report that will aid the interpretation of individual cancer genomes in a clinical setting.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe software is implemented in Python/R, and is freely available through Docker technology. Documentation, example reports, and installation instructions are accessible via the project GitHub page: https://github.com/sigven/pcgr)\\n\\nContactsigven@ifi.uio.no",
