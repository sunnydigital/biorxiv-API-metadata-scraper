    "abstract": "How DNA is mapped to functional proteins is a basic question of living matter. We introduce and study a physical model of protein evolution which suggests a mechanical basis for this map. Many proteins rely on large-scale motion to function. We therefore treat protein as learning amorphous matter that evolves towards such a mechanical function: Genes are binary sequences that encode the connectivity of the amino acid network that makes a protein. The gene is evolved until the network forms a shear band across the protein, which allows for long-range, soft modes required for protein function. The evolution reduces the high-dimensional sequence space to a low-dimensional space of mechanical modes, in accord with the observed dimensional reduction between genotype and phenotype of proteins. Spectral analysis of the space of 106 solutions shows a strong correspondence between localization around the shear band of both mechanical modes and the sequence structure. Specifically, our model shows how mutations are correlated among amino acids whose interactions determine the functional mode.\\n\\nPACS numbers: 87.14.E-, 87.15.-v, 87.10.-e",

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by homozygous mutations in human SMN1. Expression of a duplicate gene (SMN2) primarily results in skipping of exon 7 and production of an unstable protein isoform, SMN{Delta}7. Although SMN2 exon skipping is the principal contributor to SMA severity, mechanisms governing stability of SMN isoforms are poorly understood. We used a Drosophila model system and label-free proteomics to identify the SCFSlmb ubiquitin E3 ligase complex as a novel SMN binding partner. SCFSlmb interacts with a phospho-degron embedded within the human and fruitfly SMN YG-box oligomerization domains. Substitution of a conserved serine (S270A) interferes with SCFSlmb binding and stabilizes SMN{Delta}7. SMA-causing missense mutations that block multimerization of full-length SMN are also stabilized in the degron mutant background. Overexpression of SMN{Delta}7S270A, but not wild-type SMN{Delta}7, provides a protective effect in SMA model mice and human motor neuron cell culture systems. Our findings support a model wherein the degron is exposed when SMN is monomeric, and sequestered when SMN forms higher-order multimers.",

    "abstract": "Factor V Leiden (F5L) is a common genetic risk factor for venous thromboembolism in humans. We conducted a sensitized ENU mutagenesis screen for dominant thrombosuppressor genes based on perinatal lethal thrombosis in mice homozygous for F5L (F5L/L) and haploinsufficient for tissue factor pathway inhibitor (Tfpi+/-). F8 deficiency enhanced survival of F5L/L Tfpi+/- mice, demonstrating that F5L/L Tfpi+/- lethality is genetically suppressible. ENU-mutagenized F5L/L males and F5L/+ Tfpi+/- females were crossed to generate 6,729 progeny, with 98 F5L/L Tfpi+/- offspring surviving until weaning. Sixteen lines exhibited transmission of a putative thrombosuppressor to subsequent generations, with these lines referred to as MF5L (Modifier of Factor 5 Leiden) 1-16. Linkage analysis in MF5L6 identified a chromosome 3 locus containing the tissue factor gene (F3). Though no ENU-induced F3 mutation was identified, haploinsufficiency for F3 (F3+/-) suppressed F5L/L Tfpi+/- lethality. Whole exome sequencing in MF5L12 identified an Actr2 gene point mutation (p.R258G) as the sole candidate. Inheritance of this variant is associated with suppression of F5L/L Tfpi+/- lethality (p=1.7x10-6), suggesting that Actr2p.R258G is thrombosuppressive. CRISPR/Cas9 experiments to generate an independent Actr2 knockin/knockout demonstrated that Actr2 haploinsufficiency is lethal, supporting a hypomorphic or gain of function mechanism of action for Actr2p.R258G. Our findings identify F8 and the Tfpi/F3 axis as key regulators in determining thrombosis balance in the setting of F5L and also suggest a novel role for Actr2 in this process.\\n\\nSignificance StatementVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disease characterized by the formation of inappropriate blood clots. Inheritance of specific genetic variants, such as the Factor V Leiden polymorphism, increases VTE susceptibility. However, only ~10% of people inheriting Factor V Leiden develop VTE, suggesting the involvement of other genes that are currently unknown. By inducing random genetic mutations into mice with a genetic predisposition to VTE, we identified two genomic regions that reduce VTE susceptibility. The first includes the gene for blood coagulation Factor 3 and its role was confirmed by analyzing mice with an independent mutation in this gene. The second contains a mutation in the Actr2 gene. These findings identify critical genes for the regulation of blood clotting risk.",

    "abstract": "The quantitative relationship between the magnitude of variation in minor histocompatibility antigens (mHA) and graft versus host disease (GVHD) pathophysiology in stem cell transplant (SCT) donor-recipient pairs (DRP) is not established. In order to elucidate this relationship, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 27 HLA matched related (MRD), & 50 unrelated donors (URD), to identify nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). An average 2,463 SNPs were identified in MRD, and 4,287 in URD DRP (p<0.01); resulting peptide antigens that may be presented on HLA class I molecules in each DRP were derived in silico (NetMHCpan ver2.0) and the tissue expression of proteins these were derived from determined (GTex). MRD DRP had an average 3,670 HLA-binding-alloreactive peptides, putative mHA (pmHA) with an IC50 of <500 nM, and URD, had 5,386 (p<0.01). To simulate an alloreactive donor cytotoxic T cell response, the array of pmHA in each patient was considered as an operator matrix modifying a hypothetical cytotoxic T cell clonal vector matrix; each responding T cell clones proliferation was determined by the logistic equation of growth, accounting for HLA binding affinity and tissue expression of each alloreactive peptide. The resulting simulated organ-specific alloreactive T cell clonal growth revealed marked variability, with the T cell count differences spanning orders of magnitude between different DRP. Despite an estimated, uniform set of constants used in the model for all DRP, and a heterogeneously treated group of patients higher total and organ-specific T cell counts were associated with cumulative incidence of GVHD in recipients in Cox proportional hazard models. In conclusion, exome wide sequence differences and the variable alloreactive peptide binding to HLA in each DRP yields a large range of possible alloreactive donor T cell responses. Our findings also help understand the apparent randomness observed in the development of alloimmune responses.",

    "abstract": "Cell-based models provide a powerful computational tool for studying the mechanisms underlying the growth and dynamics of biological tissues in health and disease. An increasing amount of quantitative data with cellular resolution has paved the way for the quantitative parameterisation and validation of such models. However, the numerical implementation of cell-based models remains challenging, and little work has been done to understand to what extent implementation choices may influence model predictions. Here, we consider the numerical implementation of a popular class of cell-based models called vertex models, which are often used to study epithelial tissues. In two-dimensional vertex models, a tissue is approximated as a tessellation of polygons and the vertices of these polygons move due to mechanical forces originating from the cells. Such models have been used extensively to study the mechanical regulation of tissue topology in the literature. Here, we analyse how the model predictions may be affected by numerical parameters, such as the size of the time step, and non-physical model parameters, such as length thresholds for cell rearrangement. We find that vertex positions and summary statistics are sensitive to several of these implementation parameters. For example, the predicted tissue size decreases with decreasing cell cycle durations, and cell rearrangement may be suppressed by large time steps. These findings are counter-intuitive and illustrate that model predictions need to be thoroughly analysed and implementation details carefully considered when applying cell-based computational models in a quantitative setting.",

    "abstract": "Our overall goal is to develop machine learning approaches based on genomics and other relevant accessible information for use in predicting how a patient will respond to a given proposed drug or treatment. Given the complexity of this problem, we begin by developing, testing, and analyzing learning methods using data from simulated systems, which allows us access to a known ground truth. We examine the benefits of using prior system knowledge and investigate how learning accuracy depends on various system parameters as well as the amount of training data available. The simulations are based on Boolean networks - directed graphs with 0/1 node states and logical node update rules - which are the simplest computational systems that can mimic the dynamic behavior of cellular systems. Boolean networks can be generated and simulated at scale, have complex yet cyclical dynamics, and as such provide a useful framework for developing machine learning algorithms for modular and hierarchical networks such as biological systems in general and cancer in particular. We demonstrate that utilizing prior knowledge (in the form of network connectivity information), without detailed state equations, greatly increases the power of machine learning algorithms to predict network steady state node values (\\\"phenotypes\\\") and perturbation responses (\\\"drug effects\\\").",

    "abstract": "High density linkage maps are an important tool to gain insight into the genetic architecture of traits of evolutionary and economic interest, and provide a resource to characterise variation in recombination landscapes. Here, we used information from the cattle genome and the 50K Cervine Illumina BeadChip to inform and refine a high density linkage map in a wild population of red deer (Cervus elaphus). We constructed a predicted linkage map of 38,038 SNPs and a skeleton map of 10,835 SNPs across 34 linkage groups. We identified several chromosomal rearrangements in the deer lineage relative to sheep and cattle, including six chromosome fissions, one fusion and two large inversions. Otherwise, our findings showed strong concordance with map orders in the cattle genome. The sex-averaged linkage map length was 2739.7cM and the genome-wide autosomal recombination rate was 1.04cM per Mb. The female autosomal map length was 1.21 longer than that of males (2767.4cM vs 2280.8cM, respectively). Sex differences in map length were driven by high female recombination rates in peri-centromeric regions, a pattern that is unusual relative to other mammal species. This effect was more pronounced in fission chromosomes that would have had to produce new centromeres. We propose two hypotheses to explain this effect: (1) that this mechanism may have evolved to counteract centromeric drive associated with meiotic asymmetry in oocyte production; and/or (2) that sequence and structural characteristics suppressing recombination in close proximity to the centromere may not have yet evolved at neo-centromeres. Our study provides insight into how recombination landscapes vary and evolve in mammals, and will provide a valuable resource for studies of evolution, genetic improvement and population management in red deer and related species.\\n\\nArticle SummaryWe present a high density linkage map (>38,000 markers) in a wild population of Red deer (Cervus elaphus). Our investigation of the recombination landscape showed a marked difference in recombination rates between the sexes in proximity to the centromere, with females showing an unusually elevated rate relative to other mammal species. This effect is most pronounced in chromosomes that would have produced a new centromere in the deer lineage. We propose that the observed effects have evolved to counteract selfish genetic elements associated with asymmetrical female meiosis.",

    "abstract": "How the brain preserves information about multiple simultaneous items is poorly understood. We report that single neurons can represent multiple different stimuli by interleaving different signals across time. We record single units in an auditory region, the inferior colliculus, while monkeys localize 1 or 2 simultaneous sounds. During dual-sound trials, we find that some neurons fluctuate between firing rates observed for each single sound, either on a whole-trial or on a sub-trial timescale. These fluctuations are correlated in pairs of neurons, can be predicted by the state of local field potentials prior to sound onset, and, in one monkey, can predict which sound will be reported first. We find corroborating evidence of fluctuating activity patterns in a separate data set involving responses of inferotemporal cortex neurons to multiple visual stimuli. Alternation between activity patterns corresponding to each of multiple items may therefore be a general strategy to enhance the brain processing capacity, potentially linking such disparate phenomena as variable neural firing, neural oscillations, and limits in attentional/memory capacity.",

    "abstract": "The nitrogen (N) cycle represents one of the most well studied systems yet the taxonomic diversity of the organisms that contribute to it is mostly unknown, or linked to poorly characterized microbial groups. While progress has allowed functional groups to be refined, they still rely on a priori knowledge of enzymes involved, and the assumption of functional conservation, with little connection to the role the transformation plays for specific organisms. Here, we use soil microcosms to test the impact of N deposition on prokaryotic communities. By combining chemical, genomic and transcriptomic analysis we are able to identify and link changes in community structure to specific organisms catalyzing given chemical reactions. Urea deposition led to a decrease in prokaryotic richness, and a shift in community composition. This was driven by replacement of stable native populations, which utilize energy from N-linked redox reactions for physiological maintenance, with fast responding populations that use this energy for growth. This model can be used to predict response to N disturbances and allows us to identify putative life strategies of different functional, and taxonomic, groups thus providing insights into how they persist in ecosystems by niche differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The availability of electronic health record (EHR)-based phenotypes allows for genome-wide association analyses in thousands of traits, and has great potential to identify novel genetic variants associated with clinical phenotypes. We can interpret the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) result for a single genetic variant by observing its association across a landscape of phenotypes. Since PheWAS can test 1000s of binary phenotypes, and most of them have unbalanced (case:control = 1:10) or often extremely unbalanced (case:control = 1:600) case-control ratios, existing methods cannot provide an accurate and scalable way to test for associations. Here we propose a computationally fast score test-based method that estimates the distribution of the test statistic using the saddlepoint approximation. Our method is much faster than the state of the art Firths test ([~] 100 times). It can also adjust for covariates and control type I error rates even when the case-control ratio is extremely unbalanced. Through application to PheWAS data from the Michigan Genomics Initiative, we show that the proposed method can control type I error rates while replicating previously known association signals even for traits with a very small number of cases and a large number of controls.",

    "abstract": "Place cells of the rodent hippocampus fire action potentials when the animal traverses a particular spatial location in a given environment. Therefore, for any given trajectory one will observe a repeatable sequence of place cell activations as the animal explores. Interestingly, when the animal is quiescent or sleeping, one can observe similar sequences of activation, although at a highly compressed rate, known as \\\"replays\\\". It is hypothesized that this replay underlies the process of memory consolidation whereby memories are \\\"transferred\\\" from hippocampus to cortex. However, it remains unclear how the memory of a particular environment is actually encoded in the place cell activity and what the mechanism for replay is. Here we study how plasticity during spatial exploration shapes the patterns of synaptic connectivity in model networks of place cells. Specifically, we show how plasticity leads to the emergence of patterns of activity which represent the spatial environment learned. These states become spontaneously active when the animal is quiescent, reproducing the phenomenology of replays. Interestingly, replay emerges most rapidly when place cell activity is modulated by an ongoing oscillation. The optimal oscillation frequency can be calculated analytically, is directly related to the plasticity rule, and for experimentally determined values of the plasticity window in rodent slices gives values in the theta range. A major prediction of this model is that the pairwise correlation of place cells which encode for neighboring locations should increase during initial exploration, leading up to the critical transition. We find such an increase in a population of simultaneously recorded CA1 pyramidal cells from a rat exploring a novel track. Furthermore, in a rat in which hippocampal theta is reduced through inactivation of the medial septum we find no such increase. Our model is the first to show how theta-modulation can speed up learning by facilitating the emergence of environment-specific network-wide patterns of synaptic connectivity in hippocampal circuits.",

    "abstract": "Many terrestrial ectothermic species exhibit limited variation in upper thermal tolerance across latitude. However, these trends may not signify limited adaptive capacity to increase thermal tolerance in the face of climate change. Instead, thermal tolerance may be similar among populations because behavioral thermoregulation by mobile organisms or life stages may buffer natural selection for thermal tolerance. We compared thermal tolerance of adults and embryos among natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster from a broad range of thermal habitats around the globe to assess natural variation of thermal tolerance in mobile vs. immobile life stages. We found no variation among populations in adult thermal tolerance, but embryonic thermal tolerance was higher in tropical strains than in temperate strains. Average maximum temperature of the warmest month of the year predicted embryonic thermal tolerance in tropical but not temperate sites. We further report that embryos live closer to their upper thermal limits than adultso--i.e., thermal safety margins are smaller for embryos than adults. F1 hybrid embryos from crosses between temperate and tropical populations had thermal tolerance that matched that of tropical embryos, suggesting dominance of heat-tolerant alleles. Together our findings suggest that thermal selection has led to divergence in embryonic thermal tolerance but that selection for divergent thermal tolerance may be limited in adults. Further, our results suggest that thermal traits should be measured across life stages in order to better predict adaptive limits.\\n\\nImpact SummaryClimate change may threaten the extinction of many ectothermic species, unless populations can evolutionarily adapt to rising temperatures. Natural selection should favor individuals with higher heat tolerances in hotter environments. But recent studies have found that individuals from hot and cold places often have similar heat tolerances. This pattern may indicate that the evolution of heat tolerance is constrained. If this were true, then it would have dire consequences for species persistence under novel thermal conditions.\\n\\nAn alternative explanation for lack of variation in heat tolerance is that mobile organisms dont need higher heat tolerances to survive in hotter places. The majority of studies have focused on heat tolerance of the adult life stage. Yet, adults in many species are mobile organisms that can avoid extreme heat by seeking shelter in cooler microhabitats (e.g., shaded locations). In contrast, immobile life stages (e.g., insect eggs) cannot behaviorally avoid extreme heat. Thus, mobile and immobile life stages may face different thermal selection pressures that lead to disparate patterns of thermal adaptation across life stages.\\n\\nHere, we compared heat tolerances of fruit fly adults and eggs (Drosophila melanogaster) from populations in temperate North America and tropical locations around the globe. Consistent with previous studies, we found no differences among populations in adult heat tolerance. However, eggs from tropical flies were consistently more heat tolerant than eggs from North American flies. Further, eggs had lower heat tolerance than adults. Consequently, fly eggs in the hotter tropics may experience heat death more frequently than adult flies later in life. This may explain why patterns of divergence in heat tolerance were decoupled across life stages. These patterns indicate that thermal adaptation may be life-stage-specific and suggest that future work should characterize thermal traits across life stages to better understand the evolution of thermal limits.",

    "abstract": "Gut bacteria occupy the interface between the organism and the external environment, contributing to homeostasis and disease. Yet, the causal role of the gut microbiota during host aging is largely unexplored. Here, using the African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), a naturally short-lived vertebrate, we show that the gut microbiota plays a key role in modulating vertebrate life span. Recolonizing the gut of middle-age individuals with bacteria from young donors resulted in life span extension and delayed behavioral decline. This intervention prevented the decrease in microbial diversity associated with host aging and maintained a young-like gut bacterial community, characterized by overrepresentation of the key genera Exiguobacterium, Planococcus, Propionigenium and Psychrobacter. Our findings demonstrate that the natural microbial gut community of young individuals can causally induce long-lasting beneficial systemic effects that lead to life span extension in a vertebrate model.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein is the primary minus-end directed microtubule motor protein in cells. LIS1 is a highly conserved dynein regulatory factor that binds directly to the dynein motor domain, uncoupling the enzymatic and mechanical cycles of the motor, and stalling dynein on the microtubule track. Dynactin, another ubiquitous dynein regulatory factor, acts to release dynein from an autoinhibited state, leading to a dramatic increase in fast, processive dynein motility. How these opposing activities are integrated to control dynein motility is unknown. Here we used fluorescence single-molecule microscopy to study the interaction of LIS1 with the processive dynein-dynactin-BicD2N (DDB) complex. Surprisingly, in contrast to the prevailing model for LIS1 function established in the context of dynein alone, we find that binding of LIS1 to DDB does not strongly disrupt processive motility. Motile DDB complexes bind up to two LIS1 dimers, and mutational analysis suggests LIS1 binds directly to the dynein motor domains during DDB movement. Interestingly, LIS1 enhances DDB velocity in a concentration dependent manner, in contrast to observations of LIS1s effects on the motility of isolated dynein. Thus, LIS1 exerts concentration dependent effects on dynein motility, and can synergize with dynactin to enhance processive movement in the absence of load.",

    "abstract": "The first cellular differentiation event in mouse development leads to the formation of the blastocyst consisting of the inner cell mass (ICM) and an outer functional epithelium called trophectoderm (TE). The lineage specific transcription factor CDX2 is required for proper TE specification, where it promotes expression of TE genes, and represses expression of Pou5f1 (OCT4) by inhibiting OCT4 from promoting its own expression. However its downstream network in the developing early embryo is not fully characterized. Here, we performed high-throughput single embryo qPCR analysis in Cdx2 null embryos to identify components of the CDX2-regulated network in vivo. To identify genes likely to be regulated by CDX2 directly, we performed CDX2 ChIP-Seq on trophoblast stem (TS) cells, derived from the TE. In addition, we examined the dynamics of gene expression changes using an inducible CDX2 embryonic stem (ES) cell system, so that we could predict which CDX2-bound genes are activated or repressed by CDX2 binding. By integrating these data with observations of chromatin modifications, we were able to identify novel regulatory elements that are likely to repress gene expression in a lineage-specific manner. Interestingly, we found CDX2 binding sites within regulatory elements of key pluripotent genes such as Pou5f1 and Nanog, pointing to the existence of a novel mechanism by which CDX2 maintains repression of OCT4 in trophoblast. Our study proposes a general mechanism in regulating lineage segregation during mammalian development.",

    "abstract": "Filopodia are commonly observed cellular protrusions in vitro and in vivo. Defective filopodia formation is linked to several pathologies including cancer, wherein actively protruding filopodia, at the invasive front, and filopodia-mediated probing of the microenvironment accompanies cancer cell dissemination. Despite wide biological significance, delineating the function of these finger-like protrusions in more complex systems remains technically challenging, particularly hindered by lack of compatible methods to quantify filopodia properties. Here, we present FiloQuant, a freely available ImageJ plugin, to detect filopodia and filopodia-like protrusions in both fixed and live-cell microscopy data. We demonstrate that FiloQuant can extract quantifiable information including protrusion dynamics, density and length from multiple cell types and in a range of microenvironments, such as during collective or single cancer cell migration in 2D and 3D, in fixed neuronal cultures, in activated natural killer cells and in sprouting endothelial cells in vivo. In cellular models of breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) we reveal a link between filopodia formation at the cell-matrix interface, during collective invasion and in 3D tumour spheroids, with the previously reported local invasive potential of these breast cancer models in vivo. Finally, using intravital microscopy, we observed that tumour spheroids display prominent filopodia in vivo, supporting a potential role for these protrusions during tumorigenesis.",

In particular, the ratio [Formula] is expected to be a good proxy of{omega} , the probability of fixation of non-synonymous mutations relative to that of neutral mutations. Standard methods for estimating dN, dS or{omega} rely on the assumption that the base composition of sequences is at the equilibrium of the evolutionary process. In many clades, this assumption of stationarity is in fact incorrect, and we show here through simulations and through analyses of empirical data that non-stationarity biases the estimate of dN, dS and{omega} . We show that the bias in the estimate of{omega} can be fixed by explicitly considering non-stationarity in the modeling of codon evolution, in a maximum likelihood framework. Moreover, we propose an exact method of estimate of dN and dS on branches, based on stochastic mapping, that can take into account non-stationarity. This method can be directly applied to any kind of model of evolution of codons, as long as neutrality is clearly parameterized.",

    "abstract": "Measurements of gene expression levels for multiple genes in single cells provide a powerful approach to study heterogeneity of cell populations and cellular plasticity. While the expression levels of multiple genes in each cell are available in such data, the potential connections among the cells (e.g. the lineage relationship) are not directly evident from the measurement. Classifying cellular states and identifying transitions among those states are challenging due to many factors, including the small number of cells versus the large number of genes collected in the data. In this paper we adapt a classical self-organizing-map approach to single-cell gene expression data, such as those based on qPCR and RNA-seq. In this method (SOMSC), a cellular state map (CSM) is derived and employed to identify cellular states inherited in a population of measured single cells. Cells located in the same basin of the CSM are considered as in one cellular state while barriers between the basins provide information on transitions among the cellular states. Consequently, paths of cellular state transitions (e.g. differentiation) and a temporal ordering of the measured single cells are obtained. Applied to a set of synthetic data, two single-cell qPCR data sets and two single-cell RNA-seq data sets for a simulated model of cell differentiation, and systems on the early embryo development, haematopoietic cell lineages, human preimplanation embryo development, and human skeletal muscle myoblasts differentiation, the SOMSC shows good capabilities in identifying cellular states and their transitions in the high-dimensional single-cell data. This approach will have broad applications in studying cell lineages and cellular fate specification.",

    "abstract": "Transcription is regulated through binding factors to gene promoters to activate or repress expression, however, the mechanisms by which factors find targets remain unclear. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, we determined in vivo stoichiometry and spatiotemporal dynamics of a GFP tagged repressor, Mig1, from a paradigm signaling pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find the repressor operates in clusters, which upon extracellular signal detection, translocate from the cytoplasm, bind to nuclear targets and turnover. Simulations of Mig1 configuration within a 3D yeast genome model combined with a promoter-specific, fluorescent translation reporter confirmed clusters are the functional unit of gene regulation. In vitro and structural analysis on reconstituted Mig1 suggests that clusters are stabilized by depletion forces between intrinsically disordered sequences. We observed similar clusters of a co-regulatory activator from a different pathway, supporting a generalized cluster model for transcription factors that reduces promoter search times through intersegment transfer while stabilizing gene expression.",

Whether cells are cultured as conventional monolayer or advanced organoid cultures influences drug effects and thereby drug selection and clinical success. To precisely compare drug profiles in differently cultured primary cells, we developed DeathPro, an automated microscopy-based assay to resolve drug-induced cell death and proliferation inhibition. Using DeathPro, we screened cells from ovarian cancer patients in monolayer or organoid culture with clinically relevant drugs. Drug-induced growth arrest and efficacy of cytostatic drugs differed between the two culture systems. Interestingly, drug effects in organoids were more diverse and had lower therapeutic potential. Genomic analysis revealed novel links between drug sensitivity and DNA repair deficiency in organoids that were undetectable in monolayers. Thus, our results highlight the dependency of cytostatic drugs and pharmacogenomic associations on culture systems, and guide culture selection for drug tests.",

    "abstract": "Malignant spreading involves the migration of cancer cells amongst other native cell types. For example, in vivo melanoma invasion involves individual melanoma cells migrating through native skin, which is composed of several distinct subpopulations of cells. Here, we aim to quantify how interactions between melanoma and fibroblast cells affect the collective spreading of a heterogeneous population of these cells in vitro. We perform a suite of circular barrier assays that includes: (i) monoculture assays with fibroblast cells; (ii) monoculture assays with SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells; and (iii) a series of co-culture assays initiated with three different ratios of SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells and fibroblast cells. Using immunostaining, detailed cell density histograms are constructed to illustrate how the two subpopulations of cells are spatially arranged within the spreading heterogeneous population. Calibrating the solution of a continuum partial differential equation to the experimental results from the monoculture assays allows us to estimate the cell diffusivity and the cell proliferation rate for the melanoma and the fibroblast cells, separately. Using the parameter estimates from the monoculture assays, we then make a prediction of the spatial spreading in the co-culture assays. Results show that the parameter estimates obtained from the monoculture assays lead to a reasonably accurate prediction of the spatial arrangement of the two subpopulations in the co-culture assays. Overall, the spatial pattern of spreading of the melanoma cells and the fibroblast cells is very similar in monoculture and co-culture conditions. Therefore, we find no clear evidence of any interactions other than cell-to-cell contact and crowding effects.",

Inhibition of formins, but not Arp2/3, prevented the formation of migrating cell fronts in both cell types. MDCK cells depleted of the formin protein Dia1 formed polarized acini and could execute planar cell motility, either within the acinus or in 2D scattering assays. However, Dia1 was required to form protrusions into the collagen matrix. Live imaging of actin, myosin, and collagen in control acini revealed adhesions that deformed individual collagen fibrils, while Dia1-depleted acini exhibited unstable adhesions with minimal collagen deformation. This work identifies Dia1-mediated adhesions as essential regulators of tissue shape changes, through their role in focal adhesion maturation.",

Critically, culturing EPSCs in a trophoblast stem cell (TSC) culture condition permits direct establishment of TSC lines without genetic modification. Molecular analyses including single cell RNA-seq reveal that EPSCs share cardinal pluripotency features with ESCs but have an enriched blastomere transcriptomic signature and a dynamic DNA methylome.

    "abstract": "In contrast to the important role of hormones in the development of sexual dimorphic traits in vertebrates [1], the differentiation of these traits in insects is attributed exclusively to variation in cell-autonomous mechanisms controlled by members of the sex determination pathway [2], such as doublesex (dsx). Although hormones can shape the development of sexual traits in insects, and interact with dsx to create dimorphisms, variation in hormone levels are not known to cause dimorphism in these traits [3]. Here we show that butterflies use sex-specific differences in 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) hormone titers to create sexually dimorphic wing ornaments, without the local involvement of dsx. Females of the dry season (DS) form of Bicyclus anynana display a larger sexual ornament on their wings than males, whereas in the wet season (WS) form both sexes have similarly sized ornaments [4]. High levels of circulating 20E during larval development in DS females and WS forms cause proliferation of the cells fated to give rise to this wing ornament, and results in sexual dimorphism in the DS forms. This study advances our understanding of how the environment regulates sex-specific patterns of plasticity of sexual ornaments and conclusively shows that sex-specific variation in hormone titers can play a role in the development of secondary sexual traits in insects, just like they do in vertebrates.\\n\\nHighlights O_LISex-specific levels of 20E, an insect molting hormone, regulate secondary sexual trait dimorphism and plasticity in butterflies.\\nC_LIO_LI20E levels above a threshold promote local patterns of cell division in one sex, but not in the other sex, to create sexually dimorphic eyespots.\\nC_LI\\n\\neTOCSexual selection drives the evolution of ornaments for individuals to display to the opposite sex. Yet, the mechanisms by which sexual selection operates are still not well understood. Here Bhardwaj et al. provide conclusive evidence, for the first time, that male and female insects use variation in levels of hormones to create dimorphism in their sexual ornaments. Authors show that 20-hydroxyecdyone, the insect molting hormone, also functions as a sex hormone in a butterfly. They also show how the environment shapes the development of sexual ornaments at a proximate level.",

    "abstract": "Neurotrophism, structural plasticity, learning and long-term memory in mammals critically depend on neurotrophins binding Trk receptors to activate tyrosine kinase (TyrK) signalling, but Drosophila lacks full-length Trks, raising the question of how these processes occur in the fly. Paradoxically, truncated Trk isoforms lacking the TyrK predominate in the adult human brain, but whether they have neuronal functions independently of full-length Trks is unknown. Drosophila has TyrK-less Trk-family receptors, encoded by the kekkon (kek) genes, suggesting that evolutionarily conserved functions for this receptor class may exist. Here, we asked whether Keks function together with Drosophila neurotrophins (DNTs) at the larval glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Starting with an unbiased approach, we tested the evelen LRR and Ig-containing (LIG) proteins encoded in the Drosophila genome for expression in the central nervous system (CNS) and potential interaction with DNTs. Kek-6 was expressed in the CNS, could interact genetically with DNTs and could bind DNT2 both in signaling essays and in co-immunoprecipitations. There is promiscuity in ligand binding, as Kek-6 could also bind DNT1, and Kek-5 could also bind DNT2. In vivo, Kek-6 is found presynaptically in motoneurons, and binds DNT2 produced by the muscle, which functions as a retrograde factor at the NMJ. Kek-6 and DNT2 regulate NMJ growth, bouton formation and active zone homeostasis. Kek-6 does not antagonise the alternative DNT2 receptor Toll-6, but rather the two receptors contribute in distinct manners to NMJ structural plasticity. Using pull-down assays, we identified and validated CaMKII and VAP33A as intracellular partners of Kek-6, and show that together they regulate NMJ growth and active zone formation. These functions of Kek-6 could be evolutionarily conserved, raising the intriguing possibility that a novel mechanism of structural synaptic plasticity involving truncated Trk-family receptors independently of TyrK signaling may also operate in the human brain.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYA long-standing paradox had been to explain how brain structural plasticity, learning and long-term memory might occur in Drosophila in the absence of canonical Trk receptors for neurotrophin (NT) ligands. NTs link structure and function in the brain enabling adjustments in cell number, dendritic, axonal and synaptic patterns, in response to neuronal activity. These events are essential for brain development, learning and long-term memory, and are thought to depend on the tyrosine-kinase function of the NT Trk receptors. However, paradoxically, the most abundant Trk isoforms in the adult human brain lack the tyrosine kinase, and their neuronal function is unknown. Remarkably, Drosophila has kinase-less receptors of the Trk family encoded by the kekkon (kek) genes, suggesting that deep evolutionary functional conservation for this receptor class could be unveiled. Here, we show that Kek-6 is a receptor for Drosophila neurotrophin 2 (DNT2) that regulates structural synaptic plasticity via CaMKII and VAP33A, well-known factors regulating synaptic structure and plasticity, and vesicle release. Our findings suggest that in mammals truncated Trk-family receptors could also have synaptic functions in neurons independently of Tyrosine kinase signalling. This might reveal a novel mechanism of brain plasticity, with important implications for understanding also the human brain, in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Sessile invertebrate prey that detect waterborne predator cues often respond by strengthening their structural defenses. Experimental evidence of the functional significance of such modifications using field-raised organisms is lacking. This study addresses that gap using intertidal mussels and predatory dogwhelks from Atlantic Canada. During the spring and summer of 2016, we ran a field experiment that manipulated dogwhelk presence to test their nonconsumptive effects on mussel traits. Dogwhelk cues elicited thickening at the lip, centre, and base of mussel shells, although simultaneously limiting shell growth in length. As shell mass was unaffected by dogwhelk presence, a trade-off between shell thickening and elongation was revealed. Thickening was strongest at the thinnest parts of the shell. Using the field-raised organisms, a lab experiment found that dogwhelks took, on average, 55 % longer to drill and consume mussels previously exposed to dogwhelk cues than mussels grown without such a cue exposure. Dogwhelks drilled at the thinnest parts of the shell but, nonetheless, the consumed cue-exposed mussels had thicker shells at the borehole than the consumed mussels not exposed to cues, which likely explains the observed difference in handling time. As handling time normally decreases predation success, this study indicates that the plastic structural modifications in mussels triggered by dogwhelk cues in the field hinder predation by these drilling predators.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are integral to ecological and evolutionary processes, but we have a poor understanding of what drives variation in key traits across diverse viruses. For lytic viruses, burst size, latent period, and genome size are primary characteristics controlling host-virus dynamics. Burst size and latent period are analogous to organismal traits of fecundity and generation time, and genome size affects the size of the virion as well as viral control of host metabolism. Here we synthesize data on these traits for 75 strains of phytoplankton viruses, which play an important role in global biogeochemistry. We find that primary traits of the host (genome size, growth rate) are major ecological drivers, explaining 40-50% of variation in burst size and latent period. We analyze an eco-evolutionary model to explore mechanisms underlying these patterns. We find that burst size may be set by the host genomic resources available for viral construction, while latent period evolves to permit this maximal burst size, modulated by host metabolic rate. These results suggest that general mechanisms may underlie the evolution of diverse viruses, which will facilitate our understanding of viral community processes, ecosystem impacts, and coevolutionary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The invasive species Drosophila suzukii has evolved morphological and behavioral adaptations to lay eggs under the skin of fresh fruits. This results in severe damage of a wide range of small and stone fruits, thus making this species a serious agricultural and economical threat.\\n\\nDrosophila suzukii females typically lay few eggs per fruit, preferring not infested fruits. Hence larvae are exposed to a reduced amount of nitrogenous waste products. On the contrary, the innocuous Drosophila melanogaster lays eggs on fermented fruits already infested by conspecifics, with larvae developing in a crowded environment characterized by accumulation of nitrogenous waste such as ammonia and urea. Given these differences in oviposition and larval ecological niche, we expected different behavioral and physiological mechanisms in the two species to cope with nitrogenous waste. We investigated the impact of different concentrations of ammonia and urea on fecundity and larval development in both species. Females and larvae of D. suzukii showed a greater sensitivity to high concentration of both compounds, with a dramatic decrease in fecundity and egg viability.\\n\\nTo better understand the pathways underlying these differences, we evaluated the effect on ornithine aminotransferase and glutathione-S-transferase, two enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism and stress response that are expressed during larval development. Under ammonia and urea exposure, the expression of these enzymes was significantly reduced in D. suzukii.\\n\\nThe fact that D. suzukiis shift from rotten to fresh fruit as oviposition and larval substrate resulted in less efficient detoxifying and excretory mechanisms represents a potential approach for its control. Fecundity and larval development are in fact dramatically impaired by nitrogen waste products. These findings can help in planning effective strategies of sustainable pest management that targets both females and larvae.",

    "abstract": "Progress in the development and use of methods for species delimitation employing phenotypic data lags behind conceptual and practical advances in molecular genetic approaches. The basic evolutionary model underlying the use of phenotypic data to delimit species assumes random mating and quantitative polygenic traits, so that phenotypic distributions within a species should be approximately normal for individuals of the same sex and age. Accordingly, two or more distinct normal distributions of phenotypic traits suggest the existence of multiple species. In light of this model, we show that analytical approaches employed in taxonomic studies using phenotypic data are often compromised by three issues: (1) reliance on graphical analyses of phenotypic space that do not consider the frequency of phenotypes; (2)exclusion of characters potentially important for species delimitation following reduction of data dimensionality; and (3) use of measures of central tendencies to evaluate phenotypic distinctiveness. We outline approaches to overcome these issues based on statistical developments related to normal mixture models and illustrate them empirically with a reanalysis of morphological data recently used to claim that there are no morphologically distinct species of Darwins ground-finches (Geospiza). We found negligible support for this claim relative to taxonomic hypotheses recognizing multiple species. Although species limits among ground-finches merit further assessments using additional sources of information, our results bear implications for other areas of inquiry including speciation research: because ground-finches have likely speciated and are not trapped in a process of \\\"Sisyphean\\\" evolution as recently argued, they remain useful models to understand the evolutionary forces involved in speciation. Our work underscores the importance of statistical approaches grounded on appropriate evolutionary models for species delimitation. Approaches allowing one to fit normal mixture models without a priori information about species limits offer new perspectives in the kind of inferences available to systematists, with significant repercusions on ideas about the structure of biological biodiversity.

    "abstract": "Cell- and sex-specific differences in DNA methylation are major sources of epigenetic variation in whole blood. Failure to account for these confounders may lead to substantial bias in the identification of differentially methylated CpGs and predicted levels of differential methylation. Previous studies have provided evidence of cell-specific methylation, but all of these have been restricted to the detection of differential methylation in a single cell type. We developed a Bayesian model selection algorithm for the identification of cell-specific methylation profiles that incorporates knowledge of shared cell lineage, to accommodate differential methylation in one or more cell types. Under the proposed methodology, sex-specific differences in methylation by cell type are also assessed. Using publicly available cell-sorted methylation data, we show that 51.3% of female CpG markers and 61.4% of male CpG markers identified were associated with differential methylation in more than one cell type. The impact of cell lineage on differential methylation was also highlighted. An evaluation of sex-specific differences revealed marked differences in CD56+NK methylation, within both single and multi-cell dependent methylation patterns. Our findings demonstrate the need to account for cell lineage in studies of differential methylation and associated sex effects.",

    "abstract": "Genomic variations in a reference collection are naturally represented as genome variation graphs. Such graphs encode common subsequences as vertices and the variations are captured using additional vertices and directed edges. The resulting graphs are directed graphs possibly with cycles. Existing algorithms for aligning sequences on such graphs make use of partial order alignment (POA) techniques that work on directed acyclic graphs (DAG). For this, acyclic extensions of the input graphs are first constructed through expensive loop unrolling steps (DAGification). Also, such graph extensions could have considerable blow up in their size and in the worst case the blow up factor is proportional to the input sequence length. We provide a novel alignment algorithm V-ALIGN that aligns the input sequence directly on the input graph while avoiding such expensive DAGification steps. V-ALIGN is based on a novel dynamic programming formulation that allows gapped alignment directly on the input graph. It supports affine and linear gaps. We also propose refinements to V-ALIGN for better performance in practice. In this, the time to fill the DP table has linear dependence on the sizes of the sequence, the graph and its feedback vertex set. We perform experiments to compare against the POA based alignment. For aligning short sequences, standard approaches restrict the expensive gapped alignment to small filtered subgraphs having high  similarity to the input sequence. In such cases, the performance of V-ALIGN for gapped alignment on the filtered subgraph depends on the subgraph sizes.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that microbial cell populations can exhibit sustained exponential growth. More surprising is the fact that at high antibiotic levels, cell populations exhibit sustained exponential decay over several orders of magnitude. The boundary between growth and decay occurs at the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the antibiotic, where the density of living cells remains constant over time. These observations suggest that positive (growth) or negative (decay) exponents arise as a difference of cell division and death rates obeying first-order kinetics. Thus for antibiotic concentrations below MIC, division dominates; for concentrations above MIC, death dominates; while MIC itself is a dynamic steady state of balanced division and death, rather than cell stasis. To measure these rates we separately tracked living and dead cells in Escherichia coli populations treated with the ribosome-targeting antibiotic kanamycin. We found that cells divide rapidly even at MIC: inferred division and death rates at MIC are 0.6 times the antibiotic-free division rate. A stochastic model of cells as collections of self-replicating units we term \\\"widgets\\\" reproduces both steady-state and transient features of our experiments, and explains first-order exponential kinetics. In this model cell division and death rates at MIC can be tuned from low to high values by amplifying molecular noise in the synthesis, degradation and partitioning of the widgets. At extremely low noise, cells approach the classic bacteriostatic limit at MIC: neither dividing nor dying. Noise-induced division and death of cells following antibiotic treatment could increase the likelihood of sepsis and antibiotic resistance.",

Since it is analytical, it can also serve as a benchmark against which numerical schemes, such as the Finite Element Method (FEM), can be tested. While conceptually clear, the mathematical expression for the scalp potentials in the four-sphere model is quite cumbersome, and we observed the formulas presented in the literature to contain errors. We here derive and present the correct analytical formulas for future reference. They are compared with the results of FEM simulations of four-sphere model.

    "abstract": "Estimates of functional connectivity using resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) are acutely sensitive to artifacts and large scale nuisance variation. As a result much effort is dedicated to preprocessing rs-fMRI data and using diagnostic measure to identify bad scans. One such diagnostic measure is DVARS, the spatial standard deviation of the data after temporal differencing. A limitation of DVARS however is the lack of concrete interpretation of the absolute values of DVARS, and finding a threshold to distinguish bad scans from good. In this work we describe a variance decomposition of the entire 4D dataset that shows DVARS to be just one of three sources of variation we refer to as D-var (closely linked to DVARS), S-var and E-var. D-var and S-var partition the average variance between adjacent time points, while E-var accounts for edge effects, and each can be used to make spatial and temporal summary diagnostic measures. Extending the partitioning to global (and non-global) signal leads to a rs-fMRI DSE ANOVA table, which decomposes the total and global variance into fast (D-var), slow (S-var) and edge (E-var) components. We find expected values for each variance component under nominal models, showing how D-var (and thus DVARS) scales with overall variance and is diminished by temporal autocorrelation. Finally we propose a sampling distribution for squared DVARS (a multiple of D-var) and robust methods to estimate this null model, allowing computations of DVARS p-values. We propose that these diagnostic time series, images, p-values and ANOVA table will provide a succinct summary of the quality of a rs-fMRI dataset that will support comparisons of datasets over preprocessing steps and between subjects.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of functional connectivity using resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) are acutely sensitive to artifacts and large scale nuisance variation. As a result much effort is dedicated to preprocessing rs-fMRI data and using diagnostic measure to identify bad scans. One such diagnostic measure is DVARS, the spatial standard deviation of the data after temporal differencing. A limitation of DVARS however is the lack of concrete interpretation of the absolute values of DVARS, and finding a threshold to distinguish bad scans from good. In this work we describe a variance decomposition of the entire 4D dataset that shows DVARS to be just one of three sources of variation we refer to as D-var (closely linked to DVARS), S-var and E-var. D-var and S-var partition the average variance between adjacent time points, while E-var accounts for edge effects, and each can be used to make spatial and temporal summary diagnostic measures. Extending the partitioning to global (and non-global) signal leads to a rs-fMRI DSE ANOVA table, which decomposes the total and global variance into fast (D-var), slow (S-var) and edge (E-var) components. We find expected values for each variance component under nominal models, showing how D-var (and thus DVARS) scales with overall variance and is diminished by temporal autocorrelation. Finally we propose a sampling distribution for squared DVARS (a multiple of D-var) and robust methods to estimate this null model, allowing computations of DVARS p-values. We propose that these diagnostic time series, images, p-values and ANOVA table will provide a succinct summary of the quality of a rs-fMRI dataset that will support comparisons of datasets over preprocessing steps and between subjects.",

    "abstract": "Pyramidal cells and interneurons expressing parvalbumin, somatostatin, or vasoactive intestinal peptide show cell type-specific connectivity patterns leading to a canonical microcircuit across cortex. Dissecting the dynamics of this microcircuit is essential to our understanding of the mammalian cortex. However, experiments recording from this circuit often report counterintuitive and seemingly contradictory findings. For example, the response of a V1 neural population to top-down behavioral modulation can reverse from positive to negative when the bottom-up thalamic input changes. We developed a theoretical framework to explain such response reversal, and we showed how this complex dynamics can emerge in circuits that possess two key features: the presence of multiple interneuron populations and a non-linear dependence between the input and output of the populations. Furthermore, we built a cortical circuit model and the comparison of our simulations with real data shows that our model reproduces the complex dynamics observed experimentally in mouse V1. Our explicit calculations allowed us to pinpoint the connections critical to response reversal, and to predict the existence of more types of complex dynamics that could be experimentally tested and the conditions to observe them.",

    "abstract": "Both phasic and tonic modes of neurotransmission are implicated in critical functions assigned to dopamine. In learning, for example, sub-second phasic responses of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons to salient events serve as teaching signals, but learning is also interrupted by dopamine antagonists administered minutes after training. Our findings bridge the multiple timescales of dopamine neurotransmission by demonstrating that burst stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons produces a prolonged post-burst increase (> 20 min) of extracellular dopamine in nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. This elevation is not due to spillover from the stimulation surge but depends on impulse flow-mediated dopamine release. We identified Rho-mediated internalization of dopamine transporter as a mechanism responsible for prolonged availability of actively released dopamine. These results demonstrate that phasic and tonic dopamine neurotransmission can be a continuum and may explain why both modes of signaling are critical for motivational and cognitive functions associated with dopamine.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs) represent irregularly occurring synchronous neuronal population events that are observed during phases of rest and slow wave sleep. SWR activity that follows learning involves sequential replay of training-associated neuronal assemblies and is critical for systems level memory consolidation. SWRs are initiated by CA2 or CA3 pyramidal cells and require initial excitation of CA1 pyramidal cells as well as subsequent participation of parvalbumin (PV) expressing fast spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons. These interneurons are relatively unique in that they represent the major neuronal cell type known to be surrounded by perineuronal nets (PNNs), lattice like structures composed of a hyaluronin backbone that surround the cell soma and proximal dendrites. Though the function of the PNN is not completely understood, previous studies suggest it may serve to localize glutamatergic input to synaptic contacts and thus influence the activity of ensheathed cells. Noting that FS PV interneurons impact the activity of pyramidal cells thought to initiate SWRs, and that their activity is critical to ripple expression, we examine the effects of PNN integrity on SWR activity in the hippocampus. Extracellular recordings from the stratum radiatum of 490 micron horizontal murine hippocampal hemisections demonstrate SWRs that occur spontaneously in CA1. As compared to vehicle, pretreatment (120 min) of paired hemislices with hyaluronidase, which cleaves the hyaluronin backbone of the PNN, decreases PNN integrity and increases SWR frequency. Pretreatment with chondroitinase, which cleaves PNN side chains, also increases SWR frequency. Together, these data contribute to an emerging appreciation of extracellular matrix as a regulator of neuronal plasticity and suggest that one function of mature perineuronal nets could be to modulate the frequency of SWR events.",

    "abstract": "Adult mammalian CNS neurons are unable to regenerate following axonal injury, leading to permanent functional impairments. Yet, the reasons underlying this regeneration failure are not fully understood. Here, we study the transcriptome and proteome shortly after spinal cord injury. Profiling of the total and ribosome-bound RNA in injured and naive spinal cords identify a substantial post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In particular, transcripts associated with nervous system development were downregulated in the total RNA-fraction while remaining stably loaded onto ribosomes. Interestingly, motif association analysis of post-transcriptionally regulated transcripts identified the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) as enriched in a subset of these transcripts that was more resistant to injury-induced reduction at transcriptome level. Modulation of these transcripts by overexpression of the CPE binding protein, Cpeb1, in mouse and Drosophila CNS neurons promoted axonal regeneration following injury. Our study uncovers a global conserved post-transcriptional mechanism enhancing regeneration of injured CNS axons.",

    "abstract": "The cardiac myosin motor powers the beating heart by catalyzed ATPase free energy conversion to contractile work. Transgenic mouse models for heart disease express mouse -cardiac myosin heavy chain with human essential light chain (ELC) in wild type (WT), or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy linked mutant forms, A57G or E143K. Mutants modify the ELC actin binding N-terminus or C-terminus regions. Motility and single myosin mechanical characteristics show stark contrasts between the motors related to their average force, power, and displacement while all indicate the ability to down-shift ensemble step-size with increasing load. A57G and E143K consume more ATP than control WT in the presence of actin with A57G upregulating and E143K downregulating power compared with WT. Higher ATP consumption and downregulated power in E143K implies a lower unitary force. Effects on power are consistent with an A57G that impairs the ELC N-terminus actin binding and an E143K that reduces lever-arm rigidity.",

    "abstract": "Biomarker is the change associated with the disease. Blood is relatively stable because of the homeostatic mechanisms of the body. However, urine accumulates changes of the body, which makes it a better early biomarker source. Liver fibrosis, which results from the deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, is a reversible pathological condition, whereas cirrhosis, the end-stage of liver fibrosis, is irreversible. Consequently, noninvasive early biomarkers for fibrosis are desperately needed. In this study, differential urinary proteins were identified in the thioacetamide (TAA) liver fibrosis rat model using tandem mass tagging and two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2DLC-MS/MS). A total of 766 urinary proteins were identified, 143 and 118 of which were significantly changed in the TAA 1-week and 3-week groups, respectively. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-targeted proteomics was used to further validate the abundant differentially expressed proteins in the TAA 1-week, 3-week, 6-week and 8-week groups. A total of 40 urinary proteins were statistically significant (fold change >2 and p<0.05), 15 of which had been previously reported as biomarkers of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis or other related diseases and 10 of which had been reported to be associated with the pathology and mechanism of liver fibrosis. These differential proteins were detected in urine before the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) changes in the serum and before fibrosis was observed upon hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Massons staining.",

    "abstract": "Humans can identify visual objects independently of view angle and lighting, words independently of volume and pitch, and smells independently of concentration. The computational principles underlying invariant object recognition remain mostly unknown. Here we propose that, in olfaction, a small and relatively stable set made of the earliest activated receptors forms a code for concentration invariant odor identity. One prediction of this \\\"primacy coding\\\" scheme is that decisions based on odor identity can be made solely using early odor-evoked neural activity. Using an optogenetic masking paradigm, we define the sensory integration time necessary for odor identification and demonstrate that animals can use information occurring <100 ms after inhalation onset to identify odors. Using multi-electrode array recordings of odor responses in the olfactory bulb, we find that concentration invariant units respond earliest and at latencies that are within this behaviorally-defined time window. We propose a computational model demonstrating how such a code can be read by neural circuits of the olfactory system.",

Because of the low amount of RNA present in a single cell, some genes may fail to be detected even though they are expressed; these genes are usually referred to as dropouts. Here, we present a general and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB-WaVE), which leads to low-dimensional representations of the data that account for zero inflation (dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count nature of the data. We demonstrate, with simulated and real data, that the model and its associated estimation procedure are able to give a more stable and accurate low-dimensional representation of the data than principal component analysis (PCA) and zero-inflated factor analysis (ZIFA), without the need for a preliminary normalization step.",

Simulation experiments demonstrate higher accuracy of THEMIS over its ancestor, TITAN. The heterogeneity analysis results from THEMIS are validated with single cell DNA sequencing from a clinical tumor biopsy. When THEMIS is used to analyze tumor heterogeneity among multiple biopsies from the same patient, it helps to reveal the mutation accumulation history, track cancer progression, and identify the mutations related to treatment resistance. We implement our model via an extensible modeling platform, which makes our approach open, reproducible, and easy for others to extend.",

    "abstract": "The ability to parse a complex auditory scene into perceptual objects is facilitated by a hierarchical auditory system. Successive stages in the hierarchy transform an auditory scene of multiple overlapping sources, from peripheral tonotopically-based representations in the auditory nerve, into perceptually distinct auditory-objects based representation in auditory cortex. Here, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from human subjects, both men and women, we investigate how a complex acoustic scene consisting of multiple speech sources is represented in distinct hierarchical stages of auditory cortex. Using systems-theoretic methods of stimulus reconstruction, we show that the primary-like areas in auditory cortex contain dominantly spectro-temporal based representations of the entire auditory scene. Here, both attended and ignored speech streams are represented with almost equal fidelity, and a global representation of the full auditory scene with all its streams is a better candidate neural representation than that of individual streams being represented separately. In contrast, we also show that higher order auditory cortical areas represent the attended stream separately, and with significantly higher fidelity, than unattended streams. Furthermore, the unattended background streams are more faithfully represented as a single unsegregated background object rather than as separated objects. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the progression of the representations and processing of a complex acoustic scene up through the hierarchy of human auditory cortex.\\n\\nSignificance StatementUsing magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from human listeners in a simulated cocktail party environment, we investigate how a complex acoustic scene consisting of multiple speech sources is represented in separate hierarchical stages of auditory cortex.
