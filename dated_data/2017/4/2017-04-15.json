    "abstract": "Genome annotation is critical to understand the function of disease variants, especially for clinical applications. To meet this need there are segmentations available from public consortia reflecting varying unsupervised approaches to functional annotation based on epigenetics data, but there remains a need for transparent, reproducible, and easily interpreted genomic maps of the functional biology of chromatin. We introduce a new methodological framework for defining a combinatorial epigenomic model of chromatin state on a web database, StateHub. In addition, we created an annotation tool for bioconductor, StatePaintR, which accesses these models and uses them to rapidly (on the order of seconds) produce chromatin state segmentations in standard genome browser formats. Annotations are fully documented with change history and versioning, authorship information, and original source files. StatePaintR calculates ranks for each state from next-gen sequencing peak statistics, facilitating variant prioritization, enrichment testing, and other types of quantitative analysis. StateHub hosts annotation tracks for major public consortia as a resource, and allows users to submit their own alternative models.",

    "abstract": "Regressive evolution of anatomical traits corresponds with the regression of genomic loci underlying such characters. As such, studying patterns of gene loss can be instrumental in addressing questions of gene function, resolving conflicting results from anatomical studies, and understanding the evolutionary history of clades. The origin of snakes coincided with the regression of a number of anatomical traits, including limbs, taste buds and the visual system. By studying the genomes of snakes, I was able to test three hypotheses associated with the regression of these features. The first concerns two keratins that are putatively specific to claws. Both genes that encode these keratins were pseudogenized/deleted in snake genomes, providing additional evidence of claw- specificity. The second hypothesis is whether snakes lack taste buds, an issue complicated by unequivocal, conflicting results in the literature. I found evidence that different snakes have lost one or more taste receptors, but all snakes examined retained at least some capacity for taste. The final hypothesis I addressed is that the earliest snakes were adapted to a dim light niche. I found evidence of deleted and pseudogenized genes with light- associated functions in snakes, demonstrating a pattern of gene loss similar to other historically nocturnal clades. Together these data also provide some bearing on the ecological origins of snakes, including molecular dating estimates that suggest dim light adaptation preceded the loss of limbs.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common congenital infection and a known cause of microcephaly, sensorineural hearing loss, and cognitive impairment among newborns worldwide. Natural maternal HCMV immunity reduces the incidence of congenital infection, but does not prevent the disease altogether. We employed a nonhuman primate model of congenital CMV infection to investigate the ability of preexisting antibodies to protect against placental CMV transmission. Pregnant, CD4+ T cell-depleted, rhesus CMV (RhCMV)-seronegative rhesus monkeys were treated with either standardly-produced hyperimmune globulin (HIG) from RhCMV-seropositive macaques or dose-optimized, potently RhCMV-neutralizing HIG prior to intravenous challenge with an RhCMV swarm. HIG passive infusion provided complete protection against fetal loss in both groups, and the potently-neutralizing HIG additionally inhibited placental transmission of RhCMV. Our findings suggest that antibody alone at the time of primary infection can prevent congenital CMV and therefore could be a primary target of vaccines to eliminate this neonatal infection.",

However, the relationship of functional connectivity to structural connectivity remains unclear. If functional connectivity relies on structural connectivity, then anatomical isolation of a brain region should eliminate functional connectivity with other brain regions. We tested this by measuring functional connectivity of the surgically disconnected temporal pole in resection patients (N=5; mean age 37; 2F, 3M). Functional connectivity was evaluated based on coactivation of whole-brain fMRI data with the average low-frequency BOLD signal from disconnected tissue in each patient. In sharp contrast to our prediction, we observed significant functional connectivity between the disconnected temporal pole and remote brain regions in each disconnection case. These findings raise important questions about the neural bases of functional connectivity measures derived from the fMRI BOLD signal.",

    "abstract": "Animals can effortlessly adapt their behavior by generalizing from past experiences, and avoid harm in novel aversive situations. In our current understanding, the perceptual similarity between learning and generalization samples is viewed as one major factor driving aversive generalization. Alternatively, the threat-prediction account proposes that perceptual similarity should lead to generalization to the extent it predicts harmful outcomes. We tested these views using a two-dimensional perceptual continuum of faces. During learning, one face is conditioned to predict a harmful event, whereas the most dissimilar face stays neutral; introducing an adversity gradient defined only along one dimension. Learning changed the way how humans sampled information during viewing of faces. These occurred specifically along the adversity gradient leading to an increased dissimilarity of eye-movement patterns along the threat-related dimension. This provides evidence for the threat-prediction account of generalization, which conceives perceptual factors to be relevant to the extent they predict harmful outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Cotton bacterial blight (CBB), an important disease of (Gossypium hirsutum) in the early 20th century, had been controlled by resistant germplasm for over half a century. Recently, CBB re-emerged as an agronomic problem in the United States. Here, we report analysis of cotton variety planting statistics that indicate a steady increase in the percentage of susceptible cotton varieties grown each year since 2009. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strains from the current outbreak cluster with race 18 Xanthomonas citri pv. malvacearum (Xcm) strains.\\n\\nIllumina based draft genomes were generated for thirteen Xcm isolates and analyzed along with 4 previously published Xcm genomes. These genomes encode 24 conserved and nine variable type three effectors. Strains in the race 18 clade contain 3 to 5 more effectors than other Xcm strains. SMRT sequencing of two geographically and temporally diverse strains of Xcm yielded circular chromosomes and accompanying plasmids. These genomes encode eight and thirteen distinct transcription activator-like effector genes. RNA-sequencing revealed 52 genes induced within two cotton cultivars by both tested Xcm strains. This gene list includes a homeologous pair of genes, with homology to the known susceptibility gene, MLO. In contrast, the two strains of Xcm induce different clade III SWEET sugar transporters. Subsequent genome wide analysis revealed patterns in the overall expression of homeologous gene pairs in cotton after inoculation by Xcm. These data reveal host-pathogen specificity at the genetic level and strategies for future development of resistant cultivars.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCotton bacterial blight (CBB), caused by Xanthomonas citri pv. malvacearum (Xcm), significantly limited cotton yields in the early 20th century but has been controlled by classical resistance genes for more than 50 years. In 2011, the pathogen re-emerged with a vengeance. In this study, we compare diverse pathogen isolates and cotton varieties to further understand the virulence mechanisms employed by Xcm and to identify promising resistance strategies. We generate fully contiguous genome assemblies for two diverse Xcm strains and identify pathogen proteins used to modulate host transcription and promote susceptibility. RNA-Sequencing of infected cotton reveals novel putative gene targets for the development of durable Xcm resistance. Together, the data presented reveal contributing factors for CBB re-emergence in the U.S. and highlight several promising routes towards the development of durable resistance including classical resistance genes and potential manipulation of susceptibility targets.",

    "abstract": "Ammonium assimilation in E. coli is regulated by two paralogous proteins (GlnB and GlnK), which orchestrate interactions with regulators of gene expression, transport proteins and metabolic pathways. Yet how they conjointly modulate the activity of glutamine synthetase (GS), the key enzyme for nitrogen assimilation, is poorly understood. We combine experiments and theory to study the dynamic roles of GlnB and GlnK during nitrogen starvation and upshift. We measure time-resolved in vivo concentrations of metabolites, total and post-translationally modified proteins, and develop a concise biochemical model of GlnB and GlnK that incorporates competition for active and allosteric sites, as well as functional sequestration of GlnK. The model predicts the responses of GS, GlnB and GlnK under time-varying external ammonium level in the wild type and two genetic knock-outs. Our results show that GlnK is tightly regulated under nitrogen-rich conditions, yet it is expressed during ammonium run-out and starvation. This suggests a role for GlnK as a buffer of nitrogen shock after starvation, and provides a further functional link between nitrogen and carbon metabolisms.",

Although the Dictum is a widely held and well-motivated principle in decoding research, it has received scant philosophical attention. We critically evaluate the Dictum, arguing that it is false: decodability is a poor guide for revealing the content of neural representations.

    "abstract": "Understanding the transition from fatty liver or steatosis to more advanced inflammatory and fibrotic stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (steatohepatitis), is key to define strategies that alter or even reverse the progression of this pathology. The Liver X Receptor alpha (LXR) controls hepatic lipid homeostasis and inflammation. Here we show that mice carrying a mutation that abolishes phosphorylation at Ser196 (S196A) in LXR exhibit reduced hepatic inflammation and fibrosis when challenged with a high fat-high cholesterol diet, despite displaying enhanced hepatic lipid accumulation. This protective effect is associated with reduced cholesterol accumulation, a key promoter of lipid-mediated hepatic damage. Reduced steatohepatitis in S196A mice involves the reprogramming of the liver transcriptome by promoting diet-induced changes in the expression of genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress, extracellular matrix remodelling, inflammation and lipid metabolism. Unexpectedly, changes in LXR phosphorylation uncover novel diet-specific target genes, whose regulation does not simply mirror ligand-induced LXR activation. These unique LXR phosphorylation-sensitive, diet-responsive target genes are revealed by promoting LXR occupancy and cofactor recruitment in the context of a cholesterol-rich diet. Therefore, LXR phosphorylation at Ser196 critically acts as a novel nutritional sensor that promotes a unique diet-induced transcriptome thereby modulating metabolic, inflammatory and fibrotic responses important in the transition to steatohepatitis.",

We present a novel DNA assembly platform (InDel assembly), based on cycles of endonuclease restriction and ligation of standardised dsDNA building blocks, that can generate libraries exploring both composition and sequence length variation. In addition, we developed a framework to analyse the output of selection from InDel-generated libraries, combining next generation sequencing and alignment-free strategies for sequence analysis. We demonstrate the approach by engineering the well-characterized TEM-1 {beta}-lactamase {Omega}-loop, involved in substrate specificity, identifying multiple novel extended spectrum {beta}-lactamases with loops of modified length and composition areas of the sequence space not previously explored. Together, the InDel assembly and analysis platforms provide an efficient route to engineer protein loops or linkers where sequence length and composition are both essential functional parameters.",
