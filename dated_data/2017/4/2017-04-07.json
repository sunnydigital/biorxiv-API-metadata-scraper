    "abstract": "Neocortical circuits exhibit spontaneous neuronal activity whose functional relevance remains enigmatic. Several proposed functions assume that sensory experience can influence subsequent spontaneous activity. However, long-term alterations in spontaneous firing rates following sensory stimulation have not been reported until now. Here we show that multi-whisker, spatiotemporally rich stimulation of mouse vibrissae induces a laminar-specific, long-term increase of spontaneous activity in the somatosensory cortex. Such stimulation additionally produces stereotypical neural ensemble firing patterns from simultaneously recorded single neurons, which are maintained during spontaneous activity following stimulus offset. The increased neural activity and concomitant ensemble firing patterns are sustained for at least 25 minutes after stimulation, and specific to layers IV and Vb. In contrast, the same stimulation protocol applied to a single whisker fails to elicit this effect. Since layer Vb has the largest receptive fields and, together with layer IV, receives direct thalamic and lateral drive, the increase in firing activity could be the result of mechanisms involving the integration of spatiotemporal patterns across multiple whiskers. Our results provide direct evidence of modification of spontaneous cortical activity by sensory stimulation and could offer insight into the role of spatiotemporal integration in memory storage mechanisms for complex stimuli.",

    "abstract": "1. In this study we propose an extension of the N-mixture family of models that targets an improvement of the statistical properties of rare species abundance estimators when sample sizes are low, yet typical size for tropical studies. The proposed method harnesses information from other species in an ecological community to correct each species estimator. We provide guidance to determine the sample size required to estimate accurately the abundance of rare tropical species when attempting to estimate the abundance of single species.\\n\\n2. We evaluate the proposed methods using an assumption of 50-m radius plots and perform simulations comprising a broad range of sample sizes, true abundances and detectability values and a complex data generating process. The extension of the N-mixture model is achieved by assuming that the detection probabilities of a set of species are all drawn at random from a beta distribution in a multi-species fashion. This hierarchical model avoids having to specify a single detection probability parameter per species in the targeted community. Parameter estimation is done via Maximum Likelihood.\\n\\n3. We compared our multi-species approach with previously proposed multi-species N-mixture models, which we show are biased when the true densities of species in the community are less than seven individuals per 100-ha. The beta N-mixture model proposed here outperforms the traditional Multi-species N-mixture model by allowing the estimation of organisms at lower densities and controlling the bias in the estimation.\\n\\n4. We illustrate how our methodology can be used to suggest sample sizes required to estimate the abundance of organisms, when these are either rare, common or abundant. When the interest is full communities, we show how the multi-species approaches, and in particular our beta model and estimation methodology, can be used as a practical solution to estimate organism densities from rapid inventory datasets. The statistical inferences done with our model via Maximum Likelihood can also be used to group species in a community according to their detectabilities.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have expended considerable effort to understand the causes and correlates of criminal victimization. More recently, scholars have focused on identifying individual-level traits that increase the odds of victimization. Generally absent from this line of research, however, is examining the extent to which previously unmeasured genetic and environmental influences contribute to the covariation between victimization and individual-level risk factors. The current study aims to replicate and extend prior research by examining the contribution of genetic and environmental influences on the association between intelligence and victimization by analyzing twin and sibling data from two nationally representative samples of American youth. Quantitative genetic analyses indicate that common additive genetic factors, as well as non-shared environmental factors, explained the phenotypic association between intelligence and victimization. Finally, our results revealed that after correcting for possible familial confounding, the effect of intelligence on victimization experiences remained statistically significant. The findings of the current study replicate and extend prior research on the phenotypic association between indicators of general intelligence and the experience of victimization.",

    "abstract": "Mood instability is a core clinical feature of affective and psychotic disorders. In keeping with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach, it may be a useful construct for identifying biology that cuts across psychiatric categories. We aimed to investigate the biological validity of a simple measure of mood instability and evaluate its genetic relationship with several psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of mood instability in 53,525 cases and 60,443 controls from UK Biobank, identifying four independently-associated loci (on chromosomes eight, nine, 14 and 18), and a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability estimate of approximately 8%. We found a strong genetic correlation between mood instability and MDD (rg=0.60, SE=0.07, p=8.95 x 10-17) and a small but significant genetic correlation with both schizophrenia (rg=0.11, SE=0.04, p=0.01) and anxiety disorders (rg=0.28, SE=0.14, p=0.04), although no genetic correlation with BD, ADHD or PTSD. Several genes at the associated loci may have a role in mood instability, including the DCC netrin 1 receptor (DCC) gene, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit beta (eIF2B2), placental growth factor (PGF), and protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type D (PTPRD). Strengths of this study include the very large sample size, but our measure of mood instability may be limited by the use of a single question. Overall, this work suggests a polygenic basis for mood instability. This simple measure can be obtained in very large samples; our findings suggest that doing so may offer the opportunity to illuminate the fundamental biology of mood regulation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVarious functional asymmetries detected by different neurophysiological and neuroimaging methods have been reported in the literature on the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), some of them pointing to the right hemisphere activity. In our attempt to discriminate the ADHD patients from normal subjects by hierarchical clustering of behavioural, psychological and event related potential (ERP) variables, the late P3 component of potentials from the right central region (C4) proved to be one of the most informative parameters (in preparation for publication). Here, we have studied the differences in ERPs between the left (C3) and right (C4) central leads and relation of this asymmetry to ADHD diagnosed using DSM.\\n\\nMethods20 typically developing (TD) boys and 19 boys diagnosed with ADHD according to DSM-IV-TR, aged 10-13 years, were examined by the Attentional Network Test (ANT), with simultaneous recording of the respective ERPs. The intergroup differences in the ERP amplitude parameters in the left (C3) and right (C4) central channels and in the difference in these parameters between the two channels (C3 minus C4) were accessed. These characteristics were compared to the subjects DSM scores and ANT performance.\\n\\nResultsThe target-related potentials late characteristics from the C4 and C3 did not shown significant difference between the groups. The difference between ERPs of the C3 and C4 channels inside the interval of 40-290 ms after target onset was larger in the ADHD group than in control, mainly for incongruent target condition. This asymmetry and right late component were correlated with DSM scores, mainly to hyperactive and impulsive criteria.\\n\\nConclusionIn ADHD patients, the results suggest ERP pattern of right-side functional predominance in the motor control, which correlates to DSM scores, mainly to hyperactive and impulsive criteria.",

    "abstract": "RNA-seq has become the most prevalent technology for measuring genome-wide gene expression, but the best practices for processing and analysing RNA-seq data are still an open question. Many statistical methods have been developed to identify genes differentially expressed between sample groups from RNA-seq data. These methods differ by their data distribution assumptions, choice of statistical test, and computational resource requirements. Over 25 methods of differential expression detection were validated and made available through a user-friendly web portal, RNA-seq 2G. All methods are suitable for analysing differential gene expression between two groups of samples. They commonly use a read count matrix derived from RNA-seq data as input and statistically compare groups for each gene. The web portal uses a Shiny app front-end and is hosted by a cloud-based server provided by Amazon Web Service. The comparison of methods showed that the data distribution assumption is the major determinant of differences between methods. Most methods are more likely to find that longer genes are differentially expressed, which substantially impacts downstream gene set-level analysis. Combining results from multiple methods can potentially diminish this bias.

Recent methods, which employ read cloud sequencing and specialized assembly techniques, provide significantly improved genome drafts and show potential to capture these strain-level differences. Here, we apply this read cloud metagenomic approach to longitudinal stool samples from a patient undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation. The patients microbiome is profoundly disrupted and is eventually dominated by Bacteroides caccae. Comparative analysis of B. caccae genomes obtained using read cloud sequencing together with metagenomic RNA sequencing allows us to predict that particular mobile element integrations result in increased antibiotic resistance, which we further support using in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing. Thus, we find read cloud sequencing to be useful in identifying strain-level differences that underlie differential fitness.",

    "abstract": "Developmental processes depend on the combined efforts of epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes that lead to the production of specific proteins that are important determinants of cellular identity and developmental processes. Ribosomes are a central component of the protein biosynthesis machinery in cells; however, their regulatory roles in the translational control of gene expression in an organ specific context during development remain to be defined. In a genetic screen to identify critical regulators of myogenesis, we identified a DEAD-Box RNA helicase, DDX27, that is required for the proliferation and myogenic commitment of skeletal muscle stem cells. DDX27 deficient skeletal muscle exhibits hypotrophy and impaired regeneration potential. We demonstrate that DDX27 regulates ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation, and thereby the ribosome biogenesis and the translation of specific transcripts that are required to maintain pluripotency and myogenic differentiation of satellite cells. These findings provide insight into the translational regulation of gene expression in myogenesis and suggest novel functions for ribosomes in regulating gene expression during skeletal muscle development.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYInherited skeletal muscle diseases are the most common form of genetic disorders with primary abnormalities in the structure and function of skeletal muscle resulting in the impaired locomotion in affected patients. A major hindrance to the development of effective therapies is a lack of understanding of biological processes that promote skeletal muscle growth. By performing a forward genetic screen in zebrafish we have identified mutation in a RNA helicase that leads to perturbations of ribosomal biogenesis pathway and impairs skeletal muscle growth and regeneration. Therefore, our studies have identified novel ribosome-based disease processes that may be therapeutic modulated to restore muscle function in skeletal muscle diseases.",

    "abstract": "Age is the primary risk factor for many of the most common human diseases--particularly neurodegenerative diseases--yet we currently have a very limited understanding of how each individuals genome affects the aging process. Here we introduce a method to map genetic variants associated with age-related gene expression patterns, which we call temporal expression quantitative trait loci (teQTL). We found that these loci are markedly enriched in the human brain and are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Examining potential molecular mechanisms, we found that age-related changes in DNA methylation can explain some cis-acting teQTLs, and that trans-acting teQTLs can be mediated by microRNAs. Our results suggest that genetic variants modifying age-related patterns of gene expression, acting through both cis- and trans-acting molecular mechanisms, could play a role in the pathogenesis of diverse neurological diseases.",

We identify a previously uncharacterized domain of TET1 responsible for binding to OGT and report a point mutation that disrupts the OGT-TET1 interaction.

    "abstract": "MotivationReconstructing the full-length expressed transcripts (a.k.a. the transcript assembly problem) from the short sequencing reads produced by RNA-seq protocol plays a central role in identifying novel genes and transcripts as well as in studying gene expressions and gene functions. A crucial step in transcript assembly is to accurately determine the splicing junctions and boundaries of the expressed transcripts from the reads alignment. In contrast to the splicing junctions that can be efficiently detected from spliced reads, the problem of identifying boundaries remains open and challenging, due to the fact that the signal related to boundaries is noisy and weak.\\n\\nResultsWe present DeepBound, an effective approach to identify boundaries of expressed transcripts from RNA-seq reads alignment. In its core DeepBound employs deep convolutional neural fields to learn the hidden distributions and patterns of boundaries. To accurately model the transition probabilities and to solve the label-imbalance problem, we novelly incorporate the AUC (area under the curve) score into the optimizing objective function. To address the issue that deep probabilistic graphical models requires large number of labeled training samples, we propose to use simulated RNA-seq datasets to train our model. Through extensive experimental studies on both simulation datasets of two species and biological datasets, we show that DeepBound consistently and significantly outperforms the two existing methods.\\n\\nAvailabilityDeepBound is freely available at https://github.com/realbigws/DeepBound.\\n\\nContactmingfu.shao@cs.cmu.edu, realbigws@gmail.com",

    "abstract": "The variability in population size is a key quantity for understanding the evolutionary history of a species. We present a new method, CubSFS, for estimating the changes in population size of a panmictic population from the site frequency spectrum. First, we provide a straightforward proof for the expression of the expected site frequency spectrum depending only on the population size. Our derivation is based on an eigenvalue decomposition of the instantaneous coalescent rate matrix. Second, we solve the inverse problem of determining the variability in population size from an observed SFS. Our solution is based on a cubic spline for the population size. The cubic spline is determined by minimizing the weighted average of two terms, namely (i) the goodness of fit to the SFS, and (ii) a penalty term based on the smoothness of the changes. The weight is determined by cross-validation. The new method is validated on simulated demographic histories and applied on data from nine different human populations.",

    "abstract": "A reduction in high-dimensional phenotypic states to a few degrees of freedom is essential to understand biological systems. One possible origin of such a reduction (as recently discussed) is the steady growth of cells that constrains each components replication rate. Here, in contrast, our aim is to investigate consequences of evolutionary robustness, which is shown to cause a stronger dimensional reduction in possible phenotypic changes in response to a variety of environmental conditions. First, we examined global protein expression changes in Escherichia coli after various environmental perturbations. Remarkably, they were proportional across components, across different types of environmental conditions, while the proportion coefficient corresponded to the change in growth rate. Because such global proportionality is not generic to all systems under a condition of steady growth, a new conceptual framework is then needed. We hypothesized that such proportionality is a result of evolution. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed a cell model--with a huge number of components, that reproduces itself via a catalytic reaction network--and confirmed that common proportionality in the concentrations of all components is shaped through evolutionary processes to maximize cell growth (and therefore fitness) under a given environmental condition. Furthermore, we found that the changes in concentration across all components in response to environmental and evolutionary changes are constrained to the changes along a one-dimensional major axis within a huge-dimensional state space. On the basis of these observations, we propose a theory in which high-dimensional phenotypic changes after evolution are constrained to the points near a one-dimensional major axis that correlates with the growth rate, to achieve both evolutionary robustness and plasticity. By formulating this proposition in terms of dynamical systems, broad experimental and numerical results on phenotypic changes caused by evolution and adaptation are coherently explained.\\n\\nSummaryCells generally consist of thousands of components whose abundance levels change through adaptation and evolution. Accordingly, each steady cell state can be represented as a point in a high-dimensional space of component concentrations. In the context of equilibrium statistical thermodynamics, even though the state space is high-dimensional, macroscopic description only by a few degrees of freedom is possible for equilibrium systems; however, such characterization by a few degrees of freedom has not yet been achieved for cell systems. Given that they are not in equilibrium, we need some other constraint to be imposed. Here, by restricting our focus to a cellular state with steady growth that is achieved after evolution,we examine how the expression levels of its several components change under different environmental conditions. On the basis of analysis of protein expression levels in recent bacterial experiments as well as the results of simulations using a toy cell model consisting of thousands of components that are reproduced by catalytic reactions, we found that adaptation and evolutionary paths in high-dimensional state space are constrained to changes along a one-dimensional curve, representing a major axis for all the observed changes. Moreover, this one-dimensional structure emerges only after evolution and is not applicable to any system showing steady growth. This curve is determined by the growth rate of a cell, and thus it is possible to describe an evolved system by means of a growth rate function. All the observed results are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in high-dimensional states are nearly confined to the major axis in response to environmental, evolutionary, and stochastic perturbations. This description opens up the possibility to characterize a cell state as a macroscopic growth rate, as is the case for the thermodynamic potential. This approach can provide estimates of which phenotypic changes are theoretically more evolvable, as predicted simply from their observed environmental responses.",

    "abstract": "Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) are key metabolic enzymes that are mutated in a variety of cancers to confer a gain-of-function activity resulting in the accumulation and secretion of an oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Accumulation of 2-HG can result in epigenetic dysregulation and a block in cellular differentiation, suggesting these mutations play a role in neoplasia. Based on its potential as a cancer target, a number of small molecule inhibitors have been developed to specifically inhibit mutant forms of IDH (mIDH1 and mIDH2). Here, a panel of mIDH inhibitors were systematically profiled using biochemical, cell-based, and tier-one ADME techniques. We quantified the biochemical effect of each inhibitor on mIDH1 (R132H and R132C) and mIDH2 (R172Q). The effect of these inhibitors on 2-HG concentrations in seven cell lines representing five different IDH1 mutations in both 2D and 3D cell cultures was assessed. Target engagement of these inhibitors was analyzed utilizing cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA), the effects of inhibitors on reversing 2-HG-induced block on leukemic cellular differentiation. We conclude from our mIDH1 assay panel that AG-120 and a Novartis inhibitor exhibited excellent activity in all biochemical and most cellular assays. While AG-120 has superior DMPK properties, it lacks efficacy a leukemic differentiation model. In conclusion, we present a comprehensive suite of in vitro preclinical drug development assays that can be used as a tool-box to identify lead compounds for mIDH drug discovery programs, as well as what we believe is the most comprehensive publically available dataset on the top mIDH inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Alteration of single protein regulation has given a massive implication in Muscular Dystrophy pathogenesis. Herein, we investigated the contribution of defected dystrophin that has impaired PI3K/Akt signalling and subsequently reduced autophagy in dystrophin-deficient myoblasts. In this study, dfd13 (dystrophin-deficient) and C2C12 (non-dystrophic) myoblasts were cultured in low mitogen condition for 10 days to induce differentiation. Analyses of protein expression has been done by using immunoblot technique, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. In our myoblasts differentiation system, the dfd13 myoblasts did not achieved terminal differentiation as fewer myotube formation and fast-myosin heavy chain expression almost not detected. Immunoblot analysis showed that PTEN expression is profoundly increased in dfd13 myoblasts throughout the differentiation day. As a result, the PI3K activity is decreased and has caused serine/threonine kinase Akt inactivation. Both residues; Thr308 and Ser473, on Akt were found not phosphorylated. The mTOR activation by Ser2448 phosphorylation was decreased indicates an impairment for raptor and rictor binding. Unable to form complexes; mTORC1 target protein, p70S6K1 activation was found reduced at the same time explained un-phosphorylated-Akt at Ser473 by rictor-mTORC2. As one of Akt downstream protein, transcription factor FoxO3 regulation was found impaired as it was highly expressed and highly mainly localised in the nucleus in dfd13 towards the end of the differentiation day. This occurrence has caused higher activation of autophagy related genes; Beclin1, Atg5, Atg7, in dfd13 myoblasts. Autophagosome formation was increased as LC3B-I/II showed accumulation upon differentiation. However, ratio of LC3B lipidation and autophagic flux were shown decreased which exhibited dystrophic features. As a conclusion, destabilisation of plasma membrane owing to dystrophin mutation has caused the alteration of plasma membrane protein regulation particularly PTEN-PI3K, thus impaired autophagy modulation that critical for myoblasts development.",

    "abstract": "Alignment-free (AF) methods have recently been adopted to infer phylogenetic trees. However, the evolutionary relationships among microbes, impacted by common phenomena such as lateral genetic transfer and rearrangement, cannot be adequately captured in a strictly tree-like structure. Bacterial and archaeal genomes consist of highly conserved regions, e.g. ribosomal RNA genes (commonly used as phylogenetic markers), more-variable regions and extrachromosomal elements, i.e. plasmids (that contain genes critical under a selective condition e.g. antibiotic resistance). The impact of these elements on genome-scale inference of microbial phylogeny remains little known. Here, using an AF approach, we inferred phylogenomic networks of microbial life based on 2785 completely sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes, and systematically assessed the impact of ribosomal RNA genes and plasmid sequences in this network. Our results indicate that k-mer similarity can correlate with taxonomic rank of microbes. Using a relational database approach, we linked the implicated k-mers to annotated genomic regions (thus functions), and defined core functions in specific phyletic groups and genera. We found that, in most phyla, highly conserved functions are often related to Amino acid metabolism and transport, and Energy production and conversion. Our findings indicate that AF phylogenomics can be used to infer reticulate relationships in a scalable manner and provide new perspective into microbial biology and evolution.",

    "abstract": "RationaleChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory disorder of the sinonasal mucosa associated with microbial colonization. Metastasis of sinus microbiota into the lower airways is thought have significant implications in the development of chronic respiratory disease. However, this dynamic has not been thoroughly investigated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, where lower airway infections are the primary driver of patient mortality. Given the high prevalence of CRS in CF patients and the proposed infection dynamic between the upper and lower airways, a better understanding of sinus-lung continuum is warranted.\\n\\nObjectiveTo compare the microbiome of matched sinus mucus and lung sputum samples from CF subjects undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) for treatment of CRS.\\n\\nMethodsMucus was isolated from the sinuses and lungs of twelve CF patients undergoing FESS. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was then performed to compare bacterial communities of the CF lung and sinus niches. Finally, functional profiling was performed to predict bacterial metagenomes from the 16S dataset, and was used to compare pathogenic bacterial phenotypes between the upper and lower airways.\\n\\nMeasurements and Main ResultsBacterial richness was comparable between airway sites, though sinus and lung environments differed in community evenness, with the sinuses harboring a higher prevalence of dominant microorganisms. Beta diversity metrics also revealed that samples clustered more consistently by airway niche rather than by individual. Finally, predicted metagenomes showed that anaerobic metabolism was enriched in the lung environment, while genes associated with both biofilm formation and Gram identity were not variable between sites.\\n\\nConclusionsSinus and lung microbiomes are distinct with respect to richness and evenness, while sinus communities have a higher incidence of a dominant taxon. Additionally, ordination analyses point to sinus and lung environments as being stronger determinants of microbial community structure than the individual patient. Finally, BugBase-predicted metagenomes revealed anaerobic phenotypes to be in higher abundance in the lung relative to the sinuses. Our findings indicate that while the paranasal sinuses and lungs may still comprise a unified airway in which lower airways are seeded by sinus microbiota, these discrete airway microenvironments harbor distinct bacterial communities.",

A single, low dose of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine elicits a long-lasting antidepressant response in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. Developing mechanistic understanding of how NMDAR antagonism alters synapse and circuit function is pivotal to developing translatable, circuit-based therapies for depression. Here using viral vectors, anatomical tracing, fMRI, and optogenetic-assisted circuit analysis, we assessed the role of the NMDAR subunit GluN2B in regulating cellular, synaptic, and circuit-level function and depression-related behavior. We demonstrate that post-developmental deletion of GluN2B from pyramidal neurons in medial prefrontal cortex enhances action potential output in a synaptic activity-dependent manner. GluN2B deletion dictates functional connectivity between mPFC and limbic thalamus but not ventral hippocampus and elicits antidepressant-like behavior. Our findings demonstrate that postsynaptic GluN2B exerts input-specific control of pyramidal neuron innervation, and identify a novel circuit for regulating depression-like behaviors in mice.",

    "abstract": "The development of angiosperm flowers is regulated by homeotic MIKC-type MADS-domain transcription factors that activate or repress target genes via the formation of DNA-bound, organ specific tetrameric complexes. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) capabilities differ considerably between different MIKC-type proteins. The floral homeotic protein SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) acts as a hub that incorporates numerous other MADS-domain proteins into tetrameric complexes that would otherwise not form. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these promiscuous interactions remain largely unknown. In this study we created a collection of amino acid substitution mutants of SEP3 to quantify the contribution of individual residues on protein tetramerization during DNA-binding, employing methods of molecular biophysics. We show that leucine residues at certain key positions form a leucine zipper structure that is essential for tetramerization of SEP3, whereas the introduction of physicochemically very similar residues at respective sites impedes the formation of DNA-bound tetramers. Comprehensive molecular evolutionary analyses of MADS-domain proteins from a diverse set of flowering plants revealed exceedingly high conservation of the identified leucine residues within SEP3-subfamily proteins throughout angiosperm evolution. In contrast, MADS-domain proteins that are unable to tetramerize among themselves exhibit preferences for other amino acids at homologous sites. Our findings indicate that the subfamily-specific conservation of amino acid residues at just a few key positions account for subfamily-specific interaction capabilities of MADS-domain transcription factors and shaped the present-day structure of the PPI network controlling flower development.",

However, the reproducibility assessment of these studies is challenged by a lack of fully confirmatory experiments from independent researchers. While an increment in the number of studies with expression data for several tissues is expected, statistical measures are still needed to assess the reproducibility between studies. We identified a gap in the statistical literature concerning the assessment of agreement between studies that independently measure the effect of a varying condition on a population sample. The gap precluded us to test, using standard statistics, the level of agreement between the GTEX (RNAseq) and BRAINEAC (microarray) studies to distinguish the structure of co-expression networks across four brain tissues. We, therefore, generalized a classical measure of agreement, Cohens{kappa} , derived its distributional characteristics and determined its reliability properties. In the gene expression studies, we found full agreement of genome-wide networks in BRAINEAC benchmarked against GTEX, and highest agreement for brain specific pathways. Our highly interpretable measure can contribute to anticipated efforts on reproducibility research.",

We implemented an unbiased phosphoproteomics-based analysis that establishes cognate kinase-substrate associations, and revealed that c-Fes directly phosphorylates Dok1, Ptpn18 and Sts1, facilitating recruitment of the Src inhibitory kinase Csk to these substrates. These interactions resulted in modulation of Src signaling following B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation and subsequent alteration of the protein levels of CD19, a membrane-localized BCR co-receptor and emerging key protein affecting the development of B- and plasma cell-lymphoma. Strikingly, manipulating c-Fes expression levels drove opposing biological outcomes. Low-level exogenous c-Fes expression led to a strong increase in CD19 protein levels while high c-Fes expression abolished CD19 protein levels. Thus, we propose that a balance of c-Fes and Src signaling can regulate receptor maintenance, which may influence cellular outcome such as tumorigenesis or tumor suppression.",

    "abstract": "The Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complex plays an important role in chromosome organization and segregation in most living organisms. In Caulobacter crescentus, SMC is required to align the left and the right arms of the chromosome that run in parallel down the long axis of the cell. However, the mechanism of SMC-mediated alignment of chromosomal arms remains elusive. Here, using a genome-wide chromosome conformation capture assay (Hi-C), chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) and microscopy of single cells, we show that Caulobacter SMC is recruited to the centromeric parS site and that SMC-mediated arm alignment depends on the chromosome partitioning protein ParB. We provide evidence that SMC likely tethers the parS-proximal regions of the chromosomal arms together, promoting arm alignment. Strikingly, the co-orientation of DNA replication and the transcription of highly-expressed genes is crucial for chromosome-wide alignment. Highly-transcribed genes near parS that are oriented against DNA replication disrupt arm alignment suggesting that head-on transcription interferes with SMC translocation and arm alignment. Our results demonstrate a tight interdependence of bacterial chromosome organization and global patterns of transcription.",

Here, we used a mouse wound excisional model to characterize the infection dynamics of E. faecalis and show that infected wounds result in two different states depending on the initial inoculum. Low dose inocula were associated with short term, low titer colonization whereas high dose inocula were associated with acute bacterial replication and long term persistence. High dose infection and persistence were also associated with immune cell infiltration, despite suppression of some inflammatory cytokines and delayed wound healing. During high dose infection, the multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF) which is involved in resisting immune clearance, contributes to E. faecalis fitness. These results comprehensively describe a mouse model for investigating E. faecalis wound infection determinants, and suggest that both immune modulation and resistance contribute to persistent, non-healing wounds.",

    "abstract": "Different memory systems offer distinct advantages to navigational behavior. The hippocampus forms complex associations between environmental stimuli, enabling flexible navigation through space. In contrast, the dorsal striatum associates discrete cues and favorable behavioral responses, enabling habit-like, automated navigation. While these two systems often complement one another, there are instances where striatal-dependent responses (e.g. approach a cue) conflict with hippocampal representations of spatial goals. In conflict situations, preference for spatial vs. response strategies varies across individuals and depends on previous experience, plasticity and the integrity of these two memory systems. Here, we investigated the role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and exercise on mouse search strategies in a water maze task that can be solved with either a hippocampal-dependent place strategy or a striatal-dependent cue-response strategy. We predicted that inhibiting adult neurogenesis would impair hippocampal function and shift behavior towards striatal-dependent cue responses. However, blocking neurogenesis in a transgenic nestin-TK mouse did not affect strategy choice. We then investigated whether a pro-neurogenic stimulus, running, would bias mice towards hippocampal-dependent spatial strategies. While running indeed promoted spatial strategies, it did so even when neurogenesis was inhibited in nestin-TK mice. These findings indicate that exercise-induced increases in neurogenesis are not always required for enhanced cognitive function. Furthermore, our data identify exercise as a potentially useful strategy for promoting flexible, cognitive forms of memory in habit-related disorders that are characterized by excessive responding to discrete cues.",

    "abstract": "Ebola virus (EBOV) infection causes a high death toll, killing a high proportion of EBOV infected patients within 7 days. Comprehensive data on EBOV infection are very fragmented, hampering efforts in developing therapeutics and vaccines against EBOV. Under this circumstance, mathematical models become valuable resources to explore potential controlling strategies. In this paper, we employed experimental data of EBOV-infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) to construct a mathematical framework for determining windows of opportunity for treatment and vaccination. Considering a prophylactic vaccine based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-EBOV), we found that the time window can be subject-specific, but vaccination could be protective if a subject is vaccinated during a period from one week to four months before infection. For the case of a therapeutic vaccine based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), a single dose might resolve the invasive EBOV replication even it was administrated as late as four days after infection. Our mathematical models can be used as building blocks for developing therapeutic and vaccine modalities as well as for evaluating public health intervention strategies in outbreaks. Future laboratory experiments will help to validate and refine the estimates of the windows of opportunity proposed here.",

Understanding the causes of these population-wide differences is a critical step towards the development of personalized treatments and improvements to existing medications. Here, we investigate natural differences in sensitivity to anti-neoplastic drugs that target topoisomerase II, using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that wild isolates of C. elegans vary in their sensitivity to these drugs, and we use an unbiased statistical and molecular genetics approach to demonstrate that this variation is explained by a methionine-to-glutamine substitution in topoisomerase II (TOP-2). The presence of a non-polar methionine at this residue increases hydrophobic interactions between TOP-2 and the poison etoposide, as compared to a polar glutamine. We hypothesize that this stabilizing interaction results in increased genomic instability in strains that contain a methionine residue. The residue affected by this substitution is conserved from yeast to humans and is one of the few differences between the two human topoisomerase II isoforms (methionine in hTOPII and glutamine in hTOPII{beta}). We go on to show that this substitution influences binding and cytotoxicity of etoposide and two additional topoisomerase II poisons in human cell lines. These results explain why hTOPII and hTOPII{beta} are differentially affected by various poisons and demonstrate the utility of C. elegans in understanding the genetics of drug responses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundClosing gaps in draft genomes is an important post processing step in genome assembly. It leads to more complete genomes, which benefits downstream genome analysis such as annotation and genotyping. Several tools have been developed for gap closing. However, these tools dont fully utilize the information contained in the sequence data. For example, while it is known that many gaps are caused by genomic repeats, existing tools often ignore many sequence reads that originate from a repeat-related gap.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we propose a new approach called GAPPadder for gap closing. The main advantage of GAPPadder is that it uses more information in sequence data for gap closing. In particular, GAPPadder finds and uses reads that originate from repeate-related gaps. We show that these repeat-associated reads are useful for gap closing, even though they are ignored by all existing tools. Other main features of GAPPadder include utilizing the information in sequence reads with different insert sizes and performing two-stage local assembly of gap sequences. We compare GAPPadder with GapCloser, GapFiller and Sealer on one bacterial genome, human chromosome 14 and the human whole genome with paired-end and mate-paired reads with both short and long insert sizes. Empirical results show that GAPPadder can close more gaps than these existing tools. Besides closing gaps on draft genomes assembled only from short sequence reads, GAPPadder can also be used to close gaps for draft genomes assembled with long reads. We show GAPPadder can close gaps on the bed bug genome and the Asian sea bass genome that are assembled partially and fully with long reads respectively. We also show GAPPadder is efficient in both time and memory usage. The software tool, GAPPadder, is available for download at https://github.com/Reedwarbler/GAPPadder.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy is a growing field in cancer research. A privileged tumor-associated antigen that has received much attention is N-glycolyl (NeuGc) GM3. This ganglioside is present in several types of cancer, but is almost undetectable in human healthy tissues. However, its non-hydroxylated variant, NeuAc GM3, is abundant in all mammals. Due to a deletion in the human gene encoding the key enzyme for synthesis of NeuGc, humans, in contrast to other mammals, cannot synthesize NeuGc GM3. Therefore the presence of this ganglioside in human cancer cells represents an enigma. It has been shown that hypoxic conditions trigger the expression of NeuGc gangliosides, which not only serve as attractive targets for cancer therapy, but also as diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker. Here, we confirm hypoxia-induced expression of the NeuGc GM3 ganglioside also in HeLa cells and reveal several candidate proteins, in particular GM3 synthase and subunit B of respiratory complex II (SDHB), that may be involved in the generation of NeuGc GM3 by SILAC-based proteome analysis. These findings have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of how this enigmatic tumor-associated antigen is produced in humans, and also suggest a possible mechanism of action of anti-tumor antibodies that recognize hypoxia markers, such as 14F7.",

    "abstract": "Ecological networks, both displaying mutualistic or antagonistic interactions, seem to share common structural traits: the presence of nestedness and modularity. A variety of model approaches and hypothesis have been formulated concerning the significance and implications of these properties. In phage-bacteria bipartite infection networks, nestedness seems to be the rule in many different contexts. Modeling the coevolution of a diverse virus-host ensemble is a difficult task, given the dimensionality and multi parametric nature of a standard continuous approximation. Here we show that this can actually be overcome by using a simple model of coevolving digital genomes on a spatial lattice and having exactly the same properties, i.e. a genome-independent fitness associated to fixed growth and death parameters. A matching allele model of phage-virus recognition rule is enough to generate a complex, diverse ecosystem with heterogeneous patterns of interaction and nestedness, provided that interactions take place under a spatially-constrained setting. It is found that nestedness seems to be an emergent property of the coevolutionary dynamics. Our results indicate that the enhanced diversity resulting from localized interactions strongly promotes the presence of nested infection matrices.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to assess whether observational associations between exposures and disease reflect causal relationships. MR requires genetic variants to be independent of factors that confound observational associations.\\n\\nMethodsUsing data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, associations within and between 121 phenotypes and 13,720 genetic variants (from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog) were examined to assess the validity of MR assumptions.\\n\\nResultsAmongst 7,260 pairwise comparisons between the 121 phenotypes, 2,188 (30%) provided evidence of association, where 363 were expected at the 5% level (observed:expected ratio=6.03; 95% CI: 5.42, 6.70; {chi}2=9682.29; d.f. =1, P[&le;]1x10-50). Amongst 1,660,120 pairwise associations between phenotypes and genotypes, 86,748 (5.2%) gave evidence of association at the same threshold, where 83,006 were expected (observed:expected ratio=1.05; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.05; {chi}2=117.57; d.f. =1, P=2.15x10-27). Amongst 1,171,764 pairwise associations between the phenotypes and LD pruned independent genetic variants, 60,136 (5.1%) gave evidence of association, where 58,588 were expected (observed:expected ratio=1.03; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.08; {chi}2= 43.05; d.f. = 1, P=5.33x10-11).\\n\\nConclusionThese results confirm previously observed patterns of phenotypic correlation. They also provide evidence of a substantially lower level of association between genetic variants and phenotypes, with residual inflation the likely product of indistinguishable real genetic association, multiple variables measuring the same biological phenomena, or pleiotropy. These results reflect the favorable properties of genetic instruments for estimating causal relationships, but confirm the need for functional information or analytical methods to account for pleiotropic events.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDICER1 plays a major role in development and in generating mature microRNAs that are important in gene expression. We screened for DICER1 mutations in a family with DICER1 syndrome and we discovered a pathogenic mutation in a child with transposition of the great arteries (TGA). In view of a report linking DICER1 knock-out in murine cardiomyocytes to cardiac outflow defects, we investigated the involvement of DICER1 in TGA.\\n\\nFindingsWe screened 129 germline DNA samples from children with either sporadic or familial forms of TGA for DICER1 mutations using a Fluidigm access array, followed by next-generation sequencing. We identified 16 previously reported variants (5 synonymous, 6 intronic, and 5 missense) and 2 novel variants (1 intronic and 1 missense). We did not find any apparent pathological mutation in our cohort.\\n\\nConclusionHere we report that DICER1 mutations do not appear to play a major role in TGA.",
