    "abstract": "The detection of genomic regions involved in local adaptation is an important topic in current population genetics. There are several detection strategies available depending on the kind of genetic and demographic information at hand. A common drawback is the high risk of false positives. In this study, we introduce two complementary methods for the detection of divergent selection from populations connected by migration. Both methods have been developed with the aim of being robust to false positives. The first method combines haplotype information with inter-population differentiation (FST). Evidence of divergent selection is concluded only when both the haplotype pattern and the FST value support it. The second method is developed for independently segregating markers i.e. there is no haplotype information at hand. In this case, the power to detect selection is attained by developing a new outlier test based on detecting a bimodal distribution. The test computes the FST outliers and then assumes that those of interest would have a different mode which is detected by a clustering algorithm. The utility of the two methods is demonstrated through simulations and the analysis of real data. The simulation results show power ranging from 60-94% in several of the scenarios whilst the false positive rate is controlled below the nominal level in every scenario. The analysis of real samples consisted of phased data from the HapMap project and unphased data from intertidal marine snail ecotypes. The software HacDivSel implements the methods explained in this manuscript.",

    "abstract": "Interacting with others to decide how finite resources should be allocated between parties which may have competing interests is an important part of social life. Considering that not all of our proposals to others are always accepted, the outcomes of such social interactions are, by their nature, probabilistic and risky. Here, we highlight cognitive processes related to value computations in human social interactions, based on mathematical modelling of the proposer behavior in the Ultimatum Game. Our results suggest that the perception of risk is an overarching process across non-social and social decision-making, whereas nonlinear weighting of others acceptance probabilities is unique to social interactions in which others valuation processes needs to be inferred. Despite the complexity of social decision-making, human participants make near-optimal decisions by dynamically adjusting their decision parameters to the changing social value orientation of their opponents through influence by multidimensional inferences they make about those opponents (e.g. how prosocial they think their opponent is relative to themselves).",

We hypothesize that the unexplained heritability of ASD also includes rare inherited variants with intermediate effects. We investigated the genome-wide distribution and functional impact of structural variants (SVs) through whole genome analysis ([&ge;]30X coverage) of 3,169 subjects from 829 families affected by ASD. Genes that are intolerant to inactivating variants in the exome aggregation consortium (ExAC) were depleted for SVs in parents, specifically within fetal-brain promoters, UTRs and exons. Rare paternally-inherited SVs that disrupt promoters or UTRs were over-transmitted to probands (P = 0.0013) and not to their typically-developing siblings. Recurrent functional noncoding deletions implicate the gene LEO1 in ASD. Protein-coding SVs were also associated with ASD (P = 0.0025). Our results establish that rare inherited SVs predispose children to ASD, with differing contributions from each parent.",

    "abstract": "The reanalysis of publicly available GWAS data represents a powerful and cost-effective opportunity to gain insights into the genetics and pathophysiology of complex diseases. We demonstrate this by gathering and reanalyzing public type 2 diabetes (T2D) GWAS data for 70,127 subjects, using an innovative imputation and association strategy based on multiple reference panels (1000G and UK10K). This approach led us replicate and fine map 50 known T2D loci, and identify seven novel associated regions: five driven by common variants in or near LYPLAL1, NEUROG3, CAMKK2, ABO and GIP genes; one by a low frequency variant near EHMT2; and one driven by a rare variant in chromosome Xq23, associated with a 2.7-fold increased risk for T2D in males, and located within an active enhancer associated with the expression of Angiotensin II Receptor type 2 gene (AGTR2), a known modulator of insulin sensitivity. We further show that the risk T allele reduces binding of a nuclear protein, resulting in increased enhancer activity in muscle cells. Beyond providing novel insights into the genetics and pathophysiology of T2D, these results also underscore the value of reanalyzing publicly available data using novel analytical approaches.",

Here, we present the identification of a DTD variant, named ATD (Animalia-specific tRNA deacylase), that harbors a Gly-transPro motif.

Marker gene sequences can be used to assess diversity and taxonomy, but do not directly measure functions arising from other genes in the community metagenome. Such functions can be predicted by algorithms that associate marker genes with experimentally determined traits in well-studied species. Typically, such methods use ancestral state reconstruction. Here I describe SINAPS, a new algorithm that predicts traits for marker gene sequences using a fast, simple word-counting algorithm that does not require alignments or trees. A measure of prediction confidence is obtained by bootstrapping. I tested SINAPS predictions from 16S V4 query sequences for traits including energy metabolism, Gram-positive staining, presence of a flagellum, V4 primer mismatches, and 16S copy number. Accuracy was >90% except for copy number, where a large majority of predictions were within +/-2 of the true value.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation amplicon sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA is widely used to survey microbial communities. Alpha and beta diversities of these communities are often quantified on the basis of OTU frequencies in the reads. Read abundances are biased by factors including 16S copy number and PCR primer mismatches which can cause the read abundance distribution to diverge substantially from the species abundance distribution. Using mock community tests with species abundances determined independently by shotgun sequencing, I find that 16S amplicon read frequencies have no meaningful correlation with species frequencies (Pearson coefficient r close to zero). In addition, I show that that the Jaccard distance between the abundance distributions for reads of replicate samples, which ideally would be zero, is typically ~0.15 with values up to 0.71 for replicates sequenced in different runs. Using simulated communities, I estimate that the average rank of a dominant species in the reads is 3. I describe UNBIAS, a method that attempts to correct for abundance bias due to gene copy number and primer mismatches. I show that UNBIAS can achieve informative, but still poor, correlations (r ~0.6) between estimated and true abundances in the idealized case of mock samples where species are well known. However, r falls to ~0.4 when the closest reference species have 97% identity and to ~0.2 at 95% identity. This degradation is mostly explained by the increased difficulty in predicting 16S copy number when OTUs have lower similarity with the reference database, as will typically be the case in practice. 16S abundance bias therefore remains an unsolved problem, calling into question the naive use of alpha and beta diversity metrics based on frequency distributions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWith ever-increasing amounts of data produced in biology research, scientists are in need of efficient data analysis methods. Cluster analysis, combined with visualization of the results, is one such method that can be used to make sense of large data volumes. At the same time, cluster analysis is known to be imperfect and depends on the choice of algorithms, parameters, and distance measures. Most clustering algorithms dont properly account for ambiguity in the source data, as records are often assigned to discrete clusters, even if an assignment is unclear. While there are metrics and visualization techniques that allow analysts to compare clusterings or to judge cluster quality, there is no comprehensive method that allows analysts to evaluate, compare, and refine cluster assignments based on the source data, derived scores, and contextual data.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we introduce a method that explicitly visualizes the quality of cluster assignments, allows comparisons of clustering results and enables analysts to manually curate and refine cluster assignments. Our methods are applicable to matrix data clustered with partitional, hierarchical, and fuzzy clustering algorithms. Furthermore, we enable analysts to explore clustering results in context of other data, for example, to observe whether a clustering of genomic data results in a meaningful differentiation in phenotypes.\\n\\nConclusionsOur methods are integrated into Caleydo StratomeX, a popular, web-based, disease subtype analysis tool. We show in a usage scenario that our approach can reveal ambiguities in cluster assignments and produce improved clusterings that better differentiate genotypes and phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The interface between biological cells and non-biological surfaces profoundly influences cellular activities, chronic tissue responses, and ultimately the success of medical implants. Materials in contact with cells can be plastics, metal, ceramics or other synthetic materials, and their surfaces vary widely in chemical compositions, stiffness, topography and levels of roughness. To understand the molecular mechanism of how cells and tissues respond to different materials, it is of critical importance to directly visualize the cell-material interface at the relevant length scale of nanometers. Conventional ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) often requires substrate removal before microtome sectioning, which is not only challenging for most substrates but also can cause structural distortions of the interface. Here, we present a new method for in situ examination of the cell-to-material interface at any desired cellular location, based on focused-ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy imaging (FIB-SEM). This method involves a thin-layer plastification procedure that preserves adherent cells as well as enhances the contrast of biological specimen. We demonstrate that this unique procedure allows the visualization of cell-to-material interface and intracellular structures with 10nm resolution, compatible with a variety of materials and surface topographies, and capable of volume and multi-directional imaging. We expect that this method will be very useful for studies of cell-to-material interactions and also suitable for in vivo studies such as examining osteoblast adhesion and new bone formation in response to titanium implants.",

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules produce a very high dimensional time-series dataset. Performing analysis necessarily involves projection onto a lower dimensional space. A priori selection of projection coordinates requires (perhaps unavailable) prior information or intuition about the system. At best, such a projection can only confirm the intuition. At worst, a poor projection can obscure new features of the system absent from the intuition. Previous statistical methods such a time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA) and Markov state modeling (MSMs) have offered relatively unbiased means of projecting conformations onto coordinates or state labels, respectively. These analyses are underpinned by the propagator formalism and the assumption that slow dynamics are biologically interesting. Although arising from the same mathematics, tICA and MSMs have different strengths and weaknesses. We introduce a unifying method which we term \\\"landmark kernel tICA\\\" (lktICA) which uses a variant of the Nystrom kernel approximation to permit approximate non-linear solutions to the tICA problem. We show that lktICA is equivalent to MSMs with \\\"soft\\\" states. We demonstrate the advantages of this united method by finding improved projections of (a) a 1D potential surface (b) a peptide folding trajectory and (c) an ion channel conformational change.",

    "abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous organelles that contain neutral lipids and are surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer. How proteins specifically localize to the phospholipid monolayer of the LD surface has been a matter of extensive investigations. Here we show that syntaxin 17 participates in LD biogenesis by regulating the distribution of acyl-CoA synthetase 3 (ACSL3), a key enzyme for LD biogenesis that redistributes from the endoplasmic reticulum to LDs during LD formation. Time course experiments revealed that syntaxin 17 binds to ACSL3 in the initial stage of LD formation, and that ACSL3 is released as a consequence of competitive binding of SNAP23 to syntaxin 17 in the maturation stage. We propose a model in which ACSL3 redistributes from the endoplasmic reticulum to LDs through association with syntaxin 17 and SNAP23-mediated dissociation from syntaxin 17. We also provide evidence that lipid raft-like structures are important for LD formation and SNAREs-ACSL3 interactions.",

    "abstract": "To ensure disjunction to opposite poles during anaphase, sister chromatids must be held together following DNA replication. This is mediated by cohesin, which is thought to entrap sister DNAs inside a tripartite ring composed of its Smc and kleisin (Scc1) subunits. How such structures are created during S phase is poorly understood, in particular whether they are derived from complexes that had entrapped DNAs prior to replication. To address this, we used selective photobleaching to determine whether cohesin associated with chromatin in G1 persists in situ after replication. We used unlabelled HaloTag ligand following fluorescent labelling to block newly synthesised Halo-tagged Scc1 protein from incorporating fluorescent dye (pulse-chase or pcFRAP). In cells whose cohesin turnover is inactivated by deletion of WAPL, Scc1 remains associated with chromatin throughout S phase. These findings suggest that cohesion might be generated by cohesin that is already bound to unreplicated DNA.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe evolution of cis- and trans-regulatory components of transcription is central to how stress response and tolerance differ across species. However, it remains largely unknown how divergence in TF binding specificity and cis-regulatory sites contribute to the divergence of stress-responsive gene expression between wild and domesticated species.\\n\\nResultsUsing tomato as model, we analyzed the transcriptional profile of wound-responsive genes in wild Solanum pennellii and domesticated S. lycopersicum. We found that extensive expression divergence of wound-responsive genes is associated with speciation. To assess the degree of trans-regulatory divergence between these two species, 342 and 267 putative cis-regulatory elements (pCREs) in S. lycopersicum and S. pennellii, respectively, were identified that were predictive of wound-induced gene expression. We found that 35-66% of pCREs were conserved across species, suggesting that the remaining proportion (34-65%) of pCREs are species specific. This finding indicates a substantially higher degree of trans-regulatory divergence between these two plant species, which diverged [~]3-7 million years ago, compared to that observed in mouse and human, which diverged [~]100 million years ago. In addition, differences in pCRE sites were significantly associated with differences in wound-responsive gene expression between wild and domesticated tomato orthologs, suggesting the presence of substantial cis-regulatory divergence.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study provides new insights into the mechanistic basis of how the transcriptional response to wounding is regulated and, importantly, the contribution of cis- and trans-regulatory components to variation in wound-responsive gene expression during species domestication.",

    "abstract": "Compared to sequence analyses, phylogenetic reconstruction from transposable elements (TEs) offers an additional perspective to study evolutionary processes. However, detecting phylogenetically informative TE insertions requires tedious experimental work, limiting the power of phylogenetic inference. Here, we analyzed the genomes of seven bear species using high throughput sequencing data to detect thousands of TE insertions. The newly developed pipeline for TE detection called TeddyPi (TE detection and discovery for Phylogenetic Inference) obtained 150,513 high-quality TE insertions in the genomes of ursine and tremarctine bears. By integrating different TE insertion callers and using a stringent filtering approach, the TeddyPi pipeline produced highly reliable TE insertion calls, which were confirmed by extensive in vitro validation experiments. Screening for single nucleotide substitutions in the flanking regions of the TEs show that these substitutions correlate with the phylogenetic signal from the TE insertions. Our phylogenomic analyses show that TEs are a major driver of genomic variation in bears and enabled phylogenetic reconstruction of a well-resolved species tree, even with strong signals for incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. The analyses show that the Asiatic black, sun and sloth bear form a monophyletic clade. TeddyPi is open source and can be adapted to various TE and structural variation callers. The pipeline makes it easy to confidently extract thousands of TE insertions even from low coverage genomes of non-model organisms, opening new possibilities for biologists to study phylogenies, evolutionary processes as well as rates and patterns of (retro-)transposition and structural variation.",

    "abstract": "Diversification of the ca. 250,000 extant flowering plant species has been driven in large part by coevolution with animal pollinators. A recurring pattern of pollinator shifts from hummingbird to hawkmoth pollination has characterized plant speciation in many western North American plant taxa, but in the genus Mimulus (monkeyflowers) section Erythranthe the evolution of hawkmoth pollination from hummingbird-pollinated ancestors has not occurred. We manipulated two flower color loci and tested the attractiveness of the resulting four color phenotypes (red, yellow, pink, white) to naive hawkmoths. Hawkmoths strongly prefer derived colors (yellow, pink, white) over the ancestral red, and prefer the two-locus change (white) to either of the single-locus changes (yellow, pink). The simple flower color genetics underlying this innate pollinator preference suggests a potential path for speciation into an unfilled hawkmoth-pollinated niche, and the deliberate design of a hawkmoth-pollinated flower demonstrates a new, predictive method for studying pollination syndrome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Genomic prediction is a useful tool to accelerate genetic gain in selection using DNA marker information. However, this technology usually relies on models that are not designed to accommodate population heterogeneity, which results from differences in marker effects across genetic backgrounds. Previous studies have proposed to cope with population heterogeneity using diverse approaches: (i) either ignoring it, therefore relying on the robustness of standard approaches; (ii) reducing it, by selecting homogenous subsets of individuals in the sample; or (iii) modelling it by using interactive models. In this study we assessed all three possible approaches, applying existing and novel procedures for each of them. All procedures developed are based on deterministic optimizations, can account for heteroscedasticity, and are applicable in contexts of admixed populations. In a case study on a diverse switchgrass sample, we compared the procedures to a control where predictions rely on homogeneous subsamples. Ignoring heterogeneity was often not detrimental, and sometimes beneficial, to prediction accuracy, compared to the control. Reducing heterogeneity did not result in further increases in accuracy. However, in scenarios of limited subsample sizes, a novel procedure, which accounted for redundancy within subsamples, outperformed the existing procedure, which only considered relationships to selection candidates. Modelling heterogeneity resulted in substantial increases in accuracy, in the cases where accounting for population heterogeneity yielded a highly significant improvement in fit. Our study exemplifies advantages and limits of the various approaches that are promising in various contexts of population heterogeneity, e.g. prediction based on historical datasets or dynamic breeding.",

One hypothesis advanced to explain this empirical pattern is genetic confounding, wherein gene-environment correlation (rGE) causes a spurious relationship between father absence and reproductive timing. We test this hypothesis by constructing polygenic scores for age at menarche and first birth using recently available genome wide association study results and molecular genetic data on a sample of non-Hispanic white females from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Young womens accelerated menarche polygenic scores were unrelated to their exposure to father absence. In contrast, earlier first-birth polygenic scores tended to be higher in young women raised in homes with absent fathers. Nevertheless, father absence and the polygenic scores independently and additively predict reproductive timing. We find limited evidence in support of the gene-environment correlation hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Piscirickettsia salmonis is one of the main infectious diseases affecting coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) farming. Current treatments have been ineffective for the control of the disease. Genetic improvement for P. salmonis resistance has been proposed as a feasible alternative for the control of this infectious disease in farmed fish. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) strategies allow genotyping hundreds of individuals with thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which can be used to perform genome wide association studies (GWAS) and predict genetic values using genome-wide information. We used double-digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to dissect the genetic architecture of resistance against P. salmonis in a farmed coho salmon population and identify molecular markers associated with the trait. We also evaluated genomic selection (GS) models in order to determine the potential to accelerate the genetic improvement of this trait by means of using genome-wide molecular information. 764 individuals from 33 full-sib families (17 highly resistant and 16 highly susceptible) which were experimentally challenged against P. salmonis were sequenced using ddRAD sequencing. A total of 4,174 SNP markers were identified in the population. These markers were used to perform a GWAS and testing genomic selection models. One SNP related with iron availability was genome-wide significantly associated with resistance to P. salmonis defined as day of death. Genomic selection models showed similar accuracies and predictive abilities than traditional pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (PBLUP) method.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous viral elements derived from non-retroviral RNA viruses were described in various animal genomes. Whether they have a biological function such as host immune protection against related viruses is a field of intense study. Here, we investigated the repertoire of endogenous flaviviral elements (EFVEs) in Aedes mosquitoes, the vectors of arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya viruses. Previous studies identified three EFVEs from Ae. albopictus and one from Ae. aegypti cell lines. However, in-depth characterization of EFVEs in wild-type mosquito populations and individuals in vivo has not been performed. We detected the full-length DNA sequence of the previously described EFVEs and their respective transcripts in several Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti populations from geographically distinct areas. However, EFVE-derived proteins were not detected by mass spectrometry. Using deep sequencing, we detected the production of piRNA-like small RNAs in antisense orientation, targeting the EFVEs and their flanking regions in vivo. The EFVEs were integrated in repetitive regions of the mosquito genomes, and their flanking sequences varied among mosquito populations from different geographical regions. We bioinformatically predicted several new EFVEs from a Vietnamese Ae. albopictus population and observed variation in the occurrence of those elements among mosquito populations. Phylogenetic analysis of an Ae. aegypti EFVE suggested that it integrated prior to the global expansion of the species and subsequently diverged among and within populations. Together, this study revealed substantial structural and nucleotide diversity of flaviviral integrations in Aedes genomes. Unraveling this diversity will help to elucidate the potential biological function of these EFVEs.\\n\\nImportanceEndogenous viral elements (EVEs) are whole or partial viral sequences integrated in host genomes. Interestingly, some EVEs have important functions for host fitness and antiviral defense. Because mosquitoes also have EVEs in their genomes, we decided to thoroughly characterized them to lay the foundation of the potential use of these EVEs to manipulate the mosquito antiviral response. Here, we focused on EVEs related to the Flavivirus genus, to which dengue and Zika viruses belong, in Aedes mosquito individuals from geographically distinct areas. We showed the existence in vivo of flaviviral EVEs previously identified in mosquito cell lines and we detected new ones. We showed that EVEs have evolved differently in each mosquito population. They produced transcripts and small RNAs, but not proteins, suggesting a function at the RNA level. Our study uncovers the diverse repertoire of flaviviral EVEs in Aedes mosquito populations and suggests a role in the host antiviral system.",

    "abstract": "Actively transcribed genes adopt a unique chromatin environment with characteristic patterns of enrichment. Within gene bodies, H3K36me3 and cytosine DNA methylation are elevated at exons of spliced genes and have been implicated in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. H3K36me3 is further responsive to splicing, wherein splicing inhibition led to a redistribution and general reduction over gene bodies. In contrast, little is known of the mechanisms supporting elevated DNA methylation at actively spliced genic locations. Recent evidence associating the de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3b with H3K36me3-rich chromatin raises the possibility that genic DNA methylation is influenced by splicing-associated H3K36me3. Here, we report the generation of an isogenic resource to test the direct impact of splicing on chromatin. A panel of minigenes of varying splicing potential were integrated into a single FRT site for inducible expression. Profiling of H3K36me3 confirmed the established relationship to splicing, wherein levels were directly correlated with splicing efficiency. In contrast, DNA methylation was equivalently detected across the minigene panel, irrespective of splicing and H3K36me3 status. In addition to revealing a degree of independence between genic H3K36me3 and DNA methylation, these findings highlight the generated minigene panel as a flexible platform for the query of splicing-dependent chromatin modifications.",

    "abstract": "Most preparations for making neural recordings degrade over time and eventually fail due to insertion trauma and reactive tissue response. The magnitudes of these responses are thought to be related to the electrode size (specifically, the cross-sectional area) and the relative stiffness of the electrode material. Carbon fiber ultramicroelectrodes have a much smaller cross-section than traditional electrodes and thus may enable improved longevity of neural recordings in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Only two carbon fiber array designs have been described previously, each with limited channel densities due to limitations of the fabrication processes or interconnect strategies. Here, we describe a method for assembling carbon fiber electrodes on a flexible polyimide substrate that will facilitate the construction of high-density recording and stimulating arrays for acute use in peripheral nerves. Fibers were aligned using an alignment tool that was 3D-printed with sub-micron resolution using direct laser writing. Indium deposition on the carbon fibers provided a robust and reliable method of electrical connection to the polyimide traces. Spontaneous action potentials and stimulation-evoked compound responses with SNR > 10 and > 120, respectively, were recorded from a small (125 m) peripheral nerve. We also improved the typically poor charge injection capacity of small diameter carbon fibers can be improved by electrodepositing 100 nm thick iridium oxide films, making the carbon fiber arrays suitable for electrical stimulation as well as recording.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive control is a construct that refers to the set of functions that enable decisionmaking and task performance through the representation of task states, goals, and rules. The neural correlates of cognitive control have been studied in humans using a wide variety of neuroimaging modalities, including structural MRI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI. The results from each of these modalities independently have implicated the involvement of a number of brain regions in cognitive control, including dorsal prefrontal cortex, and frontal parietal and cingulo-opercular brain networks. However, it is not clear how the results from a single modality relate to results in other modalities. Recent developments in multimodal image analysis methods provide an avenue for answering such questions and could yield more integrated models of the neural correlates of cognitive control. In this study, we used multiset canonical correlation analysis with joint independent component analysis (mCCA+jICA) to identify multimodal patterns of variation related to cognitive control. We used two independent cohorts of participants from the Human Connectome Project, each of which had data from four imaging modalities. We replicated the findings from the first cohort in the second cohort using both independent and predictive analyses. The independent analyses identified a component in each cohort that was highly similar to the other and significantly correlated with cognitive control performance. The replication by prediction analyses identified two independent components that were significantly correlated with cognitive control performance in the first cohort and significantly predictive of performance in the second cohort. These components identified positive relationships across the modalities in neural regions related to both dynamic and stable aspects of task control, including regions in both the frontal-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks, as well as regions hypothesized to be modulated by cognitive control signaling, such as visual cortex. Taken together, these results illustrate the potential utility of multi-modal analyses in identifying the neural correlates of cognitive control across different indicators of brain structure and function.",

The thermoregulatory effects of MDMA and TA may affect intravenous self-administration (IVSA) of MDMA but limited prior reports conflict.\\n\\nObjectiveTo determine how body temperature responses under high and low TA influence MDMA IVSA.\\n\\nMethodsMale Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to IVSA MDMA (1.0 mg/kg/infusion; 2-hr sessions; FR5 schedule of reinforcement) under TA 20{degrees}C or 30{degrees}C. Radiotelemetry transmitters recorded body temperature and activity during IVSA.\\n\\nResultsMDMA intake increased under both TA during acquisition, but to a greater extent in the 30{degrees}C group. The magnitude of hypothermia was initially equivalent between groups but diminished over training in the 30{degrees}C group. Within-session activity was initially lower in the 30{degrees} C group, but by the end of acquisition and maintenance, activity was similar for both groups. When TA conditions were swapped, the hot-trained group increased MDMA IVSA under 20 {degrees}C TA and a modest decrease in drug intake was observed in the cold-trained group under 30 {degrees}C TA. Subsequent non-contingent MDMA (1.0-5.0 mg/kg, i.v.) found that rats with higher MDMA IVSA rates showed blunted hypothermia compared with rats with lower IVSA levels; however, within-session activity did not differ by group. High TA increased intracranial self-stimulation thresholds in a different group of rats and MDMA reduced thresholds below baseline at low, but not high, TA.\\n\\nConclusionsHigh TA appears to enhance acquisition of MDMA IVSA through an aversive effect and not via thermoregulatory motivation.",

    "abstract": "Mosquitoes are prone to dehydration and respond to this stress through multiple mechanisms, but previous studies have examined very specific responses and fail to provide an encompassing view of the role that dehydration has on mosquito biology. This study examined underlying changes in biology of the northern house mosquito, Culex pipiens, associated with short bouts of dehydration. We show that dehydration increased blood feeding propensity of mosquitoes, which was the result of both enhanced activity and a higher tendency to land on a host. Mosquitoes exposed to dehydrating conditions with access to water or rehydrated individuals experience no water loss and failed to display behavioral changes. RNA-seq and metabolome analyses following dehydration indicated that factors associated with energy metabolism are altered, specifically the breakdown of trehalose to yield glucose, which likely underlies changes in mosquito activity. Suppression of trehalose breakdown by RNA interference reduced phenotypes associated with dehydration. Comparable results were noted for two other mosquito species, suggesting this is a general response among mosquitoes. Lastly, field-based mesocosm studies using C. pipiens revealed that dehydrated mosquitoes were more likely to host feed, and disease modeling indicates dehydration bouts may increase transmission of West Nile virus. These results suggest that periods of dehydration prompt mosquitoes to utilize blood feeding as a mechanism to obtain water. This dehydration-induced increase in blood feeding is likely to intensify disease transmission during periods of low water availability.\\n\\nSignificanceDehydration stress has substantial impacts on the biology of terrestrial invertebrates. To date, no studies have elucidated the difference between dehydration exposure and realized water loss in relation to mosquito behavior and physiology. Our experiments show that direct dehydration stress increases mosquito activity and subsequent blood feeding, likely as a mechanism to locate and utilize a bloodmeal for rehydration. These dehydration-induced phenotypes were linked to altered carbohydrate metabolism that acts as a source of energy. This study provides important insight into the impact of mosquito-dehydration dynamics on disease transmission that is likely general among mosquitoes.",

    "abstract": "In gravity below Earth normal, a person should be able to take higher leaps in running. We asked ten subjects to run on a treadmill in five levels of simulated reduced gravity and optically tracked center of mass kinematics. Subjects consistently reduced ballistic height compared to running in normal gravity. We explain this trend by considering the vertical takeoff velocity (defined as maximum vertical velocity). Energetically optimal gaits should balance energetic costs of ground-contact collisions (favouring lower takeoff velocity), and step frequency penalties such as leg swing work (favouring higher takeoff velocity, but less so in reduced gravity). Measured vertical takeoff velocity scaled with the square root of gravitational acceleration, following energetic optimality predictions and explaining why ballistic height decreases in lower gravity. The success of work-based costs in predicting this behaviour challenges the notion that gait adaptation in reduced gravity results from an unloading of the stance phase. Only the relationship between takeoff velocity and swing cost changes in reduced gravity; the energetic cost of the down-to-up transition for a given vertical takeoff velocity does not change with gravity. Because lower gravity allows an elongated swing phase for a given takeoff velocity, the motor control system can relax the vertical momentum change in the stance phase, so reducing ballistic height, without great energetic penalty to leg swing work. While it may seem counterintuitive, using less \\\"bouncy\\\" gaits in reduced gravity is a strategy to reduce energetic costs, to which humans seem extremely sensitive.\\n\\nSummary StatementDuring running, humans take higher leaps in normal gravity than in reduced gravity, in order to optimally balance the competing costs of stance and leg-swing work.",

In the absence of changes in gene expression, we find that single cells demonstrate strong temporal fluctuations. We provide evidence that such signaling noise can arise from at least two sources: (i) stochastic activities of adaptation enzymes, and (ii) receptor-kinase dynamics in the absence of adaptation. We demonstrate that under certain conditions, (ii) can generate giant fluctuations that drive signaling activity of the entire cell into a stochastic two-state switching regime.

    "abstract": "The ability to predict pathways for biosynthesis of metabolites is very important in metabolic engineering. It is possible to mine the repertoire of biochemical transformations from reaction databases, and apply the knowledge to predict reactions to synthesize new molecules. However, this usually involves a careful understanding of the mechanism and the knowledge of the exact bonds being created and broken. There is clearly a need for a method to rapidly predict reactions for synthesizing new molecules, which relies only on the structures of the molecules, without demanding additional information such as thermodynamics or hand-curated information such as atom-atom mapping, which are often hard to obtain accurately.\\n\\nWe here describe a robust method based on subgraph mining, to predict a series of biochemical transformations, which can convert between two (even previously unseen) molecules. We first describe a reliable method based on subgraph edit distance to map reactants and products, using only their chemical structures. Having mapped reactants and products, we identify the reaction centre and its neighbourhood, the reaction signature, and store this in a reaction rule network. This novel representation enables us to rapidly predict pathways, even between previously unseen molecules. We also propose a heuristic that predominantly recovers natural biosynthetic pathways from amongst hundreds of possible alternatives, through a directed search of the reaction rule network, enabling us to provide a reliable ranking of the different pathways. Our approach scales well, even to databases with > 100,000 reactions.

    "abstract": "Cellular networks are intrinsically subject to stochastic fluctuations, but analysis of the resulting noise remained largely limited to gene expression. The pathway controlling chemotaxis of Escherichia coli provides one example where posttranslational signaling noise has been deduced from cellular behavior. This noise was proposed to result from stochasticity in chemoreceptor methylation, and it is believed to enhance environment exploration by bacteria. Here we combined single-cell FRET measurements with analysis based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) to characterize origins of activity fluctuations within the chemotaxis pathway. We observed surprisingly large methylation-independent thermal fluctuations of receptor activity, which contribute to noise comparably to the energy-consuming methylation dynamics. Interactions between clustered receptors involved in amplification of chemotactic signals are also necessary to produce the observed large activity fluctuations. Our work thus shows that the high response sensitivity of this cellular pathway also increases its susceptibility to noise, from thermal and out-of-equilibrium processes.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein is the primary minus-end directed microtubule motor protein in cells. LIS1 is a highly conserved dynein regulatory factor that binds directly to the dynein motor domain, uncoupling the enzymatic and mechanical cycles of the motor, and stalling dynein on the microtubule track. Dynactin, another ubiquitous dynein regulatory factor, acts to release dynein from an autoinhibited state, leading to a dramatic increase in fast, processive dynein motility. How these opposing activities are integrated to control dynein motility is unknown. Here we used fluorescence single-molecule microscopy to study the interaction of LIS1 with the processive dynein-dynactin-BicD2N (DDB) complex. Surprisingly, in contrast to the prevailing model for LIS1 function established in the context of dynein alone, we find that binding of LIS1 to DDB does not strongly disrupt processive motility. Motile DDB complexes bind up to two LIS1 dimers, and mutational analysis suggests LIS1 binds directly to the dynein motor domains during DDB movement. Interestingly, LIS1 enhances DDB velocity in a concentration dependent manner, in contrast to observations of LIS1s effects on the motility of isolated dynein. Thus, LIS1 exerts concentration dependent effects on dynein motility, and can synergize with dynactin to enhance processive movement in the absence of load.",

    "abstract": "During its life cycle, Caulobacter crescentus undergoes a series of coordinated shape changes, including generation of a polar stalk and reshaping of the cell envelope to produce new daughter cells through the process of cytokinesis. The mechanisms by which these morphogenetic processes are coordinated in time and space remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the conserved division complex FtsEX controls both the early and late stages of cytokinesis in C. crescentus, namely initiation of constriction and final cell separation. {Delta}ftsE cells display a striking phenotype: cells are chained, with skinny connections between cell bodies resulting from defects in inner membrane fusion and cell separation. Surprisingly, the thin connections in {Delta}ftsE cells share morphological and molecular features with C. crescentus stalks. Our data uncover unanticipated morphogenetic plasticity in C. crescentus, with loss of FtsE causing a stalk-like program to take over at failed division sites and yield novel cell morphology.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBacterial cell shape is genetically hardwired and is critical for fitness and, in certain cases, pathogenesis. In most bacteria, a semi-rigid structure called the cell wall surrounds the inner membrane, offering protection against cell lysis while simultaneously maintaining cell shape. A highly dynamic macromolecular structure, the cell wall undergoes extensive remodeling as bacterial cells grow and divide. We demonstrate that a broadly conserved cell division complex, FtsEX, relays signals from the cytoplasm to the cell wall to regulate key developmental shape changes in the -proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Consistent with studies in diverse bacteria, we observe strong synthetic interactions between ftsE and cell wall hydrolytic factors, suggesting that regulation of cell wall remodeling is a conserved function of FtsEX. Loss of FtsE causes morphological defects associated with both the early and late stages of division. Intriguingly, without FtsE, cells frequently fail to separate and instead elaborate a thin, tubular structure between cell bodies, a growth mode observed in other -proteobacteria. Overall, our results highlight the plasticity of bacterial cell shape and demonstrate how altering the activity of one morphogenetic program can produce diverse morphologies resembling those of other bacteria in nature.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of sleep is associated with metabolic diseases, and metabolic rate is acutely regulated by sleep-wake behavior. In humans and rodent models, sleep loss is associated with obesity, reduced metabolic rate, and negative energy balance, yet little is known about the neural mechanisms governing interactions between sleep and metabolism. We have developed a system to simultaneously measure sleep and metabolic rate in individual Drosophila, allowing for interrogation of neural systems governing interactions between sleep and metabolic rate. Like mammals, metabolic rate in flies is reduced during sleep and increased during sleep deprivation suggesting sleep-dependent regulation of metabolic rate is conserved across phyla. The reduction of metabolic rate during sleep is not simply a consequence of inactivity because metabolic rate is reduced [~]30 minutes following the onset of sleep, raising the possibility that CO2 production provides a metric to distinguish different sleep states in the fruit fly. To examine the relationship between sleep and metabolism, we determined basal and sleep-dependent changes in metabolic rate is reduced in starved flies, suggesting that starvation inhibits normal sleep-associated effects on metabolic rate. Further, translin mutant flies that fail to suppress sleep during starvation demonstrate a lower basal metabolic rate, but this rate was further reduced in response to starvation, revealing that regulation of starvation-induced changes in metabolic rate and sleep duration are genetically distinct. Therefore, this system provides the unique ability to simultaneously measure sleep and oxidative metabolism, providing novel insight into the physiological changes associated with sleep and wakefulness in the fruit fly.\\n\\nSignificance statementMetabolic disorders are associated with sleep disturbances, yet our understanding of the mechanisms underlying interactions between sleep and metabolism remain limited. Here, we describe a novel system to simultaneously record sleep and metabolic rate in single Drosophila. Our findings reveal that uninterrupted sleep bouts of 30 minutes or greater are associated with a reduction in metabolic rate providing a physiological readout of sleep. Use of this system, combined with existing genetic tools in Drosophila, will facilitate identification of novel sleep genes and neurons, with implications for understanding the relationship between sleep loss and metabolic disease.",
