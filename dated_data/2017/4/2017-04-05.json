    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms for repairing DNA damages and point mutations have been well understood but it remains unclear how a frameshift mutation is repaired. Here we report that frameshift reversion occurs in E. coli more frequently than expected and appears to be a targeted gene repair signaled by premature termination codons (PTCs), producing high-level variations in the repaired genes. Genome resequencing shows that the revertant genome is highly stable, and the single-molecule variations in the repaired genes are derived from RNA editing. A multi-omics analysis shows that the expression levels change greatly in most the DNA and RNA manipulating genes. DNA replication, transcription, RNA editing, RNA degradation, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and homologous recombination were upregulated in the frameshift or revertant, but the base excision repair was not. Moreover, genes and transposons in a duplicate region silenced in wild type E. coli were activated in the frameshift. Finally, we propose a nonsense-mediated gene revising (NMGR) model for frame repair, which also acts as a driving force for molecular evolution. In essence, nonsense mRNAs are recognized, edited, and transported to template the repair of the coding gene by RNA-directed DNA repair, nucleotide excision, mismatch repair, and homologous recombination. Thanks to NMGR, the mutation rate temporarily rises in a frameshift gene, bringing genetic diversity while repairing the frameshift mutation and accelerating the evolution process without a high mutation rate in the genome.",

    "abstract": "The formation of mammalian chromatin domains was investigated by analyzing the domain/isochore connection. This showed that LADs correspond to GC-poor isochores and are compositionally flat, flexible chromatin structures because of the local nucleosome depletions associated with the presence of oligo-As. In contrast, TADs correspond to GC-rich isochores that consist of single or (much more frequently) multiple, GC peaks that shape the single or multiple, loops of TADs. Indeed, the increasing nucleosome depletions linked to the GC gradients of isochore peaks lead to an increasing chromatin flexibility (accompanied by an increasing accessibility and decreasing supercoiling). In conclusion, isochores not only encode but also mold chromatin architecture; while architectural proteins play a role in closing and insulating TAD loops. An extension of this model concerns the encoding of open and closed chromosome compartments by alternating GC-rich and GC-poor isochores, the interactions among compartments defining the 3-D chromosome folding.",

    "abstract": "During the asymmetric division of the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode zygote, the polarity cues distribution and daughter cell fates depend on the correct positioning of the mitotic spindle, which results from both centering and cortical pulling forces. Revealed by anaphase spindle rocking, these pulling forces are regulated by the force generator dynamics, which are in turn consequent of mitotic progression. We found a novel, additional, regulation of these forces by the spindle position. It controls astral microtubule availability at the cortex, on which the active force generators can pull. Importantly, this positional control relies on the polarity dependent LET-99 cortical band, which restricts or concentrates generators to a posterior crescent. After delaying anaphase onset, we detected this positional pulling force regulation in C. elegans as a precocious spindle rocking with respect to anaphase onset. We ascribed this control to the microtubule dynamics at the cortex. Indeed, in mapping the cortical contacts, we found a correlation between the centrosome-cortex distance and the microtubule contact density. In turn, it modulates pulling force generator activity. We modelled this control, predicting and experimentally validating that the posterior crescent extent controlled where the anaphase oscillations started, in addition to mitotic progression. We found in particular that the oscillation onset position resists changes in cellular geometry and moderate variations of active force generator count. Finally, we propose that spatially restricting force generator to a posterior crescent sets the spindles final position, reflecting polarity through the LET-99 dependent restriction of force generators to a posterior crescent. This regulation superimposes that of force generator processivity. This novel control confers a low dependence on microtubule and active force generator exact numbers or dynamics, provided that they exceed the threshold needed for posterior displacement. Interestingly, this robustness originates in cell mechanics rather than biochemical networks.",

    "abstract": "SummaryRegulatory changes are broadly accepted as key drivers of phenotypic divergence. However, identifying regulatory changes that underlie human-specific traits has proven very challenging. Here, we use 63 DNA methylation maps of ancient and present-day humans, as well as of six chimpanzees, to detect differentially methylated regions that emerged in modern humans after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans. We show that genes affecting the face and vocal tract went through particularly extensive methylation changes. Specifically, we identify widespread hypermethylation in a network of face- and voice-affecting genes (SOX9, ACAN, COL2A1, NFIX and XYLT1). We propose that these repression patterns appeared after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans, and that they might have played a key role in shaping the modern human face and vocal tract.View Full Text",

Gene prediction is customarily the starting point for genome analysis. This paper presents a bioinformatics study of the oil palm genome, including a comparative genomics analysis, database and tools development, and mining of biological data for genes of interest. We annotated 26,087 oil palm genes integrated from two gene-prediction pipelines, Fgenesh++ and Seqping. As case studies, we conducted comprehensive investigations on intronless, resistance and fatty acid biosynthesis genes, and demonstrated that the current gene prediction set is of high quality. 3,672 intronless genes were identified in the oil palm genome, an important resource for evolutionary study. Further scrutiny of the oil palm genes revealed 210 candidate resistance genes involved in pathogen defense. Fatty acids have diverse applications ranging from food to industrial feedstock, and we identified 42 key genes involved in fatty-acid biosynthesis in oil palm mesocarp and kernel. These results provide an important resource for studies on plant genomes and a theoretical foundation for marker-assisted breeding of oil palm and related crops.",

    "abstract": "The structure in cortical micro-circuits deviates from what would be expected in a purely random network, which has been seen as evidence of clustering. To address this issue we sought to reproduce the non-random features of cortical circuits by considering several distinct classes of network topology, including clustered networks, networks with distance-dependent connectivity and those with broad degree distributions. To our surprise we found that all these qualitatively distinct topologies could account equally well for all reported non-random features, despite being easily distinguishable from one another at the network level. This apparent paradox was a consequence of estimating network properties given only small sample sizes. In other words, networks which differ markedly in their global structure can look quite similar locally. This makes inferring network structure from small sample sizes, a necessity given the technical difficulty inherent in simultaneous intracellular recordings, problematic. We found that a network statistic called the sample degree correlation (SDC) overcomes this difficulty. The SDC depends only on parameters which can be reliably estimated given small sample sizes, and is an accurate fingerprint of every topological family. We applied the SDC criterion to data from rat visual and somatosensory cortex and discovered that the connectivity was not consistent with any of these main topological classes. However, we were able to fit the experimental data with a more general network class, of which all previous topologies were special cases. The resulting network topology could be interpreted as a combination of physical spatial dependence and non-spatial, hierarchical clustering.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe connectivity of cortical micro-circuits exhibits features which are inconsistent with a simple random network. Here we show that several classes of network models can account for this non-random structure despite qualitative differences in their global properties. This apparent paradox is a consequence of the small numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons in experiment: when inferred via small sample sizes many networks may be indistinguishable, despite being globally distinct. We develop a connectivity measure which successfully classifies networks even when estimated locally, with a few neurons at a time. We show that data from rat cortex is consistent with a network in which the likelihood of a connection between neurons depends on spatial distance and on non-spatial, asymmetric clustering.",

    "abstract": "A gradual buildup of electrical potential over motor areas precedes self-initiated movements. Recently, such \\\"readiness potentials\\\" (RPs) were attributed to stochastic fluctuations in neural activity. We developed a new experimental paradigm that operationalised self-initiated actions as endogenous  skip responses while waiting for target stimuli in a perceptual decision task. We compared these to a block of trials where participants could not choose when to skip, but were instead instructed to skip. Frequency and timing of motor action were therefore balanced across blocks, so that conditions differed only in how the timing of skip decisions was generated. We reasoned that across-trial variability of EEG could carry as much information about the source of skip decisions as the mean RP. EEG variability decreased more markedly prior to self-initiated compared to externally-triggered skip actions. This convergence suggests a consistent preparatory process prior to self-initiated action. A leaky stochastic accumulator model could reproduce this convergence given the additional assumption of a systematic decrease in input noise prior to self-initiated actions. Our results may provide a novel neurophysiological perspective on the topical debate regarding whether self-initiated actions arise from a deterministic neurocognitive process, or from neural stochasticity. We suggest that the key precursor of self-initiated action may manifest as a reduction in neural noise.",

    "abstract": "Growing cells coordinate protein translation with metabolic rates. Central to this coordination is ribosome production. Ribosomes drive cell growth, but translation of ribosomal proteins competes with production of other proteins. Theory shows that cell growth is maximized when all expressed ribosomes are constantly translating. To examine whether budding yeast function at this limit of full ribosomal usage, we profiled the proteomes of cells growing in different environments. We find that cells produce an excess of ribosomal proteins, amounting to a constant {approx}8% of the proteome. Accordingly, {approx}25% of ribosomal proteins expressed in rapidly growing cells do not contribute to translation. This fraction increases as growth rate decreases. These excess ribosomal proteins are employed during nutrient upshift or when forcing unneeded expression. We suggest that steadily growing cells prepare for conditions that demand increased translation by producing excess ribosomes, at the expense of lower steady-state growth rate.",

    "abstract": "Adult mammalian hearts typically have little capacity to regenerate after injuries such as myocardial infarction. In contrast, neonatal mice during the first week of life possess an incredible ability to regenerate their hearts, though this capacity is lost shortly after birth. The physiological triggers mediating this transition remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that sympathetic nerve activity promotes cardiomyocyte cell-cycle arrest and binucleation. In mice hearts lacking sympathetic nerve inputs, we observe increased mononucleated cardiomyocyte numbers and elevated cardiomyocyte proliferation. Additionally, increased cardiomyocyte mononucleation and proliferation are observed in mice with genetic and pharmacological inhibition of {beta}-adrenergic receptors ({beta}ARs), which mediate sympathetic nerve signaling. Using in vitro cultures of neonatal cardiomyocytes, we demonstrate that activation of {beta}-adrenergic receptors results in decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation that is mediated through cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling. Taken together, these results suggest that sympathetic nerve activity may play a role in limiting the ability of mammalian hearts to regenerate by restricting cardiomyocyte proliferation and promoting cytokinesis failure leading to multinucleation.",

SeedVicious finds microRNA canonical sites plus other, less efficient, target sites. The program also detects near-target sites, which have one nucleotide different from a canonical site. Near-target sites are important to study population variation in microRNA regulation. Here I show that near-target sites can also be functional sites.

SeedVicious does not aim to outperform but to complement existing microRNA prediction tools.

The software is written in Perl and runs on 64-bit Unix computers (Linux and MacOS X).

Existing CNV detection methods mostly rely on read depth or alignment characteristics (paired-end distance and split reads) to infer gains/losses, while neglecting allelic intensity ratios and cannot quantify copy numbers. Additionally, most CNV callers are not scalable to handle a large number of WGS samples.\\n\\nMETHODSTo facilitate large-scale and rapid CNV detection from WGS data, we developed a Dynamic Programming Imputation (DPI) based algorithm called HadoopCNV, which infers copy number changes through both allelic frequency and read depth information. Our implementation is built on the Hadoop framework, enabling multiple compute nodes to work in parallel.\\n\\nRESULTSCompared to two widely used tools - CNVnator and LUMPY, HadoopCNV has similar or better performance on both simulated data sets and real data on the NA12878 individual. Additionally, analysis on a 10-member pedigree showed that HadoopCNV has a Mendelian precision that is similar or better than other tools. Furthermore, HadoopCNV can accurately infer loss of heterozygosity (LOH), while other tools cannot. HadoopCNV requires only 1.6 hours for a human genome with 30X coverage, on a 32-node cluster, with a linear relationship between speed improvement and the number of nodes. We further developed a method to combine HadoopCNV and LUMPY result, and demonstrated that the combination resulted in better performance than any individual tools.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThe combination of high-resolution, allele-specific read depth from WGS data and Hadoop framework can result in efficient and accurate detection of CNVs.",

How extracellular agonist binding triggers the activation of GPCRs and associated intracellular effector proteins remains, however, poorly understood. High resolution structural studies have recently revealed that inactive class-A GPCRs harbour a conserved binding site for Na+ ions in the centre of their transmembrane domain, accessible from the extracellular space. Here, we show that the opening of a conserved hydrated channel in the activated state receptors allows the Na+ ion to egress from its binding site into the cytosol. Coupled with protonation changes, this ion movement occurs without significant energy barriers, and can be driven by physiological transmembrane ion and voltage gradients. We propose that Na+ ion exchange with the cytosol is a key step in GPCR activation, which locks receptors in long-lived active-state conformations.",

The first two weeks after birth are particularly dynamic for differential gene expression and AS transitions, and calciumhandling functions are significantly enriched among genes that undergo alternative splicing. We focused on the postnatal splicing transitions of three calcineurin A genes, calcium-dependent phosphatases that regulate multiple aspects of muscle biology. Redirected splicing of calcineurin A to the fetal isoforms in adult muscle and in differentiated C2C12 slows the timing of muscle relaxation, promotes nuclear localization of calcineurin targets Nfatc3 and Nfatc2, and affects expression of Nfatc transcription targets. The results demonstrate a previously unknown specificity of calcineurin isoforms as well as the broader impact of AS during muscle postnatal development.",

    "abstract": "An important problem that hinders the use of supervised classification algorithms for brain imaging is that the number of variables per single subject far exceeds the number of training subjects available. Deriving multivariate measures of variable importance becomes a challenge in such scenarios. This paper proposes a new measure of variable importance termed sign-consistency bagging (SCB). The SCB captures variable importance by analyzing the sign consistency of the corresponding weights in an ensemble of linear support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Further, the SCB variable importances are enhanced by means of transductive conformal analysis. This extra step is important when the data can be assumed to be heterogeneous. Finally, the proposal of these SCB variable importance measures is completed with the derivation of a parametric hypothesis test of variable importance. The new importance measures were compared with a t-test based univariate and an SVM-based multivariate variable importances using anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The obtained results demonstrated that the new SCB based importance measures were superior to the compared methods in terms of reproducibility and classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) plays a crucial role in various aspects of metabolism, as well as in skeletal development. In the course of investigating metabolic defects in the Sik3-deficient mice (Sik3-/-), we observed that circadian rhythmicity of the metabolisms was phase-delayed. Sik3-/- mice also displayed other abnormalities in circadian rhythms, including lengthening of the period, impaired entrainment to the light-dark cycle, phase variation in locomotor activities, and aberrant physiological rhythms. Ex vivo suprachiasmatic nucleus slices from Sik3-/- mice exhibited destabilized and desynchronized molecular rhythms among individual neurons. In cultured cells, Sik3-knockdown resulted in cycle-to-cycle fluctuations of the circadian periodicity. Expression levels of PER2, an essential clock protein, were elevated in Sik3-knockdown cells but down-regulated in Sik3-overexpressing cells, which could be ascribed to a phosphorylation-dependent decrease in PER2 protein stability. Collectively, our results indicate that SIK3 plays key roles in murine circadian rhythms by facilitating phosphorylation-dependent destabilization of PER2.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in experimental techniques have led to a rapid growth in complexity, size, and number of macromolecular structures that are made available through the Protein Data Bank. This creates a challenge for macromolecular visualization and analysis. Macromolecular structure files, such as PDB or PDBx/mmCIF files can be slow to transfer, parse, and hard to incorporate into third-party software tools. Here, we present a new binary and compressed data representation, the MacroMolecular Transmission Format, MMTF, as well as software implementations in several languages that have been developed around it, which address these issues. We describe the new format and its APIs and demonstrate that it is several times faster to parse, and about a quarter of the file size of the current standard format, PDBx/mmCIF. As a consequence of the new data representation, it is now possible to visualize structures with millions of atoms in a web browser, keep the whole PDB archive in memory or parse it within few minutes on average computers, which opens up a new way of thinking how to implement efficient algorithms in structural bioinformatics. The PDB archive is available in MMTF file format through web services and data are updated on a weekly basis.",

By contrast, direct programming can generate similar fates through alternative routes, by directly expressing terminal transcription factors. Yet the cell state transitions defining these new routes are unclear. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare two mouse motor neuron differentiation protocols: a standard protocol approximating the embryonic lineage, and a direct programming method. Both undergo similar early neural commitment. Then, rather than transitioning through spinal intermediates like the standard protocol, the direct programming path diverges into a novel transitional state. This state has specific and abnormal gene expression. It opens a  loop or  worm hole in gene expression that converges separately onto the final motor neuron state of the standard path. Despite their different developmental histories, motor neurons from both protocols structurally, functionally, and transcriptionally resemble motor neurons from embryos.",

This study was aimed at defining the potential distribution and ecological niche of Thelocactus species.\\n\\nMethodsClimatic and environmental variables constraining the distribution of Thelocactus species were identified by means of environmental niche models (ENM) and ordination techniques, and used to generate potential distribution maps. The constructed ENMs were compared to assess the similarities of the ecological niche of Thelocactus species and to know if they share the same ecological niche space.\\n\\nResultsThe distribution of Thelocactus species was mostly limited by a combination of two environmental factors, isothermality and precipitation of wettest quarter. The null hypothesis of the niche equivalency test was rejected for all paired comparisons between all Thelocactus species except between the pair Thelocactus leucacanthus-Thelocactus hastifer. The results of the niche similarity tests were quite varied, for some species pairs the niche similarities were higher than expected by chance, for others the null hypothesis was rejected, while in other species pairs niches were more similar than expected by chance, but only in one direction.\\n\\nMain conclusionsThe differences in habitat requirements were well documented by the significative differences in the niche ecological space as shown by the equivalency test, while the high percentage of niches that were more similar than expected by chance suggest a high degree of niche conservatism among Thelocactus species. The spatial predictions could serve to improve field design sampling to discover new populations, while niche characteristics could be relevant for improving preservation actions and guiding reintroduction programs for a better conservation of Thelocactus species.",

    "abstract": "Recall by genotype (RbG) research involves recruiting participants on the basis of genetic variation. The recent use of this approach in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) has presented an important challenge for ethical conduct: for example, to inform participants of their genetic information and to deviate from existing policies of non-disclosure of results and risk unanticipated harms, or mask the full structure of the study design and miss an opportunity to open a process of disclosure within genotype directed research. Here we report analysis of 53 semi-structured interviews conducted with young adult ALSPAC participants. We found that the deep trust and faith participants developed over their long-term relationship with the study, alongside a naturally limited knowledge of genetics and modest interest in reported research outcomes, meant most reported few immediate concerns about being recruited by genotype. Participants considered themselves part of the ALSPAC team and in this vein identified constructive concerns about being informed of RbG research in recruitment documents as well as what general results would be most valuable and informative. Our findings highlight the importance of solidarity, reciprocity and co-production in biobank/participant relations, especially in long-term birth cohort studies where relationships develop over a lifetime. We argue that strong trusting relationships between study and participant confer great responsibility on researchers regarding duty of care. We make recommendations for conducting RbG research in longitudinal studies beyond those already available in the literature for other study-types.\\n\\nConflict of InterestThe authors declare no conflict of interest.",

    "abstract": "Different methods are available to calculate multi-population genomic relationship matrices. Since those matrices differ in base population, it is anticipated that the method used to calculate the genomic relationship matrix affect the estimate of genetic variances, covariances and correlations. The aim of this paper is to define a multi-population genomic relationship matrix to estimate current genetic variances within and genetic correlations between populations. The genomic relationship matrix containing two populations consists of four blocks, one block for population 1, one block for population 2, and two blocks for relationships between the populations. It is known, based on literature, that current genetic variances are estimated when the current population is used as base population of the relationship matrix. In this paper, we theoretically derived the properties of the genomic relationship matrix to estimate genetic correlations and validated it using simulations. When the scaling factors of the genomic relationship matrix fulfill the property [Formula], the genetic correlation is estimated even though estimated variance components are not necessarily related to the current population. When this property is not met, the correlation based on estimated variance components should be multiplied by [Formula] to rescale the genetic correlation. In this study we present a genomic relationship matrix which directly results in current genetic variances as well as genetic correlations between populations.",

    "abstract": "Chapter 1The rate at which unicellular micro-organisms progress through the cell cycle is a major component of their evolutionary fitness. Measuring fitness phenotypes in a given environment or genetic background forms the basis of most quantitative assays of drug sensitivity or genetic interaction, including genome-wide assays. Growth rate is typically measured in bulk cell populations, inoculated with anything from hundreds to millions of cells sampled from purified, isogenic colonies. High-throughput microscopy reveals that striking levels of growth rate heterogeneity arise between isogenic cell lineages (Levy et al., 2012). Using published Saccharomyces cerevisiae data, I examine the implications for interpreting bulk, population scale growth rate observations, given observed levels of growth rate heterogeneity at the lineage level. I demonstrate that selection between cell lineages with a range of growth rates can give rise to an apparent lag phase at the population level, even in the absence of evidence for a lag phase at the lineage level. My simulations further predict that, given observed levels of heterogeneity, final populations should be dominated by one or a few lineages.\\n\\nChapter 2In order to validate and further explore the conclusions from Chapter 1, I re-analyzed high-throughput microscopy experiments carried out on Quantitative Fitness Analysis (QFA) S. cerevisiae cultures (Addinall et al., 2011), an approach referred to as QFA. To allow for precise observation of purely clonal lineages including very fast-growing lineages and non-dividing cells, I re-designed an existing image analysis tool for QFA, now available as an open source Python package. Fast-growing outliers in particular influence the extent of the lag phase apparent at the population level, making the precision of growth rate estimation a key ingredient for successfully simulating population observations.  QFA data include population observations which I used to validate the population simulations generated from individual lineage data. I explored various options for modeling lineage growth curves and for carrying out growth rate parameter inference, and included the full workflow in an open source R package.\\n\\nContacthelena.herrmann@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdvances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics have made the analysis of microbial communities almost routine. Nonetheless, the need remains to improve on the techniques used for gathering such data, including increasing throughput while lowering cost, and benchmarking the techniques so that potential sources of bias can be better characterized.\\n\\nResultsWe present a triple-index amplicon sequencing strategy that uses a two-stage PCR protocol. The strategy was extensively benchmarked through analysis of a mock community in order to assess biases introduced by sample indexing, number of PCR cycles, and template concentration. We further evaluated the method through re-sequencing of a standardized environmental sample. Finally, we evaluated our protocol on a set of fecal samples from a small cohort of healthy adults, demonstrating good performance in a realistic experimental setting. Between-sample variation was mainly related to batch effects, such as DNA extraction, while sample indexing was also a significant source of bias. PCR cycle number strongly influenced chimera formation and affected relative abundance estimates of species with high GC content. Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq platforms to demonstrate that this protocol is highly scalable to sequence thousands of samples at a very low cost.\\n\\nConclusionsHere, we provide the most comprehensive study of performance and bias inherent to a 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing method to date. Triple-indexing greatly reduces the number of long custom DNA oligos required for library preparation, while the inclusion of variable length heterogeneity spacers minimizes the need for PhiX spike-in. This design results in a significant cost reduction of highly multiplexed amplicon sequencing. The biases we characterize highlight the need for highly standardized protocols. Reassuringly, we find that the biological signal is a far stronger structuring factor than the various sources of bias.",

We found widespread expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), including many with transcript specificity and previously unannotated sequence that were independently replicated. We leveraged this eQTL database to show that 48.1% of risk variants for schizophrenia associated with nearby expression. Within patients and controls, we implemented a novel algorithm for RNA quality adjustment, and identified 237 genes significantly associated with diagnosis that replicated in an independent case-control dataset.

Twelve out of 14 emotions could be reliably classified from the fMRI signals. All emotions engaged a multitude of brain areas, primarily in midline cortices including anterior and posterior cingulate and precuneus, in subcortical regions, and in motor regions including cerebellum and premotor cortex. Similarity of subjective emotional experiences was associated with similarity of the corresponding neural activation patterns. We conclude that the emotions included in the study have discrete neural bases characterized by specific, distributed activation patterns in widespread cortical and subcortical circuits, and highlight both overlaps and differences in the locations of these for each emotion. Locally differentiated engagement of these globally shared circuits defines the unique neural fingerprint activity pattern and the corresponding subjective feeling associated with each emotion.",

    "abstract": "Wood represents a promising source of lignocellulosic biomass for the production of bio-based renewables, especially biofuels. However, woody feedstocks must be improved to become competitive against petroleum. We created a collection of Populus trees consisting of 40 genetically engineered lines to modify and to better understand wood biomass properties. A total of 65 traits were measured in these trees and in the corresponding wild-type clone, including growth parameters, wood anatomical and structural properties, cell wall composition and analytical saccharification. The relationships between saccharification of glucose and biomass traits were investigated using multivariate data analysis methods and mathematical modeling. To circumvent potential trade-offs between biomass production and saccharification potential, we also estimated the \\\"total-wood glucose yield\\\" (TWG) expected after pretreatment and 72h of enzymatic hydrolysis from whole trees. A mathematical model estimated TWG from a subset of 22 wood biomass traits with good predictivity (Q2 = 0.8), while saccharification of glucose could be predicted from seven biomass traits (Q2 = 0.49). Among the seven diagnostic traits for saccharification, four also affected biomass production, such as the ratio of S- to G-lignin which was beneficial for saccharification but detrimental for growth. The contents of various matrix polysaccharides appeared important for predicting both saccharification and TWG, including low abundance monosaccharides. In particular, fucose and mannose contents negatively correlated with TWG, apparently by negatively associating with biomass production. Both biomass production and saccharification, and hence TWG, negatively correlated with arabinose and rhamnose contents, suggesting that these low abundance monosaccharides represent markers/targets for improving feedstocks.",

Here, we established a novel high-performance computing platform to construct large-scale networks from high-throughput sequencing data (>100000 unique antibodies), in order to uncover the architecture of antibody repertoires. We identified three fundamental principles of antibody repertoire architecture across B-cell development: reproducibility, robustness and redundancy. Reproducibility of network structure explains clonal expansion and selection. Robustness ensures a functional immune response even under extensive loss of clones (50%). Redundancy in mutational pathways suggests that there is a pre-programmed evolvability in antibody repertoires. Our analysis provides guidelines for a quantitative network analysis of antibody repertoires, which can be applied to other facets of adaptive immunity (e.g., T cell receptors), and may direct the construction of synthetic repertoires for biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "The first cellular differentiation event in mouse development leads to the formation of the blastocyst consisting of the inner cell mass (ICM) and an outer functional epithelium called trophectoderm (TE). The lineage specific transcription factor CDX2 is required for proper TE specification, where it promotes expression of TE genes, and represses expression of Pou5f1 (OCT4) by inhibiting OCT4 from promoting its own expression. However its downstream network in the developing early embryo is not fully characterized. Here, we performed high-throughput single embryo qPCR analysis in Cdx2 null embryos to identify components of the CDX2-regulated network in vivo. To identify genes likely to be regulated by CDX2 directly, we performed CDX2 ChIP-Seq on trophoblast stem (TS) cells, derived from the TE. In addition, we examined the dynamics of gene expression changes using an inducible CDX2 embryonic stem (ES) cell system, so that we could predict which CDX2-bound genes are activated or repressed by CDX2 binding. By integrating these data with observations of chromatin modifications, we were able to identify novel regulatory elements that are likely to repress gene expression in a lineage-specific manner. Interestingly, we found CDX2 binding sites within regulatory elements of key pluripotent genes such as Pou5f1 and Nanog, pointing to the existence of a novel mechanism by which CDX2 maintains repression of OCT4 in trophoblast. Our study proposes a general mechanism in regulating lineage segregation during mammalian development.",

    "abstract": "We accurately perceive the visual scene despite moving our eyes ~3 times per second, an ability that requires incorporation of eye position and retinal information. We assessed how this neural computation unfolds across three interconnected structures: frontal eye fields (FEF), intraparietal cortex (LIP/MIP), and the superior colliculus (SC). Single unit activity was assessed in head-restrained monkeys performing visually-guided saccades from different initial fixations. As previously shown, the receptive fields of most LIP/MIP neurons shifted to novel positions on the retina for each eye position, and these locations were not clearly related to each other in either eye- or head-centered coordinates (hybrid coordinates). In contrast, the receptive fields of most SC neurons were stable in eye-centered coordinates. In FEF, visual signals were intermediate between those patterns: around 60% were eye-centered, whereas the remainder showed changes in receptive field location, boundaries, or responsiveness that rendered the response patterns hybrid or occasionally head-centered. These results suggest that FEF may act as a transitional step in an evolution of coordinates between LIP/MIP and SC. The persistence across cortical areas of hybrid representations that do not provide unequivocal location labels in a consistent reference frame has implications for how these representations must be read-out.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyHow we perceive the world as stable using mobile retinas is poorly understood. We compared the stability of visual receptive fields across different fixation positions in three visuomotor regions. Irregular changes in receptive field position were ubiquitous in intraparietal cortex, evident but less common in the frontal eye fields, and negligible in the superior colliculus (SC), where receptive fields shifted reliably across fixations. Only the SC provides a stable labelled-line code for stimuli across saccades.",

    "abstract": "Fractal analysis represents a promising new approach to structural neuroimaging data, yet systematic evaluation of the fractal dimension (FD) as a marker of structural brain complexity is scarce. Here we present in-depth methodological assessment of FD estimation in structural brain MRI. On the computational side, we show that spatial scale optimization can significantly improve FD estimation accuracy, as suggested by simulation studies with known FD values. For empirical evaluation, we analyzed two recent open-access neuroimaging data sets (MASSIVE and Midnight Scan Club), stratified by fundamental image characteristics including registration, sequence weighting, spatial resolution, segmentation procedures, tissue type, and image complexity. Deviation analyses showed high repeated-acquisition stability of the FD estimates across both data sets, with differential deviation susceptibility according to image characteristics. While less frequently studied in the literature, FD estimation in T2-weighted images yielded robust outcomes. Importantly, we observed a significant impact of image registration on absolute FD estimates. Applying different registration schemes, we found that unbalanced registration induced i) repeated-measurement deviation clusters around the registration target, ii) strong bidirectional correlations among image analysis groups, and iii) spurious associations between the FD and an index of structural similarity, and these effects were strongly attenuated by reregistration in both data sets. Indeed, differences in FD between scans did not simply track differences in structure per se, suggesting that structural complexity and structural similarity represent distinct aspects of structural brain MRI. In conclusion, scale optimization can improve FD estimation accuracy, and empirical FD estimates are reliable yet sensitive to image characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Measurement of gene expression levels for multiple genes in single cells provides a powerful approach to study heterogeneity of cell populations and cellular plasticity. While the expression levels of multiple genes in each cell are available in such data, the potential connections among the cells (e.g. the cellular state transition relationship) are not directly evident from the measurement. Classifying the cellular states, identifying their transitions among those states, and extracting the pseudotime ordering of cells are challenging due to the noise in the data and the high-dimensionality in the number of genes in the data. In this paper we adapt the classical self-organizing-map (SOM) approach for single-cell gene expression data (SOMSC), such as those based on single cell qPCR and single cell RNA-seq. In SOMSC, a cellular state map (CSM) is derived and employed to identify cellular states inherited in the population of the measured single cells. Cells located in the same basin of the CSM are considered as in one cellular state while barriers among the basins in CSM provide information on transitions among the cellular states. A cellular state transitions path (e.g. differentiation) and a temporal ordering of the measured single cells are consequently obtained. In addition, SOMSC could estimate the cellular state replication probability and transition probabilities. Applied to a set of synthetic data, one single-cell qPCR data set on mouse early embryonic development and two single-cell RNA-seq data sets, SOMSC shows effectiveness in capturing cellular states and their transitions presented in the high-dimensional single-cell data. This approach will have broader applications to analyzing cellular fate specification and cell lineages using single cell gene expression data",

Ageing in human populations is marked by a highly constrained, log-linear acceleration of the probability of mortality with age4. This acceleration determines the onset and duration of human morbidity5 and the upper limits of human life. Recent studies have revealed remarkable taxonomic diversity in mortality-derived ageing rates1,3. However, the extent of intraspecific variation in ageing rates is assumed to be negligible2.

    "abstract": "We respond to claims by Dong et al. that human lifespan is limited below 125 years. Using the log-linear increase in mortality rates with age to predict the upper limits of human survival we find, in contrast to Dong et al., that the limit to human lifespan is historically flexible and increasing. This discrepancy can be explained by Dong et al.s use of data with variable sample sizes, age-biased rounding errors, and log(0) instead of log(1) values in linear regressions. Addressing these issues eliminates the proposed 125-year upper limit to human lifespan.",
