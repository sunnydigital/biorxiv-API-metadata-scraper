    "abstract": "While bacteria divide clonally, horizontal gene transfer followed by homologous recombination is now recognized as an important and sometimes even dominant contributor to their evolution. However, the details of how the competition between clonal inheritance and recombination shapes genome diversity, population structure, and species stability remains poorly understood. Using a computational model, we find two principal regimes in bacterial evolution and identify two composite parameters that dictate the evolutionary fate of bacterial species. In the divergent regime, characterized by either a low recombination frequency or strict barriers to recombination, cohesion due to recombination is not sufficient to overcome the mutational drift. As a consequence, the divergence between any pair of genomes in the population steadily increases in the course of their evolution. The species as a whole lacks genetic coherence with sexually isolated clonal sub-populations continuously formed and dissolved. In contrast, in the metastable regime, characterized by a high recombination frequency combined with low barriers to recombination, genomes continuously recombine with the rest of the population. The population remains genetically cohesive and stable over time. The transition between these two regimes can be affected by relatively small changes in evolutionary parameters. Using the Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) data we classify a number of well-studied bacterial species to be either the divergent or the metastable type. Generalizations of our framework to include fitness and selection, ecologically structured populations, and horizontal gene transfer of non-homologous regions are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Brain Computer Interface (BCI), a direct pathway between the human brain and computer, is one of the most pragmatic applications of EEG signal. The electroencephalograph (EEG) signal is one of the monitoring techniques to observe brain functionality. Mental Task Classification (MTC) based on EEG signals is a demanding BCI. Success of BCI system depends on the efficient analysis of these signals. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a filter based heuristic technique which is utilized to analyze EEG signal in recent past. There are several variants of EMD algorithms which have their own merits and demerits. In this paper, we have explored three variants of EMD algorithms named Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) on EEG data for MTC-based BCI. Features are extracted from EEG signal in two phases; in the first phase, the signal is decomposed into different oscillatory functions with the help of different EMD algorithms and eight different parameters (features) are calculated for each function for compact representation in the second phase. These features are fed into Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify the different mental tasks. We have formulated two different types of MTC, the first one is binary and second one is multi-MTC. The proposed work outperforms the existing work for both binary and multi mental tasks classification.",

We thoroughly evaluate the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate that the higher order information captured by PIDC allows it to outperform pairwise mutual information-based algorithms when recovering true relationships present in simulated data. We also infer gene regulatory networks from three experimental single-cell data sets and illustrate how network context, choices made during analysis, and sources of variability affect network inference.

    "abstract": "Summary paragraphOrganismal traits may evolve either gradually or in rapid pulses followed by periods of stasis, but the relative importance of these evolutionary models in generating biodiversity has proven difficult to resolve1,2. In addition, while it is often assumed that pulses of trait evolution are associated with speciation events, few studies have explicitly examined how the tempo of trait divergence varies with respect to different geographical phases of speciation. Thus, we still know little about the trajectories of trait divergence over timescales relevant to speciation, or the extent to which these trajectories are shaped by variation in geographical isolation and overlap (sympatry) among incipient species. Here, we combine divergence time estimates, trait measurements, and geographic range data for avian sister species pairs worldwide to examine the tempo and timing of trait divergence during allopatric speciation. We show that divergence in two important ecological traits--?body mass and beak morphology--is best explained by a model including pulses of divergence and periods of relative stasis. We also infer that trait divergence pulses often precede sympatry, and that pulses leading to greater trait disparity are associated with earlier transitions to sympatry. These findings suggest that early pulses of trait divergence promote subsequent transitions to sympatry, rather than such pulses occurring after sympatry has been established, for example via character displacement3. Incorporating pulsed divergence models into allopatric speciation theory helps to resolve some apparently contradictory observations, including widespread instances of both rapid sympatry and prolonged geographical exclusion4-6.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence of a \\\"set-point\\\" for body weight in the brain, that is regulated by the hypothalamus. This system modifies feeding behavior and metabolic rate, to keep body fat within predetermined parameters. It is also known that animals subjected to chronic centrifugation show a reduction in body fat. Experiments with mutant mice found that this loss of fat appears to be mediated by a vestibulo-hypothalamic pathway. Vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS), also known as galvanic vestibular stimulation, involves non-invasively stimulating the vestibular system by applying a small electrical current between two electrodes placed over the mastoid processes. We suggest that any means of repeatedly stimulating the otolith organs in humans would cause a reduction in total body fat, and that VeNS would be a useful technique to use in this regard.

    "abstract": "The multispecies network coalescent (MSNC) is a stochastic process that captures how gene trees grow within the branches of a phylogenetic network. Coupling the MSNC with a stochastic mutational process that operates along the branches of the gene trees gives rise to a generative model of how multiple loci from within and across species evolve in the presence of both incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and reticulation (e.g., hybridization). We report on a Bayesian method for sampling the parameters of this generative model, including the species phylogeny, gene trees, divergence times, and population sizes, from DNA sequences of multiple independent loci. We demonstrate the utility of our method by analyzing simulated data and reanalyzing three biological data sets. Our results demonstrate the significance of not only co-estimating species phylogenies and gene trees, but also accounting for reticulation and ILS simultaneously. In particular, we show that when gene flow occurs, our method accurately estimates the evolutionary histories, coalescence times, and divergence times. Tree inference methods, on the other hand, underestimate divergence times and overestimate coalescence times when the evolutionary history is reticulate. While the MSNC corresponds to an abstract model of \\\"intermixture,\\\" we study the performance of the model and method on simulated data generated under a gene flow model. We show that the method accurately infers the most recent time at which gene flow occurs. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the new method to a 106-locus yeast data set.

    "abstract": "Cellular metabolism is regulated by enzyme complexes within the mitochondrion, the function of which are sensitive to the prevailing temperature. Such thermal sensitivity, coupled with the observation that population frequencies of mitochondrial haplotypes tend to associate with latitude, altitude or climatic regions across species distributions, led to the hypothesis that thermal selection has played a role in shaping standing variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence. This hypothesis, however, remains controversial, and requires evidence that the distribution of haplotypes observed in nature corresponds with the capacity of these haplotypes to confer differences in thermal tolerance. Specifically, haplotypes predominating in tropical climates are predicted to encode increased tolerance to heat stress, but decreased tolerance to cold stress. We present direct evidence for these predictions, using mtDNA haplotypes sampled from the Australian distribution of Drosophila melanogaster. We show that the ability of flies to tolerate extreme thermal challenges is affected by sequence variation across mtDNA haplotypes, and that the thermal performance associated with each haplotype corresponds with its latitudinal prevalence. The haplotype that predominates at low (subtropical) latitudes confers greater resilience to heat stress, but lower resilience to cold stress, than haplotypes predominating at higher (temperate) latitudes. We explore molecular mechanisms that might underlie these responses, presenting evidence that the effects are in part regulated by SNPs that do not change the protein sequence. Our findings suggest that standing variation in the mitochondrial genome can be shaped by thermal selection, and could therefore contribute to evolutionary adaptation under climatic stress.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (<http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100022>). Understanding Ebola Virus (EBOV) virulence evolution is not only timely but also raises specific questions because it causes one of the most virulent human infections and it is capable of transmission after the death of its host. Using a compartmental epidemiological model that captures three transmission routes (by regular contact, via dead bodies and by sexual contact), we infer the evolutionary dynamics of case fatality ratio (CFR) on the scale of an outbreak and on the long term. Our major finding is that the viruss specific life cycle imposes selection for high levels of virulence and that this pattern is robust to parameter variations in biological ranges. In addition to shedding a new light on the ultimate causes of EBOVs high virulence, these results generate testable predictions and contribute to informing public health policies. In particular, burial management stands out as the most appropriate intervention since it decreases the R0 of the epidemics, while imposing selection for less virulent strains.\\n\\nImpact SummaryThe severe haemorrhagic fever caused by Ebola Virus (EBOV) usually kills more than one infected individual out of two in the absence of treatment, which makes this pathogen one of the most virulent known to humans. The recent outbreak in West Africa (2013-2016) revealed that the virus is able to spread and persist for months across countries. It is often thought that virulence could be due to the fact that the virus is adapted to its reservoir host. Given that microbes evolve rapidly, it is important to determine whether EBOV virulence is likely to decrease as the virus adapts to its human host. To address this problem, we developed a novel mathematical model tailored to EBOVs life cycle, notably by capturing its three main transmission routes (by regular contact, sexual contact and via dead bodies). We investigated the evolutionary trends of EBOVs virulence on different time scales (outbreak initiation, short term and long term). Our results reveal that the virulence of EBOV might not be due to the maladaptation of the virus, but could rather originate from its unique life cycle. These results are robust to the parameter values chosen. From a public health perspective, burial management stands out as the main leverage to fight the virulence of EBOV, both on the short and long terms.",

    "abstract": "The skyline plot is a graphical representation of historical effective population sizes as a function of time. Past population sizes for these plots are estimated from genetic data, without a priori assumptions on the mathematical function defining the shape of the demographic trajectory. Because of this flexibility in shape, skyline plots can, in principle, provide realistic descriptions of the complex demographic scenarios that occur in natural populations. Currently, demographic estimates needed for skyline plots are estimated using coalescent samplers or a composite likelihood approach. Here, we provide a way to estimate historical effective population sizes using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework. We assess its performance using simulated and actual microsatellite datasets. Our method correctly retrieves the signal of contracting, constant and expanding populations, although the graphical shape of the plot is not always an accurate representation of the true demographic trajectory, particularly for recent changes in size and contracting populations. Because of the flexibility of ABC, similar approaches can be extended to other types of data, to multiple populations, or to other parameters that can change through time, such as the migration rate.",

    "abstract": "Environmental perturbations have large effects on both organismal and cellular traits, including gene expression, but the extent to which the environment affects RNA processing remains largely uncharacterized. Recent studies have identified a large number of genetic variants associated with variation in RNA processing that also have an important role in complex traits; yet we do not know in which contexts the different underlying isoforms are used. Here, we comprehensively characterized changes in RNA processing events across 89 environments in five human cell types and identified 15,300 event shifts (FDR = 15%) comprised of eight event types in over 4,000 genes. Many of these changes occur consistently in the same direction across conditions, indicative of global regulation by trans factors. Accordingly, we demonstrate that environmental modulation of splicing factor binding predicts shifts in intron retention, and that binding of transcription factors predicts shifts in AFE usage in response to specific treatments. We validated the mechanism hypothesized for AFE in two independent datasets. Using ATAC-seq, we found altered binding of 64 factors in response to selenium at sites of AFE shift, including ELF2 and other factors in the ETS family. We also performed AFE QTL mapping in 373 individuals and found an enrichment for SNPs predicted to disrupt binding of the ELF2 factor. Together, these results demonstrate that RNA processing is dramatically changed in response to environmental perturbations through specific mechanisms regulated by trans factors.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryChanges in a cells environment and genetic variation have been shown to impact gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that environmental perturbations also lead to extensive changes in alternative RNA processing across a large number of cellular environments that we investigated. These changes often occur in a non-random manner. For example, many treatments lead to increased intron retention and usage of the downstream first exon. We also show that the changes to first exon usage are likely dependent on changes in transcription factor binding. We provide support for this hypothesis by considering how first exon usage is affected by disruption of binding due to treatment with selenium. We further validate the role of a specific factor by considering the effect of genetic variation in its binding sites on first exon usage. These results help to shed light on the vast number of changes that occur in response to environmental stimuli and will likely aid in understanding the impact of compounds to which we are daily exposed.",

We found that the population response was composed of a diversity of phasic modulations covering the entire sequence. The accuracy of kinematics encoding by single neurons was around chance level but improved when neuronal ensembles were considered. The distribution of single-neuron contributions to ensemble encoding was highly skewed with a minority of neurons responsible for most of the encoding accuracy.

Most analyses, however, consider only the marginal eQTL signal, rather than dissecting this signal into multiple independent eQTL for each gene. Here we show that analyzing conditional eQTL signatures, which could be important under specific cellular or temporal contexts, leads to improved fine mapping of GWAS associations. Using genotypes and gene expression levels from post-mortem human brain samples (N=467) reported by the CommonMind Consortium (CMC), we find that conditional eQTL are widespread; 63% of genes with primary eQTL also have conditional eQTL. In addition, genomic features associated with conditional eQTL are consistent with context specific (i.e. tissue, cell type, or developmental time point specific) regulation of gene expression. Integrating the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia (SCZ) GWAS and CMC conditional eQTL data reveals forty loci with strong evidence for co-localization (posterior probability >0.8), including six loci with co-localization of conditional eQTL.

    "abstract": "Butterflies have evolved different color patterns on their dorsal and ventral wing surfaces to serve different signaling functions, yet the developmental mechanisms controlling surface-specific patterning are still unknown. Here, we mutate both copies of the transcription factor apterous in Bicyclus anynana butterflies using CRISPR/Cas9 and show that apterous A functions both as a repressor and modifier of ventral wing color patterns, as well as a promoter of dorsal sexual ornaments in males. We propose that the surface-specific diversification of wing patterns in butterflies proceeded via the co-option of apterous A into various gene regulatory networks involved in the differentiation of discrete wing traits. Further, interactions between apterous and sex-specific factors such as doublesex may have contributed to the origin of sexually dimorphic surface-specific patterns. Finally, we discuss the evolution of eyespot pattern diversity in the family Nymphalidae within the context of developmental constraints due to apterous regulation.\\n\\nSignificance statementButterflies have evolved different wing patterns on their dorsal and ventral wing surfaces that serve different signaling functions. We identify the transcription factor, apterous A, as a key regulator of this surface-specific differentiation in butterflies. We also show a role for apterous A in restricting the developmental origin of a novel trait, eyespots, to just the ventral wing surface. Dorsal-ventral differentiation of tissues is not just restricted to butterfly wings but occurs in many other organs and organisms from arthropods to humans. Thus, we believe that our work will be of interest to a diverse group of biologists and layman alike interested in the role of development in shaping biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Insects rely on chemical information to locate food, choose mates, and detect potential predators. It has been hypothesized that adaptive changes in the olfactory system facilitated the diversification of numerous insect lineages. For instance, evolutionary changes of Odorant Receptor (OR) genes often occur in parallel with modifications in life history strategies. Corbiculate bees display a diverse array of behaviors that are controlled through olfaction, including varying degrees of social organization, and manifold associations with floral resources. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms driving the evolution of the OR gene family in corbiculate bees in comparison to other chemosensory gene families. Our results indicate that the genomic organization of the OR gene family has remained highly conserved for approximately 80 million years, despite exhibiting major changes in repertoire size among bee lineages. Moreover, the evolution of OR genes appears to be driven mostly by lineage-specific gene duplications in few genomic regions that harbor large numbers of OR genes. A selection analysis revealed that OR genes evolve under positive selection, with the strongest signals detected in recently duplicated copies. Our results indicate that chromosomal translocations had a minimal impact on OR evolution, and instead local molecular mechanisms appear to be main drivers of OR repertoire size. Our results provide empirical support to the longstanding hypothesis that positive selection shaped the diversification of the OR gene family. Together, our results shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of olfaction in insects.",

    "abstract": "(E)-2-benzylidene-3-(cyclohexylamino)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one (BCI) is known as a dual specific phosphatase 1/6 or MAPK inhibitor. However, its precise anti-lung cancer mechanism remains unknown. In this study, the effects of BCI on cell viability were investigated in the non-small cell lung cancer cell lines NCI-H1299, A549, and NCI-H460. We confirmed that BCI significantly inhibited the cell viability of NCI-H1299 compared to those of NCI-H460 and A549 cells. The anti-cancer effects of BCI were evaluated by MTS assay, annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining, cell cycle analysis, reverse transcription-PCR, western blotting, and JC-1 staining in NCI-H1299 cells. BCI induced cellular morphological changes and inhibited viability of NCI-H1299 cells in a dose-dependent manner. BCI enhanced Bax expression and induced processing of caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase as well as the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. BCI also down-regulated Bcl-2 expression but enhanced Bax expression in a dose-dependent manner in NCI-H1299 cells. In addition, BCI did not modulate death receptor expression or the extrinsic factor caspase-8 and Bid, a linker between the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in NCI-H1299 cells. On the basis of these results, we conclude that BCI induces apoptosis through a mediated intrinsic pathway, but not extrinsic pathway in NCI-H1299 cells. These results suggest that BCI can be used as a therapeutic agent in lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "Tears covering the ocular surface is an important bio-fluid containing thousands of molecules, including proteins, lipids, metabolites, nucleic acids, and electrolytes. Tears are valuable resources for biomarker research of ocular and even systemic diseases. For application in biomarker studies, tear samples should ideally be stored using a simple, low-cost, and efficient method along with the patients medical records. For this purpose, we developed a novel Schirmers strip-based dry method that allows for storage of tear samples in vacuum bags at room temperature. Using this method, tear protein patterns can also be preserved. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis of proteins recovered from the dry method and traditional wet method showed no significant difference. Some tissue/organ enriched proteins were identified in tear, thus tear might be a good window for monitoring the change of these tissues or organs. This dry method facilitates sample transportation and enables the storage of tear samples on a large scale, increasing the availability of samples for studying disease biomarkers in tears.",

    "abstract": "A framework that formulates haplotype assembly as sparse tensor decomposition is proposed. The problem is cast as that of decomposing a tensor having special structural constraints and missing a large fraction of its entries into a product of two factors, U and [Formula]; tensor [Formula] reveals haplotype information while U is a sparse matrix encoding the origin of erroneous sequencing reads. An algorithm, AltHap, which reconstructs haplotypes of either diploid or poly-ploid organisms by solving this decomposition problem is proposed. Starting from a judiciously selected initial point, AltHap alternates between two optimization tasks to recover U and [Formula] by relying on a modified gradient descent search that exploits salient structural properties of U and [Formula]. The performance and convergence properties of AltHap are theoretically analyzed and, in doing so, guarantees on the achievable minimum error correction scores and correct phasing rate are established. AltHap was tested in a number of different scenarios and was shown to compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods in applications to haplotype assembly of diploids, and significantly outperform existing techniques when applied to haplotype assembly of polyploids.",

    "abstract": "We introduce GATTACA, a framework for rapid and accurate binning of metagenomic contigs from a single or multiple metagenomic samples into clusters associated with individual species. The clusters are computed using co-abundance profiles within a set of reference metagnomes; unlike previous methods, GATTACA estimates these profiles from k-mer counts stored in a highly compact index. On multiple synthetic and real benchmark datasets, GATTACA produces clusters that correspond to distinct bacterial species with an accuracy that matches earlier methods, while being up to 20x faster when the reference panel index can be computed offline and 6x faster for online co-abundance estimation. Leveraging the MinHash technique to quickly compare metagenomic samples, GATTACA also provides an efficient way to identify publicly-available metagenomic data that can be incorporated into the set of reference metagenomes to further improve binning accuracy. Thus, enabling easy indexing and reuse of publicly-available metagenomic datasets, GATTACA makes accurate metagenomic analyses accessible to a much wider range of researchers.",

    "abstract": "Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a mutagen and IARC Group 1 carcinogen that causes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we present the first whole genome data on the mutational signatures of AFB1 exposure from a total of > 40,000 mutations in four experimental systems: two different human cell lines, and in liver tumors in wild-type mice and in mice that carried a hepatitis B surface antigen transgene - this to model the multiplicative effects of aflatoxin exposure and hepatitis B in causing HCC. AFB1 mutational signatures from all four experimental systems were remarkably similar. We integrated the experimental mutational signatures with data from newly-sequenced HCCs from Qidong County, China, a region of well-studied aflatoxin exposure. This indicated that COSMIC mutational signature 24, previously hypothesized to stem from aflatoxin exposure, indeed likely represents AFB1 exposure, possibly combined with other exposures. Among published somatic mutation data, we found evidence of AFB1 exposure in 0.7% of HCCs treated in North America, 1% of HCCs from Japan, but 16% of HCCs from Hong Kong. Thus, aflatoxin exposure apparently remains a substantial public health issue in some areas. This aspect of our study exemplifies the promise of future widespread resequencing of tumor genomes in providing new insights into the contribution of mutagenic exposures to cancer incidence.",

This process is controlled at transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic levels and non-coding RNAs are contributors to this regulation complexity. Here we identify a molecular cascade initiated by a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), Ephemeron (Epn), that modulates the dynamics of exit from naive pluripotency. Epn deletion delays the extinction of ESC identity, an effect mediated by perduring expression of the pivotal transcription factor Nanog. In the absence of Epn, Lin28a expression is reduced, resulting in an elevated level of Mirlet7g that suppresses de novo methyltransferases Dnmt3a/b. Dnmt3a/b deletion also retards exit from the ESC state, and is associated with delayed promoter methylation and slower down-regulation of Nanog. Altogether, our findings reveal a lncRNA/miRNA/DNA methylation axis that facilitates a timely stem cell state transition.",

    "abstract": "Plants often grow in clusters of various sizes and have a variable number of flowers per inflorescence. This small-scale spatial clustering affects insect foraging strategies and plant reproductive success. In our study, we aimed to determine how visitation rate and foraging behaviour of pollinators depend on the number of flowers per plant and on the size of clusters of multiple plants using Dracocephalum moldavica (Lamiaceae) as a target species. We measured flower visitation rate by observations of insects visiting single plants and clusters of plants with different numbers of flowers. Detailed data on foraging behaviour within clusters of different sizes were gathered for honeybees, Apis mellifera, the most abundant visitor of Dracocephalum in the experiments. We found that the total number of flower visitors increased with the increasing number of flowers on individual plants and in larger clusters, but less then proportionally. Although individual honeybees visited more flowers in larger clusters, they visited a smaller proportion of flowers, as has been previously observed. Consequently, visitation rate per flower and unit time peaked in clusters with an intermediate number of flowers. These patterns do not conform to expectations based on optimal foraging theory and the ideal free distribution model. We attribute this discrepancy to incomplete information about the distribution of resources. Detailed observations and video recordings of individual honeybees also showed that the number of flowers had no effect on handling time of flowers by honeybees. We evaluated the implications of these patterns for insect foraging biology and plant reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Estimating population size and resource selection functions (RSFs) are common approaches in applied ecology for addressing wildlife conservation and management objectives. Traditionally such approaches have been undertaken separately with different sources of data. Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) provides a framework for jointly estimating density and multi-scale resource selection, and data integration techniques provide opportunities for improving inferences from SCR models. Here we illustrate an application of integrated SCR-RSF modeling to a population of American marten (Martes americana) in alpine forests of northern New England. Spatial encounter data from camera traps were combined with telemetry locations from radio-collared individuals to examine how density and space use varied with spatial environmental features. We compared multi-model inferences between the integrated SCR-RSF model with telemetry and a standard SCR model with no telemetry. The integrated SCR-RSF model supported more complex relationships with spatial variation in third-order resource selection (i.e., individual space use), including selection for areas with shorter distances to mixed coniferous forest and rugged terrain. Both models indicated increased second-order selection (i.e., density) for areas close to mixed coniferous forest, while the integrated SCR-RSF model had a lower effect size due to modulation from spatial variability in space use. Our application of the integrated SCR-RSF model illustrates the improved inferences from spatial encounter data that can be achieved from integrating auxiliary telemetry data. Integrated modeling allows ecologists to join empirical data to ecological theory using a robust quantitative framework to better address conservation and management objectives.",

    "abstract": "The abundance of species is a fundamental consideration in ecology and conservation biology. Although broad models have been proposed to estimate the population abundance using existing data, available data is often limited. With no information available, a population estimation will rely on time consuming field surveys. Typically, time is a critical constraint in conservation and often management decisions must be made quickly under the data limited situation. Depending on time and budgetary constraints, the required accuracy of field survey changes significantly. Hence, it is desirable to set up an effective survey design to minimize time and effort of sampling given required accuracy. We examine a spatially-explicit approach to population estimation using spatial point processes, enabling us to explicitly and consistently discuss various sampling designs. We find that the accuracy of abundance estimation varies with both ecological factors and survey design. Although the spatial scale of sampling does not affect estimation accuracy when the underlying individual distribution is random, it decreases with the sampled unit size if individuals tend to form clusters. These results are derived analytically and checked numerically. Obtained insights provide a benchmark to predict the quality of population estimation, and improve survey designs for ecological studies and conservation.",

    "abstract": "The selective impact of pathogen epidemics on host defenses can be strong but remains transient. By contrast, life-history shifts can durably and continuously modify the balance between costs and benefits of immunity, which arbitrates the evolution of host defenses. Their impact on the evolutionary dynamics of host immunity, however, has seldom been documented. Optimal investment into immunity is expected to decrease with shortening lifespan, because a shorter life decreases the probability to encounter pathogens or enemies. Here, we document that in natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana, the expression levels of immunity genes correlate positively with flowering time, which in annual species is a proxy for lifespan. Using a novel genetic strategy based on bulk-segregants, we partitioned flowering time-dependent from - independent immunity genes and could demonstrate that this positive co-variation can be genetically separated. It is therefore not explained by the pleiotropic action of some major regulatory genes controlling both immunity and lifespan. Moreover, we find that immunity genes containing variants reported to impact fitness in natural field conditions are among the genes whose expression co-varies most strongly with flowering time. Taken together, these analyses reveal that natural selection has likely assorted alleles promoting lower expression of immunity genes with alleles that decrease the duration of vegetative lifespan in A. thaliana and vice versa. This is the first study documenting a pattern of variation consistent with the impact that selection on flowering time is predicted to have on diversity in host immunity.",

Past DNA studies, however, have produced different accounts. With a better understanding of genetic diversity, we have now reinterpreted public DNA data. Consistent with our recent finding of a close relationship between South Pacific populations and Denisovans or Neanderthals who were archaic Africans with Eurasian admixtures, the [~]9500 year old Kennewick Man skeleton with Australo-Melanesian affinity from North America was about equally related to Europeans and Africans, least related to East Asians among present-day people, and most related to the [~]42000 year old Neanderthal Mezmaiskaya-2 from Adygea Russia among ancient Eurasian DNAs. The [~]12700 year old Anzick-1 of the Clovis culture was most related to the [~]18720 year old El Miron of the Magdalenian culture in Spain among ancient DNAs. Amerindian mtDNA haplotypes, unlike their Eurasian sister haplotypes, share informative SNPs with Australo-Melanesians, Africans, or Neanderthals.

    "abstract": "The human microbiome is affected by multiple factors, including the environment and host genetics. In this study, we analyzed the oral microbiome of an extended family of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals living in several cities and investigated associations with both shared household and host genetic similarities. We found that environmental effects dominated over genetic ones. While there was weak evidence of geographic structuring at the level of cities, we observed a large and significant effect of shared household on microbiome composition, supporting the role of immediate shared environment in dictating the presence or absence of taxa. This effect was also seen when including adults who had grown up in the same household but moved out prior to the time of sampling, suggesting that the establishment of the oral microbiome earlier in life may affect its long-term composition. We found weak associations between host genetic relatedness and microbiome dissimilarity when using family pedigrees as proxies for genetic similarity. However this association disappeared when using more accurate measures of kinship based on genome-wide genetic markers, indicating that environment rather than host genetics is the dominant factor affecting the composition of the oral microbiome in closely-related individuals. Our results support the concept that there is a consistent core microbiome conserved across global scales, but that small-scale effects due to shared living environment significantly affect microbial community composition.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEPrevious research shows that relatives have a more similar oral microbiome composition than non-relatives, but it remains difficult to distinguish the effects of relatedness and shared household environment. Furthermore, pedigree measures may not accurately measure host genetic similarity. In this study, we include genetic relatedness based on genome-wide SNPs (rather than pedigree measures) and shared environment in the same analysis. We quantify the relative importance of these factors by studying the oral microbiome in members of a large extended Ashkenazi Jewish family who share a similar diet and lifestyle despite living in different locations. We find that host genetics plays no significant role and that the dominant factor is shared environment at the household level. We also find that this effect appears to persist in individuals who have moved out of the parental household, suggesting that the oral microbiome established earlier in life persists long-term.",

    "abstract": "Change is the most fundamental property of biomarker. Contrast to the blood, which is under homeostatic controls, urine reflects changes in the body earlier and more sensitive therefore is a better biomarker source. And drawing blood from infants and toddlers is hard and less tolerated. For patients limited by language, giving chief complaint is difficult. Thus, monitoring biomarkers in urine can provide valuable clues for diagnosis of diseases, especially pediatric diseases. Collecting urine from young children and some adult patients is more challenging than collecting it from healthy adults. Here, we propose a method that uses a fluff pulp diaper to collect urine. Urinary proteins were then eluted and adsorbed onto a piece of nitrocellulose membrane, which can be dried and stored in a vacuumed bag. SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis indicated that this method is reproducible, and similar proteins were identified as those obtained using an acetone precipitation method. With this simple economical method, it is possible to collect and preserve urine samples from infants, toddlers, and patients with special needs, even for large-scale biomarker studies.",

    "abstract": "The molecular basis for the decline in experience-dependent neural plasticity over age remains poorly understood. In visual cortex, the robust plasticity induced in juvenile mice by brief monocular deprivation (MD) during the critical period is abrogated by genetic deletion of Arc, an activity-dependent regulator of excitatory synaptic modification. Here we report that augmenting Arc expression in adult mice prolongs juvenile-like plasticity in visual cortex, as assessed by recordings of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in vivo. A distinguishing characteristic of juvenile OD plasticity is the weakening of deprived-eye responses, believed to be accounted for by the mechanisms of homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD). Accordingly, we also found increased LTD in visual cortex of adult mice with augmented Arc expression, and impaired LTD in visual cortex of juvenile mice that lack Arc or have been treated in vivo with a protein synthesis inhibitor. Further, we found that although activity-dependent expression of Arc mRNA does not change with age, expression of Arc protein is maximal during the critical period and declines in adulthood. Finally, we show that acute augmentation of Arc expression in wild type adult mouse visual cortex is sufficient to restore juvenile-like plasticity. Together, our findings suggest a unifying molecular explanation for the age- and activity-dependent modulation of synaptic sensitivity to deprivation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNeuronal plasticity peaks early in life during critical periods and normally declines with age, but the molecular changes that underlie this decline are not fully understood. Using the mouse visual cortex as a model, we found that activity-dependent expression of the neuronal protein Arc peaks early in life, and that loss of activity-dependent Arc expression parallels loss of synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex. Genetic overexpression of Arc prolongs the critical period of visual cortex plasticity and acute viral expression of Arc in adult mice can restore juvenile-like plasticity. These findings provide a mechanism for the loss of excitatory plasticity with age, and suggest that Arc may be an exciting therapeutic target for modulation of the malleability of neuronal circuits.",

    "abstract": "PET imaging is a widely applicable but a very expensive technology. Strategies that can significantly reduce the high cost of PET imaging are highly desirable both for research and commercialization. On-site synthesis is one important contributor to the high cost. In this report, we demonstrated the feasibility of a synthesis-free method for PET imaging of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO) via a combination of Disulfiram, an FDA approved drug for alcoholism, and 64CuCl2 (termed 64Cu-Dis). Our blocking studies, Western blot, and tissue histological imaging suggested that the observed BAT contrast was due to 64Cu-Dis binding to TSPO, which was further confirmed as a specific biomarker for BAT imaging using [18F]-F-DPA, a TSPO-specific PET tracer. Our studies, for the first time, demonstrated that TSPO could serve as a potential imaging biomarker for BAT. Furthermore, since imaging contrast obtained with both 64Cu-Dis and [18F]-F-DPA was not dependent on BAT activation, these agents could be used for reliably imaging BAT mass. Additional value of our synthesis-free approach could be applied to imaging TSPO in other tissues as it is an established biomarker of neuro-inflammation in activated microglia and plays a role in immune response, steroid synthesis, and apoptosis. Although here we applied 64Cu-Dis for a synthesis-free PET imaging of BAT, we believe that our strategy could be extended to other targets while significantly reducing the cost of PET imaging.\\n\\nSignificanceBrown adipose tissue (BAT) has been considered as \\\"good fat,\\\" and large-scale analysis has undoubtedly validated its clinical significance. BAT tightly correlates with body-mass index (BMI), suggesting that BAT bears clear significance for metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. BAT imaging with [18F]-FDG, the most used method for visualizing BAT, primarily reflects BAT activation, but not BAT mass. A convenient imaging method that can consistently reflect BAT mass is still lacking. In this report, we demonstrated that BAT mass can be reliably imaged with a synthesis-free method using the combination of Disulfiram and 64CuCl2 (64Cu-Dis) via TSPO binding. We further demonstrated for the first time that TSPO is a specific imaging biomarker for BAT.",

    "abstract": "Plant responses to the environment are shaped by external stimuli and internal signaling pathways. In both the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and crop species, circadian clock factors have been identified as critical for growth, flowering and circadian rhythms. Outside of A. thaliana, however, little is known about the molecular function of clock genes. Therefore, we sought to compare the function of Brachypodium distachyon and Seteria viridis orthologs of EARLY FLOWERING3, a key clock gene in A. thaliana. To identify both cycling genes and putative ELF3 functional orthologs in S. viridis, a circadian RNA-seq dataset and online query tool (Diel Explorer) was generated as a community resource to explore expression profiles of Setaria genes under constant conditions after photo- or thermo-entrainment. The function of ELF3 orthologs from A. thaliana, B. distachyon, and S. viridis were tested for complementation of an elf3 mutation in A. thaliana. Despite comparably low sequence identity versus AtELF3 (less than 37%), both monocot orthologs were capable of rescuing hypocotyl elongation, flowering time and arrhythmic clock phenotypes. Molecular analysis using affinity purification and mass spectrometry to compare physical interactions also found that BdELF3 and SvELF3 could be integrated into similar complexes and networks as AtELF3, including forming a composite evening complex. Thus, we find that, despite 180 million years of separation, BdELF3 and SvELF3 can functionally complement loss of ELF3 at the molecular and physiological level.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryOrthologs of a key circadian clock component ELF3 from grasses functionally complement the Arabidopsis counterpart at the molecular and physiological level, in spite of high sequence divergence.",

    "abstract": "Potato virus Y is the most economically important potato viral pathogen. We aimed at unraveling the roles of small RNAs (sRNAs) in the complex immune signaling network controlling the establishment of tolerant response of potato cv. Desiree to the virus. We constructed a sRNA regulatory network connecting sRNAs and their targets to link sRNA level responses to physiological processes. We discovered an interesting novel sRNAs-gibberellin regulatory circuit being activated as early as 3 days post inoculation before viral multiplication can be detected. Increased levels of miR167 and phasiRNA931 were reflected in decreased levels of transcripts involved in gibberellin biosynthesis. Moreover, decreased concentration of gibberellin confirmed this regulation. The functional relation between lower activity of gibberellin signaling and reduced disease severity was previously confirmed in Arabidopsis-virus interaction using knockout mutants. We further showed that this regulation is salicylic acid-dependent as the response of sRNA network was attenuated in salicylic acid-depleted transgenic counterpart NahG-Desiree expressing severe disease symptoms. Besides downregulation of gibberellin signaling, regulation of several other parts of sRNA network in tolerant Desiree revealed similarities to responses observed in mutualistic symbiotic interactions. The intertwining of different regulatory networks revealed shows how developmental signaling, disease symptom development and stress signaling can be balanced.",

    "abstract": "Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a devastating disease that can cause severe yield losses. Identification and utilization of stripe rust resistance genes are essential for effective breeding against the disease. Wild emmer accession TZ-2, originally collected from Mount Hermon, Israel, confers near-immunity resistance against several prevailing Pst races in China. A set of 200 F6:7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between susceptible durum wheat cultivar Langdon and TZ-2 was used for stripe rust evaluation. Genetic analysis indicated that the stripe rust resistance of TZ-2 to Pst race CYR34 was controlled by a single dominant gene, temporarily designated YrTZ2. Through bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and SSR mapping, YrTZ2 was located on chromosome arm 1BS and flanked by SSR markers Xwmc230 and Xgwm413 with genetic distance of 0.8 cM (distal) and 0.3 cM (proximal), respectively. By applying wheat 90K iSelect SNP genotyping assay, 11 polymorphic loci (consist of 250 SNP markers) closely linked with YrTZ2 were identified. YrTZ2 was further delimited into a 0.8 cM genetic interval between SNP marker IWB19368 and SSR marker Xgwm413, and co-segregated with SNP marker IWB28744 (attached with 28 SNP markers). Comparative genomics analyses revealed high level of collinearity between the YrTZ2 genomic region and the orthologous region of Aegilops tauschii 1DS. The genomic region between loci IWB19368 and IWB31649 harboring YrTZ2 is orthologous to a 24.5 Mb genomic region between AT1D0112 and AT1D0150, spanning 15 contigs on chromosome 1DS. The genetic and comparative maps of YrTZ2 provide framework for map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection (MAS) of YrTZ2.",

    "abstract": "Plant cells are surrounded by walls, which must often meet opposing functional requirements during plant growth and defense. The cells meet them by modifying wall structure and composition in a tightly controlled and adaptive manner. The modifications seem to be mediated by a dedicated cell wall integrity (CWI) maintenance mechanism. Currently the mode of action of the mechanism is not understood and it is unclear how its activity is coordinated with established plant defense signaling. We investigated responses to induced cell wall damage (CWD) impairing CWI and the underlying mechanism in Arabidopsis thaliana. Interestingly inhibitor- and enzyme-derived CWD induced similar, turgor-sensitive stress responses. Genetic analysis showed that the receptor-like kinase (RLK) FEI2 and the mechano-sensitive, plasma membrane-localized Ca2+- channel MCA1 function downstream of the THE1 RLK in CWD perception. Phenotypic clustering with 27 genotypes identified a core group of RLKs and ion channels, required for activation of CWD responses. By contrast, the responses were repressed by pattern-triggered immune (PTI) signaling components including PEPR1 and 2, the receptors for the immune signaling peptide AtPep1. Interestingly AtPep1 application repressed CWD-induced phytohormone accumulation in a PEPR1/2-dependent manner. These results suggest that PTI suppresses CWD-induced defense responses through elicitor peptide-mediated signaling during defense response activation. If PTI is impaired, the suppression of CWD-induced responses is alleviated, thus compensating for defective PTI.\\n\\nSignificance statementStress resistance and plant growth determine food crop yield and efficiency of bioenergy production from ligno-cellulosic biomass. Plant cell walls are essential elements of the biological processes, therefore functional integrity of the cell walls must be maintained throughout. Here we investigate the plant cell wall integrity maintenance mechanism. We characterize its mode of action, identify essential signaling components and show that the AtPep1 signaling peptide apparently coordinates pattern triggered immunity (PTI) and cell wall integrity maintenance in plants. These results suggest how PTI and cell wall modification coordinately regulate biotic stress responses with plants possibly compensating for PTI impairment through enhanced activation of stress responses regulated by the CWI maintenance mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The parasitic African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, evades the adaptive host immune response by a process of antigenic variation that involves the clonal switching of variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs). The VSGs that periodically come to dominate in vivo display a hierarchy, but how this hierarchy arises is not well-understood. Combining publicly available genetic data with mathematical modelling, we report a VSG-length-dependent hierarchical timing of clonal VSG dominance in a mouse model, revealing an inverse correlation between VSG length and trypanosome growth-rate. Our analysis indicates that, among parasites switching to new VSGs, those expressing shorter VSGs preferentially accumulate to a detectable level that is sufficient to trigger an effective immune response. Subsequent elimination of faster-growing parasites then allows slower parasites with longer VSGs to accumulate. This interaction between the host and parasite is able by itself to explain the temporal distribution of VSGs observed in vivo. Thus, our findings reveal a length-dependent hierarchy that operates during T. brucei infection, representing a  feint attack diversion tactic utilised during infection by these persistent parasites to out-maneuver the host immune system.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei causes devastating and lethal diseases in humans and livestock. This parasite continuously evades the host adaptive immune response by drawing on a library of variant surface proteins but the mechanisms determining the timing of surface protein - host interactions are not understood. We report a simple mechanism, based on differential growth of parasites with surface proteins of different lengths, which can explain the hierarchy of variants over time. This allows parasites to evade host immune responses for extended timeframes using limited cohorts of surface proteins. We liken this strategy to a military  feint attack, that enhances the parasites ability to evade the host immune response. A similar mechanism may also operate in other important pathogens.",

KMAC also identifies correct motifs in more experiments than four state-of-the-art motif discovery methods. In addition, KSM derived features outperform both PWM and deep learning model derived sequence features in predicting differential regulatory activities of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) alleles. Finally, we have applied KMAC to 1488 ENCODE TF ChIP-seq datasets and created a public resource of KSM and PWM motifs. We expect that the KSM representation and KMAC method will be valuable in characterizing TF binding specificities and in interpreting the effects of non-coding genetic variations.",

    "abstract": "TGF-{beta} and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) family proteins are made as proprotein dimers, which are cleaved by proprotein convertases to release the active C-terminal ligand dimer. Multiple proteolytic processing sites in Glass bottom boat (Gbb), the Drosophila BMP7 ortholog, can produce distinct forms of active ligand. Cleavage at the S1 or atypical S0 site produces Gbb15, the conventional small BMP ligand, while cleavage at the NS site produces the larger Gbb38 ligand (1, 2). Here, we found that blocking NS cleavage increased association of the full length prodomain with Gbb15 resulting in a concomitant decrease in signaling activity. NS cleavage is required in vivo for Gbb-Decapentaplegic (Dpp) heterodimer-mediated wing vein patterning but not in cell culture to enable Gbb15-Dpp het-erodimer activity. Gbb NS cleavage is also required in vivo for the regulation of pupal ecdysis and viability that is dependent on the type II receptor Wishful thinking (Wit). We found that the ability of Gbb38 to signal requires the expression of either Wit or the type I receptor, Saxophone (Sax). Finally, we discovered that the production of Gbb38 in 3rd instar larvae results when processing at the S1/S0 site is blocked by O-linked glycosylation. Our findings demonstrate that BMP prodomain cleavage can ensure that the mature ligand is not inhibited by the prodomain. Furthermore, alternative processing of BMP proproteins produces ligand types that signal preferentially through different receptors and exhibit specific developmental functions.",

    "abstract": "Molecular rulers that rely on the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism are widely used to investigate dynamic molecular processes that occur on the nanometer scale. However, the capabilities of these fluorescence molecular rulers are fundamentally limited to shallow imaging depths by light scattering in biological samples. Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has recently emerged as a high resolution modality for in vivo imaging, coupling optical excitation with ultrasound detection. In this paper, we report the capability of PAT to probe distance-dependent FRET at centimeter depths. Using DNA nanotechnology we created several nanostructures with precisely positioned fluorophore-quencher pairs over a range of nanoscale separation distances. PAT of the DNA nanostructures showed distance-dependent photoacoustic signal generation and experimentally demonstrated the ability of PAT to reveal the FRET process deep within tissue mimicking phantoms. Further, we experimentally validated these DNA nanostructures as providing a novel and biocompatible strategy to augment the intrinsic photoacoustic signal generation capabilities of small molecule fluorescent dyes.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome-wide time series expression profiling is used to characterize the cellular response to environmental perturbations. The first step to analyzing transcriptional response data is often to cluster genes with similar responses. Here, we present a nonparametric model-based method, Dirichlet process Gaussian process mixture model (DPGP), which jointly models cluster number with a Dirichlet process and temporal dependencies with Gaussian processes. We demonstrate the accuracy of DPGP in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches using hundreds of simulated data sets. To further test our method, we apply DPGP to published microarray data from a microbial model organism exposed to stress and to novel RNA-seq data from a human cell line exposed to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. We validate our clusters by examining local transcription factor binding and histone modifications. Our results demonstrate that jointly modeling cluster number and temporal dependencies can reveal novel regulatory mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Sulfur, most abundantly found in the environment as sulfate (SO42-), is an essential element in metabolites required by all living cells, including amino acids, co-factors and vitamins. Current understanding of the cellular delivery of SO42- at the molecular level is limited however. CysZ has been described as a SO42- permease, but its sequence family is without known structural precedent. Based on crystallographic structure information, SO42- binding and uptake experiments in cells and proteoliposomes, and single-channel conductance measurements, we provide insight into the molecular mechanism of CysZ-mediated translocation of SO42- across membranes. CysZ properties differ markedly from those of known transporters and ion channels. The structures display a hitherto unknown fold with dual topology, assembling in CysZ from Pseudomonas denitrificans as a trimer of antiparallel dimers in the membrane. CysZ structures from two other species recapitulate dimers from this assembly. Mutational studies highlight the functional relevance of conserved CysZ residues.",

    "abstract": "Tumor metastasis is the cause of death for 90% of cancer patients, and no currently-available therapies target this multi-step process in which cancer cells spread from the local tissue of a primary tumor to distant organs where they establish secondary tumors1. Although epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition2, tumor-secreted exosomes3, epigenetic regulators as well as other genes4-8 have been implicated in metastasis, little is known about how cells adapt to and colonize new tissue environments. Here, we show that the epigenetics-mediated reprogramming of tissue-specific gene transcription in cancer cells promotes metastasis. Using colorectal cancer (CRC) as a model, we found in both clinical and cell line studies that metastatic CRC cells lose their colon-specific gene transcription program and gain a liver-specific gene transcription program as they metastasize in the liver. Further, we found this transcription reprogramming is driven by a reshaped epigenetic landscape of both typical and super-enhancers. Chemical inhibition of enhancer activity disrupts the ability of cells to execute altered transcription programs and consequently inhibits metastasis. Binding motif analysis of the enhancers in liver metastatic CRC cells identified the liver-specific transcription factor FOXA2 as a key regulator, and knocking down of FOXA2 expression prevents the colonization of metastatic CRC cells in the liver of a mice xenograft model. These results, together with additional observations of similar reprogramming in several cohorts of clinical CRC tumor samples and in multiple other forms of metastatic cancers, indicate that this reprogramming may be a common feature of metastasis in multiple cancers and suggest the targeted disruption of this epigenetic reprogramming as a strategy for the development of therapies to treat metastasis, the leading cause of cancer-related mortality.",

    "abstract": "Tubulins, the building block of microtubules (MTs), play a critical role in both supporting and regulating neurite growth. Eukaryotic genomes contain multiple tubulin isotypes, and their missense mutations cause a range of neurodevelopmental defects. Using the C. elegans touch receptor neurons, we analyzed the effects of 67 tubulin missense mutations on neurite growth. Three types of mutations emerged: 1) loss-of-function mutations, which cause mild defects in neurite growth; 2) antimorphic mutations, which map to the GTP binding site and intradimer and interdimer interfaces, significantly reduce MT stability, and cause severe neurite growth defects; and 3) neomorphic mutations, which map to the exterior surface, increase MT stability, and cause ectopic neurite growth. Structure-function analysis reveals a causal relationship between tubulin structure and MT stability. This stability affects neuronal morphogenesis. As part of this analysis, we engineered several disease-associated human tubulin mutations into C. elegans genes and examined their impact on neuronal development at the cellular level. We also discovered an -tubulin (TBA-7) that appears to destabilize MTs. Loss of TBA-7 led to the formation of hyperstable MTs and the generation of ectopic neurites; the lack of potential sites for polyamination and polyglutamination on TBA-7 may be responsible for this destabilization.\\n\\nTable of Content (TOC) Highlight SummaryDifferent tubulin isotypes perform different functions in the regulation of MT structure and neurite growth, and missense mutations of tubulin genes have three types of distinct effects on MT stability and neurite growth. One -tubulin isotype appears to induce relative instability due to the lack of potential post-translational modification sites.",

    "abstract": "Climate change represents a significant threat to amphibians, which are already imperiled. However, for many species, the relationship between demographic vital rates (survival and growth) and climate is unknown, which limits predictive models. Here we describe the life history variation of Plethodon montanus using capture-recapture data over a period of four years, at five sites along an elevational gradient to determine how survival and growth vary with temperature, precipitation, and how these relationships vary with elevation. We used a hierarchical model to estimate asymptotic size and growth rate, and used a spatial Cormack-Jolly-Seber model to estimate probability of capture and survival, as well as dispersal variance. Our results show that during the active season, growth and survival rates are both positively affected by precipitation, while survival was positively affected by temperature at all elevations, the relationship between growth rates and temperature varied along the elevational gradient. Generally at lower elevations, higher temperatures led to a decrease in growth while at higher elevations the opposite was true. During the inactive season we found elevational variation in the relationship between survival and the amount of snow; at low elevations snowfall was low but survival decreased with increasing snowfall while at higher elevations increasing snowfall lead to higher survival. Our results demonstrate that understanding how the environment can affect salamander demography to develop mechanistic models, will require knowledge of the actual environmental conditions experienced by a given population as well as an understanding of the overall differences in climate at a given site.",

However, the impact of different modes of subsistence on recent changes in population size, patterns of gene flow, and deleterious mutational load remains unclear. Here, we report high-coverage exome sequencing data from various populations of rainforest hunter-gatherers and farmers from central Africa. We find that the recent demographic histories of hunter-gatherers and farmers differed considerably, with population collapses for hunter-gatherers and expansions for farmers, accompanied by increased gene flow. We show that purifying selection against deleterious alleles is of similar efficiency across African populations, in contrast with Europeans where we detect weaker purifying selection. Furthermore, the per-individual mutation load of rainforest hunter-gatherers is similar to that of farmers, under both additive and recessive models. Our results indicate that differences in the cultural practices and demographic regimes of African populations have not resulted in large differences in mutational burden, and highlight the beneficial role of gene flow in reshaping the distribution of deleterious genetic variation across human populations.",

    "abstract": "The environment can influence heterosis, the phenomena in which the offspring of two inbred parents exhibits phenotypic performance beyond the inbred parents for specific traits. In this study we measured 25 traits in a set of 47 maize hybrids and their inbred parents grown in 16 different environments, and each had varying levels of average productivity. By quantifying 25 vegetative and reproductive traits across the life cycle we were able to analyze interactions between the environment and multiple distinct instances of heterosis. The magnitude and rank among hybrids of better-parent heterosis (BPH) varied for the different traits and environments. Across the traits, a higher within plot variance was observed for inbred lines compared to hybrids. However, for most traits, variance across environments was not significantly different for inbred lines compared to hybrids. Further, for many traits the correlations of BPH to hybrid performance and BPH to better parent performance were of comparable magnitude. These results indicate that inbreds and hybrids are showing similar trends in environmental response and are both contribute to genotype-by-environment interactions for heterosis. This study highlights that degree of heterosis is not an inherent trait of a specific hybrid, but varies depending on the trait measured and the environment where that trait is measured. Studies that attempt to correlate molecular processes with heterosis are hindered by the fact that heterosis is not a consistent attribute of a specific hybrid.",

Relic DNA can influence a number of important ecological and evolutionary processes, but it may also bias estimates of microbial abundance and diversity, which has implications for understanding environmental, engineered, and host-associated ecosystems. We developed models capturing the fundamental processes that regulate the size and composition of the relic DNA pools to identify scenarios leading to biased estimates of biodiversity. Our models predict that bias increases with relic DNA pool size, but only when the species abundance distributions (SAD) of relic and intact DNA are distinct from one another. We evaluated our model predictions by quantifying relic DNA and assessing its contribution to bacterial diversity using 16S rRNA gene sequences collected from different ecosystem types, including soil, sediment, water, and the mammalian gut. On average, relic DNA made up 33 % of the total bacterial DNA pool, but exceeded 80 % in some samples. Despite its abundance, relic DNA had no effect on estimates of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, even in ecosystems where processes such as the physical protection of relic DNA are common and predicted by our models to generate bias. Rather, our findings are consistent with the expectation that relic DNA sequences degrade in proportion to their abundance and therefore may contribute minimally to estimates of microbial diversity.",

The rate of decay of visual performance with eccentricity depends strongly on the stimuli and task used in measurement. While detailed measures of this decay have been made across a broad range of tasks, a comprehensive theoretical account of this phenomenon is lacking. We demonstrate that the decay in visual performance can be attributed to the efficient encoding of binocular information in natural scenes. The efficient coding hypothesis holds that the early stages of visual processing attempt to form an efficient coding of ecologically valid stimuli. Using Independent Component Analysis to learn an efficient coding of stereoscopic images, we show that the ratio of binocular to monocular components varied with eccentricity at the same rate as human stereo acuity and Vernier acuity. Our results demonstrate that the organisation of the visual cortex is dependent on the underlying statistics of binocular scenes and, strikingly, that monocular acuity depends on the mechanisms by which the visual cortex processes binocular information. This result has important theoretical implications for understanding the encoding of visual information in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) is an important cause of quality loss in many cereal crops and is particularly prevalent and damaging in wheat. Resistance to PHS is therefore a valuable target trait in many breeding programmes. The Phs-A1 locus on wheat chromosome arm 4AL has been consistently shown to account for a significant proportion of natural variation to PHS in diverse mapping populations. However the deployment of sprouting resistance is confounded by the fact that different candidate genes, including the tandem duplicated Plasma Membrane 19 (PM19) genes and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (TaMKK3-A) gene, have been proposed to underlie Phs-A1. To further define the Phs-A1 locus, we constructed a physical map across this interval in hexaploid and tetraploid wheat. We established close proximity of the proposed candidate genes which are located within a 1.2 Mb interval. An association analysis of diverse germplasm used in previous genetic mapping studies suggests that TaMKK3-A, and not PM19, is the major gene underlying the Phs-A1 effect in European, North American, Australian and Asian germplasm. We identified the non-dormant TaMKK3-A allele at low frequencies within the A-genome diploid progenitor Triticum urartu genepool, and show an increase in the allele frequency in modern varieties. In UK varieties, the frequency of the dormant TaMKK3-A allele was significantly higher in bread-making quality varieties compared to feed and biscuit-making cultivars. Analysis of exome capture data from 58 diverse hexaploid wheat accessions identified fourteen haplotypes across the extended Phs-A1 locus and four haplotypes for TaMKK3-A. Analysis of these haplotypes in a collection of UK and Australian cultivars revealed distinct major dormant and non-dormant Phs-A1 haplotypes in each country, which were either rare or absent in the opposing germplasm set. The diagnostic markers and haplotype information reported in the study will help inform the choice of germplasm and breeding strategies for the deployment of Phs-A1 resistance into breeding germplasm.",
