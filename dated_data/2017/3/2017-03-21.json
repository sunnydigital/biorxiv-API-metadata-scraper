    "abstract": "Polyploidy can have a huge impact on the evolution of species, and it is a common occurrence, especially in plants. The two types of polyploids - autopolyploids and allopolyploids - differ in the level of divergence between the genes that are brought together in the new polyploid lineage. Because allopolyploids are formed via hybridization, the homoeologous copies of genes within them are at least as divergent as orthologs in the parental species that came together to form them. This means that common methods for estimating the parental lineages of allopolyploidy events are not accurate, and can lead to incorrect inferences about the number of gene duplications and losses. Here, we have adapted an algorithm for topology-based gene-tree reconciliation to work with multi-labeled trees (MUL-trees). By definition, MUL-trees have some tips with identical labels, which makes them a natural representation of the genomes of polyploids. Using this new reconciliation algorithm we can: accurately place allopolyploidy events on a phylogeny, identify the parental lineages that hybridized to form allopolyploids, distinguish between allo-, auto-, and (in most cases) no polyploidy, and correctly count the number of duplications and losses in a set of gene trees. We validate our method using gene trees simulated with and without polyploidy, and revisit the history of polyploidy in data from the clades including both bakers yeast and bread wheat. Our re-analysis of the yeast data confirms the allopolyploid origin and parental lineages previously identified for this group. The method presented here should find wide use in the growing number of genomes from species with a history of polyploidy.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that translation elongation is regulated by multiple factors, but the observed heterogeneity remains only partially explained. To dissect quantitatively the different determinants of elongation speed, we use probabilistic modeling to estimate initiation and local elongation rates from ribosome profiling data. This model-based approach allows us to quantify the extent of interference between ribosomes on the same transcript. We show that neither interference nor the distribution of slow codons is sufficient to explain the observed heterogeneity. Instead, we find that electrostatic interactions between the ribosomal exit tunnel and specific parts of the nascent polypeptide govern the elongation rate variation as the polypeptide makes its initial pass through the tunnel. Once the N-terminus has escaped the tunnel, the hydropathy of the nascent polypeptide within the ribosome plays a major role in modulating the speed. We show that our results are consistent with the biophysical properties of the tunnel.",

    "abstract": "We will inevitably face new epidemic outbreaks where the mechanisms of transmission are still uncertain, making it difficult to obtain quantitative predictions. Thus we present a novel algorithm that qualitatively predicts the start, relative magnitude and decline of uncertain epidemic outbreaks, requiring to know only a few of its \\\\macroscopic\\\" parameters. The algorithm is based on estimating exactly the time-varying contact rate of a canonical but time-varying Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemic model parametrized to the particular outbreak. The algorithm can also be extended to other canonical epidemic models. Even if dynamics of the outbreak deviates significantly from the underlying epidemic model, we show the predictions of the algorithm remain robust. We validated our algorithm using real time-series data of measles, dengue and the current zika outbreak, comparing its performance to existing algorithms that also use a few macroscopic parameters (e.g., those estimating reproductive numbers) and to those using a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of the epidemic outbreak. We show our algorithm can outperform existing algorithms using a few macroscopic parameters, providing an informative qualitative evaluation of the outbreak.",

    "abstract": "In this study we used age at onset of Alzheimers disease (AD), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) datasets to identify candidate causal genes and mechanisms underlying AD GWAS loci. In a genome-wide survival analysis of 40,255 samples, eight of the previously reported AD risk loci are significantly (P < 5x10-8) or suggestively (P < 1x10-5) associated with age at onset-defined survival (AAOS) and a further fourteen novel loci reached suggestive significance. Using stratified LD score regression we demonstrated a significant enrichment of AD heritability in hematopoietic cells of the myeloid and B-lymphoid lineage. We then investigated the impact of these 22 AAOS-associated variants on CSF biomarkers and gene expression in cells of the myeloid lineage. In particular, the minor allele of rs1057233 (G), within the previously reported CELF1 AD risk locus, shows association with higher age at onset of AD (P=8.40x10-6), higher CSF levels of A{beta}42 (P=1.2x10-4), and lower expression of SPI1 in monocytes (P=1.50x10-105) and macrophages (P=6.41x10-87). SPI1 encodes PU.1, a transcription factor critical for myeloid cell development and function. AD heritability is enriched within the SPI1 cistromes of monocytes and macrophages, implicating a myeloid PU.1 target gene network in the etiology of AD. Finally, experimentally altered PU.1 levels are correlated with phagocytic activity of BV2 mouse microglial cells and specific changes in the expression of multiple myeloid-expressed genes, including the mouse orthologs of AD-associated genes, APOE, CLU/APOJ, CD33, MS4A4A/MS4A6A, and TYROBP. Our results collectively suggest that lower SPI1 expression reduces AD risk by modulating myeloid cell gene expression and function.",

    "abstract": "An ideal gene drive system to alter wild populations would 1) exclusively affect organisms within the political boundaries of consenting communities, and 2) be capable of restoring any engineered population to its original genetic state. Here we describe  daisy quorum drive systems that meet these criteria by combining daisy drive with underdominance. A daisy quorum drive system is predicted to spread through a population until all of its daisy elements have been lost, at which point its fitness becomes frequency-dependent: mostly altered populations become fixed for the desired change, while engineered genes at low frequency are swiftly eliminated by natural selection. The result is an engineered population surrounded by wild-type organisms with limited mixing at the boundary. Releasing large numbers of wild-type organisms or a few bearing a population suppression element can reduce the engineered population below the quorum, triggering elimination of all engineered sequences. In principle, the technology can restore any drive-amenable population carrying engineered genes to wild-type genetics. Daisy quorum systems may enable efficient, community-supported, and genetically reversible ecological engineering.\\n\\nSummaryLocal communities should be able to control their own environments without forcing those choices on others. Ideally, each community could reversibly alter local wild organisms in ways that cannot spread beyond their own boundaries, and any engineered population could be restored to its original genetic state. We've invented a 'daisy quorum' drive system that appears to meet these criteria.\\n\\n\\\"Daisy\\\" refers to a daisy drive, which typically uses a daisy-chain of linked genes to spread a change through a local population while losing links every generation until it stops spreading. \\\"Quorum\\\" reflects the system's ability to \\\"vote\\\" on whether a local population should be altered or not: once all daisy elements are lost, it favors replication by the altered version or the original depending on which is more abundant in the local area. Put together, they result in a change that first spreads through a local population, then either becomes locally prevalent is eliminating, inhibiting mixing at the boundary. All organisms in the target population are altered, but changes are unable to spread much beyond that area due to being greatly outnumbered by wild-type organisms and consequently less able to replicate.\\n\\nWe haven't yet performed any experiments involving daisy quorum systems. Rather, were describing what we intend to do, including the safeguards we will use and our assessment of risks, in the hope that others will evaluate our plans and tell us if there's anything wrong that we missed. We hope that all researchers working on gene drive systems - and other technologies that could impact the shared environment - will similarly pre-register their plans. Sharing plans can reduce needless duplication, accelerate progress, and make the proposed work safer for everyone.",

At the center, the neutral term \\\"amendment\\\" describes all forms of post-publication change to an article. We lay out a straightforward and consistent process that applies to each of the three types of amendments: insubstantial, substantial, and complete. This proposed system supports the dynamic nature of the research process itself as researchers continue to refine or extend the work, removing the emotive climate particularly associated with retractions and corrections to published work. It allows researchers to cite and share the correct versions of articles with certainty, and for decision makers to have access to the most up to date information.",

    "abstract": "During asymmetric cell division, dynein generates forces, which position the spindle to reflect polarity and ensure correct daughter cell fates. The transient cortical localization of dynein raises the question of its targeting. We found that it accumulates at the microtubule plus-ends like in budding yeast, indirectly hitch-hiking on EBP-2EB1 likely via dynactin. Importantly, this mechanism, which modestly accounts for cortical forces, does not transport dynein, which displays the same binding/unbinding dynamics as EBP-2EB1. At the cortex, dynein tracks can be classified as having either directed or diffusive-like motion. Diffusive-like tracks reveal force-generating dyneins. Their densities are higher on the posterior tip of the embryos, where GPR-1/2LGN concentrate, but their durations are symmetric. Since dynein flows to the cortex are non-polarized, we suggest that this posterior enrichment increases dynein binding, thus accounts for the force imbalance reflecting polarity, and supplements the regulation of mitotic progression via the non-polarized detachment rate.",

Interactions between cytoplasmic dynein at the cortex and astral microtubules generate pulling forces that position the spindle. In yeast, dynein is actively delivered to the cortex through microtubule plus-end tracking complexes. In animal cells, an evolutionarily conserved G-GPR-1/2Pins/LGN-LIN-5NuMA cortical complex interacts with dynein and is required to generate pulling forces, but the mechanism of dynein recruitment to the cortex is unclear. Using CRISPR/Cas9-assisted recombineering, we fluorescently labeled endogenous DHC-1 dynein in C. elegans. We observed strong dynein plus-end tracking, which depended on the end-binding protein EBP-2. Complete removal of the EBP family abolished dynein plus-end tracking but not LIN-5-dependent cortical localization. The ebp-1/2/3 deletion mutant, which was viable and fertile, showed increased cortical microtubule retention; however, pulling forces and spindle positioning were normal. These data indicate that dynein recruited from the cytoplasm creates robust pulling forces.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDogs (Canis lupus familiaris) were domesticated from gray wolves between 10-40 kya in Eurasia, yet details surrounding the process of domestication remain unclear. The vast array of phenotypes exhibited by dogs mirror other domesticated animal species, a phenomenon known as the Domestication Syndrome. Here, we use signatures persisting in the dog genome to identify genes and pathways altered by the intensive selective pressures of domestication.\\n\\nResultsWe identified 246 candidate domestication regions containing 10.8Mb of genome sequence and 178 genes through whole-genome SNP analysis of 43 globally distributed village dogs and 10 wolves. Comparisons with ancient dog genomes suggest that these regions reflect signatures of domestication rather than breed formation. The strongest hit is located in the Retinoic Acid-Induced 1 (RAI1) gene, mutations of which cause Smith-Magenis syndrome. The identified regions contain a significant enrichment of genes linked to neural crest cell migration, differentiation and development. Read depth analysis suggests that copy number variation played a minor role in dog domestication.\\n\\nConclusionOur results indicate that phenotypes distinguishing domesticated dogs from wolves, such as tameness, smaller jaws, floppy ears, and diminished craniofacial development, are determined by genes which act early in embryogenesis. These differences are all phenotypes of the Domestication Syndrome, which can be explained by decreases in neural crest cells at these sites. We propose that initial selection during early dog domestication was for behavior, a trait also influenced by genes which act in the neural crest, which secondarily gave rise to the phenotypes of modern dogs.",

Herewith, we have used a dataset of 104 pigs, with available genotypes for 62,163 single nucleotide polymorphisms and microarray gene expression measurements in the gluteus medius muscle, to investigate the genetic regulation of 63 genes with crucial roles in the uptake, transport, synthesis and catabolism of lipids. By performing an eQTL scan with the GEMMA software, we have detected 12 cis- and 18 trans-eQTL modulating the expression of 19 loci. Genes regulated by eQTL had a variety of functions such as the {beta}-oxidation of fatty acids, lipid biosynthesis and lipolysis, fatty acid activation and desaturation, lipoprotein uptake, apolipoprotein assembly and cholesterol trafficking. These data provide a first picture about the genetic regulation of loci involved in porcine lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The diffusion of wearable sensors enables the monitoring of heart physiology in real-life contexts. Wearable technology is characterized by important advantages but also by technical limitations that affect the quality of the collected signals in terms of movement artifacts and presence of noise. Therefore specific signal processing algorithms are required to cope with the lower quality and different characteristic of signals collected with wearable sensor units. Here we propose and validate a pipeline to detect heartbeats in cardiac signals, extract the Inter Beat Intervals (IBI) and compute the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) indicators from wearable devices. In particular, we describe the novel Derivative-Based Detection (DBD) algorithm to estimate the beat position in Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals and the Reverse Combinatorial Optimization (RCO) algorithm to identify and correct IBI extraction errors. The pipeline is first validated on data from clinical-grade sensors, then on a benchmark dataset including examples of movement artifacts in a real-life context. The accuracy of the DBD algorithm is assessed in terms of precision and recall of the detection; error in the IBI values is quantified by root mean square error. The reliability of HRV indicators is evaluated by the Bland-Altman ratio. The DBD algorithm performs better than a state-of-art algorithm for both medical-grade and wearable devices. However, as already found in similar studies, worse reliability is found with the BVP signal in computing frequency domain HRV indicators, in particular with wearable devices.",

    "abstract": "Research on changes in phenotypic plasticity within wild animal populations is centuries old, however far fewer studies have investigated the role that epigenetics play in the development or persistence of natural variation in response to environmental change. Tiger snakes (Notechis scutatus) are an ideal study organism to investigate the link between epigenetics and phenotypic responses to environmental change, as they live on a range of offshore islands with different environments and prey types while exhibiting gigantism and dwarfism in body and head size. In this study, we have generated methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) data and found that, in general, Tiger Snakes are more epigenetically differentiated than genetically differentiated. Each island group has a distinctive epigenetic signal, suggesting the Tiger Snakes on each island group have adapted to their specific environment. This is also supported by the strong positive relationship between epigenetic differentiation and isolation age, as well as between epigenetic/genetic signal and both temperature and precipitation. The Tiger Snakes from Kangaroo Island, which has a complex landscape/environment like the mainland rather than the simple landscape/environment of each of the smaller islands, are both genetically and epigenetically more like the mainland. As the MSAP loci are randomly distributed across the genome, we believe a closer examination of the epigenetic modifications near genes involved in growth, development, and lipid metabolism will allow us to investigate the epigenetic basis for the natural variation in head size and body size on the islands.",

    "abstract": "Perception can be described as a process of inference, integrating bottom-up sensory inputs and top-down expectations. However, it is unclear how this process is neurally implemented. It has been proposed that expectations lead to pre-stimulus baseline increases in sensory neurons tuned to the expected stimulus, which in turn affects the processing of subsequent stimuli. Recent fMRI studies have revealed stimulus-specific patterns of activation in sensory cortex as a result of expectation, but this method lacks the temporal resolution necessary to distinguish pre- from post-stimulus processes. Here, we combined human MEG with multivariate decoding techniques to probe the representational content of neural signals in a time-resolved manner. We observed a representation of expected stimuli in the neural signal well before they were presented, demonstrating that expectations indeed induce a pre-activation of stimulus templates. These results suggest a mechanism for how predictive perception can be neurally implemented.",

    "abstract": "Several methods have been developed to measure dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in fMRI data. These methods are often based on a sliding-window analysis, which aims to capture how the brains functional organization varies over the course of a scan. The aim of many studies is to compare dFC across groups, such as younger versus older people. However, spurious group differences in measured dFC may be caused by other sources of heterogeneity between people. For example, the shape of the haemodynamic response function (HRF) and levels of measurement noise have been found to vary with age. We use a generic simulation framework for fMRI data to investigate the effect of such heterogeneity on estimates of dFC. Our findings show that, despite no differences in true dFC, individual differences in measured dFC can result from other (non-dynamic) features of the data, such as differences in neural autocorrelation, HRF shape, connectivity strength and measurement noise. We also find that common dFC methods such as k-means and multilayer modularity approaches can detect spurious group differences in dynamic connectivity due to inappropriate setting of their hyperparameters. fMRI studies therefore need to consider alternative sources of heterogeneity across individuals before concluding differences in dFC.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100045). Parallel evolution, defined as identical changes arising in independent populations, is often attributed to similar selective pressures favoring the fixation of identical genetic changes. However, some level of parallel evolution is also expected if mutation rates are heterogeneous across regions of the genome. Theory suggests that mutation and selection can have equal impacts on patterns of parallel evolution, however empirical studies have yet to jointly quantify the importance of these two processes. Here, we introduce several statistical models to examine the contributions of mutation and selection heterogeneity to shaping parallel evolutionary changes at the gene-level. Using this framework we analyze published data from forty experimentally evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations. We can partition the effects of a number of genomic variables into those affecting patterns of parallel evolution via effects on the rate of arising mutations, and those affecting the retention versus loss of the arising mutations (i.e. selection). Our results suggest that gene-to-gene heterogeneity in both mutation and selection, associated with gene length, recombination rate, and number of protein domains drive parallel evolution at both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites. While there are still a number of parallel changes that are not well described, we show that allowing for heterogeneous rates of mutation and selection can provide improved predictions of the prevalence and degree of parallel evolution.\\n\\nData archival locationDryad, doi to be included later",

Genes of the ancestral autosomes are often assumed to have undertaken these transitions on uniform terms, but we hypothesized that they varied in their dosage constraints. We inferred such constraints from conservation of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated repression, validated by analysis of experimental data. X-linked genes with a surviving Y homolog have the most conserved miRNA target sites, followed by genes with no Y homolog and subject to XCI, and then genes with no Y homolog but escaping XCI; this heterogeneity existed on the ancestral autosomes. Similar results for avian Z-linked genes, with or without a W homolog, lead to a model of XY/ZW evolution incorporating preexisting dosage sensitivities of individual genes in determining their evolutionary fates, and ultimately shaping the mammalian and avian sex chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "Clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are known to differ from those associated with infections of non-CF hosts in colony morphology, drug susceptibility patterns, and genomic hypermutability. Although Pa isolates from CF have long been recognized for their overall higher resistance rate calculated generally by reduced \\\"percent susceptible\\\", this study takes the approach to compare and contrast Etest MIC distributions between two distinct cohorts of clinical strains (n=224 from 56 CF patients and n=130 from 68 non-CF patients respectively) isolated in 2013. Logarithmic transformed MIC (logMIC) values of 11 antimicrobial agents were compared between the two groups. CF isolates tended to produce heterogeneous and widely dispersed MICs compared to non-CF isolates. By applying a test for equality of variances, we were able to confirm that the MICs generated from CF isolates against 9 out of the 11 agents were significantly more dispersed than those from non-CF (p<0.02-<0.001). Quantile-quantiles plots indicated little agreement between the two cohorts of isolates. Based on whole genome sequencing of 19 representative CF Pa isolates, divergent gain- or loss-of-function mutations in efflux and porin genes and their regulators between isogenic or intra-clonal associates were evident. Not one, not a few, but the net effect all adaptive mutational changes in the genomes of CF Pa, both shared and unshared between isogenic strains, are responsible for the divergent heteroresistance patterns. Moreover, the isogenic variations are suggestive of a bacterial syntrophic lifestyle when \\\"lockedo inside a host focal airway environment over prolonged periods.\\n\\nSignificance statementBacterial heteroresistance is associated with niche specialized organisms interacting with host species for prolonged period of time, medically characterized by \\\"chronic focal infections\\\". A prime example is found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isogenic/non-homogeneous isolates from patient airways with cystic fibrosis. The development of pseudomonal polarizing MICs in vitro to many actively used antimicrobial agents among isogenic isolates and \\\"Eagle-type\\\" heteroresistance patterns are common and characteristic. Widespread isogenic gene lesions were evident for defects in drug transporters, DNA mismatch repair, and many other structural or cellular functions--a result of pseudomonal symbiotic response to host selection. Co-isolation of extremely susceptible and resistant isogenic Pa strains suggests intra-airway evolution of a multicellular syntrophic bacterial lifestyle, which has laboratory interpretation and clinical treatment implications.",

We aim to investigate if, consequently, the indirect protection of higher valency vaccines could fall short of the profound effects of current formulations.\\n\\nWe compare three previously described pneumococcal models harmonized to simulate 20 serotypes with a combined pre-vaccination prevalence in <5y old children of 40%. We simulate vaccines of increasing valency by adding serotypes in order of their competitiveness and explore their ability to reduce VT carriage by 95% within 10 years after introduction.\\n\\nAll models predict that additional valency will reduce indirect vaccine effects and hence the overall vaccine impact on carriage both in children and adults. Consequently, the minimal effective coverage (efficacy against carriage * vaccine coverage) needed to eliminate vaccine type carriage increases with increasing valency. One model predicts this effect to be modest while the other two predict that high-valency vaccines may struggle to eliminate VT pneumococci unless vaccine efficacy against carriage can be substantially improved. Similar results were obtained when settings of higher transmission intensity and different PCV formulations were explored.\\n\\nFailure to eliminate carriage as a result of increased valency could lead to overall decreased impact of vaccination if the disease burden caused by the added serotypes is low. Hence a comparison of vaccine formulations of varying valency, and pan-valent formulations in particular, should consider the invasiveness of targeted serotypes, as well as efficacy against carriage.",
