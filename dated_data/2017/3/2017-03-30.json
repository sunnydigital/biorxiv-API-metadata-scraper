    "abstract": "Density dependence plays an important role in population regulation and is known to generate temporal fluctuations in population density. However, the ways in which density dependence affects spatial population processes, such as species invasions, are less understood. While classical ecological theory suggests that invasions should advance at a constant speed, empirical work is illuminating the highly variable nature of biological invasions, which often exhibit non-constant spreading speeds even in simple, controlled settings. Here, we explore endogenous density dependence as a mechanism for inducing variability in biological invasions with a set of population models that incorporate density dependence in demographic and dispersal parameters. We show that density dependence in demography at low population densities--i.e., an Allee effect--combined with spatiotemporal variability in population density behind the invasion front can produce fluctuations in spreading speed. The density fluctuations behind the front can arise from either overcompensatory population growth or from density-dependent dispersal, both of which are common in nature. Our results demonstrate that simple rules can generate complex spread dynamics, and highlight a novel source of variability in biological invasions that may aid in ecological forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) play an essential role in shaping eukaryotic genomes and generating variability. Our \\\"Cold Genome\\\" hypothesis postulates that speciation and TEs activity are strongly related in mammals. In order to test this hypothesis, we created two new parameters: the Density of Insertion (DI) and the Relative Rate of Speciation (RRS). The DI is the ratio between the number of TE insertions in a genome and its size, whereas the RRS is a conditional parameter designed to identify potential speciation bursts. Thus, by analyzing TEs insertions in mammals, we defined the genomes as \\\"hot\\\" (low DI) and \\\"cold\\\" (high DI). Then, comparing TEs activity among 16 intra-order pairs of mammalian species, 4 superorders of Eutheria and 29 taxonomical families of the whole Mammalia class, we showed that taxa with positive RRS correlate with \\\"hot\\\" genomes, whereas taxa with negative RRS correlate with \\\"cold\\\" genomes. In addition, our study supports the \\\"Punctuated Equilibria\\\" theory in mammals for both adaptive radiation and stasis.",

    "abstract": "Although neurons in columns of visual cortex of adult carnivores and primates share similar orientation tuning preferences, responses of nearby neurons are surprisingly sparse and temporally uncorrelated, especially in response to complex visual scenes. The mechanisms underlying this counter-intuitive combination of response properties are still unknown. Here we present a computational model of columnar visual cortex which explains experimentally observed integration of complex features across the visual field, and which is consistent with anatomical and physiological profiles of cortical excitation and inhibition. In this model, sparse local excitatory connections within columns, coupled with strong unspecific local inhibition and functionally-specific long-range excitatory connections across columns, give rise to competitive dynamics that reproduce experimental observations. Our results explain surround modulation of responses to simple and complex visual stimuli, including reduced correlation of nearby excitatory neurons, increased excitatory response selectivity, increased inhibitory selectivity, and complex orientation-tuning of surround modulation.",

    "abstract": "Access to primary research data is vital for the advancement of science. To extend the data types supported by community repositories, we built a prototype Image Data Resource (IDR) that collects and integrates imaging data acquired across many different imaging modalities. IDR links high-content screening, super-resolution microscopy, time-lapse and digital pathology imaging experiments to public genetic or chemical databases, and to cell and tissue phenotypes expressed using controlled ontologies. Using this integration, IDR facilitates the analysis of gene networks and reveals functional interactions that are inaccessible to individual studies. To enable re-analysis, we also established a computational resource based on IPython notebooks that allows remote access to the entire IDR. IDR is also an open source platform that others can use to publish their own image data. Thus IDR provides both a novel on-line resource and a software infrastructure that promotes and extends publication and re-analysis of scientific image data.",

Predicting and managing contemporary adaption requires a proper understanding of the determinants of genetic variation. Spatial heterogeneity of the environment may stably maintain polymorphism when habitat contribution to the next generation can be considered independent of the degree of adaptation of local populations within habitats (i.e., under soft selection). In contrast, when habitats contribute proportionally to the mean fitness of the populations they host (hard selection), polymorphism is not expected to be maintained by selection. Although mathematically established decades ago, this prediction had never been properly explored. Here we provide an experimental test in which polymorphic populations of Escherichia coli growing in heterogeneous habitats were exposed to hard and soft selection regimes. As predicted by theory, polymorphism was longer preserved under soft selection. Complementary tests established that soft selection slowed down fixation processes and could even protect polymorphism on the long term by providing a systematic advantage to rare genotypes.",

One strategy for reaching a tractable understanding of circuit function is to seek the simplest dynamical system that can account for the population activity. By imaging Aplysias pedal ganglion during fictive locomotion, here we show that its population-wide activity arises from a low-dimensional spiral attractor. Evoking locomotion moved the population into a low-dimensional, periodic, decaying orbit -a spiral -in which it behaved as a true attractor, converging to the same orbit when evoked, and returning to that orbit after transient perturbation. We found the same attractor in every preparation, and could predict motor output directly from its orbit, yet individual neurons participation changed across consecutive locomotion bouts. From these results, we propose that only the low-dimensional dynamics for movement control, and not the high-dimensional population activity, are consistent within and between nervous systems.",

However, identifying regulatory changes that underlie human-specific traits has proven very challenging. Here, we use 63 DNA methylation maps of ancient and present-day humans, as well as of six chimpanzees, to detect differentially methylated regions that emerged in modern humans after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans. We show that genes affecting the face and vocal tract went through particularly extensive methylation changes. Specifically, we identify widespread hypermethylation in a network of face- and voice-affecting genes (SOX9, ACAN, COL2A1, NFIX and XYLT1). We propose that these repression patterns appeared after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans, and that they might have played a key role in shaping the modern human face and vocal tract.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary biologists commonly assess the evolutionary advantage of an allele based on its effects on the lifetime survival and reproduction of individuals. However, alleles affecting traits like sex, evolvability, and cooperation can cause fitness effects that depend heavily on differences in the environmental, genetic, and social context of individuals carrying the allele. This variability makes it difficult to summarize the evolutionary fate of an allele based solely on its effects on any one individual. In this review we show how attempts to average over variability in the fitness effects of an allele can sometimes cause misleading results. We then describe a number of intriguing new evolutionary phenomena that have emerged in studies that explicitly model the fate of alleles that influence long-term lineage dynamics. We conclude with prospects for generalizations of population genetics theory and discuss how this theory might be applied to the evolution of infectious diseases.",

Interferon/peginterferon and ribavirin combination therapy was the backbone of chronic HCV therapy for two decades of the journey. However, the interferon based treatment success rate was around 50% with many side effects. Many chronic HCV patients with psychiatric diseases, or even cytopenias, were ineligible for HCV treatment. Now, we no longer need any injectable medicine. New direct-acting antiviral agents against HCV allowed the advance of interferon-free and ribavirin-free oral regimens with high rates of response and tolerability. The cost of the medications should not be a barrier to their access in certain parts of the world. While we are getting closer, we should still focus on preventing the spread of the disease, screening and delivering the cure globally to those in need. In the near future, development of an effective vaccine against HCV would make it possible to eradicate HCV infection worldwide completely.",

    "abstract": "Perception can be described as a process of inference, integrating bottom-up sensory inputs and top-down expectations. However, it is unclear how this process is neurally implemented. It has been proposed that expectations lead to pre-stimulus baseline increases in sensory neurons tuned to the expected stimulus, which in turn affects the processing of subsequent stimuli. Recent fMRI studies have revealed stimulus-specific patterns of activation in sensory cortex as a result of expectation, but this method lacks the temporal resolution necessary to distinguish pre- from post-stimulus processes. Here, we combined human MEG with multivariate decoding techniques to probe the representational content of neural signals in a time-resolved manner. We observed a representation of expected stimuli in the neural signal well before they were presented, demonstrating that expectations indeed induce a pre-activation of stimulus templates. These results suggest a mechanism for how predictive perception can be neurally implemented.",

In the case of craft beer, this has traditionally only encompassed locally sourced barley, hops, and other agricultural adjuncts. The identification and use of novel yeasts in brewing lags behind. We sought to bridge this gap by bio-prospecting for wild yeasts, with a focus on the American Midwest. We isolated 284 different strains from 54 species of yeast and have begun to determine their fermentation characteristics. During this work, we found several isolates of five species that produce lactic acid and ethanol during wort fermentation: Hanseniaspora vineae, Lachancea fermentati, Lachancea thermotolerans, Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, and Wickerhamomyces anomalus. Tested representatives of these species yielded excellent attenuation, lactic acid production, and sensory characteristics, positioning them as viable alternatives to lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for the production of sour beers. Indeed, we suggest a new LAB-free paradigm for sour beer production that we term \\\"primary souring\\\" because the lactic acid production and resultant pH decrease occurs during primary fermentation, as opposed to kettle souring or souring via mixed culture fermentation.\\n\\nChemical compounds studied in this article: Lactic acid (PubChem CID: 612); Ethanol (PubChem CID: 702)\\n\\nAbbreviations: ABV, alcohol by volume; DIC, differential interference contrast; EtOH, ethanol; FG, final gravity; gDNA, genomic DNA; IBU, international bittering unit; LAB, lactic acid bacteria; LASSO, lactic acid specific soft-agar overlay; N-J, neighbor-joining; OG, original gravity; WLN, Wallerstein Laboratories nutrient; YPD, yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose",

    "abstract": "Non-random, dynamic three-dimensional organization of the nucleus is important for regulation of gene expression. Numerous studies using chromosome conformation capture strategies have uncovered ensemble organizational principles of individual chromosomes, including organization into active (A) and inactive (B) compartments. In addition, large inactive regions of the genome appear to be associated with the nuclear lamina, the so-called Lamina Associated Domains (LADs). However, the interrelationship between overall chromosome conformation and association of domains with the nuclear lamina remains unclear. In particular, the 3D organization of LADs within the context of the entire chromosome has not been investigated. In this study, we describe \\\"chromosome conformation paints\\\" to determine the relationship in situ between LAD and non-LAD regions of the genome in single cells. We find that LADs organize into constrained and compact regions at the nuclear lamina, and these findings are supported by an integrated analysis of both DamID and Hi-C data. Using a refined algorithm to identify active (A) and inactive (B) compartments from Hi-C data, we demonstrate that the LADs correspond to the B compartment. We demonstrate that in situ single cell chromosome organization is strikingly predicted by integrating both Hi-C and DamID data into a chromosome conformation model. In addition, using the chromosome conformation paints, we demonstrate that LAD (and B-compartment) organization is dependent upon both chromatin state and Lamin A/C. Finally, we demonstrate that small regions within LADs escape the repressive regime at the peripheral zone to interact with the A-compartment and are enriched for both transcription start sites (TSSs) and active enhancers.",

    "abstract": "The extent of non-additive interaction among mutations or epistasis reflects the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, the mapping of genotype to reproductive fitness. In protein evolution, there is strong support for the importance and prevalence of epistasis, but whether there is a universal mechanism behind epistasis remains unknown. It is also unclear which of the biophysical properties of proteins--folding stability, activity, binding affinity, and dynamics--have the strongest contribution to epistasis. Here, we determine the contribution of selection for folding stability to epistasis in protein evolution. By combining theoretical estimates of the rates of molecular evolution and protein folding thermodynamics, we show that simple selection for folding stability implies that at least ~30% to ~60% of among amino acid substitutions would have experienced epistasis. Additionally, our model predicts substantial epistasis at marginal stabilities therefore linking epistasis to the strength of selection. Estimating the contribution of governing factors in molecular evolution such as protein folding stability to epistasis will provide a better understanding of epistasis that could improve methods in molecular evolution.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer can have profound effects on bacterial evolution by allowing individuals to rapidly acquire adaptive traits that shape their strategies for competition. One strategy for intermicrobial antagonism often used by Proteobacteria is the genetically-encoded contact-dependent Type VI secretion system (T6SS); a weapon used to kill heteroclonal neighbors by direct injection of toxic effectors. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that Vibrio cholerae can acquire new T6SS effector genes via horizontal transfer and utilize them to kill neighboring cells. Replacement of one or more parental alleles with novel effectors allows the recombinant strain to dramatically outcompete its parent. Through spatially-explicit simulation modeling, we show that the HGT is risky: transformation brings a cell into conflict with its former clonemates, but can be adaptive when superior T6SS alleles are acquired. More generally, we find that these costs and benefits are not symmetric, and that high rates of HGT can act as hedge against competitors with unpredictable T6SS efficacy. We conclude that antagonism and horizontal transfer drive successive rounds of weapons-optimization and selective sweeps, dynamically shaping the composition of microbial communities.",

DNA cleavage of Cas9 is controlled by the conformational state of the HNH nuclease domain, but the mechanism that governs HNH activation at on-target DNA while reducing cleavage activity at off-target sites remains poorly understood. Using single-molecule FRET, we identified an intermediate state of S. pyogenes Cas9, representing a conformational checkpoint between DNA binding and cleavage. Upon DNA binding, the HNH domain transitions between multiple conformations before docking into its active state. HNH docking requires divalent cations, but not strand scission, and this docked conformation persists following DNA cleavage. Sequence mismatches between the DNA target and guide RNA prevent transitions from the checkpoint intermediate to the active conformation, providing selective avoidance of DNA cleavage at stably bound off-target sites.",

    "abstract": "Noonan syndrome (NS) is caused by mutations in RAS/ERK pathway genes, and is characterized by craniofacial, growth, cognitive and cardiac defects. NS patients with kinase-activating RAF1 alleles typically develop pathological left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which is reproduced in Raf1L613V/+ knock-in mice. Here, using inducible Raf1L613V expression, we show that LVH results from the interplay of cardiac cell types. Cardiomyocyte Raf1L613V enhances Ca2+ sensitivity and cardiac contractility without causing hypertrophy. Raf1L613V expression in cardiomyocytes or activated fibroblasts exacerbates pressure overload-evoked fibrosis. Endothelial/endocardial (EC) Raf1L613V causes cardiac hypertrophy without affecting contractility. Co-culture and neutralizing antibody experiments reveal a cytokine (TNF/IL6) hierarchy in Raf1L613V-expressing ECs that drives cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro. Furthermore, post-natal TNF inhibition normalizes the increased wall thickness and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vivo. We conclude that NS cardiomyopathy involves cardiomyocytes, ECs, and fibroblasts, TNF/IL6 signaling components represent potential therapeutic targets, and abnormal EC signaling might contribute to other forms of LVH.",

Extensive studies have shown that CME proteins actively modulate the plasma membrane curvature1,3,4. However, the reciprocal regulation of how plasma membrane curvature affects the activities of endocytic proteins is much less explored, despite studies suggesting that membrane curvature itself can trigger biochemical reactions5-8. This gap in our understanding is largely due to technical challenges in precisely controlling the membrane curvature in live cells. In this work, we use patterned nanostructures to generate well-defined membrane curvatures ranging from +50 nm to -500 nm radius of curvature. We find that the positively curved membranes are CME hotspots, and that key CME proteins, clathrin and dynamin, show a strong preference toward positive membrane curvatures with a radius < 200 nm. Of ten CME related proteins we examined, all show preferences to positively curved membrane. By contrast, other membrane-associated proteins and non-CME endocytic protein, caveolin1, show no such curvature preference. Therefore, nanostructured substrates constitute a novel tool for investigating curvature-dependent processes in live cells.",

However, why MYOD can efficiently convert some cell types into myotubes but not others remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze MYOD-mediated reprogramming of human fibroblasts at pseudotemporal resolution using single-cell RNA-Seq. Successfully reprogrammed cells navigate a trajectory with two branches that correspond to two barriers to reprogramming, with cells that select incorrect branches terminating at aberrant or incomplete reprogramming outcomes. Differential analysis of the major branch points alongside alignment of the successful reprogramming path to a primary myoblast trajectory revealed Insulin and BMP signaling as crucial molecular determinants of an individual cells reprogramming outcome, that when appropriately modulated, increased efficiency more than five-fold. Our single-cell analysis reveals that MYOD is sufficient to reprogram cells only when the extracellular milieu is favorable, supporting MYOD with upstream signaling pathways that drive normal myogenesis in development.",

ROS are essential for antigen specific activation of T cells, but little is known about what role ROS play in NKT cells. In the current study, we investigated the role of ROS in NKT cell function. We found that ROS levels are similar among CD4, CD8 and NKT cell subsets in the thymus. However, NKT cells, but neither CD4 nor CD8 T cells, showed dramatically increased ROS in the spleen and liver but not in adipose tissues. ROS in the peripheral NKT cells were primarily produced by NADPH oxidases not mitochondria. Accordingly, ROS-high NKT cells were susceptible to oxidative stress and underwent apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, ROS play an important role in regulating the inflammatory function of NKT cells because antioxidant treatment of NKT cells showed reduced frequencies of IFN-{gamma}+ and IL-17+ cells. In line with this, freshly isolated ROS-high NKT cells had more NKT1 and NKT17 cells but less NKT2 than ROS-low cells. These characteristics are regulated by promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) as evidenced by low ROS in NKT cells from PLZF haplodeficient mice and also from adipose tissues that do not express PLZF. Conversely, ROS were highly elevated in CD4 T cells from mice ectopically expressing PLZF. Together, our study revealed for the first time that ROS regulate NKT cell functions through PLZF.",

    "abstract": "The spread of drug-resistant bacterial pathogens pose a major threat to global health. It is widely recognised that the widespread use of antibiotics has generated selective pressures that have driven the emergence of resistant strains. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was first observed in 1960, less than one year after the introduction of this second generation {beta}-lactam antibiotic into clinical practice. Epidemiological evidence has always suggested that resistance arose around this period, when the mecA gene encoding methicillin resistance carried on an SCCmec element, was horizontally transferred to an intrinsically sensitive strain of S. aureus. Whole genome sequencing a collection of the very first MRSA isolates allowed us to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the archetypal MRSA. Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction was applied to infer the time point at which this early MRSA lineage arose and when SCCmec was acquired. MRSA emerged in the mid 1940s, following the acquisition of an ancestral type I SCCmec element, some fourteen years prior to the first therapeutic use of methicillin. Methicillin use was not the original driving factor in the evolution of MRSA as previously thought. Rather it was the widespread use of first generation {beta}-lactams such as penicillin in the years prior to the introduction of methicillin, which selected for S. aureus strains carrying the mecA determinant. Crucially this highlights how new drugs, introduced to circumvent known resistance mechanisms, can be rendered ineffective by unrecognised adaptations in the bacterial population due to the historic selective landscape created by the widespread use of other antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Our knowledge of cell cycle regulatory mechanisms in apicomplexan parasites is very limited. In this study, we describe a novel Toxoplasma gondii factor, essential for chromosome replication 1 (ECR1), that has a vital role in chromosome replication and the regulation of cytoplasmic and nuclear mitotic structures. ECR1 was discovered by complementation of a temperature sensitive (ts) mutant that suffers lethal, uncontrolled chromosome replication at 40{degrees}C similar to a ts-mutant carrying a defect in topoisomerase. ECR1 is a 52kDa protein containing divergent RING and TRAF-Sina like zinc-binding domains that is dynamically expressed in the tachyzoite cell cycle. ECR1 first appears in the centrocone compartment of the nuclear envelope in early S phase and then in the nucleus in late S phase where it reaches maximum expression. Following nuclear division, but before daughters resolve from the mother, ECR1 is down regulated and is absent in new daughter parasites. The proteomics of ECR1 identified interactions with the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation machinery and the minichromosome maintenance complex and the loss of ECR1 led to increased stability of a key member of this complex, MCM2. ECR1 also forms a stable complex with the CDK-related kinase, TgCrk5, which shares a similar cell cycle expression and localization during tachyzoite replication. Altogether, the results of this study suggest ECR1 may be a unique E3 ligase that regulates DNA licensing and other mitotic processes. Importantly, the localization of ECR1/TgCrk5 in the centrocone indicates this Apicomplexa-specific spindle compartment houses important regulatory factors that control the parasite cell cycle.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEParasites of the apicomplexan family are important causes of human disease including malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis. Parasite growth is the underlying cause of pathogenesis, yet despite this importance the molecular basis for parasite replication is poorly understood. Filling this knowledge gap cannot be accomplished by mining recent whole genome sequencing because apicomplexan cell cycles differ substantially and lack many of the key regulatory factors of well-studied yeast and mammalian cell division models. We have utilized forward genetics to discover essential factors that regulate cell division in these parasites using the Toxoplasma gondii model. An example of this approach is described here with the discovery of a putative E3 ligase/protein kinase mechanism involved in regulating chromosome replication and mitotic processes of asexual stage parasites.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a type of metabolic disease marked by hyperglycemia, and 90% of diabetes cases are type 2 diabetes mellitus. More than half of patients are not diagnosed at all or are diagnosed too late to be effectively treated, resulting in nonspecific symptoms and a long period of incubation of the disease. Pre-diabetes mellitus, also known as impaired glucose regulation, is an early warning signal of diabetes, which has long been determinated by impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. In this study, Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats were used to test if there were changes in urine glucose before blood glucose increases. Six 8-week-old male ZDF rats (fa/fa) and Zucker lean (ZL) rats (fa/+) were fed with Purina 5008 high-fat diet and tested for fasting blood glucose and urine glucose. After 12 weeks of feeding, the urine glucose values of the ZL rats were normal (0-10 mmol/L), but the values of the ZDF model rats increased 10 weeks before their blood glucose levels elevated. The urine glucose values of the ZDF model rats showed a state of disorder that was frequently elevated (>10 mmol/L) and occasionally normal (0-10 mmol/L). This finding may provide an easy early diagnosis. Screening for human diabetes can be considered by frequently monitoring urine glucose levels: pre-diabetes may be revealed by frequently disordered urine glucose levels over a period.",

Major theories of consciousness make distinct predictions about the role of PFC, providing an opportunity to arbitrate between these views empirically. Here we address three common misconceptions: i) PFC lesions do not affect subjective perception; ii) PFC activity does not reflect specific perceptual content; iii) PFC involvement in studies of perceptual awareness is solely driven by the need to make reports required by the experimental tasks, rather than subjective experience per se. These claims are incompatible with empirical findings, unless one focuses only on studies using methods with limited sensitivity. The literature highlights PFCs essential role in enabling the subjective experience in perception, contra the objective capacity to perform visual tasks; conflating the two can also be a source of confusion.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMany individuals with Parkinsons disease exhibit narrow stance width during balance and gait. Because of this, stance width is an important biomechanical variable in many studies. Measuring stance width accurately using kinematic markers in parkinsonian patients can be problematic due to occlusions by research staff who must closely guard patients to prevent falls.\\n\\nMethodsWe investigated whether a measure of stance width based on the mediolateral distance between the center of pressure under each foot could approximate stance width measured with kinematic data. We assessed the agreement between estimates of stance width obtained from simultaneous kinematic and center of pressure measures during quiet standing in 15 individuals (n=9 parkinsonian, n=6 age-similar neurotypical). The source data (1363 unique trials) contained observations of stance width varying between 75-384 mm ({approx}25-150% of hip width).\\n\\nFindingsStance width estimates using the two measures were strongly correlated (r = 0.98). Center of pressure estimates of stance width were 48 mm wider on average than kinematic measures, and did not vary across study groups (F2,12=1.81, P<0.21). The expected range of differences between the center of pressure and kinematic methods was 14-83 mm. Agreement increased as stance width increased (P<0.02).\\n\\nInterpretationIt is appropriate to define stance width based on center of pressure when it is convenient to do so in studies of individuals with and without Parkinsons disease. When comparing results across studies with the two methodologies, it is reasonable to assume a bias of 48 mm.",

    "abstract": "Sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.] is one of the most important crops in many developing countries and provides a candidate source of bioenergy. However, neither high-quality reference genome nor large-scale full-length cDNA sequences for this outcrossing hexaploid are still lacking, which in turn impedes progress in research studies in sweetpotato functional genomics and molecular breeding. In this study, we apply a combination of second- and third-generation sequencing technologies to sequence full-length transcriptomes in sweetpotato and its putative ancestor I. trifida. In total, we obtained 53,861/51,184 high-quality transcripts, which includes 34,963/33,637 putative full-length cDNA sequences, from sweetpotato/I. trifida. Amongst, we identified 104,540/94,174 open reading frames, 1476/1475 transcription factors, 25,315/27,090 simple sequence repeats, 417/531 long non-coding RNAs out of the sweetpotato/I. trifida dataset. By utilizing public available genomic contigs, we analyzed the gene features (including exon number, exon size, intron number, intron size, exon-intron structure) of 33,119 and 32,793 full-length transcripts in sweetpotato and I. trifida, respectively. Furthermore, comparative analysis between our transcript datasets and other large-scale cDNA datasets from different plant species enables us assessing the quality of public datasets, estimating the genetic similarity across relative species, and surveyed the evolutionary pattern of genes. Overall, our study provided fundamental resources of large-scale full-length transcripts in sweetpotato and its putative ancestor, for the first time, and would facilitate structural, functional and comparative genomics studies in this important crop.",

    "abstract": "Cell population heterogeneity is increasingly a focus of inquiry in biological research. For example, cell migration studies have investigated the heterogeneity of invasiveness and taxis in development, wound healing, and cancer. However, relatively little effort has been devoted to explore when heterogeneity is mechanistically relevant and how to reliably measure it. Statistical methods from the animal movement literature offer the potential to analyse heterogeneity in collections of cell tracking data. A popular measure of heterogeneity, which we use here as an example, is the distribution of delays in directional cross-correlation. Using a suitably generic, yet minimal, model of collective cell movement in three dimensions, we show how using such measures to quantify heterogeneity in tracking data can result in the inference of heterogeneity where there is none. Our study highlights a potential pitfall in the statistical analysis of cell population heterogeneity, and we argue this can be mitigated by the appropriate choice of null models.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIgroups of identical cells appear heterogeneous due to limited sampling and experimental repeatability\\nC_LIO_LIheterogeneity bias increases with attraction/repulsion between cells\\nC_LIO_LImovement in confined environments decreases apparent heterogeneity\\nC_LIO_LIhypothetical applications in neural crest and in vitro cancer systems\\nC_LI\\n\\nIn BriefWe use a mathematical model to show how cell populations can appear heterogeneous in their migratory characteristics, even though they are made up of identically-behaving individual cells.

    "abstract": "The regulatory interactions in a cell control cellular response to environmental and genetic perturbations. Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference from high-throughput gene expression data helps to identify unknown regulatory interactions in a cell. One of the main challenges in the GRN inference is to identify complex biological interactions from the limited information contained in the gene expression data. Using prior biological knowledge, in addition to the gene expression data, is a common method to overcome this challenge. However, only a few GRN inference methods can inherently incorporate the prior knowledge and these methods are also not among the best-ranked in benchmarking studies.\\n\\nWe propose to incorporate the prior knowledge after the GRN inference so that any inference method can be used. Two algorithms have been developed and tested on the well studied Escherichia coli, yeast, and realistic in silico networks. Their accuracy is higher than the best-ranking method in the latest community-wide benchmarking study. Further, one of the algorithms identifies and removes wrong interactions predicted by the inference methods. With half of the available prior knowledge of interactions, around 970 additional correct edges were obtained and 1300 wrong interactions were removed. Moreover, the limitation that only a few GRN inference methods can incorporate the prior knowledge is overcome. Therefore, a post-inference method of incorporating the prior knowledge improves accuracy, removes wrong edges, and overcomes the limitation of GRN inference methods.",

    "abstract": "An outstanding challenge in the design of synthetic biocircuits is the development of a robust and efficient strategy for interconnecting functional modules. Recent work demonstrated that a phosphorylation-based insulator (PBI) implementing a dual strategy of high gain and strong negative feedback can be used as a device to attenuate retroactivity. This paper describes the implementation of such a biological circuit in a cell-free transcription-translation system and the structural identifiability of the PBI in the system. We first show that the retroactivity also exists in the cell-free system by testing a simple negative regulation circuit. Then we demonstrate that the PBI circuit helps attenuate the retroactivity significantly compared to the control. We consider a complex model that provides an intricate description of all chemical reactions and leveraging specific physiologically plausible assumptions. We derive a rigorous simplified model that captures the output dynamics of the PBI. We perform standard system identification analysis and determine that the model is globally identifiable with respect to three critical parameters. These three parameters are identifiable under specific experimental conditions and we perform these experiments to estimate the parameters. Our experimental results suggest that the functional form of our simplified model is sufficient to describe the reporter dynamics and enable parameter estimation. In general, this research illustrates the utility of the cell-free expression system as an alternate platform for biocircuit implementation and system identification and it can provide helpful insights into future biological circuit designs.",

In this work, we apply state-of-the art causal discovery methods on a large collection of public mass cytometry data sets, measuring intra-cellular signaling proteins of the human immune system and their response to several perturbations. We show how different experimental conditions can be used to facilitate causal discovery, and apply two fundamental methods that produce context-specific causal predictions.

    "abstract": "Methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), the mutated protein in Rett syndrome (RTT), is a crucial chromatin-modifying and gene-regulatory protein that has two main isoforms (MeCP2_E1 and MeCP2_ E2) due to the alternative splicing and switching between translation start codons in exons one and two. Functionally, these two isoforms appear to be virtually identical; however, evidence suggests that only MeCP2_E1 is relevant to RTT, including a single RTT missense mutation in exon 1, p.Ala2Val. Here, we show that N-terminal co- and post- translational modifications differ for MeCP2_E1, MeCP2_E1-p.Ala2Val and MeCP2_E2, which result in different protein degradation rates in vitro. We report partial N-methionine excision (NME) for MeCP2_E2, whereas NME for MeCP2_E1 is complete. Surprisingly, we also observed evidence of excision of multiple alanine residues from the N-terminal polyalanine stretch. Regarding MeCP2_E1-Ala2Val, we also observed only partial NME and N-acetylation (NA) of either methionine or valine. The localization of MeCP2_E1 and co-localization with chromatin appear to be unaffected by the p.Ala2Val mutation. However, a higher proteasomal degradation rate was observed for MeCP2_E1-Ala2Val compared with that for wild type (WT) MeCP2_E1. Thus, the etiopathology of p.Ala2Val is likely due to a reduced bio-availability of MeCP2 because of the faster degradation rate of the unmodified defective protein. MeCP2_E1 is thought to have a much higher translational efficiency than MeCP2_E2. Our data suggest that this increased efficiency may be balanced by a higher degradation rate. The higher turnover rate of the MeCP2_E1 protein suggests that it may play a more dynamic role in cells than MeCP2_E2.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe Rett syndrome protein, MeCP2, undergoes a number of modifications before becoming functionally active in the bodys cells. Here, we report the presence of N-terminal modifications in both MeCP2 isoforms, MeCP2_E1 and MeCP2_E2, and that the only reported Rett missense mutation in exon 1, p.Ala2Val, disrupts these modifications, decreasing the longevity of the protein. Interestingly, p.Ala2Val mutations have been reported in many other disease genes, such as DKCX, ECHS1, IRF6, SMN1, and TNNI3, and the etiopathological mechanism(s) have never been explained. Thus, this work is important not only for the understanding of the pathophysiology of Rett syndrome but also for a deeper understanding of the effects of genetic mutations at the N-terminal end of genes in general.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundE. coli ST131-H30 is a globally important pathogen implicated in rising rates of multidrug resistance among E. coli causing extraintestinal infections. Previous studies have focused on adults, leaving the epidemiology of H30 among children undefined.\\n\\nMethodsWe used clinical data and isolates from a case-control study of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli conducted at four US childrens hospitals to estimate the burden and identify host correlates of infection with H30. H30 isolates were identified using two-locus genotyping; host correlates were examined using log-binomial regression models stratified by extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance status.\\n\\nResultsA total of 339 extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant and 1008 extended-spectrum cephalosporin-susceptible E. coli isolates were available for analyses. The estimated period prevalence of H30 was 5.3% among all extraintestinal E. coli isolates (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.6%-7.1%); H30 made up 43.3% (81/187) of ESBL-producing isolates in this study. Host correlates of infection with H30 differed by extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance status: among resistant isolates, age [&le;]5 years was positively associated with H30 infection (relative risk [RR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.19-2.83); among susceptible isolates, age [&le;]5 years was negatively associated with H30 (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.27-0.87), while presence of an underlying medical condition was positively associated (RR 4.49, 95% CI 2.43-8.31).\\n\\nConclusionsST131-H30 is less common among extraintestinal E. coli collected from children compared to reported estimates among adults, possibly reflecting infrequent fluoroquinolone use in pediatrics; however, it is similarly dominant among ESBL-producing isolates. The H30 subclone appears to disproportionately affect young children relative to other extendedspectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli.\\n\\nSummaryST131-H30 was responsible for 5.3% of all extraintestinal E. coli infections and 43.3% of ESBL-producing extraintestinal E. coli infections among US children. The clinical and demographic correlates of infection with ST131-H30 differed between extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant and -sensitive isolates.",

    "abstract": "Unlike synaptic strength, intrinsic excitability is assumed to be a stable property of neurons. For example, learning of somatic conductances is generally not incorporated into computational models, and the discharge pattern of neurons in response to test stimuli is frequently used as a basis for phenotypic classification. However, it is increasingly evident that signal processing properties of neurons are more generally plastic on the timescale of minutes. Here we demonstrate that the intrinsic firing patterns of CA3 neurons of the rat hippocampus in vitro undergo rapid long-term plasticity in response to a few minutes of only subthreshold synaptic conditioning. This plasticity on the spike-timing could also be induced by intrasomatic injection of subthreshold depolarizing pulses and was blocked by kinase inhibitors, indicating that discharge dynamics are modulated locally. Cluster analysis of firing patterns before and after conditioning revealed systematic transitions towards adapting and intrinsic burst behaviours, irrespective of the patterns initially exhibited by the cells. We used a conductance-based model to decide appropriate pharmacological blockade, and found that the observed transitions are likely due to recruitment of calcium and M-type potassium conductances. We conclude that CA3 neurons adapt their conductance profile to the subthreshold activity of their input, so that their intrinsic firing pattern is not a static signature, but rather a reflection of their history of subthreshold activity. In this way, recurrent output from CA3 neurons may collectively shape the temporal dynamics of their embedding circuits.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyDespite being widely conserved across the animal phyla, it is still a mystery why nerve cells present diverse discharge dynamics upon somatic step currents. Adding a new timing dimension to the intrinsic plasticity literature, here we show that CA3 neurons rapidly adapt through the space of known firing patterns in response to the subthreshold signals that they receive from their embedding circuit. This result implies that CA3 neurons collectively adjust their network processing to the temporal statistics of their circuit.",
