    "abstract": "A major challenge in gene expression analysis is to accurately infer relevant biological insight, such as regulation of cell type proportion or pathways, from global gene expression studies. We present a general solution for this problem that outperforms available cell proportion inference algorithms, and is more widely useful to automatically identify specific pathways that regulate gene expression. Our method improves replicability and biological insight when applied to trans-eQTL identification.",

    "abstract": "The North Slope of Alaska contains arctic fish populations that are important for subsistence of local human populations, and are under threat from natural resource extraction and climate change. We designed and evaluated four quantitative PCR assays for the detection of environmental DNA from five Alaskan fish species present on the North Slope of Alaska: burbot (Lota lota), arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma), arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus), and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus). All assays were designed and tested for species specificity and sensitivity, and all assays detected target species from filtered water samples collected from the field. These assays will enable efficient and economical detection and monitoring of these species in lakes and rivers. This in turn will provide managers with improved knowledge of current distributions and future range shifts associated with climate and development threats, enabling more timely management.",

    "abstract": "RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become a preferred option to quantify gene expression, because it is more accurate and reliable than microarrays. In RNA-Seq experiments, the expression level of a gene is measured by the count of short reads that are mapped to the gene region. Although some normal-based statistical methods may also be applied to log-transformed read counts, they are not ideal for directly modeling RNA-Seq data. Two discrete distributions, Poisson distribution and negative binomial distribution, have been commonly used in the literature to model RNA-Seq data, where the latter is a natural extension of the former with allowance of overdispersion. Due to the technical difficulty in modeling correlated counts, most existing classifiers based on discrete distributions assume that genes are independent of each other. However, as we show in this paper, the independence assumption may cause non-ignorable bias in estimating the discriminant score, making the classification inaccurate. To this end, we drop the independence assumption and explicitly model the dependence between genes using Gaussian copula. We apply a Bayesian approach to estimate covariance matrix and the overdispersion parameter in negative binomial distribution. Both synthetic data and real data are used to demonstrate the advantages of our model.",

    "abstract": "Glycosylation is a universal strategy to post-translationally modify proteins. The recently discovered arginine rhamnosylation activates the polyproline specific bacterial translation elongation factor EF-P. EF-P is rhamnosylated on arginine 32 by the glycosyltransferase EarP. However, the enzymatic mechanism remains elusive. In the present study, we solved the crystal structure of EarP from Pseudomonas putida. The enzyme is composed of two opposing domains with Rossmann-folds, thus constituting a GT-B glycosyltransferase. While TDP-rhamnose is located within a highly conserved pocket of the C-domain, EarP recognizes the EF-P via its KOW-like N-domain. Based on our structural data combined with an in vitro /in vivo enzyme characterization, we propose a mechanism of inverting arginine glycosylation. As EarP is essential for pathogenicity in P. aeruginosa our study provides the basis for targeted inhibitor design.",

    "abstract": "Outbreaks caused by asexual lineages of fungal and oomycete pathogens are an expanding threat to crops, wild animals and natural ecosystems (Fisher et al. 2012,Kupferschmidt 2012). However, the mechanisms underlying genome evolution and phenotypic plasticity in asexual eukaryotic microbes remain poorly understood (Seidl and Thomma 2014). Ever since the 19th century Irish famine, the oomycete Phytophthora infestans has caused recurrent outbreaks on potato and tomato crops that have been primarily caused by the successive rise and migration of pandemic asexual lineages (Cooke et al. 2012, Yoshida et al. 2013,Yoshida et al. 2014). Here, we reveal patterns of genomic and gene expression variation within a P. infestans asexual lineage by compared sibling strains belonging to the South American EC-1 clone that has dominated Andean populations since the 1990s (Forbes et al. 1997, Oyarzun et al. 1998, Delgado et al. 2013, Yoshida et al. 2013, Yoshida et al. 2014). We detected numerous examples of structural variation, nucleotide polymorphisms and gene conversion within the EC-1 clone. Remarkably, 17 genes are not expressed in one of the two EC-1 isolates despite apparent absence of sequence polymorphisms. Among these, silencing of an effector gene was associated with evasion of disease resistance conferred by a potato immune receptor. These results highlight the exceptional genetic and phenotypic plasticity that underpins host adaptation in a pandemic clonal lineage of a eukaryotic plant pathogen.",

These findings withstood robust attempts at falsification. Fine-mapping did not serve to narrow the interval (minimum P=1.13xl0-14), and functional genomic integration (including 5C data we generated for this region) did not provide a mechanistic hypothesis. Controls carrying a risk haplotype had significantly longer and more variable FMR1 CGG repeats than controls with the protective haplotype (P=4.75x10-5) which may predispose toward increases in CGG number to the pre-mutation range over many generations.

Here, we report a new approach, circScan, to identify regulatory interactions between circRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) by discovering back-splicing reads from Cross-Linking and Immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) data. By using our method, we have systematically scanned ~1500 CLIP-seq datasets, and identified ~12540 and ~1090 novel circRNA-RBP interactions in human and mouse genomes, respectively, which include all known interactions between circRNAs and Argonaute (AGO) proteins. More than twenty novel interactions were further experimentally confirmed by RNA Immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR (RIP-qPCR). Importantly, we uncovered that some natural circRNAs interacted with cap-independent translation factors eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) and N6-Methyladenosine (m6A), indicating they can be translated into proteins. These findings demonstrate that circRNAs are regulated by various RBPs, suggesting they may play important roles in diverse biological processes.",

    "abstract": "Scientists have observed theta rhythms (3-12 Hz) in the hippocampus for decades, but we do not have a clear understanding of how they are generated. This is largely due to the complex, multi-scale and nonlinear nature of the brain. To obtain insight into mechanisms underlying the generation of theta rhythms, we develop cellular-based network models of the hippocampus based on a whole hippocampus in vitro preparation that spontaneously generates theta rhythms. Building on theoretical and computational analyses, we find that spike frequency adaptation and post-inhibitory rebound constitute a basis for theta generation in large, minimally connected CA1 pyramidal (PYR) cell network models with fast-firing parvalbumin-positive (PV+) inhibitory cells. The particular theta frequency is more controlled by PYR to PV+ cell interactions rather than PV+ to PYR cell ones. We identify two scenarios by which theta rhythms can emerge and they can be differentiated by the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory currents to PV+ cells, but not to PYR cells. Only one of the scenarios is consistent with data from the whole hippocampus preparation, which leads to the prediction that the connection probability from PV+ to PYR cells needs to be larger than from PYR to PV+ cells. Our models can serve as a platform on which to build and develop an understanding of in vivo theta generation, and of microcircuit dynamics in the hippocampus.\\n\\nSignificanceBrain rhythms have been linked to cognition and are disrupted in disease. This makes it essential to understand mechanisms underlying their generation. Theory and mathematical models help provide an understanding and generate hypotheses. Together with experiment they contribute a framework to dissect the cellular contributions to network activity. However, models are inherently biological approximations, and thus the specific experimental and theoretical context upon which they are built will shape their output. If the approximations and contexts are not taken into account, particularly when using previously constructed models, misinterpretations can arise. Here, we use both theory and microcircuit models derived from a specific experimental context to provide insight into cellular-based mechanisms involved in theta rhythm generation in the hippocampus.",

However, the molecular basis for treatment resistance, the impact that radiation and other adjuvant therapies have in promoting recurrence, and the use of this information to rationally design effective approaches to treat recurrent ependymoma are unknown. Due to the rarity of these tumors and the even less likely banking of multiple recurrent samples from the same patient, we initiated a study to characterize the evolution of a single patients ependymoma in response to therapy.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsA combination of high depth, whole genome and exome-based DNA sequencing of germline and tumor specimens, RNA sequencing of tumor specimens, and advanced computational analyses were employed to reconstruct the natural history of a supratentorial ependymoma case in which there were four local recurrences. The findings reveal the extent to which treatment with radiation and chemotherapies resulted in the diversification of the tumor subclonal architecture and shaped the neo-antigen landscape, and provide new insights into possible molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis, treatment response and recurrence.\\n\\nConclusionsAlthough the recurrent tumors we studied were clearly shaped by therapy, the founding clone was never eradicated by any treatment. We conclude that DNA and RNA sequencing may provide critical prognostic indicators to identify ependymoma patients that should be observed, rather than irradiated, post gross total resection.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is the main cellular route for protein degradation in plants and is important for a wide range of biological processes including daily and seasonal timing. The UPS relies on the action of E3 ubiquitin ligases to specifically recognize substrate proteins and facilitate their ubiquitylation. In plants, there are three major challenges that inhibit studies of E3 ligase function: 1) rampant genetic redundancy, 2) labile interactions between an E3 ligase and its cognate substrates, and 3) a lack of tools for rapid validation of bona fide substrates. To overcome these 3 challenges, we have developed a decoy method that allows for rapid genetic analysis of E3 ligases, in vivo identification of substrates using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, and reconstitution of the ubiquitylation reaction in mammalian cells to rapidly validate potential substrates. We employ the strategy to study the plant F-box proteins, ZTL, LKP2, and FKF1 revealing differential genetic impacts on circadian clock period and seasonal flowering. We identify a group of circadian clock transcriptional regulators that interact with ZTL, LKP2, and FKF1 in vivo providing a host of potential substrates that have not been seen previously. We then validate one substrate of ZTL, the plant circadian clock transcription factor CHE, and show that ZTL mediates CHE ubiquitylation and that the levels of the CHE protein cycle in daily timecourses. This work further untangles the complicated genetic roles of this family of E3 ligases and suggests that ZTL is a master regulator of a diverse set of critical clock transcription factors. Furthermore, the method that is validated here can be tool employed widely to overcome traditional challenges in studying redundant plant E3 ubiquitin ligases.",
