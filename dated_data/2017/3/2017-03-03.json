    "abstract": "A quantitative model to genetically interpret the histology in whole microscopy slide images is desirable to guide downstream immuno-histochemistry, genomics, and precision medicine. We constructed a statistical model that predicts whether or not SPOP is mutated in prostate cancer, given only the digital whole slide after standard hematoxylin and eosin [H&E] staining. Using a TCGA cohort of 177 prostate cancer patients where 20 had mutant SPOP, we trained multiple ensembles of residual networks, accurately distinguishing SPOP mutant from SPOP non-mutant patients (test AUROC=0.74, p=0.0007 Fishers Exact Test). We further validated our full metaensemble classifier on an independent test cohort from MSK-IMPACT of 152 patients where 19 had mutant SPOP. Mutants and non-mutants were accurately distinguished despite TCGA slides being frozen sections and MSK-IMPACT slides being formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections (AUROC=0.86, p=0.0038). Moreover, we scanned an additional 36 MSK-IMPACT patients having mutant SPOP, trained on this expanded MSK-IMPACT cohort (test AUROC=0.75, p=0.0002), tested on the TCGA cohort (AUROC=0.64, p=0.0306), and again accurately distinguished mutants from non-mutants using the same pipeline. Importantly, our method demonstrates tractable deep learning in this \\\"small data\\\" setting of 20-55 positive examples and quantifies each predictions uncertainty with confidence intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first statistical model to predict a genetic mutation in cancer directly from the patients digitized H&E-stained whole microscopy slide. Moreover, this is the first time quantitative features learned from patient genetics and histology have been used for content-based image retrieval, finding similar patients for a given patient where the histology appears to share the same genetic driver of disease i.e. SPOP mutation (p=0.0241 Kosts Method), and finding similar patients for a given patient that does not have have that driver mutation (p=0.0170 Kosts Method).\\n\\nSignificance StatementThis is the first pipeline predicting gene mutation probability in cancer from digitized H&E-stained microscopy slides. To predict whether or not the speckle-type POZ protein [SPOP] gene is mutated in prostate cancer, the pipeline (i) identifies diagnostically salient slide regions, (ii) identifies the salient region having the dominant tumor, and (iii) trains ensembles of binary classifiers that together predict a confidence interval of mutation probability. Through deep learning on small datasets, this enables automated histologic diagnoses based on probabilities of underlying molecular aberrations and finds histologically similar patients by learned genetic-histologic relationships.\\n\\nConception, Writing: AJS, TJF.

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPI) are crucial for protein function. There exist many techniques to identify PPIs experimentally, but to determine the interactions in molecular detail is still difficult and very time-consuming. The fact that the number of PPIs is vastly larger than the number of individual proteins makes it practically impossible to characterize all interactions experimentally. Computational approaches that can bridge this gap and predict PPIs and model the interactions in molecular detail are greatly needed. Here we present InterPred, a fully automated pipeline that predicts and model PPIs from sequence using structural modeling combined with massive structural comparisons and molecular docking. A key component of the method is the use of a novel random forest classifier that integrate several structural features to distinguish correct from incorrect protein-protein interaction models. We show that InterPred represents a major improvement in protein-protein interaction detection with a performance comparable or better than experimental high-throughput techniques. We also show that our full-atom protein-protein complex modelling pipeline performs better than any state of the art protein docking method on a standard benchmark set.

    "abstract": "Purpose: The recent growth in pan-ethnic expanded carrier screening (ECS) has raised questions about how such panels might be designed and evaluated systematically. Design principles for ECS panels might improve clinical detection of at-risk couples and facilitate objective discussions of panel choice.\\n\\nMethods: Guided by medical-society statements, we propose a method for the design of ECS panels that aims to maximize the aggregate and per-disease sensitivity and specificity across a range of Mendelian disorders considered serious by a systematic classification scheme. We evaluated this method retrospectively using results from 474,644 de-identified carrier screens. We then constructed several idealized panels to highlight strengths and limitations of different ECS methodologies.\\n\\nResults: Based on modeled fetal risks for \\\"severe\\\" and \\\"profound\\\" diseases, a commercially available ECS panel (Counsyl) is expected to detect 183 affected conceptuses per 100,000 US births. A screens sensitivity is greatly impacted by two factors: (1) the methodology used (e.g., full-exon sequencing finds up to 46 more affected fetuses per 100,000 than targeted genotyping with an optimal 50 variant panel), and (2) the detection rate of the screen for diseases with high prevalence and complex molecular genetics (e.g., fragile X syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, and alpha-thalassemia account for 54 affected fetuses per 100,000).\\n\\nConclusion: The described approaches allow principled, quantitative evaluation of which diseases and methodologies are appropriate for pan-ethnic expanded carrier screening.",

    "abstract": "Neurons extend processes that vary in number, length, and direction of outgrowth. Extracellular cues help determine outgrowth patterns. In Caenorhabditis elegans, neurons respond to the extracellular UNC-6 (netrin) cue via UNC-40 (DCC) and UNC-5 (UNC5) receptors. Previously we presented evidence that UNC-40 asymmetric localization at the plasma membrane is self-organizing and that UNC-40 can localize and mediate outgrowth at randomly selected sites. We also postulate that the process is statistically dependent, i.e. if the probability of outgrowth at one site changes then the probability at another site(s) must also change. Over time, the direction of outgrowth activity fluctuates across the membrane. A probability distribution describes the likelihood of outgrowth in each direction. Random walk modeling predicts that the degree to which the direction of outgrowth fluctuations affects the outward displacement of the membrane. We predict that extracellular cues create patterns of outgrowth by differentially affecting the degree to which the direction of outgrowth activity fluctuates along the membrane. This produces different rates of outgrowth along the surface and creates patterns of extension. Here we present evidence that UNC-5 (UNC5) receptor activity regulates UNC-40 asymmetric localization and the patterning of outgrowth. We show that unc-5 mutations alter UNC-40 asymmetric localization and the patterns of outgrowth that neurons develop. Genetic interactions suggest UNC-5 acts through the UNC-53 (NAV2) cytoplasmic protein to regulate UNC-40 asymmetric localization in response to both the UNC-6 and EGL-20 (wnt) extracellular cues.",

We describe genomic data from 371 affected individuals, 309 of which were sequenced as proband-parent trios.\\n\\nMethodsWhole exome sequences (WES) were generated for 365 individuals (127 affected) and whole genome sequences (WGS) were generated for 612 individuals (244 affected).\\n\\nResultsPathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were found in 100 individuals (27%), with variants of uncertain significance in an additional 42 (11.3%). We found that a family history of neurological disease, especially the presence of an affected 1st degree relative, reduces the pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant identification rate, reflecting both the disease relevance and ease of interpretation of de novo variants. We also found that improvements to genetic knowledge facilitated interpretation changes in many cases. Through systematic reanalyses we have thus far reclassified 15 variants, with 11.3% of families who initially were found to harbor a VUS, and 4.7% of families with a negative result, eventually found to harbor a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant. To further such progress, the data described here are being shared through ClinVar, GeneMatcher, and dbGAP.\\n\\nConclusionOur data strongly support the value of large-scale sequencing, especially WGS within proband-parent trios, as both an effective first-choice diagnostic tool and means to advance clinical and research progress related to pediatric neurological disease.",

    "abstract": "Dimethyltryptamines are hallucinogenic serotonin-like molecules present in traditional Amerindian medicine (e.g. Ayahuasca, Virola) recently associated with cognitive gains, antidepressant effects and changes in brain areas related to attention, self-referential thought, and internal mentation. Historical and technical restrictions impaired understanding how such substances impact human brain metabolism. Here we used shotgun mass spectrometry to explore proteomic differences induced by dimethyltryptamine (5-methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine, 5-MeO-DMT) on human cerebral organoids. Out of the 6,728 identified proteins, 934 were found differentially expressed in 5-MeO-DMT-treated cerebral organoids. In silico systems biology analyses support 5-MeO-DMTs anti-inflammatory effects and reveal a modulation of proteins associated with the formation of dendritic spines, including proteins involved in cellular protrusion formation, microtubule dynamics and cytoskeletal reorganization. Proteins involved in long-term potentiation were modulated in a complex manner, with significant increases in the levels of NMDAR, CaMKII and CREB, but a reduction of PKA and PKC levels. These results offer possible mechanistic insights into the neuropsychological changes caused by the ingestion of substances rich in dimethyltryptamines.",

Because a lack of in vivo tools has prevented the study of endogenous ASC dynamics, we generated a live ASC reporter through CRISPR/Cas9 tagging of the endogenous gene in zebrafish. We see strong ASC expression in the skin and other epithelia that act as barriers to insult. A toxic stimulus triggered speck formation and rapid pyroptosis in keratinocytes in vivo. Macrophages engulfed and digested this speck-containing pyroptotic debris. A 3D ultrastructural reconstruction based on CLEM of in vivo assembled specks revealed a compact network of highly intercrossed filaments, whereas PYD or CARD alone formed filamentous aggregates. The effector caspase is recruited through PYD, whose overexpression induced pyroptosis, but after substantial delay. Therefore, formation of a single compact speck and rapid cell death induction in vivo requires full-length ASC.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryWith a new endogenous ASC real-time reporter we characterize speck dynamics in vivo as well as the concomitant pyroptosis speck formation causes in keratinocytes.",

Attempts to design novel proteins with tailored functions have mostly failed to yield efficiencies matching those found in nature because standard methods do not allow for the design of exchange between necessary conformational states on a functionally-relevant timescale. Here, we develop a broadly-applicable computational method to engineer protein dynamics that we term meta-multistate design. We used this methodology to design spontaneous exchange between two novel conformations introduced into the global fold of Streptococcal protein G domain {beta}1. The designed proteins, named DANCERs, for Dynamic And Native Conformational ExchangeRs, are stably folded and exchange between predicted conformational states on the millisecond timescale. The successful introduction of defined dynamics on functional timescales opens the door to new applications requiring a protein to spontaneously access multiple conformational states.",

    "abstract": "We describe an MHC II (IAb)-restricted T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mouse line that produces CD4+ T cells specific for Plasmodium species. This line, termed PbT-II, was derived from a CD4+ T cell hybridoma generated to blood-stage Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA). PbT-II cells responded to all Plasmodium species and stages tested so far, including rodent (PbA, P. berghei NK65, P. chabaudi AS and P. yoelii 17XNL) and human (P. falciparum) blood-stage parasites as well as irradiated PbA sporozoites. PbT-II cells can provide help for generation of antibody to P. chabaudi infection and can control this otherwise lethal infection in CD40L-deficient mice. PbT-II cells can also provide help for development of CD8+ T cell-mediated experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) during PbA infection. Using PbT-II CD4+ T cells and the previously described PbT-I CD8+ T cells, we determined the dendritic cell (DC) subsets responsible for immunity to PbA blood-stage infection. CD8+ DC (a subset of XCR1+ DC) were the major antigen presenting cell (APC) responsible for activation of both T cell subsets, though other DC also contributed to CD4+ T cell responses. Depletion of CD8+ DC at the beginning of infection prevented ECM development and impaired both Th1 and Tfh responses; in contrast, late depletion did not affect ECM. This study describes a novel and versatile tool for examining CD4+ T cell immunity during malaria and provides evidence that CD4+ T cell help, acting via CD40L signalling, can promote immunity or pathology to blood stage malaria largely through antigen presentation by CD8+ DC.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAntimicrobial resistance has become a major worldwide public health concern, calling for a better characterization of existing and novel resistance mechanisms. GWAS methods applied to bacterial genomes have shown encouraging results for new genetic marker discovery. Most existing approaches either look at SNPs obtained by sequence alignment or consider sets of kmers, whose presence in the genome is associated with the phenotype of interest. While the former approach can only be performed when genomes are similar enough for an alignment to make sense, the latter can lead to redundant descriptions and to results which are hard to interpret.\\n\\nResultsWe propose an alignment-free GWAS method detecting haplotypes of variable length associated to resistance, using compacted De Bruijn graphs. Our representation is flexible enough to deal with very plastic genomes subject to gene transfers while drastically reducing the number of features to explore compared to kmers, without loss of information. It accomodates polymorphisms in core genes, accessory genes and noncoding regions. Using our representation in a GWAS leads to the selection of a small number of entities which are easier to visualize and interpret than fixed-length kmers. We illustrate the benefit of our approach by describing known as well as potential novel determinants of antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa, a pathogenic bacteria with a highly plastic genome.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationThe code and data used in the experiments will be made available upon acceptance of this manuscript.\\n\\nContactmagali.dancette@biomerieux.com",

We developed REPARATION (RibosomeE Profiling Assisted (Re-)AnnotaTION), a de novo algorithm that takes advantage of experimental protein translation evidence from ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) to delineate translated open reading frames (ORFs) in bacteria, independent of genome annotation. REPARATION evaluates all possible ORFs in the genome and estimates minimum thresholds based on a growth curve model to screen for spurious ORFs. We applied REPARATION to three annotated bacterial species to obtain a more comprehensive mapping of their translation landscape in support of experimental data. In all cases, we identified hundreds of novel (small) ORFs including variants of previously annotated ORFs. Our predictions were supported by matching mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics data, sequence composition and conservation analysis. REPARATION is unique in that it makes use of experimental translation evidence to perform de novo ORF delineation in bacterial genomes irrespective of the sequence context of the reading frame.",

    "abstract": "Modern human experienced various selective pressures; including range of xenobiotics which contributed to heterogeneity of drug response. Many genes involve in pharmacokinetics and dynamics of drug, have been reported under natural selection. However, none of the studies have utilized comprehensive information of drug-centered PharmGKB pathways. We have extended this work and aimed to investigate sweep signals, using 1,798 subjects, from 53 Indian and 15 other world populations. We observed that modifiers which alters the biochemical function of other genes, have excess of natural selection (median std-z score=0.033{+/-}0.95; p-value=1.7x10-9-3.7x10-3). Taxane and statin primarily used for chemotherapy and lowering cholesterol level, respectively; and well known for heterogeneous drug response. We observed that pharmacokinetic pathway of taxane and statins are under natural selection (p-value=2.53x10-9and 2.73x10-9-1.09x10-4; q-value=1.28x10-7 and 6.91x10-6-1.1x10-3). We also observed signal of selection in Ibuprofen pharmacokinetics (p-value=1.76x10-5; q-value =2.22x10-4), beta-agonist/beta-blocker pharmacodynamics (p-value=4.79x10-4; q-value =4.04x10-4) and Zidovudin pharmacokinetics/dynamic pathway (p-value=7.0x10-4; q-value =5.06x10-4). Hard sweeps signals were observed in a total of 322 loci. Of which, 53 affect mRNA expression (p-value<0.001) and 16 were already reported with therapeutic response. Interestingly, we observed that Africans have experience 2 phases of natural selection, one at ~30,000 another at ~10,000 years before present.",

    "abstract": "Genetic diversity plays a central role in tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. Experiments are shedding light on this diversity at ever finer scales, but interpretation is challenging. Using recent progress in numerical models, we simulate macroscopic tumors to investigate the interplay between growth dynamics, microscopic composition, and circulating tumor cell cluster diversity. We find that modest differences in growth parameters can profoundly change microscopic diversity. Simple outwards expansion leads to spatially segregated clones and low diversity, as expected. However, a modest cell turnover can result in an increased number of divisions and mixing among clones resulting in increased microscopic diversity in the tumor core. Using simulations to estimate power to detect such spatial trends, we find that multiregion sequencing data from contemporary studies is marginally powered to detect the predicted effects. Slightly larger samples, improved detection of rare variants, or sequencing of smaller biopsies or circulating tumor cell clusters would allow one to distinguish between leading models of tumor evolution. The genetic composition of circulating tumor cell clusters, which can be obtained from non-invasive blood draws, is therefore informative about tumor evolution and its metastatic potential.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LINumerical and theoretical models show interaction of front expansion, mutation, and clonal mixing in shaping tumor heterogeneity.\\nC_LIO_LICell turnover increases intratumor heterogeneity.\\nC_LIO_LISimulated circulating tumor cell clusters and microbiopsies exhibit substantial diversity with strong spatial trends.\\nC_LIO_LISimulations suggest attainable sampling schemes able to distinguish between prevalent tumor growth models.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Effective ecosystem conservation and resource management require quantitative monitoring of biodiversity, including accurate descriptions of species composition and temporal variations of species abundance. Therefore, quantitative monitoring of biodiversity has been performed for many ecosystems, but it is often time- and effort-consuming and costly. Recent studies have shown that environmental DNA (eDNA), which is released to the environment from macro-organisms living in a habitat, contains information about species identity and abundance. Thus, analyzing eDNA would be a promising approach for more efficient biodiversity monitoring. In the present study, we added internal standard DNAs (i.e., known amounts of short DNA fragments from fish species that have never been observed in a sampling area) to eDNA samples, which were collected weekly from a coastal marine ecosystem in Maizuru-Bay, Kyoto, Japan (from April 2015 to March 2016), and performed metabarcoding analysis using Illumina MiSeq to simultaneously identify fish species and quantify fish eDNA copy numbers. A correction equation was obtained for each sample using the relationship between the number of sequence reads and the added amount of the standard DNAs, and this equation was used to estimate the copy numbers from the sequence reads of non-standard fish eDNA. The calculated copy numbers showed significant positive correlation with those determined by quantitative PCR, suggesting that eDNA metabarcoding with standard DNA enabled useful quantification of eDNA. Furthermore, for samples that show a high level of PCR inhibition, our method might allow more accurate quantification than qPCR because the correction equations generated using internal standard DNAs would include the effect of PCR inhibition. A single run of Illumina MiSeq produced > 70 quantitative fish eDNA time series in our study, showing that our method could contribute to more efficient and quantitative monitoring of biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "To explore the role of microRNAs in osteoarthritis (OA), we conducted microRNA expression profiling on micro-dissected tibial cartilage and subchondral bone in a mouse model of OA produced by medial meniscus destabilization (DMM). DMM mice had characteristic cartilage degeneration, subchondral bone sclerosis and osteophyte formation. While subchondral bone showed no microRNA dysregulation, 139 microRNAs were differentially expressed in DMM cartilage at 1 and/or 6 weeks after OA initiation. To prioritize OA-candidates, dysregulated microRNAs with human orthologues were filtered using paired microRNA:mRNA expression analysis to identify those with corresponding changes in mRNA target transcripts in the DMM cartilage. An important cohort overlapped with microRNAs identified in human end-stage OA. Comparisons with microRNAs dysregulation in DMM mouse cartilage where aggrecan cleavage was genetically-ablated demonstrated that all were independent of aggrecan breakdown, earmarking these as important to the critical stages of OA initiation. Our comprehensive analyses identified high-priority microRNA candidates that have potential as human OA-biomarkers and therapeutic targets.\\n\\nSUMMARYKung et al. conducted global analysis of microRNA dysregulation in joint tissues of a well-established mouse osteoarthritis model.

    "abstract": "Sleep spindles are transient oscillatory waveforms occurring during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and are implicated in plasticity and memory processes. In humans, spindles can be classified as either slow or fast, but large individual differences in spindle frequency as well as methodological difficulties have hindered progress towards understanding their function. Using two nights of high-density electroencephalography recordings from healthy individuals, we first characterize the individual variability of NREM spectra and demonstrate the difficulty of determining subject-specific spindle frequencies. We then introduce a novel spatial filtering approach that can reliably separate subject-specific spindle activity into slow and fast components that are stable across nights and across N2 and N3 sleep. We then proceed to provide detailed analyses of the topographical expression of individualized slow and fast spindle activity. Group-level analyses conform to known spatial properties of spindles, but also uncover novel differences between sleep stages and spindle classes. Moreover, subject-specific examinations reveal that individual topographies show considerable variability that is stable across nights. Finally, we demonstrate that topographical maps depend nontrivially on the spindle metric employed. In sum, our findings indicate that group-level approaches mask substantial individual variability of spindle dynamics, in both the spectral and spatial domains. We suggest that leveraging, rather than ignoring, such differences may prove useful to further our understanding of the physiology and functional role of sleep spindles.",

    "abstract": "Noise is often indispensable to key cellular activities, such as gene expression, necessitating the use of stochastic models to capture its dynamics. The chemical master equation (CME) is a commonly used stochastic model that describes how the probability distribution of a chemically reacting system varies with time. Knowing analytic solutions to the CME can have benefits, such as expediting simulations of multiscale biochemical reaction networks and aiding the design of distributional responses. However, analytic solutions are rarely known. A recent method of computing analytic stationary solutions relies on gluing simple state spaces together recursively at one or two states. We explore the capabilities of this method and introduce algorithms to derive analytic stationary solutions to the CME. We first formally characterise state spaces that can be constructed by performing single-state gluing of paths, cycles or both sequentially. We then study stochastic biochemical reaction networks that consist of reversible, elementary reactions with two-dimensional state spaces. We also discuss extending the method to infinite state spaces and designing stationary distributions that satisfy user-specified constraints. Finally, we illustrate the aforementioned ideas using examples that include two interconnected transcriptional components and chemical reactions with two-dimensional state spaces.\\n\\nSubject AreasSystems biology, synthetic biology, biomathematics, bioengineering",

The existence of persistent genetic variation within natural populations presents an evolutionary problem as natural selection and genetic drift tend to erode genetic diversity. Models of balancing selection were developed to account for the high and sometimes extreme levels of polymorphism found in many natural populations. Negative frequency-dependent selection may be the most powerful selective force maintaining balanced natural polymorphisms but it is also commonly misinterpreted. The aim of this review is to clarify the processes underlying negative frequency-dependent selection, describe classes of natural polymorphisms that can and cannot result from these processes, and discuss observational and experimental data that can aid in accurately identifying the processes that generated or are maintain diversity in nature.

While the majority of lncRNAs remains to be functionally characterized, several have been implicated in cancer development and metastasis. Considering the plethora of lncRNAs genes that is currently reported, it is conceivable that several lncRNAs might function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes.\\n\\nWe devised a strategy to detect focal lncRNA SCNAs using a custom DNA microarray platform probing 20 418 lncRNA genes. By screening a panel of 80 cancer cell lines, we detected numerous focal aberrations targeting one or multiple lncRNAs without affecting neighboring protein-coding genes. These focal aberrations are highly suggestive for a tumor suppressive or oncogenic role of the targeted lncRNA gene. Although functional validation remains an essential step in the further characterization of the involved candidate cancer lncRNAs, our results provide a direct way of prioritizing candidate lncRNAs involved in cancer pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "To examine how climate affects soil development and nutrient availability over long timescales, we studied a series of four long-term chronosequences along a climate gradient in southwestern Australia. Annual rainfall ranged from 533 mm to 1185 mm (water balance from -900 mm to +52 mm) and each chronosequence included Holocene ([&le;]6.5 ka), Middle Pleistocene (120-500 ka), and Early Pleistocene ([~]2000 ka) dunes. Vegetation changed markedly along the climosequence, from shrubland at the driest site to Eucalyptus forest at the wettest. The carbonate and P content of the parent sand declined along the climosequence, presumably linked to variation in offshore productivity. However, soil development and associated nutrient status followed remarkably consistent patterns along the four chronosequences. Pedogenesis involved decalcification and secondary carbonate precipitation in Holocene soils and leaching of iron oxides from Middle Pleistocene soils, ultimately yielding bleached quartz sands on the oldest soils. Along all chronosequences soil pH and total P declined, while C:P and N:P ratios increased, consistent with the predicted shift from N to P limitation of vegetation during ecosystem development. The expected unimodal pattern of leaf area index was most pronounced along wetter chronosequences, suggesting an influence of climate on the expression of retrogression. The four chronosequences do not appear to span a pedogenic climate threshold, because exchangeable phosphate and base cations declined consistently during long-term pedogenesis. However, the proportion of the total P in organic form was greater along wetter chronosequences. We conclude that soils and nutrient availability on the coastal sand plains of southwestern Australia change consistently during long-term pedogenesis, despite marked variation in modern vegetation and climate. The four chronosequences provide a rare soil-age x climate framework within which to study long-term ecosystem development.",

    "abstract": "Precise tissue remodeling during development is essential for shaping embryos and for optimal organ function. Epiboly is an early gastrulation event by which the blastoderm expands around the yolk to engulf it. Three different layers are involved, an epithelial layer (the enveloping layer, EVL), the embryo proper, constituted by the deep cells (DCs), and the yolk cell. Although teleost epiboly has been studied for many years, a clear understanding of its mechanics was still missing. Here we present new information on the cellular, molecular and mechanical elements involved in epiboly that, together with some other recent data and upon comparison with previous biomechanical models, lets conclude that the expansion of the epithelia is passive and driven by cortical contraction and membrane removal in the adjacent layer, the External Yolk Syncytial Layer (E-YSL). The isotropic actomyosin contraction of the E-YSL generates an anisotropic stress pattern and a directional net movement as a result of the differences in the deformation response of two opposites adjacent domains (the EVL and the Yolk Cytoplasmic Layer - YCL). Contractility is accompanied by the local formation of membrane folds and the membrane removal by Rab5ab dependent macropinocytosis. The increase in area of the epithelia during the expansion is achieved by cell-shape changes (flattening) responding to spherical geometrical cues. The counterbalance between the geometry of the embryo and forces dissipation is therefore essential for epiboly global coordination.",

Reproductive interference is considered a strong ecological force, potentially leading to species exclusion. This supposes that the net effect of reproductive interactions is strongly negative for one of the species involved. Testing this requires a comprehensive analysis of interspecific reproductive interactions, accounting for the order and timing of mating events, and for their effects on either fertility or fecundity. To this aim, we measured reproductive interactions between a focal species, Tetranychus urticae, and an invasive (T.evansi) and a resident (T. ludeni) species, varying the mating sequence and interval, and measuring the effect of such crosses on fecundity and offspring sex ratio (a measure of fertility, as these species are haplodiploid). We found that mating with heterospecifics affected fecundity and sex ratio negatively, but also positively, depending on the species involved, and on the order and timing of mating events. Overall, the net effect of reproductive interactions was weak despite strong effects of particular events. In natural situations, the outcome of reproductive interactions will thus hinge upon the frequency of each event.",

While these events are well described in Central and Southern Europe, genetic evidence from Northern Europe surrounding the Baltic Sea is still sparse. Here we report genome-wide DNA data from 24 ancient North Europeans ranging from [~]7,500 to 200 calBCE spanning the transition from a hunter-gatherer to an agricultural lifestyle, as well as the adoption of bronze metallurgy. We show that Scandinavia was settled after the retreat of the glacial ice sheets from a southern and a northern route, and that the first Scandinavian Neolithic farmers derive their ancestry from Anatolia 1000 years earlier than previously demonstrated. The range of Western European Mesolithic hunter-gatherers extended to the east of the Baltic Sea, where these populations persisted without gene-flow from Central European farmers until around 2,900 calBCE when the arrival of steppe pastoralists introduced a major shift in economy and established wide-reaching networks of contact within the Corded Ware Complex.",

    "abstract": "The ability to tolerate infection is a key component of host defence and offers potential novel therapeutic approaches for infectious diseases. To yield successful targets for therapeutic intervention, it is important that the analytical tools employed to measure disease tolerance are able to capture distinct host responses to infection. Here, we show that commonly used methods that estimate tolerance as a linear relationship may be inadequate, and that more flexible, non-linear estimates of this relationship may reveal variation in distinct components of host defence. To illustrate this, we measured the survival of Drosophila melanogaster carrying either a functional or non-functional regulator of the JAK-STAT immune pathway (G9a) when challenged with a range of concentrations of Drosophila C Virus (DCV). While classical linear model analyses indicated that G9a affected tolerance only in females, a more powerful non-linear logistic model showed that G9a mediates viral tolerance to different extents in both sexes. This analysis also revealed that G9a acts by changing the sensitivity to increasing pathogen burdens, but does not reduce the ultimate severity of infection. These results indicate that fitting non-linear models to host health-pathogen burden relationships may offer better and more detailed estimates of disease tolerance.",

We report that CMTR1 is recruited to Serine-5 phosphorylated RNA Pol II CTD, facilitating cotranscriptional methylation. We isolated CMTR1 in a complex with DHX15, an RNA helicase functioning in splicing and ribosome biogenesis, and characterised it as a regulator of CMTR1. When bound to DHX15, CMTR1 activity is repressed and prevented from binding to RNA pol II, thus constraining 1st nucleotide methylation to a co-transcriptional event. Conversely CMTR1 activates DHX15 helicase activity and influences its nuclear localisation, which is likely to impact on several nuclear functions. The impact of the CMTR1-DHX15 interaction is complex and will depend on the relative expression of these enzymes and their interactors, and the cellular dependency on different RNA processing pathways. In HCC1806 cells, the DHX15-CMTR1 interaction controls ribosome loading of a subset of mRNAs and impacts on cell proliferation.",

Although the majority of Lyme patients can be cured with the standard 2-4 week antibiotic treatment, at least 10-20% of patients continue to suffer from prolonged post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). While the cause for this is unclear, one possibility is that persisting organisms are not killed by current Lyme antibiotics. In our previous studies, we screened an FDA drug library and an NCI compound library on B. burgdorferi and found some drug hits including sulfa drugs as having good activity against B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells. In this study, we evaluated the relative activity of three commonly used sulfa drugs sulfamethoxazole (Smx), dapsone (Dps), sulfachlorpyridazine (Scp), and also trimethoprim (Tmp), and assessed their combinations with the commonly prescribed Lyme antibiotics for activities against B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells. Using the same molarity concentration, dapsone, sulfachlorpyridazine and trimethoprim showed very similar activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi enriched in persisters, however, sulfamethoxazole was the least active drug among the three sulfa drugs tested. Interestingly, contrary to other bacterial systems, Tmp did not show synergy in drug combinations with the three sulfa drugs at their clinically relevant serum concentrations against B. burgdorferi. We found that sulfa drugs combined with other antibiotics were more active than their respective single drugs and that four-drug combinations were more active than three-drug combinations. Four drug combinations dapsone+minocycline+cefuroxime+azithromycin and dapsone+minocycline+cefuroxime+rifampin showed best activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi in these sulfa drug combinations. However, these 4-sulfa drug containing combinations still had considerably less activity against B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells than the daptomycin+cefuroxime+doxycycline used as a positive control which completely eradicated B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells. Future studies are needed to evaluate and optimize the sulfa drug combinations in vitro and also in animal models.",

Rugged adaptive landscapes contain two or more adaptive peaks: allele combinations that differ in two or more genes and confer higher fitness than intermediate combinations.

Evolutionary biologists have struggled with this question since it was first introduced in the 1930s by Sewall Wright.\\n\\nDiscoveries in the fields of genetics and biochemistry inspired various mathematical models of adaptive landscapes. The development of landscape models led to numerous theoretical studies analyzing evolution on rugged landscapes under different biological conditions. The large body of theoretical work suggests that adaptive landscapes are major determinants of the progress and outcome of evolutionary processes.\\n\\nRecent technological advances in molecular biology and microbiology allow experimenters to measure adaptive values of large sets of allele combinations and construct empirical adaptive landscapes for the first time. Such empirical landscapes have already been generated in bacteria, yeast, viruses, and fungi, and are contributing to new insights about evolution on adaptive landscapes.\\n\\nIn this Key Issues Review we will: (i) introduce the concept of adaptive landscapes; (ii) review the major theoretical studies of evolution on rugged landscapes; (iii) review some of the recently obtained empirical adaptive landscapes; (iv) discuss recent mathematical and statistical analyses motivated by empirical adaptive landscapes, as well as provide the reader with source code and instructions to implement simulations of adaptive landscapes; and (v) discuss possible future directions for this exciting field.",
