We therefore developed the open-source software MMseqs2 (mmseqs.org), which improves on current search tools over the full range of speed-sensitivity trade-off, achieving sensitivities better than PSI-BLAST at more than 400 times its speed.",

    "abstract": "The primary electrophysiological marker of feature-based selection is the N2pc, a lateralized posterior negativity emerging around 180-200 ms. As it relies on hemispheric differences, its ability to discriminate the locus of focal attention is severely limited. Here we demonstrate that multivariate analyses of raw EEG data provide a much more fine-grained spatial profile of feature-based target selection. When training a pattern classifier to determine target position from EEG, we were able to decode target positions on the vertical midline, which cannot be achieved using standard N2pc methodology. Next, we used a forward encoding model to construct a channel tuning function that describes the continuous relationship between target position and multivariate EEG in an eight-position display. This model can spatially discriminate individual target positions in these displays and is fully invertible, enabling us to construct hypothetical topographic activation maps for target positions that were never used. When tested against the real pattern of neural activity obtained from a different group of subjects, the constructed maps from the forward model turned out statistically indistinguishable, thus providing independent validation of our model. Our findings demonstrate the power of multivariate EEG analysis to track feature-based target selection with high spatial and temporal precision.\\n\\nSignificance StatementFeature-based attentional selection enables observers to find objects in their visual field. The spatiotemporal profile of this process is difficult to assess with standard electrophysiological methods, which rely on activity differences between cerebral hemispheres. We demonstrate that multivariate analyses of EEG data can track target selection across the visual field with high temporal and spatial resolution. Using a forward model, we were able to capture the continuous relationship between target position and EEG measurements, allowing us to reconstruct the distribution of cortical activity for target locations that were never shown during the experiment. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a temporally and spatially precise EEG signal that can be used to study the neural basis of feature-based attentional selection.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the natural world will be impacted by environmental change over the coming decades is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity. Addressing this challenge is difficult because environmental change can generate both population level plastic and evolutionary responses, with plastic responses being either adaptive or non-adaptive. We develop an approach that links quantitative genetic theory with data-driven structured models to allow prediction of population responses to environmental change via plasticity and adaptive evolution. After introducing general new theory, we construct a number of example models to demonstrate that evolutionary responses to environmental change over the short-term will be considerably slower than plastic responses, and that the rate of adaptive evolution to a new environment depends upon whether plastic responses are adaptive or non-adaptive. Parameterization of the models we develop requires information on genetic and phenotypic variation and demography that will not always be available, meaning that simpler models will often be required to predict responses to environmental change. We consequently develop a method to examine whether the full machinery of the evolutionarily explicit models we develop will be needed to predict responses to environmental change, or whether simpler non-evolutionary models that are now widely constructed may be sufficient.",

    "abstract": "Emerging single-molecule sequencing technologies from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore have revived interest in long read mapping algorithms. Alignment-based seed-and-extend methods demonstrate good accuracy, but face limited scalability, while faster alignment-free methods typically trade decreased precision for efficiency. In this paper, we combine a fast approximate read mapping algorithm based on minimizers with a novel MinHash identity estimation technique to achieve both scalability and precision. In contrast to prior methods, we develop a mathematical framework that defines the types of mapping targets we uncover, establish probabilistic estimates of p-value and sensitivity, and demonstrate tolerance for alignment error rates up to 20%. With this framework, our algorithm automatically adapts to different minimum length and identity requirements and provides both positional and identity estimates for each mapping reported. For mapping human PacBio reads to the hg38 reference, our method is 290x faster than BWA-MEM with a lower memory footprint and recall rate of 96%. We further demonstrate the scalability of our method by mapping noisy PacBio reads (each [&ge;] 5 kbp in length) to the complete NCBI RefSeq database containing 838 Gbp of sequence and > 60, 000 genomes.",

    "abstract": "Discovering meaningful gene interactions is crucial for the identification of novel regulatory processes in cells. Building accurately the related graphs remains challenging due to the large number of possible solutions from available data. Nonetheless, enforcing a priori on the graph structure, such as modularity, may reduce network indeterminacy issues. BRANE Clust (Biologically-Related A priori Network Enhancement with Clustering) refines gene regulatory network (GRN) inference thanks to cluster information. It works as a post-processing tool for inference methods (i.e. CLR, GENIE3). In BRANE Clust, the clustering is based on the inversion of a system of linear equations involving a graph-Laplacian matrix promoting a modular structure. Our approach is validated on DREAM4 and DREAM5 datasets with objective measures, showing significant comparative improvements. We provide additional insights on the discovery of novel regulatory or co-expressed links in the inferred Escherichia coli network evaluated using the STRING database. The comparative pertinence of clustering is discussed computationally (SIMoNe, WGCNA, X-means) and biologically (RegulonDB).

This bioinformatics-based study focuses on eight of the cathepsin B-like cysteine proteases (CPs) of the worm to explore their pathogenic potential. CP1 - CP6, which harbored the active site cysteine residue for enzymatic activity, were relevantly observed to have N-terminal signal peptide for extracellular localization. The secretory CPs could be releasing indigenous worm heparin at the host-pathogen interface for anticoagulation purposes. CP2 and CP3 showed a novel hemoglobinase motif that could be a prerequisite for hemoglobin degradation. CP1 and CP6 shared similar enzymatic-pocket features with cathepsin B and cruzain that cleave high molecular weight kininogen for blood-thinning activity. CP1, CP2, CP3, CP5 and CP6 were predicted to bind heparin, at their C terminal domain, like human cathepsin B and cruzain non-covalently bind heparin to enhance their activity. NA CPs action in concert with heparin, have implications for anti-heparin and heparin analog design against hookworm infection.",

We propose a different model that publishers of research can apply to the content they publish, ensuring that any post-publication amendments are seamless, transparent and propagated to all the countless places online where descriptions of research appear. At the center, the neutral term \\\"amendment\\\" describes all forms of post-publication change to an article. We lay out a straightforward and consistent process that applies to each of the three types of amendments: insubstantial, substantial, and complete. This proposed system supports the dynamic nature of the research process itself as researchers continue to refine or extend the work, removing the emotive climate particularly associated with retractions and corrections to published work. It allows researchers to cite and share the correct versions of articles with certainty, and for decision makers to have access to the most up to date information.",

This presents unique opportunities as well as confounding challenges in our understanding of how molecular signalling outcomes vary among individuals in the general population. As a result the conventional  one drug fits all lines of approach in the drug discovery process is becoming obsolete. However, an innovative genotype-specific approach targeting protein sequence variants instead of a reference protein target is currently lacking. In this short communication we report a remarkable observation of antibody-mediated knockdown of intracellular protein expression. This suggests allele-specific inhibition of protein-variant expression can be achieved by intracellular delivery of lipid conjugated linear epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. The results presented here demonstrate novel opportunities for interrogating the protein coding variations in the human genomes and new therapeutic strategies for the inhibition of pathogenic protein variants in a genotype-centric manner.",

    "abstract": "As DNA sequencing throughput increases, novel strategies for discovering genes that affect traits of interest become available. One strategy starts with a population of animals and selects individuals over multiple generations for a particular trait. Subsequent whole genome sequencing should identify loci affecting this trait. We apply this strategy by sorting flies for wing length over 18 generations, obtaining two populations that differ in wing length by 20%. Flies with longer wings had increased overall body sizes and elevated TOR activity, suggesting that genetic variation targets TOR signaling to influence body size. High-throughput sequencing of big and small flies identified thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms that differed between the two populations, leading us to identify five novel regulators of TOR signaling. Surprisingly, stochastic simulations of the process show that large fractions of the genetic differences between the big and small flies are probably biological false positives, selected by chance by random drift. We employ these computer simulations to identify experimental setup parameters to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for successfully running sort-and-sequence experiments - a resource which will hopefully be useful for the community.",

    "abstract": "Mobile genetic elements can be found in almost all genomes. Possibly the most common non-autonomous mobile genetic elements in bacteria are REPINs that can occur hundreds of times within a genome. The sum of all REPINs within a genome are an evolving populations because they replicate and mutate. We know the exact composition of this population and the sequence of each member of a REPIN population, in contrast to most other biological populations. Here, we model the evolution of REPINs as quasispecies. We fit our quasispecies model to ten different REPIN populations from ten different bacterial strains and estimate duplication rates. We find that our estimated duplication rates range from about 5 x 10-9 to 37 x 10-9 duplications per generation per genome. The small range and the low level of the REPIN duplication rates suggest a universal trade-off between the survival of the REPIN population and the reduction of the mutational load for the host genome. The REPIN populations we investigated also possess features typical of other natural populations. One population shows hallmarks of a population that is going extinct, another population seems to be growing in size and we also see an example of competition between two REPIN populations.",

    "abstract": "Desiccation-tolerant cultured cells Pv11 derived from the anhydrobiotic Polypedilum vanderplanki embryo endure complete desiccation because of their ametabolic state and resume their metabolism after rehydration. These features led us to develop a novel dry preservation technology for enzymes as it was still unclear whether Pv11 cells preserved an exogenous enzyme in the dry state. This study shows that Pv11 cells protect an exogenous desiccation-sensitive enzyme, luciferase, preserving the enzymatic activity even after dry storage for 372 days at room temperature. A process including pre-incubation with trehalose, dehydration, storage, and rehydration allowed Pv11 (Pvll-Luc) cells stably expressing luciferase to survive desiccation and still emit luminescence caused by luciferase after rehydration. Luminescence produced by luciferase in Pvll-Luc cells after rehydration did not significantly decrease in presence of a translation inhibitor, showing that the activity did not derive from de novo enzyme synthesis following the resumption of cell metabolism. These findings indicate that the surviving Pv11 cells almost completely protect luciferase during desiccation. Lacking of the preincubation step resulted in the loss of luciferase activity after rehydration. We showed that preincubation with trehalose associated to induction of desiccation-tolerant related genes in Pv11 cells allowed effective in vivo preservation of enzymes in the dry state.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomics allows unprecedented access to uncultured environmental microorganisms. The assembly of metagenomic sequences facilitates gene prediction and annotation, and enables the assembly of draft genomes of dominant taxa, including uncultured members of a community. However, while numerous platforms have been developed for this critical step, there is currently no strict standard for the assembly of metagenomic sequence data. To assist with selection of an appropriate metagenome assembler we evaluated the capabilities of eight prominent assembly tools on nine publicly-available environmental metagenomes. We found that assembler choice ultimately hinges on the scientific question at hand, the resources available and the bioinformatic competence of the researcher. We provide a concise workflow for the selection of the best assembly tool.",

    "abstract": "Despite increasing access to antiretroviral therapy, HIV incidence in rural KwaZulu-Natal communities remains among the highest ever reported in Africa. While many epidemiological factors have been invoked to explain this high incidence, widespread human mobility and movement of viral lineages between geographic locations have implicated high rates of transmission across communities. High rates of crosscommunity transmission call into question how effective increasing local coverage of antiretroviral therapy will be at preventing new infections, especially if many new cases arise from external introductions. To help address this question, we use a new phylodynamic modeling approach to estimate both changes in epidemic dynamics through time and the relative contribution of local transmission versus external introductions to overall incidence from HIV-1 subtype C phylogenies. Our phylodynamic estimates of HIV prevalence and incidence are remarkably consistent with population-based surveillance data. Our analysis also reveals that early epidemic dynamics in this population were largely driven by a wave of external introductions. More recently, we estimate that anywhere between 20-60% of all new infections arise from external introductions from outside the local community. These results highlight the power of using phylodynamic methods to study generalized HIV epidemics and the growing need to consider larger-scale regional transmission dynamics above the level of local communities when designing and testing prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Reproduction is a defining feature of living systems. To reproduce, aggregates of biological units (e.g., multicellular organisms or colonial bacteria) must fragment into smaller parts. Fragmentation modes in nature range from binary fission in bacteria to collective-level fragmentation and the production of unicellular propagules in multicellular organisms. Despite this apparent ubiquity, the adaptive significance of fragmentation modes has received little attention. Here, we develop a model in which groups arise from the division of single cells that do not separate but stay together until the moment of group fragmentation. We allow for all possible fragmentation patterns and calculate the population growth rate of each associated life cycle. Fragmentation modes that maximise growth rate comprise a restrictive set of patterns that include production of unicellular propagules and division into two similar size groups. Life cycles marked by single-cell bottlenecks maximise population growth rate under a wide range of conditions. This surprising result offers a new evolutionary explanation for the widespread occurrence of this mode of reproduction. All in all, our model provides a framework for exploring the adaptive significance of fragmentation modes and their associated life cycles.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMode of reproduction is a defining trait of all organisms, including colonial bacteria and multicellular organisms. To produce offspring, aggregates must fragment by splitting into two or more groups. The particular way that a given group fragments defines the life cycle of the organism. For instance, insect colonies can reproduce by splitting or by producing individuals that found new colonies. Similarly, some colonial bacteria propagate by fission or by releasing single cells, while others split in highly sophisticated ways; in multicellular organisms reproduction typically proceeds via a single cell bottleneck phase. The space of possibilities for fragmentation is so vast that an exhaustive analysis seems daunting. Focusing on fragmentation modes of a simple kind we parametrise all possible modes of group fragmentation and identify those modes leading to the fastest population growth rate. Two kinds of life cycle dominate: one involving division into two equal size groups, and the other involving production of a unicellular propagule. The prevalence of these life cycles in nature is consistent with our null model and suggests that benefits accruing from population growth rate alone may have shaped the evolution of fragmentation mode.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCryptic genetic variation (CGV) is the hidden genetic variation that can be unlocked by perturbing normal conditions. CGV can drive the emergence of novel complex phenotypes through changes in gene expression. Although our theoretical understanding of CGV has thoroughly increased over the past decade, insight into polymorphic gene expression regulation underlying CGV is scarce. Here we investigated the transcriptional architecture of CGV in response to rapid temperature changes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We analyzed regulatory variation in gene expression (and mapped eQTL) across the course of a heat stress and recovery response in a recombinant inbred population.\\n\\nResultsWe measured gene expression over three temperature treatments: i) control, ii) heat stress, and iii) recovery from heat stress. Compared to control, exposure to heat stress affected the transcription of 3305 genes, whereas 942 were affected in recovering worms. These affected genes were mainly involved in metabolism and reproduction. The gene expression pattern in recovering worms resembled both the control and the heat stress treatment. We mapped eQTL using the genetic variation of the recombinant inbred population and detected 2626 genes with an eQTL in the heat stress treatment, 1797 in the control, and 1880 in the recovery. The cis-eQTL were highly conserved across treatments. A considerable fraction of the trans-eQTL (40-57%) mapped to 19 treatment specific trans-bands. In contrast to cis-eQTL, trans-eQTL were highly environment specific and thus cryptic. Approximately 67% of the trans-eQTL were only induced in a single treatment, with heat-stress showing the most unique trans-eQTL.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results illustrate the highly dynamic pattern of CGV across three different environmental conditions that can be evoked by a stress response over a relatively short time-span (2 hours) and that CGV is mainly determined by response related trans regulatory eQTL.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) often work cooperatively, where the binding of one TF to DNA enhances the binding affinity of a second TF to a nearby location. Such cooperative binding is important for activating gene expression from promoters and enhancers in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Existing methods to detect cooperative binding of a TF pair rely on analyzing the sequence that is bound. We propose a method that uses, instead, only ChIP-seq peak intensities and an expectation maximization (CPI-EM) algorithm. We validate our method using ChIP-seq data from cells where one of a pair of TFs under consideration has been genetically knocked out. Our algorithm relies on our observation that cooperative TF-TF binding is correlated with weak binding of one of the TFs, which we demonstrate in a variety of cell types, including E. coli, S. cerevisiae and M. musculus cells. We show that this method performs significantly better than a predictor based only on the ChIP-seq peak distance of the TFs under consideration. This suggests that peak intensities contain information that can help detect the cooperative binding of a TF pair. CPI-EM also outperforms an existing sequence-based algorithm in detecting cooperative binding. The CPI-EM algorithm is available at https://github.com/vishakad/cpi-em.",

    "abstract": "Trichoderma reesei (Ascomycota, Pezizomycotina) QM6a is a model fungus for a broad spectrum of physiological phenomena, including plant cell wall degradation, industrial production of enzymes, light responses, conidiation, sexual development, polyketide biosynthesis and plant-fungal interactions. The genomes of QM6a and its high-enzyme producing mutants have been sequenced by second-generation-sequencing methods and are publicly available from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI). While these genome sequences have offered useful information for genomic and transcriptomic studies, their limitations and especially their short read lengths make them poorly suited for some particular biological problems, including assembly, genome-wide determination of chromosome architecture and genetic modification or engineering. We integrated Pacific Biosciences and Illumina sequencing platforms for the highest-quality genome assembly yet achieved, revealing seven telomere-to-telomere chromosomes (34,922,528 bp; 10877 genes) with 1630 newly-predicted genes and >1.5 Mb of new sequences. Most new sequences are located on AT-rich blocks, including 7 centromeres, 14 subtelomeres and 2329 interspersed AT-rich blocks. The seven QM6a centromeres separately consist of 24 conserved repeats and 37 putative centromere-encoded genes. These findings open up a new perspective for future centromere and chromosome architecture studies. Next, we demonstrate that sexual crossing readily induced cytosine-to-thymine point mutations on both tandem and unlinked duplicated sequences. We also show by bioinformatic analysis that Trichoderma reesei has evolved a robust repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) system to accumulate AT-rich sequences, with longer AT-rich blocks having more RIP mutations. The widespread distribution of AT-rich blocks correlates genome-wide partitions with gene clusters, explaining why clustering of genes has been reported to not influence gene expression in Trichoderma reesei. Compartmentation of ancestral gene clusters by AT-rich blocks might promote flexibilities that are evolutionarily advantageous in this fungus soil habitats and other natural environments. Our analyses, together with the complete genome sequence, provide a better blueprint for biotechnological and industrial applications.",

There are still many regions of smaller effect size or low frequency left to discover, and better exploitation of existing type 1 diabetes cohorts with meta analysis and imputation can precede the acquisition of new or larger cohorts. An existing dataset of 5,913 case and 8,829 control samples was analysed using genome-wide microarrays (Affymetrix GeneChip 500K and Illumina Infinium 550K) with imputation via IMPUTE2 with the 1000 Genomes Project (phase 3) reference panel. Genotyping coverage was doubled in known association regions, and increased by four fold in other regions compared to previous studies. Our analysis resulted in new index variants for 17/57 regions, an expanded set of plausible candidate SNPs for 17 regions, and five novel type 1 diabetes association regions at 1p31.3, 1q24.3, 1q31.2, 2q11.2 and 11q12.2.

    "abstract": "Environmental perturbations have large effects on both organismal and cellular traits, including gene expression, but the extent to which the environment affects RNA processing remains largely uncharacterized. Recent studies have identified a large number of genetic variants associated with variation in RNA processing that also have an important role in complex traits; yet we do not know in which contexts the different underlying isoforms are used. Here, we comprehensively characterized changes in RNA processing events across 89 environments in five human cell types and identified 15,300 event shifts (FDR = 15%) comprised of eight event types in over 4,000 genes. Many of these changes occur consistently in the same direction across conditions, indicative of global regulation by trans factors. Accordingly, we demonstrate that environmental modulation of splicing factor binding predicts shifts in intron retention, and that binding of transcription factors predicts shifts in AFE usage in response to specific treatments. We validated the mechanism hypothesized for AFE in two independent datasets. Using ATAC-seq, we found altered binding of 64 factors in response to selenium at sites of AFE shift, including ELF2 and other factors in the ETS family. We also performed AFE QTL mapping in 373 individuals and found an enrichment for SNPs predicted to disrupt binding of the ELF2 factor. Together, these results demonstrate that RNA processing is dramatically changed in response to environmental perturbations through specific mechanisms regulated by trans factors.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryChanges in a cells environment and genetic variation have been shown to impact gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that environmental perturbations also lead to extensive changes in alternative RNA processing across a large number of cellular environments that we investigated. These changes often occur in a non-random manner. For example, many treatments lead to increased intron retention and usage of the downstream first exon. We also show that the changes to first exon usage are likely dependent on changes in transcription factor binding. We provide support for this hypothesis by considering how first exon usage is affected by disruption of binding due to treatment with selenium. We further validate the role of a specific factor by considering the effect of genetic variation in its binding sites on first exon usage. These results help to shed light on the vast number of changes that occur in response to environmental stimuli and will likely aid in understanding the impact of compounds to which we are daily exposed.",

    "abstract": "Breathlessness debilitates millions of people with chronic illness. Mismatch between breathlessness severity and objective disease markers is common and poorly understood. Traditionally, sensory perception was conceptualised as a stimulus-response relationship, although this cannot explain how conditioned symptoms may occur in the absence of physiological signals from the lungs or airways. A Bayesian model is now proposed in which the brain generates sensations based on expectations learned from past experiences (priors), which are then checked against incoming afferent signals. In this model, psychological factors may act as moderators. They may either alter priors, or change the relative attention towards incoming sensory information, leading to more variable interpretation of an equivalent afferent input.\\n\\nIn the present study we conducted a preliminary test of this model in a supplementary analysis of previously published data (Hayen 2017). We hypothesised that individual differences in psychological traits (anxiety, depression, anxiety sensitivity) would correlate with the variability of subjective evaluation of equivalent breathlessness challenges. To better understand the resulting inferential leap in the brain, we explored whether these behavioural measures correlated with activity in areas governing either prior generation or sensory afferent input.\\n\\nBehaviorally, anxiety sensitivity was found to positively correlate with each subjects variability of intensity and unpleasantness during mild breathlessness, and with unpleasantness during strong breathlessness. In the brain, anxiety sensitivity was found to positively correlate with activity in the anterior insula during mild breathlessness, and negatively correlate with parietal sensorimotor areas during strong breathlessness.\\n\\nOur findings suggest that anxiety sensitivity may reduce the robustness of this Bayesian sensory perception system, increasing the variability of breathlessness perception and possibly susceptibility to symptom misinterpretation. These preliminary findings in healthy individuals demonstrate how differences in psychological function influence the way we experience bodily sensations, which might direct us towards better understanding of symptom mismatch in clinical populations.",

    "abstract": "A gradual buildup of electrical potential over motor areas precedes self-initiated movements. Recently, such \\\"readiness potentials\\\" (RPs) were attributed to stochastic fluctuations in neural activity. We developed a new experimental paradigm that operationalised self-initiated actions as endogenous  skip responses while waiting for target stimuli in a perceptual decision task. We compared these to a block of trials where participants could not choose when to skip, but were instead instructed to skip. Frequency and timing of motor action were therefore balanced across blocks, so that conditions differed only in how the timing of skip decisions was generated. We reasoned that across-trial variability of EEG could carry as much information about the source of skip decisions as the mean RP. EEG variability decreased more markedly prior to self-initiated compared to externally-triggered skip actions. This convergence suggests a consistent preparatory process prior to self-initiated action. A leaky stochastic accumulator model could reproduce this convergence given the additional assumption of a systematic decrease in input noise prior to self-initiated actions. Our results may provide a novel neurophysiological perspective on the topical debate regarding whether self-initiated actions arise from a deterministic neurocognitive process, or from neural stochasticity. We suggest that the key precursor of self-initiated action may manifest as a reduction in neural noise.",

We have here applied proximity labelling of FGFR1 in an osteosarcoma cell line to identify determinants of FGFR1 activity. Many known FGFR interactors were identified (e.g. FRS2, PLC{gamma}, RSK2, SHC4, SRC), but the data also suggested novel determinants. A strong hit in our screen was the tyrosine phosphatase PTPRG. We show that PTPRG and FGFR1 interact and colocalize at the plasma membrane where PTPRG directly dephosphorylates activated FGFR1. We further show that osteosarcoma cell lines depleted for PTPRG display increased FGFR activity and are hypersensitive to stimulation by FGF1. In addition, PTPRG depletion elevated cell growth and negatively affected the efficacy of FGFR kinase inhibitors. Thus, PTPRG may have future clinical relevance by being a predictor of outcome after FGFR inhibitor treatment.",

    "abstract": "Genomic sequence mutations in both the germline and somatic cells can be pathogenic. Several authors have observed that often the same genes are involved in cancer when mutated in somatic cells and in genetic diseases when mutated in the germline. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques have provided us with large databases of both types of mutations, allowing us to investigate this issue in a systematic way. Here we show that high-throughput data about the frequency of somatic mutations in the most common cancers can be used to predict the genes involved in abnormal phenotypes and diseases. The predictive power of somatic mutation patterns is largely independent of that of methods based on germline mutation frequency, so that they can be fruitfully integrated into algorithms for the prioritization of causal variants. Our results confirm the deep relationship between pathogenic mutations in somatic and germline cells, provide new insight into the common origin of cancer and genetic diseases and can be used to improve the identification of new disease genes.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular systems such as multiprotein complexes or biopolymers can span several tens to several hundreds of nanometers, but the dynamics of such \\\"mesocale\\\" molecules remain challenging to probe. We have developed a single-molecule technique that uses Tracking Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (tFCS) to measure the conformation and dynamics of molecular assemblies specifically at the mesoscale level (~100-1000 nm). tFCS is non-perturbative, as molecules, which are tracked in real-time, are untethered and freely diffusing. To achieve sub-diffraction spatial resolution, we use a feedback scheme which allows us to maintain the molecule at an optimal position within the laser intensity gradient. We find that tFCS is sufficiently sensitive to measure the distance fluctuations between two sites within a DNA molecule separated by distances as short as 1000 bp. We demonstrate that tFCS detects changes in the compaction of reconstituted chromatin, and can assay transient protein mediated interactions between distant sites in an individual DNA molecule. Our measurements highlight the impact that tFCS can have in the study of a wide variety of biochemical processes involving mesoscale conformational dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Hearing loss is a condition highly prevalent worldwide. It affects people of a broad age range since the causes and risk factors are varied. At present, some types of hearing impairments have a palliative treatment whereas some, especially for those where otic neurons are damaged, cannot be properly treated. Recent findings had shown it possible to use human embryonic stem cell-derived otic neural progenitors (ONPs) as a new mode of treating hearing loss caused by damage to the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). To improve the efficiency and overcome some limitations of this potential treatment, we have applied principles of tissue engineering which involves an interaction between cells and an extracellular matrix -mimicking scaffold. Here, we describe the influence of poly(l-lactic acid)(PLLA) aligned fibres on ONP cell morphology, proliferation, neuronal differentiation and establishment of neural polarity under both progenitor and neuralising conditions. The results show that most of ONPs on aligned fibres exhibited bipolar morphology and extended their neurites along the major fibre axis. Their proliferation was lower than those in 2D culture but the differentiation of ONPs on aligned fibres was significantly enhanced in both progenitor and neuralising conditions as indicated by the fluorescence intensity and number of cells that were positive for neuronal markers ({beta}-tubulin III and NF200) and the expression pattern of spiral ganglion molecular markers (MMP13, NPR2 and NTNG1). Moreover, axonal and dendritic markers (TAU and MAP2 respectively) were also induced after 14 days in culture.",

    "abstract": "A complex network of inflammation succeeds somatic cell transformation and malignant disease. Immune cells and their associated molecules are responsible for detecting and eliminating cancer cells as they establish themselves as the precursors of a tumour. By the time a patient has a detectable solid tumour, cancer cells have escaped the initial immune response mechanisms. To date, no model exists for studying the underlying mechanisms that govern the initial phase of the immune response when transformed cells become precursors of cancer. Here we describe the development of a double binary zebrafish model designed for exploring regulatory programming of the myeloid cells as they respond to oncogenic transformed melanocytes. A hormone-inducible binary system allows for temporal control of different Ras-oncogenes (NRasK61Q, HRasG12V, KRasG12V) expression in melanocytes, enabling analysis of melanocyte transformation and melanoma initiation. This model was coupled to binary cell-specific biotagging models allowing in vivo biotinylation and subsequent isolation of macrophage or neutrophil nuclei for regulatory profiling of their active transcriptomes. Nuclear transcriptional profiling of neutrophils, performed for the first time as they respond to the earliest precursors of melanoma in vivo, revealed an intricate landscape of regulatory factors that may promote progression to melanoma including fgf1, fgf6, cathepsin H, cathepsin L, galectin 1 and galectin 3. The model presented here provides a powerful platform to study the myeloid response to the earliest precursors of melanoma.\\n\\nSummary StatementWe present an innovative double binary zebrafish model for exploring the underlying regulatory mechanisms that govern the myeloid response mechanisms at the onset of melanoma.",

Here, we compared prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus and nucleus accumbens from 6 individuals, performing whole genome bisulfite sequencing for DNA methylation. In addition, we have performed ATAC-seq for chromatin accessibility, and RNA-seq for gene expression in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex from 6 additional individuals. We found substantial neuron- and brain region-specific differences in both DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility which were largely non-overlapping, and were greatest between nucleus accumbens and the other regions. In contrast, glial methylation and chromatin were relatively homogeneous across brain regions, although neuron/glia ratios varied greatly, demonstrating the necessity for cellular fractionation. Gene expression was also largely the same across glia from different brain regions and substantially different for neurons. Expression was correlated with methylation and accessibility across promoters and known enhancers. Several classes of transcription factor binding sites were enriched at regions of differential methylation and accessibility, including many that respond to synaptic activity. Finally, both regions of differential methylation and those of differential accessibility showed a surprising >10-fold enrichment of explained heritability associated with addictive behavior, as well as schizophrenia- and neuroticism-associated regions, suggesting that common psychiatric illness is mediated through brain region-specific epigenetic marks.",

By combining both of these control loops, we have created a population regulation circuit where both the total population size and relative cell type ratio can be set by reference signals. The dynamics of the regulation circuit show robustness and adaptation to perturbations in cell growth rate and changes in cell numbers.

    "abstract": "Identifying genes underlying complex diseases remains a major challenge. Biomarkers are typically identified by comparing average levels of gene expression in populations of healthy and diseased individuals. However, genetic diversities may undermine the effort to uncover genes with significant but individual contribution to the spectrum of disease phenotypes within a population. Here we leverage the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), a model system of 100+ genetically diverse strains of mice exhibiting different complex disease traits, to develop a personalized differential gene expression analysis that is able to identify disease-associated genes missed by traditional population-wide methods. The population-level and personalized approaches are compared for isoproterenol(ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure using pre- and post-ISO gene expression and phenotypic data. The personalized approach identifies 36 Fold-Change (FC) genes predictive of the severity of cardiac hypertrophy, and enriched in genes previously associated with cardiac diseases in human. Strikingly, these genes are either up- or down-regulated at the individual strain level, and are therefore missed when averaging at the population level. Using insights from the gene regulatory network and protein-protein interactome, we identify Hes1 as a strong candidate FC gene. We validate its role by showing that even a mild knockdown of 20-40% of Hes1 can induce a dramatic reduction of hypertrophy by 80-90% in rat neonatal cardiac cells. These findings emphasize the importance of a personalized approach to identify causal genes underlying complex diseases as well as to develop personalized therapies.\\n\\nSignificanceA traditional approach to investigate the genetic basis of complex diseases is to look for genes with a global change in expression between diseased and healthy individuals. Here, we investigate individual changes of gene expression by inducing heart failure in 100 strains of genetically distinct mice. We find that genes associated to the severity of the disease are either up- or down-regulated across individuals and are therefore missed by a traditional population level approach. However, they are enriched in human cardiac disease genes and form a coregulated module strongly interacting with a cardiac hypertrophic signaling network in the human interactome. Our analysis demonstrates that individualized approaches are crucial to reveal all genes involved in the development of complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "In social insects, the postembryonic development of individuals exhibits strong phenotypic plasticity in response to environment, thus generating the caste system. Different from eusocial Hymenoptera, in which queens dominate reproduction and inhibit worker fertility, the primary reproductive caste in termites (kings and queens) can be replaced by neotenic reproductives derived from functionally sterile individuals. Feedback regulation of nestmate differentiation into reproductives has been suggested, but the sex-specificity remains inconclusive. In the eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes, we tested the hypothesis that neotenic reproductives regulate worker-reproductive transition in a sex-specific manner. With this R. flavipes system, we demonstrate a sex-specific regulatory mechanism with both inhibitory and stimulatory functions. Neotenics inhibit workers of the same sex from differentiating into additional reproductives, but stimulate workers of the opposite sex to undergo this transition. Furthermore, this process is not affected by the presence of soldiers. Our results highlight the extraordinary reproductive plasticity of termites in response to social cues, and provide insights into the regulation of reproductive division of labour in a hemimetabolous social insect.",

    "abstract": "Many terrestrial ectothermic species exhibit limited variation in upper thermal tolerance across latitude. However, these trends may not signify limited adaptive capacity to increase thermal tolerance in the face of climate change. Instead, thermal tolerance may be similar among populations because behavioral thermoregulation by mobile organisms or life stages may buffer natural selection for thermal tolerance. We compared thermal tolerance of adults and embryos among natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster from a broad range of thermal habitats around the globe to assess natural variation of thermal tolerance in mobile vs. immobile life stages. We found no variation among populations in adult thermal tolerance, but embryonic thermal tolerance was higher in tropical strains than in temperate strains. Average maximum temperature of the warmest month of the year predicted embryonic thermal tolerance in tropical but not temperate sites. We further report that embryos live closer to their upper thermal limits than adultso--i.e., thermal safety margins are smaller for embryos than adults. F1 hybrid embryos from crosses between temperate and tropical populations had thermal tolerance that matched that of tropical embryos, suggesting dominance of heat-tolerant alleles. Together our findings suggest that thermal selection has led to divergence in embryonic thermal tolerance but that selection for divergent thermal tolerance may be limited in adults. Further, our results suggest that thermal traits should be measured across life stages in order to better predict adaptive limits.\\n\\nImpact SummaryClimate change may threaten the extinction of many ectothermic species, unless populations can evolutionarily adapt to rising temperatures. Natural selection should favor individuals with higher heat tolerances in hotter environments. But recent studies have found that individuals from hot and cold places often have similar heat tolerances. This pattern may indicate that the evolution of heat tolerance is constrained. If this were true, then it would have dire consequences for species persistence under novel thermal conditions.\\n\\nAn alternative explanation for lack of variation in heat tolerance is that mobile organisms dont need higher heat tolerances to survive in hotter places. The majority of studies have focused on heat tolerance of the adult life stage. Yet, adults in many species are mobile organisms that can avoid extreme heat by seeking shelter in cooler microhabitats (e.g., shaded locations). In contrast, immobile life stages (e.g., insect eggs) cannot behaviorally avoid extreme heat. Thus, mobile and immobile life stages may face different thermal selection pressures that lead to disparate patterns of thermal adaptation across life stages.\\n\\nHere, we compared heat tolerances of fruit fly adults and eggs (Drosophila melanogaster) from populations in temperate North America and tropical locations around the globe. Consistent with previous studies, we found no differences among populations in adult heat tolerance. However, eggs from tropical flies were consistently more heat tolerant than eggs from North American flies. Further, eggs had lower heat tolerance than adults. Consequently, fly eggs in the hotter tropics may experience heat death more frequently than adult flies later in life. This may explain why patterns of divergence in heat tolerance were decoupled across life stages. These patterns indicate that thermal adaptation may be life-stage-specific and suggest that future work should characterize thermal traits across life stages to better understand the evolution of thermal limits.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome duplication has played a pivotal role in the evolution of many eukaryotic lineages, including the vertebrates. The most recent vertebrate genome duplication is that in Xenopus laevis, resulting from the hybridization of two closely related species about 17 million years ago [1]. However, little is known about the consequences of this duplication at the level of the genome, the epigenome and gene expression.\\n\\nResultsOf the parental subgenomes, S chromosomes have degraded faster than L chromosomes ever since the genome duplication and until the present day. Deletions appear to have the largest effect on pseudogene formation and loss of regulatory regions. Deleted regions are enriched for long DNA repeats and the flanking regions have high alignment scores, suggesting that non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) has played a significant role in the loss of DNA. To assess innovations in the X. laevis subgenomes we examined p300 (Ep300)-bound enhancer peaks that are unique to one subgenome and absent from X. tropicalis. A large majority of new enhancers are comprised of transposable elements. Finally, to dissect early and late events following interspecific hybridization, we examined the epigenome and the enhancer landscape in X. tropicalis x X. laevis hybrid embryos. Strikingly, young X. tropicalis DNA transposons are derepressed and recruit p300 in hybrid embryos.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results show that erosion of X. laevis genes and functional regulatory elements is associated with repeats and NAHR, and furthermore that young repeats have also contributed to the p300-bound regulatory landscape following hybridization and whole genome duplication.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization and polyploidy followed by genome-wide diploidization significantly impacted the diversification of land plants. The ancient At- whole-genome duplication (WGD) preceded the diversification of crucifers (Brassicaceae). Some genera and tribes also experienced younger, mesopolyploid WGDs concealed by subsequent genome diploidization. Here we tested if multiple base chromosome numbers originated due to genome diploidization after independent mesopolyploid WGDs and how diploidization impacted post-polyploid gene retention. Sixteen species representing ten Brassicaceae tribes were analyzed by comparative chromosome painting and/or whole-transcriptome analysis of gene age distributions and phylogenetic analyses of gene duplications. Overall, we found evidence for at least 13 independent mesopolyploidies followed by different degrees of diploidization across the Brassicaceae. New mesotetraploid events were uncovered for tribes Anastaticeae, Iberideae and Schizopetaleae, and mesohexaploid WGDs for Cochlearieae and Physarieae. In contrast, we found convergent patterns of gene retention and loss among these independent WGDs. Our combined analyses of Brassicaceae genomic data indicate that the extant chromosome number variation in many plant groups, and especially polybasic but monophyletic taxa, can result from clade-specific genome duplications followed by diploidization. Our observation of parallel gene retention and loss across multiple independent WGDs provides one of the first multi-species tests that post-polyploid genome evolution is predictable.\\n\\nSignificance statementOur data show that multiple base chromosome numbers in some Brassicaceae clades originated due to genome diploidization following multiple independent whole-genome duplications (WGD). The parallel gene retention/loss across independent WGDs and diploidizations provides one of the first tests that post-polyploid genome evolution is predictable.",

    "abstract": "microRNAs are short RNAs that serve as master regulators of gene expression and are essential components of normal development as well as modulators of disease. MicroRNAs generally act cell autonomously and thus their localization to specific cell types is needed to guide our understanding of microRNA activity. Current tissue-level data has caused considerable confusion and comprehensive cell-level data does not yet exist. Here we establish the landscape of human cell-specific microRNA expression. This project evaluated 8 billion small RNA-seq reads from 46 primary cell types, 42 cancer or immortalized cell lines, and 26 tissues. It identified both specific and ubiquitous patterns of expression that strongly correlate with adjacent super-enhancer activity. Analysis of unaligned RNA reads uncovered 207 unknown minor strand (passenger) microRNAs of known microRNA loci and 2,632 novel putative microRNA loci. Although cancer cell lines generally recapitulated the expression patterns of matched primary cells, their isomiR sequence families exhibited increased disorder suggesting Drosha and Dicer-dependent microRNA processing variability. Cell-specific patterns of microRNA expression were used to deconvolute variable cellular composition of adipose tissue samples highlighting one use of this cell-specific microRNA expression data. Characterization of cellular microRNA expression across a wide variety of cell types provides a new understanding of this critical regulatory RNA species.",

    "abstract": "One difficulty when identifying and analyzing alternative splicing (AS) events in plants is distinguishing functional AS from splicing noise. One way to add confidence to the validity of a splice isoform is to observe that it is conserved across evolutionarily related species. We use a high throughput method to identify junction based conserved AS events from RNA-Seq data across nine plant species including: five grass monocots (maize, sorghum, rice, Brachpodium and foxtail millet), plus two non-grass monocots (bananan and African oil palm), the eudicot Arabidopsis and the basal angiosperm Amborella. In total, 9,804 conserved AS events within 19,235 genes were identified conserved between 2 or more species studied. In grasses containing large regions of conserved synteny, the frequency of conserved AS events is twice that observed for genes outside of conserved synteny blocks. In plant-specific RS and RS2Z subfamilies, we observe both conservation and divergence of AS events after the whole genome duplication in maize. In addition, plant-specific RS and RS2Z subfamilies are highly connected with R2R3-MYB in splicing networks. Furthermore, we discovered that the network based on genes harboring conserved AS events is enriched for phosphatases, kinases and ubiquitylation genes, which suggests that AS may participate in regulating signaling pathways. These data lay the foundation for identifying and studying conserved AS events in the monocots, particularly across grass species, and this conserved AS resource identifies an additional layer between genotype to phenotype that may impact future crop improvement efforts.",

    "abstract": "Leukocytes and other amoeboid cells change shape as they move, forming highly dynamic, actin-filled pseudopods. Although we understand much about the architecture and dynamics of thin lamellipodia made by slow-moving cells on flat surfaces, conventional light microscopy lacks the spatial and temporal resolution required to track complex pseudopods of cells moving in three dimensions. We therefore employed lattice light sheet microscopy to perform three-dimensional, time-lapse imaging of neutrophil-like HL-60 cells crawling through collagen matrices. To analyze three-dimensional pseudopods we: (i) developed fluorescent probe combinations that distinguish cortical actin from dynamic, pseudopod-forming actin networks, and (ii) adapted molecular visualization tools from structural biology to render and analyze complex cell surfaces. Surprisingly, three-dimensional pseudopods turn out to be composed of thin (<0.75 m), flat sheets that sometimes interleave to form rosettes. Their laminar nature is not templated by an external surface, but likely reflects a linear arrangement of regulatory molecules. Although we find that pseudopods are dispensable for three-dimensional locomotion, their elimination dramatically decreases the frequency of cell turning, and pseudopod dynamics increase when cells change direction, highlighting the important role pseudopods play in pathfinding.",

    "abstract": "How do large-scale brain networks reorganize during the waxing and waning of anxious anticipation? Here, threat was dynamically modulated during functional MRI as two circles slowly meandered on the screen; if they touched, an unpleasant shock was delivered. We employed intersubject network analysis, which allows the investigation of network-level properties \\\"across brains,\\\" and sought to determine how network properties changed during periods of approach (circles moving closer) and periods of retreat (circles moving apart). Dynamic threat altered network cohesion across the salience, executive, and task-negative networks, as well as subcortical regions. Functional connections between subcortical regions and the salience network also increased during approach vs. retreat, including the putative periaqueductal gray, habenula, and amygdala, showing that the latter is involved under conditions of relatively prolonged and uncertain threat (the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis was observed during both approach and retreat). Together, our findings unraveled dynamic properties of large-scale networks across participants while threat levels varied continuously, and demonstrate the potential of characterizing emotional processing at the level of distributed networks.\\n\\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding the brain basis of anxious anticipation is important not only from a basic research perspective, but because aberrant responding to uncertain future negative events is believed to be central to anxiety disorders. Although previous studies have investigated how brain responses are sensitive to threat proximity, little is known about how patterns of response co-activation change during dynamic manipulations of threat. To address these important gaps in the literature, we studied the dynamics of emotional processing at the level of large-scale brain networks by devising a manipulation in which threat was dynamically modulated during functional MRI scanning.",

It has been predicted that the richness of species involved in obligate mutualisms should be positively associated across their range. Whereas, if mutualisms are facilitative, the distribution of mutualists should be correlated with other factors. This study is the first study to compare the co-distribution of mutualist species in general and seed dispersal mutualisms specifically. We used geographic distributions of plant and animal mutualists to investigate the co-distribution and patterns of seed dispersal mutualisms. We found the mutualism between dispersers and plants does not account for the distribution of either group. In fact, there is a mismatch of richness between plants and the animals that disperse their seeds. Environmental factors are better predictors of both animal distribution and seed dispersal mutualisms across North America.\\n\\nStatement of authorshipJD, CM, and SV conceived the original project idea.

Here, we show that viruses were responsible for dozens of adaptive introgressions between Neanderthals and modern humans. We identify RNA viruses--specifically lentiviruses and orthomyxoviruses--as likely drivers of introgressions from Neanderthals to Europeans.

    "abstract": "Growth patterns of individual plants and evolutionary trajectories of plant communities are intimately linked with and are critically affected by host-associated microbiomes. Research across systems has begun to shed light on how these phytobiomes are established and under laboratory and natural conditions, and have cultivated hope that a better understanding of the governing principles for host-microbe interactions can guide attempts to engineer microbiomes to boost agricultural yields. One important, yet relatively understudied, parameter in regards to phytobiome membership is the degree to which specialization and coevolution between plant species and microbial strains structures these communities. In this article, I provide an broad overview about current knowledge concerning mechanisms enabling adaptation and specialization of phytobiome communties to host plants as well as the potential for plants themselves to recruit and cultivate interactions with beneficial microbes. I further explore the possibility of host-beneficial microbe coevolution and suggest interactions that could promote the evolution of such close-knit partnerships. It is my hope that this overview will encourage future experiments that can begin to fill in this black box of ecological and evolutionary interactions across phytobiomes.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=155 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/120493_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (26K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16c5315org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c298d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c073a6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e8bd1d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "One method for identifying noncoding regulatory regions of a genome is to quantify rates of divergence between related species, as functional sequence will generally diverge more slowly. Most approaches to identifying these conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) based on alignment have had relatively large minimum sequence lengths ([&gt;=]15 base pair) compared to the average length of known transcription factor binding sites. To circumvent this constraint, STAG-CNS integrates data from the promoters of conserved orthologous genes in three or more species simultaneously. Using data from up to six grass species made it possible to identify conserved sequences as short at 9 base pairs with FDP [&lt;=] 0.05. These CNS exhibit greater overlap with open chromatin regions identified using DNase I hypersensitivity, and are enriched in the promoters of genes involved in transcriptional regulation. STAG-CNS was further employed to characterize loss of conserved noncoding sequences associated with retained duplicate genes from the ancient maize polyploidy. Genes with fewer retained CNS show lower overall expression, although this bias is more apparent in samples of complex organ systems containing many cell types, suggesting CNS loss may correspond to a reduced number of expression contexts rather than lower expression levels across the entire ancestral expression domain.",
