    "abstract": "The Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama) is the insect vector of the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), the pathogen associated with citrus Huanglongbing (HLB, citrus greening). HLB threatens citrus production worldwide. Suppression or reduction of the insect vector using chemical insecticides has been the primary method to inhibit the spread of citrus greening disease. Accurate structural and functional annotation of the Asian citrus psyllid genome, as well as a clear understanding of the interactions between the insect and CLas, are required for development of new molecular-based HLB control methods. A draft assembly of the D. citri genome has been generated and annotated with automated pipelines. However, knowledge transfer from well-curated reference genomes such as that of Drosophila melanogaster to newly sequenced ones is challenging due to the complexity and diversity of insect genomes. To identify and improve gene models as potential targets for pest control, we manually curated several gene families with a focus on genes that have key functional roles in D. citri biology and CLas interactions. This community effort produced 530 manually curated gene models across developmental, physiological, RNAi regulatory, and immunity-related pathways. As previously shown in the pea aphid, RNAi machinery genes putatively involved in the microRNA pathway have been specifically duplicated. A comprehensive transcriptome enabled us to identify a number of gene families that are either missing or misassembled in the draft genome. In order to develop biocuration as a training experience, we included undergraduate and graduate students from multiple institutions, as well as experienced annotators from the insect genomics research community. The resulting gene set (OGS v1.0) combines both automatically predicted and manually curated gene models. All data are available on https://citrusgreening.org/.",

    "abstract": "In a recent past, Transposable Elements (TEs) were referred as selfish genetic components only capable of copying themselves with the aim to increase the odds that will be inherited. Nonetheless, TEs have been initially proposed as positive control elements acting in synergy with the host. Nowadays, it is well known that TE movement into genome host comprise an important evolutionary mechanism capable to produce diverse chromosome rearrangements and thus increase the adaptive fitness. According to as insights into TE functioning are increasing day to day, the manipulation of transposition has raised an interesting possibility to setting the host functions, although the lack of appropriate genome engineering tools has unpaved it. Fortunately, the emergence of genome editing technologies based on programmable nucleases, and especially the arrival of a multipurpose RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease system, has made it possible to reconsider this challenge. For such purpose, a particular type of transposons referred as Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Elements (MITEs) has demonstrated a series of interesting characteristics for designing functional drivers. Here, recent insights into MITE elements and versatile RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering system are given to outline an effective strategy that allows to deploy the TE potential for control of the host transcriptional activity.",

    "abstract": "Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen and a causative agent of culture-negative endocarditis. While C. burnetii initially infects alveolar macrophages, it has also been found in lipid droplet (LD)-containing foamy macrophages in the cardiac valves of endocarditis patients. In addition, transcriptional studies of C. burnetii-infected macrophages reported differential regulation of the LD coat protein-encoding gene perilipin 2 (plin-2). To further investigate the relationship between LDs and C. burnetii, we compared LD numbers using fluorescence microscopy in mock-infected and C. burnetii-infected alveolar macrophages. On average, C. burnetii-infected macrophages contained twice as many LDs as mock-infected macrophages. LD numbers increased as early as 24 hours post-infection, an effect reversed by blocking C. burnetii protein synthesis. The observed LD accumulation was dependent on the C. burnetii Type 4B Secretion System (T4BSS), a major virulence factor that manipulates host cellular processes by secreting bacterial effector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm. To determine the importance of LDs during C. burnetii infection, we manipulated LD homeostasis and assessed C. burnetii intracellular growth. Surprisingly, blocking LD formation with the pharmacological inhibitors triacsin C or T863, or knocking out acyl-CoA transferase-1 (acat-1) in alveolar macrophages, increased C. burnetii growth at least 2-fold. Conversely, preventing LD lipolysis by inhibiting adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) with atglistatin almost completely blocked bacterial growth, suggesting LD breakdown is essential for C. burnetii. Together these data suggest that maintenance of LD homeostasis, possibly via the C. burnetii T4BSS, is critical for bacterial growth.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEHost neutral lipid storage organelles known as lipid droplets (LDs) serve as a source of energy, nutrients, and signaling lipids. LDs are associated with infection of the intracellular bacterial pathogen Coxiella burnetii, a significant cause of culture-negative endocarditis. While C. burnetii was found in LD-rich foamy macrophages in endocarditis patients, little is known about the host LD-C. burnetii relationship. We demonstrated C. burnetii Type 4B Secretion System (T4BSS)-dependent LD accumulation in macrophages, suggesting a T4BSS-mediated regulation of host LD homeostasis. Further, manipulating LD homeostasis significantly affected bacterial growth, indicating LDs play an important role during C. burnetii infection. As C. burnetii endocarditis has a 19% mortality rate even in treated patients, exploring the LD-C. burnetii association might identify novel therapeutic targets.",

The Escherichia coli Tat system comprises TatC and two additional sequence-related proteins, TatA and TatB. Here we use disulfide crosslinking and molecular modelling to show there are two binding sites for TatA/B proteins on TatC. TatA and TatB are each able to occupy both sites if they are the only TatA/B protein present. However, under resting conditions the sites are differentially occupied with TatB occupying the  polar cluster site while TatA binds adjacently at the TatC transmembrane helix 6 binding site. When the Tat system is activated by the overproduction of a substrate, TatA and TatB switch their binding sites. We propose that this substrate-triggered positional exchange is a key step in the assembly of an active Tat translocase.",

However, accurate integrative structural modeling has been hampered by the challenges in objectively weighing cryo-EM data against other sources of information due to the presence of random and systematic errors, as well as correlations, in the data. To address these challenges, we introduce a Bayesian scoring function that efficiently and accurately ranks alternative structural models of a macromolecular system based on their consistency with a cryo-EM density map and other experimental and prior information. The accuracy of this approach is benchmarked using complexes of known structure and illustrated in three applications: the structural determination of the GroEL/GroES, RNA polymerase II, and exosome complexes. The approach is implemented in the open-source Integrative Modeling Platform (http://integrativemodeling.org), thus enabling integrative structure determination by combining cryo-EM data with other sources of information.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe present a modeling approach to integrate cryo-EM data with other sources of information\\nC_LIO_LIWe benchmark our approach using synthetic data on 21 complexes of known structure\\nC_LIO_LIWe apply our approach to the GroEL/GroES, RNA polymerase II, and exosome complexes\\nC_LI",

The patients provided informed consent at our clinic. The serum alpha klotho levels were evaluated using a human soluble alpha klotho assay kit. The fetal chromosomal abnormalities were investigated at our clinic. We also assessed the clinical outcomes of post-clinical pregnancies.\\n\\nResultsThe serum alpha klotho level during the follicular phase of preimplantation for non-pregnant women was 544.31 pg/ml (mean). The clinical pregnancy rate was 38.1%. There were chromosomal abnormalities observed in four unborn children (9.5%; Down syndrome, etc). The serum alpha klotho levels during the follicular phase of preimplantation in the chromosomal abnormalities group were higher than in the group without chromosomal abnormalities (P=0.029, abnormalities group 659.26 pg/ml [mean] versus control 530.23 pg/ml [mean]). A multiple logistic regression analysis showed the chromosomal abnormalities rates in unborn children were positively influenced by serum alpha klotho levels during the follicular phase of preimplantation (p=0.0008) and the patients age (p=0.008).\\n\\nConclusionPrevious studies have demonstrated that increased alpha klotho levels in human serum are positively correlated with health.

In idealized situations where a single, continuous stimulus is encoded in a homogeneous population code, the value of an encoded stimulus can be read out without bias. Here we find that when multiple stimuli are simultaneously coded in the population, biases in the estimates of the stimuli and strong correlations between estimates can emerge. Although bias produced via this novel mechanism can be reduced by competitive coding and disappears in the complete absence of noise, the bias diminishes only slowly as a function of neural noise level. A Gaussian Process framework allows for accurate calculation of the bias and shows that a bimodal estimate distribution underlies the bias.

    "abstract": "Ongoing anthropogenic alterations of the biosphere have shifted emphasis in conservation biology from individual species to entire ecosystems. Modern measures of ecosystem change, however, lack the extended temporal scales necessary to forecast future change under increasingly stressful environmental conditions. Accordingly, the assessment and reconstruction of ecosystem dynamics during previous intervals of environmental stress and climate change in deep time has garnered increasing attention. The nature of the fossil record, though, raises questions about the difficulty of reconstructing paleocommunity and paleoecosystem-level dynamics. In this study, we assess the reliability of such reconstructions by simulating the fossilization of a highly threatened and disturbed modern ecosystem, a Caribbean coral reef. Using a high-resolution coral reef food web from Jamaica, we compare system structures of the modern and simulated fossil reefs, including guild richness and evenness, trophic level distribution, predator dietary breadth, food chain lengths, and modularity. Results indicate that despite the loss of species, guilds, and trophospecies interactions, particularly zooplankton and other soft-bodied organisms, the overall guild diversity, structure, and modularity of the reef ecosystem remained intact. These results have important implications for the integrity of fossil food web studies and coral reef conservation, demonstrating that fossil reef communities can be used to understand reef community dynamics during past regimes of environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Genetic material sequenced from ancient samples is revolutionizing our understanding of the recent evolutionary past. However, ancient DNA is often degraded, resulting in low coverage, error-prone sequencing. Several solutions exist to this problem, ranging from simple approach such as selecting a read at random for each site to more complicated approaches involving genotype likelihoods. In this work, we present a novel method for assessing the relationship of an ancient sample with a modern population while accounting for sequencing error and post-mortem damage by analyzing raw read from multiple ancient individuals simultaneously. We show that when analyzing SNP data, it is better to sequence more ancient samples to low coverage: two samples sequenced to 0.5x coverage provide better resolution than a single sample sequenced to 2x coverage. We also examined the power to detect whether an ancient sample is directly ancestral to a modern population, finding that with even a few high cover-age individuals, even ancient samples that are very slightly diverged from the modern population can be detected with ease. When we applied our approach to European samples, we found that no ancient samples represent direct ancestors of modern Europeans. We also found that, as shown previously, the most ancient Europeans appear to have had the smallest effective population sizes, indicating a role for agriculture in modern population growth.",

    "abstract": "Divergence time estimation -- the calibration of a phylogeny to geological time -- is a integral first step in modelling the tempo of biological evolution (traits and lineages). However, despite increasingly sophisticated methods to infer divergence times from molecular genetic sequences, the estimated age of many nodes across the tree of life contrast significantly and consistently with timeframes conveyed by the fossil record. This is perhaps best exemplified by crown angiosperms, where molecular clock (Triassic) estimates predate the oldest (Early Cretaceous) undisputed angiosperm fossils by tens of millions of years or more. While the incompleteness of the fossil record is a common concern, issues of data limitation and model inadequacy are viable (if underexplored) alternative explanations. In this vein, Beaulieu et al. (2015) convincingly demonstrated how methods of divergence time inference can be misled by both (i) extreme state-dependent molecular substitution rate heterogeneity and (ii) biased sampling of representative major lineages. While these (essentially model-violation) results are robust (and probably common in empirical data sets), we note a further alternative: that the configuration of the statistical inference problem alone (i.e., the parameters, their relationships, and associated priors) precluded the reconstruction of the paleontological timeframe for the crown age of angiosperms. We demonstrate, through sampling from the joint prior (formed by combining the tree (diversification) prior with the various calibration densities specified for fossil-calibrated nodes), that with no data present at all, an Early Cretaceous crown angiosperms is rejected (i.e., has essentially zero probability). More worrisome, however, is that for the 24 nodes calibrated by fossils, almost all have indistinguishable marginal prior and posterior age distributions, indicating an absence of relevant information in the data. Given that these calibrated nodes are strategically placed in disparate regions of the tree, they essentially anchor the tree scaffold, and so the posterior inference for the tree as a whole is largely determined by the pseudo-data present in the (often arbitrary) calibration densities. We recommend, as for any Bayesian analysis, that marginal prior and posterior distributions be carefully compared, especially for parameters of direct interest. Finally, we note that the results presented here do not refute the biological modelling concerns identified by Beaulieu et al. (2015). Both sets of issues remain apposite to the goals of accurate divergence time estimation, and only by considering them in tandem can we move forward more confidently.

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally despite the availability of the TB therapy. 1 The current TB therapy is lengthy and suboptimal, requiring a treatment time of at least 6 months for drug susceptible TB and 9-12 months (shorter Bangladesh regimen) or 18-24 months (regular regimen) for multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). 1 The lengthy therapy makes patient compliance difficult, which frequently leads to emergence of drug-resistant strains. The requirement for the prolonged treatment is thought to be due to dormant persister bacteria which are not effectively killed by the current TB drugs, except rifampin and pyrazinamide (PZA) which have higher activity against persisters. 2, 3 Therefore new therapies should address the problem of insufficient efficacy against M. tuberculosis persisters, which could cause relapse of clinical disease. 4 PZA is a critical frontline TB drug that kills persister bacteria 5 and shortens the TB treatment from 9-12 months to 6 months. 6, 7 Although several new TB drugs are showing promise in clinical studies, none can replace PZA as they all have to be used together with PZA. 7 Because of the essentiality of PZA and the high cost of developing new drugs, in this study, we explored the idea of identifying drugs that enhance the anti-persister activity of PZA as an economic alternative approach to developing new drugs for improved treatment by screening an clinical drug library against old M. tuberculosis cultures enriched with persisters.",

    "abstract": "Galactosaminogalactan and Pel are cationic heteropolysaccharides produced by the opportunistic pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. These exopolysaccharides both contain 1,4-linked N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and play an important role in biofilm formation by these organisms. Proteins containing glycoside hydrolase domains have recently been identified within the biosynthetic pathway of each exopolysaccharide. Recombinant hydrolase domains from these proteins (Sph3h from A. fumigatus and PelAh from P. aeruginosa) were found to degrade their respective polysaccharides in vitro. We therefore hypothesized that these glycoside hydrolases could exhibit anti-biofilm activity, and further, given the chemical similarity between galactosaminogalactan and Pel, that they might display cross-species activity. Treatment of A. fumigatus with Sph3h disrupted A. fumigatus biofilms with an EC50 of 0.4 nM. PelAh treatment also disrupted pre-formed A. fumigatus biofilms with EC50 values similar to those obtained for Sph3h. In contrast, Sph3h was unable to disrupt P. aeruginosa Pel-based biofilms, despite being able to bind to the exopolysaccharide. Treatment of A. fumigatus hyphae with either Sph3h or PelAh significantly enhanced the activity of the antifungals posaconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin, likely through increasing antifungal penetration of hyphae. Both enzymes were non-cytotoxic and protected A549 pulmonary epithelial cells from A. fumigatus-induced cell damage for up to 24 hours. Intratracheal administration of Sph3h was well tolerated, and reduced pulmonary fungal burden in a neutropenic mouse model of invasive aspergillosis. These findings suggest that glycoside hydrolases can exhibit activity against diverse microorganisms and may be useful as therapeutic agents by degrading biofilms and attenuating virulence.\\n\\nSignificanceThe production of biofilms is an important strategy used by both bacteria and fungi to colonize surfaces and to enhance resistance to killing by immune cells and antimicrobial agents. We demonstrate that glycoside hydrolases derived from the opportunistic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus and Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be exploited to disrupt pre-formed fungal biofilms and reduce virulence. Additionally, these glycoside hydrolases can be utilized to potentiate antifungal drugs by increasing their hyphal penetration, to protect human cells from fungal-induced injury and to attenuate virulence of A. fumigatus in a mouse model of invasive aspergillosis. The findings of this study identify recombinant microbial glycoside hydrolases as promising therapeutics with the potential for anti-biofilm activity against pathogens across different taxonomic kingdoms.",

    "abstract": "Vocal communication evokes robust responses in primary auditory cortex (A1) of songbirds, and single neurons from superficial and deep regions of A1 have been shown to respond selectively to songs over complex, synthetic sounds. However, little is known about how this song selectivity arises and manifests itself on the level of networks of neurons in songbird A1. Here, we examined the network-level coding of song and synthetic sounds in A1 by simultaneously recording the responses of multiple neurons in unanesthetized zebra finches. We developed a latent factor model of the joint simultaneous activity of these neural populations, and found that the shared variability in the activity has a surprisingly simple structure; it is dominated by an unobserved latent source with one degree-of-freedom. This simple model captures the structure of the correlated activity in these populations in both spontaneous and stimulus-driven conditions, and given both song and synthetic stimuli. The inferred latent variability is strongly suppressed under stimulation, consistent with similar observations in a range of mammalian cortical regions.",

    "abstract": "There has been fare amount of debate regarding the contribution of salt-bridges in the stabilization of protein folds. However, their participation in crucial protein functions are well established. The current study analyzes their modes of association, in terms of networks, both within globular proteins and also at protein-protein interfaces. Apart from the most common and trivial case of isolated salt-bridges, bifurcated salt-bridges appear to be a special salt-bridge motif both in terms of its topology and geometry and found ubiquitously in proteins and inter-protein complexes. Interesting and attractive examples presenting different interaction-modes have been highlighted. Bifurcated salt-bridges appear to function as molecular clips instrumental in stitching large surface contours of interacting protein-protein interfaces. The work also emphasizes the key role of salt-bridge mediated interactions in the partial folding of proteins containing large amount of disordered regions. Salt-bridge mediated interactions seem pivotal in promoting  disorder-to-order transitions for small disordered protein fragments and their stabilization upon binding. The results should guide to elucidate the modus operandi of these partially disordered proteins and also should be helpful to conceptualize how these proteins manage to keep necessary amount of disorder even in their functionally active bound forms, encouraging future studies. It should also be potentially beneficial towards the proposed notion of geometrically specific designable interactions involving salt-bridges.",

    "abstract": "Novelty and innovation are fundamental yet relatively understudied concepts in evolution. We may study novelty phylogenetically, with a key question of whether evolution occurs by tree-like branching, or through exchange of distantly related parts in processes akin to horizontal transfer. Here, I argue that except at the lowest levels of biological organization, evolution is not usually tree-like. Perfectly vertical inheritance, an assumption of evolutionary trees, requires simultaneous co-duplication of all the parts of a duplicating or speciating (which I collectively call 'furcating') biological feature. However, simultaneous co-duplication of many parts usually requires variational processes that are rare. Therefore, instead of being perfectly tree-like, evolution often involves events that incorporate or fuse more distantly related parts into new units during evolution, which herein I call 'fusion'. Exon shuffling, horizontal gene transfer, introgression and co-option are such fusion processes at different levels of organization. In addition to co-duplication, units under phylogenetic study must individuate (gaining evolutionary independence) before they can diverge. A lack of individuation erases evolutionary history, and provides another challenge to tree-like evolution. In particular, biological units in the same organism that are the products of development always share the same genome, perhaps making full individuation difficult. The ubiquity of processes that fuse distantly related parts or oppose individuation has wide ranging implications for the study of macroevolution. For one, the central metaphor of a tree of life will often be violated, to the point where we may need a different metaphor, such as economic public goods, or a  web of life. Secondly, we may need to expand current models. For example, even under the prevailing model of cell-type evolution, the sister-cell-type model, a lack of complete individuation and evolution by co-option will often be involved in forming new cell-types. Finally, these processes highlight a need for an expansive toolkit for studying evolutionary history. Multivariate methods are particularly critical to discover co-variation, the hallmark of an absence of complete individuation. In addition to studying phylogenetic trees, we may often need to analyze and visualize phylogenetic networks. Even though furcation - the splitting and individuation of biological features - does happen, fusion of distant events is just as critical for the evolution of novelties, and must formally be incorporated into the metaphors, models, and visualization of evolutionary history.",

Yet ecological works often are subjected to unintentional biases thus an improved framework for hypothesis testing should be used. Double-blind ecological studies are rare but necessary to minimize sampling biases and omission errors and improve the reliability of research. We used a double-blind design to evaluate associations between nests of red wood ants (Formica rufa, RWA) and the distribution of tectonic faults. We randomly sampled two regions in western Denmark to map the spatial distribution of RWA nests. We then calculated nest proximity to the nearest active tectonic faults. Red wood ant nests were eight times more likely to be found within 60 meters of known tectonic faults than were random points in the same region but without nests. This pattern paralleled the directionality of the fault system, with NNE-SSW faults having the strongest associations with RWA nests. The nest locations were collected without knowledge of the spatial distribution of active faults thus we are confident that the results are neither biased nor artefactual. This example highlights the benefits of double-blind designs in reducing sampling biases, testing controversial hypotheses, and increasing the reliability of the conclusions of research.",

    "abstract": "Motor variability plays an important role in motor learning, although the exact mechanisms of how variability affects learning is not well understood. Recent evidence suggests that motor variability may have different effects on learning in redundant tasks, depending on whether it is present in the task space (where it affects task performance), or in the null space (where it has no effect on task performance). Here we examined the effect of directly introducing null and task space variability using a manipulandum during the learning of a motor task. Participants learned a bimanual shuffleboard task for 2 days, where their goal was to slide a virtual puck as close as possible towards a target. Critically, the distance traveled by the puck was determined by the sum of the left and right hand velocities, which meant that there was redundancy in the task. Participants were divided into five groups - based on both the dimension in which the variability was introduced and the amount of variability that was introduced during training. Results showed that although all groups were able to reduce error with practice, learning was affected more by the amount of variability introduced rather than the dimension in which variability was introduced. Specifically, groups with higher movement variability during practice showed larger errors at the end of practice compared to groups that had low variability during learning. These results suggest that although introducing variability can increase exploration of new solutions, this may come at a cost of decreased stability of the learned solution.",

    "abstract": "Empirical feeding studies where density-dependent consumption rates are fitted to functional response models are often used to parametrize the interaction strengths in models of population or food-web dynamics. However, the relationship between functional response parameter estimates from short-term feeding studies and real-world, long-term, trophic interaction strengths remains largely untested. In a critical first step to address this void, we tested for systematic effects of experimental duration and predator satiation on the estimation of functional response parameters, namely attack rate and handling time. Analyzing a large data set covering a wide range of predator taxonomies and body sizes we show that attack rates decrease with increasing experimental duration, and that handling times of starved predators are consistently shorter than those of satiated predators. Therefore, both the experimental duration and the predator satiation level have a strong and systematic impact on the predictions of population dynamics and food-web stability. Our study highlights potential pitfalls at the intersection of empirical and theoretical applications of functional responses. We conclude our study with some practical suggestions how these implications should be addressed in the future to improve predictive abilities and realism in models of predator-prey interactions.",
