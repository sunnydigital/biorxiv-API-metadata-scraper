    "abstract": "Epistasis, commonly defined as the interaction between multiple genes, is an important genetic component underlying phenotypic variation. Many statistical methods have been developed to model and identify epistatic interactions between genetic variants. However, because of the large combinatorial search space of interactions, most epistasis mapping methods face enormous computational challenges and often suffer from low statistical power due to multiple test correction. Here, we present a novel, alternative strategy for mapping epistasis: instead of directly identifying individual pairwise or higher-order interactions, we focus on mapping variants that have non-zero marginal epistatic effects -- the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. By testing marginal epistatic effects, we can identify candidate variants that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners with which the variants interact, thus potentially alleviating much of the statistical and computational burden associated with standard epistatic mapping procedures. Our method is based on a variance component model, and relies on a recently developed variance component estimation method for efficient parameter inference and p-value computation. We refer to our method as the \\\"MArginal ePIstasis Test\\\", or MAPIT. With simulations, we show how MAPIT can be used to estimate and test marginal epistatic effects, produce calibrated test statistics under the null, and facilitate the detection of pairwise epistatic interactions. We further illustrate the benefits of MAPIT in a QTL mapping study by analyzing the gene expression data of over 400 individuals from the GEUVADIS consortium.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEpistasis is an important genetic component that underlies phenotypic variation and is also a key mechanism that accounts for missing heritability. Identifying epistatic interactions in genetic association studies can help us better understand the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. However, the ability to identify epistatic interactions in practice faces important statistical and computational challenges. Standard statistical methods scan through all-pairs (or all high-orders) of interactions, and the large number of interaction combinations results in slow computation time and low statistical power. We propose an alternative mapping strategy and a new variance component method for identifying epistasis. Our method examines one variant at a time, and estimates and tests its marginal epistatic effect -- the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. By testing for marginal epistatic effects, we can identify variants that are involved in epistasis without the need of explicitly searching for interactions. Our method also relies on a recently developed variance component estimation method for efficient and robust parameter inference, and accurate p-value computation. We illustrate the benefits of our method using simulations and real data applications.",

They escaped from the repellents and went to the attractants. Five motile mutants that failed to do that were isolated. They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal sensory stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. The mutants, although motile, failed to respond to stimuli at both 34{degrees}C and at room temperature. Some of the mutants have been mapped.

    "abstract": "Predictive coding suggests that the brain infers the causes of its sensations by combining sensory evidence with internal predictions based on available prior knowledge. However, the neurophysiological correlates of (pre-)activated prior knowledge serving these predictions are still unknown. Based on the idea that such pre-activated prior knowledge must be maintained until needed we measured the amount of maintained information in neural signals via the active information storage (AIS) measure. AIS was calculated on whole-brain beamformer-reconstructed source time-courses from magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of 52 human subjects during the baseline of a Mooney face/house detection task. Pre-activation of prior knowledge for faces showed as alpha- and beta-band related AIS increases in content specific areas; these AIS increases were behaviourally relevant in brain area FFA. Further, AIS allowed decoding of the cued category on a trial-by-trial basis. Moreover, top-down transfer of predictions estimated by transfer entropy was associated with beta frequencies. Our results support accounts that activated prior knowledge and the corresponding predictions are signalled in low-frequency activity (<30 Hz).\\n\\nSignificance statementOur perception is not only determined by the information our eyes/retina and other sensory organs receive from the outside world, but strongly depends also on information already present in our brains like prior knowledge about specific situations or objects. A currently popular theory in neuroscience, predictive coding theory, suggests that this prior knowledge is used by the brain to form internal predictions about upcoming sensory information. However, neurophysiological evidence for this hypothesis is rare - mostly because this kind of evidence requires making strong a-priori assumptions about the specific predictions the brain makes and the brain areas involved. Using a novel, assumption-free approach we find that face-related prior knowledge and the derived predictions are represented and transferred in low-frequency brain activity.",

    "abstract": "A novel strategy for controlling the spread of arboviral diseases such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya is to transform mosquito populations with virus-suppressing Wolbaehia. In general, Wolbachia transinfected into mosquitoes induce fitness costs through lower viability or fecundity. These maternally inherited bacteria also produce a frequency-dependent advantage for infected females by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which kills the embryos produced by uninfected females mated to infected males. These competing effects, a frequency-dependent advantage and frequency-independent costs, produce bistable Wolbachia frequency dynamics. Above a threshold frequency, denoted p, CI drives fitness-decreasing Wolbachia transinfections through local populations; but below p, infection frequencies tend to decline to zero. If p is not too high, CI also drives spatial spread once infections become established over sufficiently large areas. We illustrate how simple models provide testable predictions concerning the spatial and temporal dynamics of Wolbachia introductions, focusing on rate of spatial spread, the shape of spreading waves, and the conditions for initiating spread from local introductions. First, we consider the robustness of diffusion-based predictions to incorporating two important features of wMel-Aedes aegypti biology that may be inconsistent with the diffusion approximations, namely fast local dynamics induced by complete CI (i.e., all embryos produced from incompatible crosses die) and long-tailed, non-Gaussian dispersal. With complete CI, our numerical analyses show that long-tailed dispersal changes wave-width predictions only slightly; but it can significantly reduce wave speed relative to the diffusion prediction; it also allows smaller local introductions to initiate spatial spread. Second, we use approximations for[p] and dispersal distances to predict the outcome of 2013 releases of wMel-infected Aedes aegypti in Cairns, Australia, Third, we describe new data from Aedes aegypti populations near Cairns, Australia that demonstrate long-distance dispersal and provide an approximate lower bound on p for wMel in northeastern Australia. Finally, we apply our analyses to produce operational guidelines for efficient transformation of vector populations over large areas. We demonstrate that even very slow spatial spread, on the order of 10-20 m/month (as predicted), can produce area-wide population transformation within a few years following initial releases covering about 20-30% of the target area.",

We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called R2GLMM for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families.\\nC_LIO_LISimilarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients ICC (also known as repeatability in the field of ecology and evolution) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. ICC is related to R2 because they are both ratios of variance components.\\nC_LIO_LIIn this article we expand our method to additional non-Gaussian distributions, namely quasi-Poisson, negative binomial and gamma GLMMs. However, in theory, our extension could be applied to any distribution and we include an explanatory calculation for the Tweedie distribution.\\nC_LIO_LIWhile expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts, Jensens inequality and the delta method, both of which help in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensens inequality has important implications for the interpretation GLMMs while the delta method allows a general derivation of distribution-specific variances. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data.\\nC_LIO_LIWe illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples in the R environment.

    "abstract": "Drones are rapidly becoming a key part of the toolkit for a range of scientific disciplines, as well as a range of management and commercial applications. This presents a number of challenges in context of how drone use might impact nearby wildlife. Interactions between birds and drones naturally come to mind, since they share the airspace. This paper details initial findings on the interactions between drones and birds for a range of waterbird, passerine and raptor species, across of a range of scientific applications and natural environments. The primary aims of this paper are to provide guidance for those planning or undertaking drone monitoring exercises, as well as provide direction for future research into safe and effective monitoring with drones. Our study sites we all located within Australia and spanned a range of arid, semi-arid, dunefield, floodplain, wetland, woodland, forest, coastal heath and urban environments. We particularly focus on behavioral changes towards drones during breeding season, interactions with raptors, and effects on nesting birds in large colonies - three areas yet to be explored in published literature. In over 70 hours of flight, there were no incidents with birds. Although some aggressive behavior was encountered from solitary breeding birds. Several large breeding bird colonies were surveyed, and included in our observations is monitoring and counting of nests in a colony of over 200,000 Straw-necked Ibis, the largest drone-based bird monitoring exercise to date. In addition to providing observations of interactions with specific bird species, we recommend procedures for flight planning, safe flying and avoidance. This paper also provides a basis for a number of critical and emerging areas of research into bird-drone interactions, most notably, territorial breeding birds, safety around large raptors, and the effect of drones on the behaviour of birds in large breeding colonies.",

    "abstract": "TRPV1 promotes cationic currents across cellular membranes in response to multiple stimuli such as increased temperature, binding of chemicals, low pH and voltage. The molecular underpinnings of TRPV1 gating, in particular the mechanism of temperature sensitivity, are still largely unknown. Here, we used molecular simulations and electrophysiology to shed light on the closed to open transition. Specifically, we found that gating of TRPV1 relies on the motion of an evolutionarily conserved amino acid (N676) in the middle of the S6 helix. On rotation, the side chain of this asparagine faces either the central pore or the S4-S5 linker. Only in the former case is the central pore hydrated and thus conductive. Interestingly, when N676 rotates toward the linker, we observe hydration of four so far unreported small nonpolar cavities. Based on these findings, we propose a model for TRPV1 gating involving the dynamic hydration of these four cavities. Free energy calculations indicate that this gating mechanisms is markedly temperature dependent favoring the open state at high temperature. On the basis of this model, which is able to rationalize a wealth of seemingly conflicting and/or unrelated experimental observations, we predicted the behavior of two single residue mutants, M572A and F580Y, the consequences of which we confirmed experimentally.",

    "abstract": "Cell polarization underlies many cellular and organismal functions. The GTPase Cdc42 orchestrates polarization in many contexts. In budding yeast, polarization is associated with a focus of Cdc42*GTP which is thought to self sustain by recruiting a complex containing Cla4, a Cdc42-binding effector, Bem1, a scaffold and Cdc24, a Cdc42 GEF. Using optogenetics, we probe yeast polarization and find that local recruitment of Cdc24 or Bem1 is sufficient to induce polarization by triggering self-sustaining Cdc42 activity. However, the response to these perturbations depends on the recruited molecule, the cell cycle stage, and existing polarization sites. Before cell cycle entry, recruitment of Cdc24, but not Bem1, induces a metastable pool of Cdc42 that is sustained by positive feedback. Upon Cdk1 activation, recruitment of either Cdc24 or Bem1 creates a stable site of polarization that induces budding and inhibits formation of competing sites. Local perturbations have therefore revealed unexpected features of polarity establishment.",

    "abstract": "Ancient DNA studies have established that European Neolithic populations were descended from Anatolian migrants who received a limited amount of admixture from resident hunter-gatherers. Many open questions remain, however, about the spatial and temporal dynamics of population interactions and admixture during the Neolithic period. Using the highest-resolution genome-wide ancient DNA data set assembled to date--a total of 177 samples, 127 newly reported here, from the Neolithic and Chalcolithic of Hungary (6000-2900 BCE, n = 98), Germany (5500-3000 BCE, n = 42), and Spain (5500-2200 BCE, n = 37)--we investigate the population dynamics of Neolithization across Europe. We find that genetic diversity was shaped predominantly by local processes, with varied sources and proportions of hunter-gatherer ances try among the three regions and through time. Admixture between groups with different ancestry profiles was pervasive and resulted in observable population transformation across almost all cultural transitions. Our results shed new light on the ways that gene flow reshaped European populations throughout the Neolithic period and demonstrate the potential of time-series-based sampling and modeling approaches to elucidate multiple dimensions of historical population interactions.",

    "abstract": "Two major stumbling blocks exist in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data analysis. The first is the sheer file size typically in gigabytes when uncompressed, causing problems in storage, transmission and analysis. However, these files do not need to be so large and can be reduced without loss of information. Each HTS file, either in compressed .SRA or plain text .fastq format, contains numerous identical reads stored as separate entries. For example, among 44603541 forward reads in the SRR4011234.sra file (from a Bacillus subtilis transcriptomic study) deposited at NCBIs SRA database, one read has 497027 identical copies. Instead of storing them as separate entries, one can and should store them as a single entry with the SeqID_NumCopy format (which I dub as FASTA+ format). The second is the proper allocation reads that map equally well to paralogous genes. I illustrate in detail a new method for such allocation. I have developed ARSDA software that implement these new approaches. A number of HTS files for model species are in the process of being processed and deposited at http://coevol.rdc.uottawa.ca to demonstrate that this approach not only saves a huge amount of storage space and transmission bandwidth, but also dramatically reduces time in downstream data analysis. Instead of matching the 497027 identical reads separately against the Bacillus subtilis genome, one only needs to match it once. ARSDA includes functions to take advantage of HTS data in the new sequence format for downstream data analysis such as gene expression characterization. ARSDA can be run on Windows, Linux and Macintosh computers and is freely available at http://dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/ARSDA/ARSDA.aspx.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria frequently engage in cross-feeding interactions that involve an exchange of metabolites with other micro- or macroorganisms. The often obligate nature of these associations, however, hampers manipulative experiments, thus limiting our mechanistic understanding of the ecophysiological consequences that result for the organisms involved. Here we address this issue by taking advantage of a well-characterised experimental model system, in which auxotrophic genotypes of E. coli derive essential amino acid from prototrophic donor cells using intercellular nanotubes. Surprisingly, donor-recipient cocultures revealed that the mere presence of auxotrophic genotypes in coculture was sufficient to increase amino acid production levels in donor cells. Subsequent experiments unravelled that this effect was due to the depletion of amino acid concentrations in the cytoplasm of donor cells, which delayed feedback inhibition of the corresponding amino acid biosynthetic pathway. This finding indicates that in newly established mutualistic associations, an intercellular regulation of exchanged metabolites can simply emerge from the architecture of the underlying biosynthetic pathways, rather than through the evolution of new regulatory mechanisms. Taken together, our results show that a single loss-of-function mutation can physiologically couple the metabolism of two cross-feeding cells in a source-sink-like relationship.",

Infants might move differently for physical, physiological and cognitive reasons, but so far these differences have not been quantified.\\n\\nMethodsThe spatial modes and total magnitude of motion in the MRI scanner were measured (N=211). The effects of group (infant vs. adult) and stimulation paradigm (auditory vs. visual) were evaluated.\\n\\nResultsSpatial modes of motion were found to be distinct between infant and adult groups. Infants had less anterior-posterior translational motion, but greater motion in other dimensions, often with complex multi-axis patterns. In magnitude distribution, sleeping infants often remained more still than adults, but when movement did occur it was more extreme and abrupt. Two groups of adults presented with different stimulation showed similar shapes of motion.\\n\\nConclusionThe spatial modes and magnitude distribution of motion differed substantially between groups, and must be considered carefully as a confound in comparisons of structure or function. The abruptness and magnitude of movement suggests that for infants relative to adults post-processing strategies such as de-noising are likely to be more effective than prospective motion correction.\\n\\nKey notesO_LIQuantified the spatial and temporal distribution of motion during MRI in 211 adults and neonates\\nC_LIO_LIThe different spatial modes in adults and infants were visualized and statistically contrasted\\nC_LIO_LIThe magnitude of motion had \\\"heavier tails\\\" in infants, with more still periods, and more large movements, than adults.\\nC_LI",

Exactly how cell migration is controlled by gap junctions remains a mystery. To shed light on this, we investigated the role of Connexin43 in collective cell migration during embryo development using the neural crest, an embryonic cell population whose migratory behavior has been likened to cancer invasion. We discovered that Connexin43 is required for contact inhibition of locomotion by directly regulating the transcription of N-cadherin. For this function, the Connexin43 carboxy tail interacts with Basic Transcription Factor 3, which mediates its translocation to the nucleus. Together, they bind to the n-cad promotor regulating n-cad transcription. Thus, we uncover an unexpected, gap junction-independent role for Connexin43 in collective migration that illustrates the possibility that connexins, in general, may be important for a wide variety of cellular processes that we are only beginning to understand.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LICx43 regulates collective directional migration of neural crest cells\\nC_LIO_LICx43 carboxy tail controls cell polarity via n-cad regulation\\nC_LIO_LICx43 carboxy tail localises at the nucleus and that depends on BTF3\\nC_LIO_LIBTF3 and Cx43 carboxy tail directly interact to bind and regulate n-cad promoter activity\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Most biological traits and common diseases have a strong but complex genetic basis, controlled by large numbers of genetic variants with small contributions to a trait or disease risk. The effect-size of most genetic variants is not absolute, but can depend on a number of factors including the age and genetic background of an organism. In order to understand the mechanisms that cause these changes, we are studying heritable trait differences between two domesticated strains of C. elegans. We previously identified a major effect locus, caused by a mutation in a component of the NURF chromatin remodeling complex, that regulated reproductive output in an age-dependent manner. The effect-size of this locus changes from positive to negative over the course of an animals reproductive lifespan. Using a previously published macroscale model of egg-laying rate in C. elegans, we show how time-dependent effect-size can be explained by an unequal use of sperm combined with negative feedback between sperm and ovulation rate. We validate a number of key predictions of this model using controlled mating experiments and quantification of oogenesis and sperm use. By incorporating this model into QTL mapping, we identify and partition new QTLs into specific aspects of the egg-laying process. Finally, we show how epistasis between two genetic variants is predicted by this modeling as a consequence of unequal use of sperm. This work demonstrates how modeling of multicellular communication systems can improve our ability to predict and understand the role of genetic variation on a complex phenotype. Negative autoregulatory feedback loops, common in transcriptional regulation, could play an important role in modifying genetic architecture in other traits.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYComplex traits are influenced not only by the individual effects of genetic variants, but also how these variants interact with the environment, age, and each other. While complex genetic architectures seem to be ubiquitous in natural traits, little is known about the mechanisms that cause them. Here we identify an example of age-dependent genetic architecture controlling the rate and timing of reproduction in the hermaphroditic nematode C. elegans. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate how this age-dependent genetic architecture can arise as a consequence of two factors: hormonal feedback on oocytes mediated by major sperm protein (MSP) released by sperm stored in the spermatheca and life history differences in sperm use caused by genetic variants. Our work also suggests how age-dependent epistasis can emerge from multicellular feedback systems.",

    "abstract": "Range expansions and biological invasions are prime examples of non-equilibrium systems that are likely impacted by rapid evolutionary changes. As a spatial process, range expansions are driven by dispersal and movement behaviour. While it is widely accepted that dispersal and movement may be context-dependent, for instance density-dependent, and best represented by reaction norms, the evolution of density-dependent movement during range expansions has received little experimental attention. We therefore tested current theory predicting the evolution of increased movement at low densities at range margins using highly replicated and controlled range expansion experiments across multiple genotypes of the protist model system Tetrahymena thermophila. Although rare, we found evolutionary changes during range expansions even in the absence of initial standing genetic variation. Range expansions led to the evolution of negatively density-dependent movement at range margins. In addition, we report the evolution of increased competitive ability and concurrently decreased population growth rates in range cores. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding movement and dispersal as evolving reaction norms and plastic life-history traits of central relevance for range expansions, biological invasions and the dynamics of spatially structured systems in general.\\n\\nData accessibilityThe data will be made available at Dryad (http://dx.doi.org/xxxxx).

    "abstract": "Whether evolution can be predicted is a key question in evolutionary biology. Here we set out to better understand the repeatability of evolution, which is a necessary condition for predictability. We explored experimentally the effect of mutation supply and the strength of selective pressure on the repeatability of selection from standing genetic variation. Different sizes of mutant libraries of an antibiotic resistance gene, TEM-1 {beta}-lactamase in Escherichia coli, were subjected to different antibiotic concentrations. We determined whether populations went extinct or survived, and sequenced the TEM gene of the surviving populations. The distribution of mutations per allele in our mutant libraries--generated by error-prone PCR--followed a Poisson distribution. Extinction patterns could be explained by a simple stochastic model that assumed the sampling of beneficial mutations was key for survival. In most surviving populations, alleles containing at least one known large-effect beneficial mutation were present. These genotype data also support a model which only invokes sampling effects to describe the occurrence of alleles containing large-effect driver mutations. Hence, evolution is largely predictable given cursory knowledge of mutational fitness effects, the mutation rate and population size. There were no clear trends in the repeatability of selected mutants when we considered all mutations present. However, when only known large-effect mutations were considered, the outcome of selection is less repeatable for large libraries, in contrast to expectations. Furthermore, we show experimentally that alleles carrying multiple mutations selected from large libraries confer higher resistance levels relative to alleles with only a known large-effect mutation, suggesting that the scarcity of high-resistance alleles carrying multiple mutations may contribute to the decrease in repeatability at large library sizes.",

    "abstract": "Mark-recapture estimators are commonly used for population size estimation, and typically yield unbiased estimates for most solitary species with low to moderate home range sizes. However, these methods assume independence of captures among individuals, an assumption that is clearly violated in social species that show fission-fusion dynamics, such as the Asian elephant. In the specific case of Asian elephants, doubts have been raised about the accuracy of population size estimates. More importantly, the potential problem for the use of mark-recapture methods posed by social organization in general has not been systematically addressed. We developed an individual-based simulation framework to systematically examine the potential effects of type of social organization, as well as other factors such as trap density and arrangement, spatial scale of sampling, and population density, on bias in population sizes estimated by POPAN, Robust Design, and Robust Design with detection heterogeneity. In the present study, we ran simulations with biological, demographic and ecological parameters relevant to Asian elephant populations, but the simulation framework is easily extended to address questions relevant to other social species. We collected capture history data from the simulations, and used those data to test for bias in population size estimation. Social organization significantly affected bias in most analyses, but the effect sizes were variable, depending on other factors. Social organization tended to introduce large bias when trap arrangement was uniform and sampling effort was low. POPAN clearly outperformed the two Robust Design models we tested, yielding close to zero bias if traps were arranged at random in the study area, and when population density and trap density were not too low. Social organization did not have a major effect on bias for these parameter combinations at which POPAN gave more or less unbiased population size estimates. Therefore, the effect of social organization on bias in population estimation could be removed by using POPAN with specific parameter combinations, to obtain population size estimates in a social species.",

    "abstract": "Neonicotinoid insecticides are now the most widely used insecticides in the world. Previous studies have indicated that sublethal doses of neonicotinoids impair learning, memory capacity, foraging and immunocompetence in honeybees (Apis mellifera). Despite this, few studies have been carried out on the molecular effects of neonicotinoids. In this study, we focus on the second-generation neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, which is currently widely used in agriculture to protect crops. Using high-throughput RNA-Seq, we investigated the transcriptome profile of honeybees after subchronic exposure to thiamethoxam (10 ppb) over 10 days. In total, 609 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 225 were up-regulated and 384 were down-regulated. The functions of some DEGs were identified, and GO enrichment analysis showed that the enriched DEGs were mainly linked to metabolism, biosynthesis and translation. KEGG pathway analysis showed that thiamethoxam affected biological processes including ribosomes, the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, tyrosine metabolism pathway, pentose and glucuronate interconversions and drug metabolism. Overall, our results provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the complex interactions between neonicotinoid insecticides and honeybees.\\n\\nSummary statementNR1, Cyp6as5, nAChRa9 and nAChR{beta}2 were up-regulated in honeybees exposed to thiamethoxam, while CSP3, Obp21, defensin-1, Mrjp1, Mrjp3 and Mrjp4 were down-regulated.",

    "abstract": "Sensory systems evolve in the ecological niches each species is occupying. Accordingly, the tuning of sensory neurons is expected to be adapted to the statistics of natural stimuli. For an unbiased quantification of sensory scenes we tracked natural communication behavior of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus rostratus in their Neotropical rainforest habitat with high spatio-temporal resolution over several days. In the context of courtship and aggression we observed large quantities of electrocommunication signals. Echo responses and acknowledgment signals clearly demonstrated the behavioral relevance of these signals. The known tuning properties of peripheral electrosensory neurons suggest, however, that they are barely activated by these obviously relevant signals. Frequencies of courtship signals are clearly mismatched with the frequency tuning of neuronal population activity. Our results emphasize the importance of quantifying sensory scenes derived from freely behaving animals in their natural habitats for understanding the evolution and function of neural systems.",

    "abstract": "Most eukaryotic genes are subject to alternative splicing (AS), which may contribute to the production of functional protein variants or to the regulation of gene expression, notably via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). However, a fraction of splice variants might correspond to spurious transcripts, and the question of the relative proportion of splicing errors vs. functional splice variants remains highly debated. We propose here a test to quantify the fraction of AS events corresponding to errors. This test is based on the fact that the fitness cost of splicing errors increases with the number of introns in a gene and with expression level. We first analyzed the transcriptome of the intron-rich unicellular eukaryote Paramecium tetraurelia. We show that both in normal and in NMD-deficient cells, AS rates (intron retention, alternative splice site usage or cryptic intron splicing) strongly decrease with increasing expression level and with increasing number of introns. This relationship is observed both for AS events that are detectable by NMD or not, which invalidates the hypothesis of a possible link with the regulation of gene expression. Our results indicate that in genes with a median expression level, 92%-98% of observed splice variants correspond to errors. Interestingly, we observed the same patterns in human transcriptomes. These results are consistent with the mutation-selection-drift theory, which predicts that genes under weaker selective pressure should accumulate more maladaptive substitutions, and therefore should be more prone to errors of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Chemotaxis is the movement of an organism in response to an external chemical stimulus. This system enables bacteria to sense their immediate environment and adapt to changes in its chemical composition. Bacterial chemotaxis is mediated by chemoreceptors, membrane proteins that bind an effector and transduce the signal to the downstream proteins. From a synthetic biology perspective, the natural chemotactic repertoire is of little use since bacterial chemoreceptors have evolved to sense specific ligands that either benefit or harm the cell. Here we demonstrate that using a combined computational design approach together with a quantitative, real-time, and digital detection approach, we can rapidly design, manufacture, and characterize a synthetic chemoreceptor in E. coli for histamine (a ligand for which there are no known chemoreceptors). First, we employed a computational protocol that uses the Rosetta bioinformatics software together with high threshold filters to design mutational variants to the native Tar ligand binding domain that target histamine. Second, we tested different ligand-chemoreceptors pairs with a novel chemotaxis assay, based on optical reflectance interferometry of porous silicon (PSi) optical transducers, enabling label-free quantification of chemotaxis by monitoring real-time changes in the optical readout (expressed as the effective optical thickness, EOT). We found that different ligands can be characterized by an individual set of fingerprints in our assay. Namely, a binary, digital-like response in EOT change (i.e. positive or negative) that differentiates between attractants and repellants, the amplitude of change of EOT response, and the rate by which steady state in EOT change is reached. Using this assay, we were able to positively identify and characterize a single mutational chemoreceptor variant for histamine that mediated chemotaxis comparably to the natural Tar-aspartate system. Our results demonstrate the possibility of not only expanding the natural chemotaxis repertoire, but also provide a new quantitative assay by which to characterize the efficacy of the chemotactic response.",

    "abstract": "A living cells ability to assemble actin filaments in intracellular motile processes is directly dependent on the availability of polymerizable actin monomers which feed polarized filament growth. Continued generation of the monomer pool by filament disassembly is therefore crucial. Disassemblers like ADF/cofilin and filament cappers like Capping Protein (CP) are essential agonists of motility, but the exact molecular mechanisms by which they accelerate actin polymerization at the leading edge and filament turnover has been debated for over two decades. While filament fragmentation by ADF/cofilin has long been demonstrated by TIRF, filament depolymerization was only inferred from bulk solution assays. Using microfluidics-assisted TIRF microscopy, we provide the first direct visual evidence of ADF's simultaneous severing and rapid depolymerization of individual filaments. We have also built a conceptually novel assay to directly visualize ADFs effect on a filament population. We demonstrate that ADFs enhanced pointed-end depolymerization leads to an increase in polymerizable actin monomers co-existing with filaments, thus promoting faster barbed-end growth. We further reveal how ADF-enhanced filament depolymerization synergizes with CPs long-predicted \\\"monomer funneling\\\" and leads to skyrocketing of filament growth rates, close to estimated rates in the lamellipodia. The \\\"Funneling model\\\" hypothesized, on thermodynamic grounds, that at high enough extent of capping, the few noncapped filaments transiently grow much faster, an effect proposed to be very important for motility. We provide the first direct microscopic evidence of monomer funneling by CP at the scale of individual filaments. We believe that these results enlighten our understanding of the turnover of cellular actin networks.",

    "abstract": "Certain typical old wheat varieties grown in the Mediterranean countries and elsewhere are renowned for their nutritional value due to higher concentration of polyphenols, especially flavonoids, as well as of important minerals, than modern varieties. However, the respective economical sustainability is constrained by reduced yield, increasing costs and stagnating or decreasing market prices. Moreover, under certain conditions, connected with the respective scale and local market volume, low-input, organically grown cereals can lead to lower environmental footprint. Brewing with a portion of such old grains can effectively boost their spreading, conditioned on its ability to supply a significant additional net income to farmers. Beer has become the worldwide most consumed alcoholic beverage and, although its market is dominated by few global players and standardized products, craft breweries have quickly spread out in most countries. Nevertheless, a scale issue has arisen about the economic sustainability of microbreweries, mainly due to high initial capital investment, energy costs, scale, and sometimes taxation. It is shown how breakthrough, cheaper, more efficient and profitable microbreweries can help solving the sustainability issues affecting old wheat varieties, thus boosting the respective spreading, lowering the environmental footprint of the cereal sector and contributing to improve the public health.",

Paradoxically, high levels of H3K27me3 were also detected at hundreds of genomic loci. However, it is not known how and why H3K27me3 is redistributed in DIPG cells.

But more importantly, Jarid2, a PRC2-associated protein, strongly correlates the presence of H3K27me3 and relieves the H3.3K27M-mediated inhibition in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we show that H3K27me3-mediated silencing of tumor suppressor gene Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) supports the proliferation of DIPG cells and reaction of WT1 inhibits DIPG proliferation. Together, these studies reveal mechanisms whereby H3K27me3 is retained in the environment of global loss of this mark, and how persistence of this mark contributes to DIPG tumorigenesis.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in a wide range of cardiovascular diseases including cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and arrhythmias, but it is unknown if it also contributes to SCD risk. We sought to examine the prospective association between mtDNA copy number (mtDNA-CN), a surrogate marker of mitochondrial function, and SCD risk.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsWe measured baseline mtDNA-CN in 11,093 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. mtDNA-CN was calculated from probe intensities of mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) on the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. SCD was defined as a sudden pulseless condition presumed due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia in a previously stable individual without evidence of a non-cardiac cause of cardiac arrest. SCD cases were reviewed and adjudicated by an expert committee. During a median follow-up of 20.4 years, we observed 361 SCD cases. After adjusting for age, race, sex, and center, the hazard ratio (HR) for SCD comparing the 1st to the 5th quintiles of mtDNA-CN was 2.24 (95% CI 1.58 to 3.19; p-trend <0.001). When further adjusting for traditional CVD risk factors, prevalent CHD, heart rate, and QT interval duration, the association remained statistically significant. Spline regression models showed that the association was approximately linear over the range of mtDNA-CN values. No apparent interaction by race or by sex was detected.\\n\\nConclusionIn this community-based prospective study, mtDNA-CN in peripheral blood was inversely associated with the risk of SCD.",

The aims of this study were to assess the social-ecological risk factors associated with dengue and mosquito presence at the household-level.\\n\\nMethodsIn 2014 we conducted 100 household surveys (50 on each island) in neighborhoods with prior reported dengue. Adult mosquitoes were collected inside and outside the home, larval indices were determined through container surveys, and heads of households were interviewed to determine demographics, prior dengue infections, housing conditions, and knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding dengue. Multimodel selection methods were used to derive best-fit generalized linear regression (GLM) models of prior dengue infection, and the presence of Ae. aegypti in the home.\\n\\nResultsWe found that 24% of PB and 14% of PA respondents self-reported a prior dengue infection, and more PB homes than PA homes had Ae. aegypti. The top-ranked model for prior dengue infection included human movement - travel between neighborhoods, between islands, and to the mainland; demographics including salary level and education of the head of household, and increase with more people per room in a house, house condition, access to water quality issues, and dengue awareness. The top-ranked model for the presence of Ae. aegypti included housing conditions, including the presence of window screens and air conditioners, mosquito control actions, and dengue risk perception.\\n\\nDiscussion/conclusionTo our knowledge, this is the first study of dengue risk and Aedes aegypti in the Galapagos Islands.

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that animal nutrition is tightly linked to gut microbiota, especially under nutritional stress. In Drosophila, microbiota are known to promote juvenile growth, development and survival on poor diets, mainly through enhanced digestion leading to changes in hormonal signaling. Here we show that this reliance on microbiota is greatly reduced in replicated Drosophila populations that adapted to a poor larval diet in the course of over 170 generations of experimental evolution. Protein and polysaccharide digestion in these malnutrition-adapted populations became much less dependent on colonization with microbiota. This was accompanied by changes in at least some targets of dFOXO transcription factor, which is a key regulator of cell growth and survival. Our study suggests that some metazoans have retained the evolutionary potential to adapt their physiology such that association with microbiota may become optional rather than essential.",

We quantified the impact of ahead-of-time HCW-targeted strategies, and reactive HCW and community vaccination.\\n\\nResultsWe found that for some outbreaks (we call \\\"type 1\\\") HCW amplified transmission both to other HCW and the community, and in these outbreaks prophylactic vaccination of HCW decreased outbreak size. Reactive vaccination strategies had little effect because type 1 outbreaks ended quickly. However, in outbreaks with longer time courses (\\\"type 2 outbreaks\\\"), reactive community vaccination decreased the number of cases, with or without prophylactic HCW-targeted vaccination. For both outbreak types, we found that ahead-of-time HCW-targeted strategies had an impact at coverage of 30%.\\n\\nConclusionsThe optimal vaccine strategy depends on the dynamics of the outbreak and the impact of other interventions on transmission. Although we will not know the characteristics of a new outbreak, ahead-of-time HCW-targeted vaccination can decrease the total outbreak size, even at low vaccine coverage.\\n\\nsummaryTargeting health care workers for Ebola virus disease vaccination can decrease the size of outbreaks, and the number of health care workers infected. The impact of these strategies decrease depends on timing, coverage, and the dynamics of the outbreak.",

    "abstract": "To examine how climate affects soil development and nutrient availability over long timescales, we studied a series of four long-term chronosequences along a climate gradient in southwestern Australia. Annual rainfall ranged from 533 mm to 1185 mm (water balance from -900 mm to +52 mm) and each chronosequence included Holocene ([&le;]6.5 ka), Middle Pleistocene (120-500 ka), and Early Pleistocene ([~]2000 ka) dunes. Vegetation changed markedly along the climosequence, from shrubland at the driest site to Eucalyptus forest at the wettest. The carbonate and P content of the parent sand declined along the climosequence, presumably linked to variation in offshore productivity. However, soil development and associated nutrient status followed remarkably consistent patterns along the four chronosequences. Pedogenesis involved decalcification and secondary carbonate precipitation in Holocene soils and leaching of iron oxides from Middle Pleistocene soils, ultimately yielding bleached quartz sands on the oldest soils. Along all chronosequences soil pH and total P declined, while C:P and N:P ratios increased, consistent with the predicted shift from N to P limitation of vegetation during ecosystem development. The expected unimodal pattern of leaf area index was most pronounced along wetter chronosequences, suggesting an influence of climate on the expression of retrogression. The four chronosequences do not appear to span a pedogenic climate threshold, because exchangeable phosphate and base cations declined consistently during long-term pedogenesis. However, the proportion of the total P in organic form was greater along wetter chronosequences. We conclude that soils and nutrient availability on the coastal sand plains of southwestern Australia change consistently during long-term pedogenesis, despite marked variation in modern vegetation and climate. The four chronosequences provide a rare soil-age x climate framework within which to study long-term ecosystem development.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is one of the leading causes of invasive fungal infection in humans worldwide. C. neoformans uses macrophages as a proliferative niche to increase infective burden and avoid immune surveillance. However, the specific mechanisms by which C. neoformans manipulates host immunity to promote its growth during infection remain ill-defined. Here we demonstrate that eicosanoid lipid mediators manipulated and/or produced by C. neoformans play a key role in regulating pathogenesis. C. neoformans is known to secrete several eicosanoids that are highly similar to those found in vertebrate hosts. Using eicosanoid deficient cryptococcal mutants{Delta} plb1 and{Delta} lac1, we demonstrate that prostaglandin E2 is required by C. neoformans for proliferation within macrophages and in vivo during infection. Genetic and pharmacological disruption of host PGE2 synthesis is not required for promotion of cryptococcal growth by eicosanoid production. We find that PGE2 must be dehydrogenated into 15-keto-PGE2 to promote fungal growth, a finding that implicated the host nuclear receptor PPAR-{gamma}. C. neoformans infection of macrophages activates host PPAR-{gamma} and its inhibition is sufficient to abrogate the effect of 15-keto-PGE2 in promoting fungal growth during infection. Thus, we describe the first mechanism of reliance on pathogen-derived eicosanoids in fungal pathogenesis and the specific role of 15-keto-PGE2 and host PPAR-{gamma} in cryptococcosis.\n\nAuthor SummaryCryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is responsible for significant numbers of deaths in the immunocompromised population worldwide. Here we address whether eicosanoids produced by C. neoformans manipulate host innate immune cells during infection. Cryptococcus neoformans produces several eicosanoids that are notable for their similarity to vertebrate eicosanoids, it is therefore possible that fungal-derived eicosanoids may provoke physiological effects in the host. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo infection models we identify a specific eicosanoid species - prostaglandin E2 - that is required by C. neoformans for growth during infection. We subsequently show that prostaglandin E2 must be converted to 15-keto-prostaglandin E2 within the host before it has these effects. Furthermore, we find that prostaglandin E2/15-keto-prostaglandin E2 mediated virulence is via activation of host PPAR-{gamma} - an intracellular eicosanoid receptor known to interact with 15-keto-PGE2.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous calcium fluorescence recorded from large cortical neuropil patches strongly correlates with the electro-corticogram, and is thought to arguably reflect primarily pre-synaptic inputs. Here we used in vivo 2-photon imaging with Oregon Green Bapta (OGB) to study neuropil visual responses to moving gratings in layer 2/3 of mouse area V1. We found neuropil responses to be more reliable and more strongly modulated than neighboring somatic activity. Furthermore, stimulus independent modulations in neuropil activity, i.e. noise correlations, were highly coherent across the cortical surface, up to distances of at least 200 m. Pairwise neuropil-to-neuropil-patch noise correlation strength was much higher than cell-to-cell noise correlation strength and depended strongly on brain state, decreasing in quiet wakefulness relative to light anesthesia. The profile of neuropil noise correlation strength decreased gently with distance, dropping by ~12% at a distance of 200 m. This was comparatively slower than the profile of cell-to-cell noise correlations, which dropped by ~30% at 200 m. Interestingly, in spite of the \\\"salt & pepper\\\" organization of orientation and direction encoding across mouse V1 neurons, populations of neuropil patches, even of moderately large size (radius ~100m), showed high accuracy for discriminating perpendicularly moving gratings commensurate to the accuracy of corresponding cell populations. These observations underscore the dynamic nature of the functional organization of neuropil activity.\\n\\nConflict of InterestThe authors declare that no competing interests exist.",

    "abstract": "A cross sectional study of canine cutaneous myiasis was conducted in five randomly selected kebeles of Dire Dawa Administrative council from December 2009 up to April 2010 to determine the prevalence of canine cutaneous myiasis and to assess factors that determine the occurrence of the disease specifically in dog. Active questionnaire survey among 60 households were used for which 384 dogs were sampled. From a total of 384 dogs, 162 (42.19%) were found harboring the disease cutaneous myiasis among this 120 (74.07%) were infested with the 3rd and 2nd instar larvae of Cordylobiaantropophaga. whereas the remaining 42(25.93%) observed dogs were found infested with cutaneous myiasis. The larvae were identified in Dire Dawa regional diagnostic veterinary parasitology laboratory. Analysis of active questionnaire survey showed that there is no statistically significance difference in the prevalence of disease among different breeds and sexes (P >0.05). In this study, an overall prevalence rate of 162 (42.19%) was found with a statistically significant association among different age groups, housing system and living area (kebele) (P<0.05). Higher prevalence was recorded at 02 kebele (Sabian area) 59 (54.65%), 03 Kebele (Depo and number-one), 43(44.33%), 04 Keble (Gende kore and Greek camp) 33(37.50%), Addis Ketema. 27(51.92%) and05 Keeble (Dechatu) 0(0%).

    "abstract": "Extracellular field potentials (EFPs) are an important source of information in neuroscience, but their physiological basis is in many cases still a matter of debate. Axonal sources are typically discounted in modeling and data analysis because their contributions are assumed to be negligible. Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that contributions of axons to EFPs can be significant. Modeling action potentials propagating along axons, we showed that EFPs were prominent in the presence of a terminal zone where axons branch and terminate in close succession, as found in many brain regions. Our models predicted a dipolar far field and a polarity reversal at the center of the terminal zone. We confirmed these predictions using EFPs from the barn owl auditory brainstem where we recorded in nucleus laminaris using a multielectrode array. These results demonstrate that axonal terminal zones produce EFPs with considerable amplitude and spatial reach.",

    "abstract": "Reduced representation methylation profiling is a method of analysis in which a subset of CpGs is used to report the overall methylation status of the probed genomic regions. This approach has been widely adopted for genome-scale bisulfite sequencing since it requires fewer sequencing reads and uses significantly less starting material than whole-genome analysis. Consequently, this method is suitable for profiling medical samples and single cells at high throughput and reduced costs. Here, we use this concept in order to create a pattern of fluorescent optical methylation profiles along individual DNA molecules. Reduced representation optical methylation mapping (R2OM2) in combination with Bionano Genomics next generation genome mapping (NGM) technology provides a hybrid genetic/epigenetic genome map of individual chromosome segments spanning hundreds of kilobase pairs (kbp). These long reads, along with the single-molecule resolution, allow for epigenetic variation calling and methylation analysis of large structural aberrations such as pathogenic macrosatellite arrays not accessible to single-cell next generation sequencing (NGS). We apply this method to facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) showing both structural variation and hypomethylation status of a disease-associated, highly repetitive locus on chromosome 4q.",
