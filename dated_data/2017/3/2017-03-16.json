    "abstract": "Bacteria produce a wide variety of exoproducts that favourably modify their environment and increase their fitness. These are often termed  public goods because they are costly for individuals to produce and can be exploited by non-producers ( cheats). The outcome of conflict over public goods is dependent upon the prevailing environment and the phenotype of the individuals in competition. Many bacterial species use quorum sensing (QS) signalling molecules to regulate the production of public goods. QS therefore determines the cooperative phenotype of individuals, and influences conflict over public goods. In addition to their regulatory functions, many QS molecules have additional properties that directly modify the prevailing environment. This leads to the possibility that QS molecules could influence conflict over public goods indirectly through non-signalling effects, and the impact of this on social competition has not previously been explored. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa QS signal molecule PQS is a powerful chelator of iron which can cause an iron starvation response. Here we show that PQS stimulates a concentration-dependent increase in the cooperative production of iron scavenging siderophores, resulting in an increase in the relative fitness of non-producing siderophore cheats. This is likely due to an increased cost of siderophore output by producing cells and a concurrent increase in the shared benefits, which accrue to both producers and cheats. Although PQS can be a beneficial signalling molecule for P.aeruginosa, our data suggests that it can also render a siderophore-producing population vulnerable to competition from cheating strains. More generally our results indicate that the production of one social trait can indirectly affect the costs and benefits of another social trait.",

    "abstract": "Recognition of personally familiar faces is remarkably efficient, effortless and robust. We asked if feature-based face processing facilitates detection of familiar faces by testing the effect of face inversion on a visual search task for familiar and unfamiliar faces. Because face inversion disrupts configural and holistic face processing, we hypothesized that inversion would diminish the familiarity advantage to the extent that it is mediated by such processing. Subjects detected personally familiar and stranger target faces in arrays of two, four, or six face images. Subjects showed significant facilitation of personally familiar face detection for both upright and inverted faces. The effect of familiarity on target absent trials, which involved only rejection of unfamiliar face distractors, suggests that familiarity facilitates rejection of unfamiliar distractors as well as detection of familiar targets. The preserved familiarity effect for inverted faces suggests that facilitation of face detection afforded by familiarity reflects mostly feature-based processes.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial blooms occur in lakes worldwide, producing toxins that pose a serious public health threat. Eutrophication caused by human activities and warmer temperatures both contribute to blooms, but it is still difficult to predict precisely when and where blooms will occur. One reason that prediction is so difficult is that blooms can be caused by different species or genera of cyanobacteria, which may interact with other bacteria and respond to a variety of environmental cues. Here we used a deep 16S amplicon sequencing approach to profile the bacterial community in eutrophic Lake Champlain over time, to characterize the composition and repeatability of cyanobacterial blooms, and to determine the potential for blooms to be predicted based on time-course sequence data. Our analysis, based on 135 samples between 2006 and 2013, spans multiple bloom events. We found that bloom events significantly alter the bacterial community without reducing overall diversity, suggesting that a distinct microbial community - including non-cyanobacteria - prospers during the bloom. We also observed that the community changes cyclically over the course of a year, with a repeatable pattern from year to year. This suggests that, in principle, bloom events are predictable. We used probabilistic assemblages of OTUs to characterize the bloom-associated community, and to classify samples into bloom or non-bloom categories, achieving up to 92% classification accuracy (86% after excluding cyanobacterial sequences). Finally, using symbolic regression, we were able to predict the start date of a bloom with 78-92% accuracy (depending on the data used for model training), and found that sequence data was a better predictor than environmental variables.",

    "abstract": "Long-read sequencing technologies have the potential to produce gold-standard de novo genome assemblies, but fully exploiting error-prone reads to resolve repeats remains a challenge. Aggressive approaches to repeat resolution often produce mis-assemblies, and conservative approaches lead to unnecessary fragmentation. We present HINGE, an assembler that seeks to achieve optimal repeat resolution by distinguishing repeats that can be resolved given the data from those that cannot. This is accomplished by adding \\\"hinges\\\" to reads for constructing an overlap graph where only unresolvable repeats are merged. As a result, HINGE combines the error resilience of overlap-based assemblers with repeat-resolution capabilities of de Bruijn graph assemblers. HINGE was evaluated on the long-read bacterial datasets from the NCTC project. HINGE produces more finished assemblies than Miniasm and the manual pipeline of NCTC based on the HGAP assembler and Circlator. HINGE also allows us to identify 40 datasets where unresolvable repeats prevent the reliable construction of a unique finished assembly. In these cases, HINGE outputs a visually interpretable assembly graph that encodes all possible finished assemblies consistent with the reads, while other approaches such as the NCTC pipeline and FALCON either fragment the assembly or resolve the ambiguity arbitrarily.",

Antagonistic species interactions dominate the local adaptation literature relative to mutualistic ones, preventing an overall assessment of adaptation within interspecific interactions. Here, we tested whether the legume Medicago lupulina is adapted to the locally abundant species of mutualistic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (\\\"rhizobia\\\"), which vary in frequency across its eastern North American range. We reciprocally inoculated northern and southern M. lupulina genotypes with the northern (Ensifer medicae) or southern bacterium (E. meliloti) in a greenhouse experiment. Neither northern nor southern plants produced more seed flowered earlier, or were more likely to flower when inoculated with their local rhizobium species, although plants produced more root nodules (the structures that house the bacteria) wit their local rhizobia. We used a pre-existing dataset to perform a genome scan for loci that showed elevated differentiation between field-collected plants that hosted different bacteria. None of the loci we identified belonged to the well-characterized suite of legume-rhizobia symbiosis genes, suggesting that the rhizobia do not drive genetic divergence between M. lupulina populations. Our results demonstrate that symbiont local adaptation is weak in this mutualism despite large-scale geographic variation in the identity of the interacting species.",

    "abstract": "The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live-attenuated polioviruses that induce immunity by causing low virulence infections in vaccine recipients and their close contacts. Widespread immunization with OPV has reduced the annual global burden of paralytic poliomyelitis by a factor of ten thousand or more and has driven wild poliovirus (WPV) to the brink of eradication. However, in instances that have so far been rare, OPV can paralyze vaccine recipients and generate vaccine-derived polio outbreaks. To complete polio eradication, OPV use should eventually cease, but doing so will leave a growing population fully susceptible to infection. If poliovirus is reintroduced after OPV cessation, under what conditions will OPV vaccination be required to interrupt transmission? Can conditions exist where OPV and WPV reintroduction present similar risks of transmission? To answer these questions, we built a multiscale mathematical model of infection and transmission calibrated to data from clinical trials and field epidemiology studies. At the within-host level, the model describes the effects of vaccination and waning immunity on shedding and oral susceptibility to infection. At the between-host level, the model emulates the interaction of shedding and oral susceptibility with sanitation and person-to-person contact patterns to determine the transmission rate in communities. Our results show that inactivated polio vaccine is sufficient to prevent outbreaks in low transmission rate settings, and that OPV can be reintroduced and withdrawn as needed in moderate transmission rate settings. However, in high transmission rate settings, the conditions that support vaccine-derived outbreaks have only been rare because population immunity has been high. Absent population immunity, the Sabin strains from OPV will be nearly as capable of causing outbreaks as WPV. If post-cessation outbreak responses are followed by new vaccine-derived outbreaks, strategies to restore population immunity will be required to ensure the stability of polio eradication.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOral polio vaccine (OPV) has played an essential role in the elimination of wild poliovirus (WPV). OPV contains attenuated yet transmissible viruses that can spread from person-to-person. When OPV transmission persists uninterrupted, vaccine-derived outbreaks occur. After OPV is no longer used in routine immunization, as with the cessation of type 2 OPV in 2016, population immunity will decline. A key question is how this affects the potential of OPV viruses to spread within and across communities. To address this, we examined the roles of immunity, sanitation, and social contact in limiting OPV transmission. Our results derive from an extensive review and synthesis of vaccine trial data and community epidemiological studies. Shedding, oral susceptibility to infection, and transmission data are analyzed to systematically explain and model observations of WPV and OPV circulation. We show that in high transmission rate settings, falling population immunity after OPV cessation will lead to conditions where OPV and WPV are similarly capable of causing outbreaks, and that this conclusion is compatible with the known safety of OPV prior to global cessation. Novel strategies will be required to ensure the stability of polio eradication for all time.",

    "abstract": "Competitive gene-set analysis, also called enrichment analysis, is a widely used tool for functional interpretation of high-throughput biological data such as gene expression data. It aims at testing a known category (e.g. a pathway) of genes for enriched differential expression (DE) signals compared to genes not in the category. Most enrichment testing methods ignore the widespread correlations among genes, which has been shown to result in excessive false positives. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that existing methods to account for correlations, such as GSEA and CAMERA, can result in severely mis-calibrated type 1 error and/or considerable power loss due to the failure to properly accommodate the DE heterogeneity across genes. We propose MEACA, a new gene-set testing framework based on a mixed effects model. Our method flexibly incorporates the unknown distribution of DE effects, effectively adjusts for completely unknown, unstructured correlations among genes, and does not rely on time-consuming permutations. Compared to existing methods, MEACA enjoys robust type 1 error control in widely ranging scenarios and substantially improves power. Applications of MEACA to a Huntingtons disease study and a lymphoblastoid cell line data set demonstrate its ability to recover biologically meaningful relationships. MEACA is available as an R package.",

However, whether and how visual information about prey is conveyed to the hypothalamic feeding centre is largely unknown. Here we perform real-time imaging of neuronal activity in freely behaving or constrained zebrafish larvae and demonstrate that prey or prey-like visual stimuli activate the hypothalamic feeding centre. Furthermore, we identify prey detector neurons in the pretectal area that project to the hypothalamic feeding centre. Ablation of the pretectum completely abolishes prey capture behaviour and neurotoxin expression in the hypothalamic area also reduces feeding. Taken together, these results suggest that the pretecto-hypothalamic pathway plays a crucial role in conveying visual information to the feeding centre. Thus, this pathway possibly converts visual food detection into feeding motivation in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "We address the evolution of effective number of individuals under androdioecy and gynodioecy. We analyze dynamic models of autosomal modifiers of weak effect on sex expression. In our zygote control models, the sex expressed by a zygote depends on its own genotype, while in our maternal control models, it depends on the genotype of its maternal parent. Our analysis unifies full multi-dimensional local stability analysis with the Li-Price equation, which for all its heuristic appeal, describes evolutionary change over a single generation. We define a point in the neighborhood of a fixation state from which a single-generation step indicates the asymptotic behavior of the frequency of a modifier allele initiated at an arbitrary point near the fixation state. A concept of heritability appropriate for the evolutionary modification of sex emerges from the Li-Price framework. We incorporate our theoretical analysis into our previously-developed Bayesian inference framework to develop a new method for inferring the viability of gonochores (males or females) relative to hermaphrodites. Applying this approach to microsatellite data derived from natural populations of the gynodioecious plant Schiedea salicaria and the androdioecious killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus, we find that while female and hermaphrodite S. salicaria appear to have similar viabilities, male K. marmoratus appear to survive to reproductive age at less than half the rate of hermaphrodites.",

    "abstract": "Crop establishment in carrot (Daucus carota L.) is limited by slow seedling growth and delayed canopy closure, resulting in high management costs for weed control. Varieties with improved growth habit (i.e. larger canopy and increased shoot biomass) may help mitigate weed control, but the underlying genetics of these traits in carrot is unknown. This project used a diallel mating design coupled with recent Bayesian analytical methods to determine the genetic basis of carrot shoot growth. Six diverse carrot inbred lines with variable shoot size were crossed in WI in 2014. F1 hybrids, reciprocal crosses, and parental selfs were grown in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with two blocks in CA (2015, 2016) and in WI (2015). Measurements included canopy height, canopy width, shoot biomass, and root biomass. General and specific combining abilities were estimated using Griffings Model I. In parallel, additive, inbreeding, epistatic, and maternal effects were estimated from a Bayesian linear mixed model, which is more robust to dealing with missing data, outliers, and theoretical constraints than traditional biometric methods. Both additive and non-additive effects significantly influenced shoot traits, with non-additive effects playing a larger role early in the growing season, when weed control is most critical. Results suggest that early season canopy growth and root size express hybrid vigor and can be improved through reciprocal recurrent selection.\\n\\nArticle SummaryBreeding for improved competitive ability is a priority in carrot, which suffers yield losses under weed pressure. However, improvement and in-depth genetic studies for these traits relies on knowledge of the underlying genetic architecture. This study estimated heritable and non-heritable components of carrot shoot growth from a diallel mating design using a Bayesian mixed model. Results directly contribute to improvement efforts by providing estimates of combining ability, identifying a useful tester line, and characterizing the genetic and non-genetic influences on traits for improved competitive ability in carrot.",

While we appreciate the authors attempt to investigate the accuracy of alternative methods of analysis, their conclusion is based on an inappropriate comparison of the ML point estimate, which does not consider confidence, with the Bayesian consensus, which incorporates estimation credibility into the summary tree. Using simulation, we demonstrate that ML and Bayesian estimates are concordant when confidence and credibility are comparably reflected in summary trees, a result expected from statistical theory.

    "abstract": "Puttick et al. [1] performed a simulation study to compare accuracy among methods of inferring phylogeny from discrete morphological characters. They report that a Bayesian implementation of the Mk model [2] was most accurate (but with low resolution), while a maximum likelihood (ML) implementation of the same model was least accurate. They conclude by strongly advocating that Bayesian implementations of the Mk model should be the default method of analysis for such data. While we appreciate the authors attempt to investigate the accuracy of alternative methods of analysis, their conclusion is based on an inappropriate comparison of the ML point estimate, which does not consider confidence, with the Bayesian consensus, which incorporates estimation credibility into the summary tree. Using simulation, we demonstrate that ML and Bayesian estimates are concordant when confidence and credibility are comparably reflected in summary trees, a result expected from statistical theory. We therefore disagree with the conclusions of PEA and consider their prescription of any default method to be poorly founded. Instead, we recommend caution and thoughtful consideration of the model or method being applied to a morphological dataset.",

    "abstract": "Most studies of responses to transcriptional stimuli measure changes in cellular mRNA concentrations. By sequencing nascent RNA instead, it is possible to detect changes in transcription in minutes rather than hours, and thereby distinguish primary from secondary responses to regulatory signals. Here, we describe the use of PRO-seq to characterize the immediate transcriptional response in human cells to celastrol, a compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine that has potent anti-inflammatory, tumor-inhibitory and obesity-controlling effects. Our analysis of PRO-seq data for K562 cells reveals dramatic transcriptional effects soon after celastrol treatment at a broad collection of both coding and noncoding transcription units. This transcriptional response occurred in two major waves, one within 10 minutes, and a second 40-60 minutes after treatment. Transcriptional activity was generally repressed by celastrol, but one distinct group of genes, enriched for roles in the heat shock response, displayed strong activation. Using a regression approach, we identified key transcription factors that appear to drive these transcriptional responses, including members of the E2F and RFX families. We also found sequence-based evidence that particular TFs drive the activation of enhancers. We observed increased polymerase pausing at both genes and enhancers, suggesting that pause release may be widely inhibited during the celastrol response. Our study demonstrates that a careful analysis of PRO-seq time course data can disentangle key aspects of a complex transcriptional response, and it provides new insights into the activity of a powerful pharmacological agent.",

    "abstract": "Adult sex ratio (ASR) is a central concept in population biology and a key factor in sexual selection, yet why do most demographic models ignore sex-biases? Vital rates often vary between the sexes and across life history, but their relative contributions to ASR variation remain poorly understood--an essential step to evaluate sex ratio theories in the wild and inform conservation. Here we combine structured two-sex population models with individual-based mark-recapture data from an intensively monitored polygamous population of snowy plovers. We show that a strongly male-biased ASR is primarily driven by sex-specific survival of juveniles, rather than adults or dependent offspring. This provides empirical support for theories of unbiased sex allocation when sex-differences in survival arise after the period of parental investment. Importantly, a conventional model ignoring sex-biases significantly overestimated population viability. We suggest that sex-specific population models are essential to understand the population dynamics of sexual organisms: reproduction and population growth is most sensitive to perturbations in survival of the limiting sex. Overall, our study suggests that sex-biased early survival may contribute towards mating system evolution and population persistence, with implications for both sexual selection theory and biodiversity conservation.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSex biases are widespread in nature and represent a fundamental component of sexual selection and population biology--but at which point in life history do these biases emerge? Here we report a detailed individual-based demographic analysis of an intensively studied wild bird population to evaluate the origins of sex biases and their consequences on mating strategies and population dynamics. We document a strongly male-biased adult sex ratio, which is consistent with behavioral observations of female-biased polygamy. Notably, sex-biased juvenile, rather than adult survival, contributed most to the adult sex ratio. Sex-biases also strongly influenced population viability, which was significantly overestimated when sex ratio and mating system were ignored. Our study therefore has implications for both sexual selection theory and biodiversity conservation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOne of the most successful approaches to develop new small molecule therapeutics has been to start from a validated druggable protein target. However, only a small subset of potentially druggable targets has attracted significant research and development resources. The Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project develops resources to catalyze the development of likely targetable, yet currently understudied prospective drug targets. A central component of the IDG program is a comprehensive knowledge resource of the druggable genome.\\n\\nResultsAs part of that effort, we have been developing a framework to integrate, navigate, and analyze drug discovery data based on formalized and standardized classifications and annotations of druggable protein targets, the Drug Target Ontology (DTO). DTO was constructed by extensive curation and consolidation of various resources. DTO classifies the four major drug target protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors, based on phylogenecity, function, target development level, disease association, tissue expression, chemical ligand and substrate characteristics, and target-family specific characteristics. The formal ontology was built using a new software tool to auto-generate most axioms from a database while also supporting manual knowledge acquisition. A modular, hierarchical implementation facilitates development and maintenance and makes use of various external ontologies, thus integrating the DTO into the ecosystem of biomedical ontologies. As a formal OWL-DL ontology, DTO contains asserted and inferred axioms. Modeling data from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program illustrates the potential of DTO for contextual data integration and nuanced definition of important drug target characteristics. DTO has been implemented in the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer of protein target disease relationships.\\n\\nConclusionsDTO was built based on the need for a formal semantic model for druggable targets including various related information such as protein, gene, protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small molecule drug, mechanism of action, protein tissue localization, disease association, and many other types of information. DTO will further facilitate the otherwise challenging integration and formal linking to biological assays, phenotypes, disease models, drug poly-pharmacology, binding kinetics and many other processes, functions and qualities that are at the core of drug discovery. The first version of DTO is publically available via the website http://drugtargetontology.org/, Github (https://github.com/DrugTargetOntology/DTO), and the NCBO Bioportal (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DTO). The long-term goal of DTO is to provide such an integrative framework and to populate the ontology with this information as a community resource.",

One of them is the epithelial rotation of developing organs. However, how epithelial cells move, how they break symmetry to define common direction of their collective movement and what function rotational epithelial motions have in morphogenesis remain elusive. Here, we identified a dynamic actomyosin network with preferred retrograde contractility at the basal side of the rotating follicle epithelium in Drosophila oogenesis. We provide evidence that unidirectional epithelial rotation is a result of actomyosin asymmetry cue transmission onto a tissue plane synchronized by the atypical cadherin Fat2, a key planar cell polarity regulator in Drosophila oogenesis. We found that Fat2 directs actomyosin contractility to move the epithelial tissue in order to provide directed elongation of follicle cells. In contrast, loss of Fat2 results in anisotropic non-muscle Myosin II pulses that are disorganized in plane and deform cell shape, tissue and Drosophila eggs. Our data indicate that directed elongation of follicle cells is critical for proper Drosophila egg morphogenesis. Together, we demonstrate the importance of atypical cadherins in the control of cell mechanics, left/right symmetry breaking and its propagation onto the tissue scale to facilitate proper organ morphogenesis. This process may be evolutionarily conserved in rotating animal organs.",

Giantin morphants have fewer cilia in the neural tube and those remaining are longer. Mutants have the same number of cilia in the neural tube but these cilia are also elongated. Scanning electron microscopy shows that loss of giantin results in an accumulation of material at the ciliary tip, consistent with a loss-of-function of retrograde intraflagellar transport.

    "abstract": "Gene expression is orchestrated by distinct regulatory regions (e.g. promoters, enhancers, UTRs) to ensure a wide variety of cell types and functions. A challenge is to identify which regulatory regions are active, what are their associated features and how they work together in each cell type. Several approaches have tackled this problem by modeling gene expression based on epigenetic marks (e.g. ChIP-seq, methylation, DNase hypersensitivity), with the ultimate goal of identifying driving genomic regions and mutations that are clinically relevant in particular in precision medicine. However, these models rely on experimental data, which are limited to specific samples (even often to cell lines) and cannot be generated for all regulators and all patients. In addition, we show here that, although these approaches are accurate in predicting gene expression, their biological interpretation can be misleading. Finally these methods are not designed to capture potential regulation instructions present at the sequence level, before the binding of regulators or the opening of the chromatin. We develop here a method for predicting mRNA levels based solely on sequence features collected from distinct regulatory regions, which is as accurate as methods based on experimental data. Our approach confirms the importance of nucleotide composition in predicting gene expression and ranks regulatory regions according to their contribution. It also unveils strong influence of gene body sequence, in particular introns. We further provide evidence that the contribution of nucleotide content can be linked to co-regulations associated with genome 3D architecture and to associations of genes within topologically associated domains.",

    "abstract": "Studies of animal personality attempt to uncover underlying or  latent personality traits that explain broad patterns of behaviour, often by applying latent variable statistical models (e.g. factor analysis) to multivariate data sets. Two integral, but infrequently confirmed, assumptions of latent variable models in animal personality are: i) behavioural variables are independent (i.e. uncorrelated) conditional on the latent personality traits they reflect (local independence), and ii) personality traits are associated with behavioural variables in the same way across individuals or groups of individuals (measurement invariance). We tested these assumptions using observations of aggression in four age classes (4 - 10 months, 10 months - 3 years, 3 - 6 years, over 6 years) of male and female shelter dogs (N = 4,743) in 11 different contexts. A structural equation model supported the hypothesis of two positively correlated personality traits underlying aggression across contexts: aggressiveness towards people and aggressiveness towards dogs (comparative fit index: 0.96; Tucker-Lewis index: 0.95; root mean square error of approximation: 0.03). Aggression across contexts was moderately repeatable (towards people: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.479; towards dogs: ICC = 0.303).\\n\\nHowever, certain contexts related to aggressiveness towards people (but not dogs) shared significant residual relationships unaccounted for by latent levels of aggressiveness.\\n\\nFurthermore, aggressiveness towards people and dogs in different contexts interacted with sex and age. Thus, sex and age differences in displays of aggression were not simple functions of underlying aggressiveness. Our results illustrate that the robustness of traits in latent variable models must be critically assessed before making conclusions about the effects of, or factors influencing, animal personality. Our findings are of concern because inaccurate  aggressive personality trait attributions can be costly to dogs, recipients of aggression and society in general.",

    "abstract": "To optimize processing, the human visual system utilizes regularities present in naturalistic visual input. One of these regularities is the relative position of objects in a scene (e.g., a sofa in front of a television), with behavioral research showing that regularly positioned objects are easier to perceive and to remember. Here we use fMRI to test how positional regularities are encoded in the visual system. Participants viewed pairs of objects that formed minimalistic two-object scenes (e.g., a \\\"living room\\\" consisting of a sofa and television) presented in their regularly experienced spatial arrangement or in an irregular arrangement (with interchanged positions). Additionally, single objects were presented centrally and in isolation. Multi-voxel activity patterns evoked by the object pairs were modeled as the average of the response patterns evoked by the two single objects forming the pair. In two experiments, this approximation in object-selective cortex was significantly less accurate for the regularly than the irregularly positioned pairs, indicating integration of individual object representations. More detailed analysis revealed a transition from independent to integrative coding along the posterior-anterior axis of the visual cortex, with the independent component (but not the integrative component) being almost perfectly predicted by object selectivity across the visual hierarchy. These results reveal a transitional stage between individual object and multi-object coding in visual cortex, providing a possible neural correlate of efficient processing of regularly positioned objects in natural scenes.",

    "abstract": "First described from western Kansas, USA, the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, is one of the worst pests of maize. The species is generally thought to be of Mexican origin and to have incidentally followed the expansion of maize cultivation into North America thousands of years ago. However, this hypothesis has never been investigated formally. In this study, the genetic variability of samples collected throughout North America was analysed at 13 microsatellite marker loci to explore precisely the population genetic structure and colonization history of D. v. virgifera. In particular, we used up-to-date Approximate Bayesian Computation methods based on random forest algorithms to test a Mexican versus a central-USA origin of the species, and to compare various possible timings of colonization. This analysis provided strong evidence that the origin of D. v. virgifera was southern (Mexico, or even further south). Surprisingly, we also found that the expansion of the species north of its origin was recent - probably not before 1100 years ago - thus indicating it was not directly associated with the early history of maize expansion out of Mexico, a far more ancient event.",

Here we describe the anatomical and electrophysiological organization of the VTA-projecting PAG neurons. Using rabies-based, cell type-specific retrograde tracing, we observed that PAG to VTA projection neurons are evenly distributed along the rostro-caudal axis of the PAG, but concentrated in its posterior and ventrolateral segments. Optogenetic projection targeting demonstrated that the PAG-to-VTA pathway is predominantly excitatory and targets similar proportions of Ih-expressing VTA DA and GABA neurons.

    "abstract": "BackgroundPerennial growth in plants is the product of interdependent cycles of daily and annual stimuli that induce cycles of growth and dormancy. In conifers, needles are the key perennial organ that integrates daily and seasonal signals from light, temperature, and water availability. To understand the relationship between seasonal rhythms and seasonal gene expression responses in conifers, we examined diurnal and circannual needle mRNA accumulation in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) needles at diurnal and circannual scales. Using mRNA sequencing, we sampled 6.1x109 microreads from 19 trees and constructed a de novo pan-transcriptome reference that includes 173,882 tree-derived transcripts. Using this reference, we mapped RNA-Seq reads from 179 samples that capture daily, seasonal, and annual variation.\\n\\nResultsWe identified 12,042 diurnally-cyclic transcripts, 9,299 of which showed homology to annotated genes from other plant genomes, including angiosperm core clock genes. Annual analysis revealed 21,225 an-nually-cyclic transcripts, 17,335 of which showed homology to annotated genes from other plant genomes. The timing of maximum gene expression is associated with light quality at diurnal and photoperiod at annual scales, with two-thirds of transcripts reaching maximum expression +/- 2 hours from sunrise and sunset, and half reaching maximum expression +/- 20 days from winter and summer solstices. Comparison to published microarray-based gene expression studies in spruce (Picea) show that the rank order of expression for 760 putatively orthologous genes was significantly preserved, highlighting the generality of our findings.\\n\\nConclusionsThis finding highlights the extensive annual and seasonal transcriptome variability demonstrated in conifer needles. At these temporal scales, 29% of expressed transcripts showed a significant diurnal rhythm, and 58.7% showed a significant circannual rhythm. Remarkably, thousands of genes reach their annual peak activity during winter dormancy, a time of metabolic stasis. Photoperiod appears to be a dominant driver of annual transcription patterns in Douglas-fir, and these results may be general for predicting rhythmic transcription patterns in emerging gymnosperm models.",

    "abstract": "The adaptation of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to mammalian cell lines is transforming the study of human functional genomics. Pooled libraries of CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs), targeting human protein-coding genes and encoded in viral vectors, have been used to systematically create gene knockouts in a variety of human cancer and immortalized cell lines, in an effort to identify whether these knockouts cause cellular fitness defects. Previous work has shown that CRISPR screens are more sensitive and specific than pooled library shRNA screens in similar assays, but currently there exists significant variability across CRISPR library designs and experimental protocols. In this study, we re-analyze 17 genome-scale knockout screens in human cell lines from three research groups using three different genome-scale gRNA libraries, using the Bayesian Analysis of Gene Essentiality (BAGEL) algorithm to identify essential genes, to refine and expand our previously defined set of human core essential genes, from 360 to 684 genes. We use this expanded set of reference Core Essential Genes (CEG2), plus empirical data from six CRISPR knockout screens, to guide the design of a sequence-optimized gRNA library, the Toronto KnockOut version 3.0 (TKOv3) library. We demonstrate the high effectiveness of the library relative to reference sets of essential and nonessential genes as well as other screens using similar approaches. The optimized TKOv3 library, combined with the CEG2 reference set, provide an efficient, highly optimized platform for performing and assessing gene knockout screens in human cell lines.",

Twenty-seven differential proteins with human orthologs had been reported to associate with astrocytoma.

    "abstract": "Recent studies of somatic and germline mutations have led to the identification of a number of factors that influence point mutation rates, including CpG methylation, expression levels, replication timing and GC content. Intriguingly, some of the effects appear to differ between soma and germline: in particular, whereas mutation rates have been reported to decrease with expression levels in tumors, no clear effect has been detected in the germline. Distinct approaches were taken to analyze the data, however, so it is hard to know whether these apparent differences are real. To enable a cleaner comparison, we considered a statistical model in which the mutation rate of a coding region is predicted by GC content, expression levels, replication timing, and two histone repressive marks. We applied this model to both a set of germline mutations identified in exomes and to exonic somatic mutations in four types of tumors. Germline and soma share most determinants of mutations; notably, we detected an effect of expression levels on germline mutations as well as on somatic ones. However, whereas in somatic tissues, increased expression levels are associated with greater strand asymmetry and decreased mutation rates, in ovaries and testes, increased expression leads to greater strand asymmetry but increased mutation rates. This contrast points to differences in damage or repair rates during transcription in soma and germline.",

It is likely that the role of PRC is to dampen expression of these PRC-active genes. However, it is unclear how this flipping between chromatin states alters the kinetics of transcriptional burst size and frequency relative to genes with exclusively activating marks. To investigate this, we integrate histone modifications and RNAPII states derived from bulk ChIP-seq data with single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We find that PRC-active genes have a greater cell-to-cell variation in expression than active genes with the same mean expression levels, and validate these results by knockout experiments. We also show that PRC-active genes are clustered on chromosomes in both two and three dimensions, and interactions with active enhancers promote a stabilization of gene expression noise. These findings provide new insights into how chromatin regulation modulates stochastic gene expression and transcriptional bursting, with implications for regulation of pluripotency and development.",

    "abstract": "The selection of amino acid identities that encode new interactions between two-component signaling (TCS) proteins remains a significant challenge. Recent work constructed a co-evolutionary landscape that can be used to select mutations to maintain signal transfer interactions between partner TCS proteins without introducing signal transfer between non-partners (crosstalk). A bigger challenge is to introduce mutations between non-natural partner TCS proteins using the landscape to enhance, suppress, or have a neutral effect on their basal signal transfer rates. This study focuses on the selection of mutations to a response regulator (RR) from Bacilus subtilis and its effect on phosphotransfer with a histidine kinase (HK) from Escherichia Coli. Twelve single-point mutations of the RR protein are selected from the landscape and experimentally expressed to directly test the theoretical predictions on the effect of signal transfer. Differential Scanning Calorimetry is used to monitor any protein stability effects caused by the mutations, which could be detrimental to proper protein function. Of these proteins, seven mutants successfully perturb phosphoryl transfer activity in the computationally predicted manner between the TCS proteins. Furthermore, brute-force exhaustive mutagenesis approaches indicate that only 1% of mutations result in enhanced activity. In comparison, of the six mutations predicted to enhance phosphotransfer, two mutations exhibit a significant enhancement while two mutations are comparable to the wild-type. Thus co-evolutionary landscape theory offers significant improvement over traditional large-scale mutational studies in the efficiency of selecting mutations for protein engineering and design.",

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction has been proposed as a more rigorous way to define prediction confidence compared to other application domain concepts that have earlier been used for QSAR modelling. One main advantage of such a method is that it provides a prediction region potentially with multiple predicted labels, which contrasts to the single valued (regression) or single label (classification) output predictions by standard QSAR modelling algorithms. Standard conformal prediction might not be suitable for imbalanced datasets. Therefore, Mondrian cross-conformal prediction (MCCP) which combines the Mondrian inductive conformal prediction with cross-fold calibration sets has been introduced. In this study, the MCCP method was applied to 18 publicly available datasets that have various imbalance levels varying from 1:10 to 1:1000 (ratio of active/inactive compounds). Our results show that MCCP in general performed well on cheminformatics datasets with various imbalance levels. More importantly, the method not only provides confidence of prediction and prediction regions compared to standard machine learning methods, but also produces valid predictions for the minority class. In addition, a compound similarity based nonconformity measure was investigated. Our results demonstrate that although it gives valid predictions, its efficiency is much worse than nonconformity measures obtained from supervised learning.",

    "abstract": "Mass cytometry (CyTOF) has greatly expanded the capability of cytometry. It is now easy to generate multiple CyTOF samples in a single study, with each sample containing single-cell measurement on 50 markers for more than hundreds of thousands of cells. Current methods do not adequately address the issues concerning combining multiple samples for subpopulation discovery, and these issues can be quickly and dramatically amplified with increasing number of samples. To overcome this limitation, we developed Partition-Assisted Clustering and Multiple Alignments of Networks (PAC-MAN) for the fast automatic identification of cell populations in CyTOF data closely matching that of expert manual-discovery, and for alignments between subpopulations across samples to define dataset-level cellular states. PAC-MAN is computationally efficient, allowing the management of very large CyTOF datasets, which are increasingly common in clinical studies and cancer studies that monitor various tissue samples for each subject.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRecently, the cytometry field has experienced rapid advancement in the development of mass cytometry (CyTOF). CyTOF enables a significant increase in the ability to monitor 50 or more cellular markers for millions of cells at the single-cell level. Initial studies with CyTOF focused on few samples, in which expert manual discovery of cell types were acceptable. As the technology matures, it is now feasible to collect more samples, which enables systematic studies of cell types across multiple samples. However, the statistical and computational issues surrounding multi-sample analysis have not been previously examined in detail. Furthermore, it was not clear how the data analysis could be scaled for hundreds of samples, such as those in clinical studies. In this work, we present a scalable analysis pipeline that is grounded in strong statistical foundation. Partition-Assisted Clustering (PAC) offers fast and accurate clustering and Multiple Alignments of Networks (MAN) utilizes network structures learned from each homogeneous cluster to organize the data into data-set level clusters. PAC-MAN thus enables the analysis of a large CyTOF dataset that was previously too large to be analyzed systematically; this pipeline can be extended to the analysis of similarly large or larger datasets.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a well-established magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique used for studying microstructural changes in the white matter. As with many other imaging modalities, DTI images suffer from technical between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps of 205 healthy participants acquired on two different scanners, we show that the DTI measurements are highly site-specific, highlighting the need of correcting for site effects before performing downstream statistical analyses. We first show evidence that combining DTI data from multiple sites, without harmonization, is counter-productive and negatively impacts the inference. Then, we propose and compare several harmonization approaches for DTI data, and show that ComBat, a popular batch-effect correction tool used in genomics, performs best at modeling and removing the unwanted inter-site variability in FA and MD maps. Using age as a biological phenotype of interest, we show that ComBat both preserves biological variability and removes the unwanted variation introduced by site. Finally, we assess the different harmonization methods in the presence of different levels of confounding between site and age, in addition to test robustness to small sample size studies.",

    "abstract": "A key component to overcoming the reproducibility crisis in biomedical research is the development of readily available, rigorously validated and renewable protein affinity reagents. As part of the NIH Protein Capture Reagents Program (PCRP), we have generated a collection of 1406 highly validated, immunoprecipitation (IP) and/or immunoblotting (IB) grade, mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to 736 human transcription factors. We used HuProt human protein microarrays to identify mAbs that recognize their cognate targets with exceptional specificity. Using an integrated production and validation pipeline, we validated these mAbs in multiple experimental applications, and have distributed them to the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB) and several commercial suppliers. This study allowed us to perform a meta-analysis that identified critical variables that contribute to the generation of high quality mAbs. We find that using full-length antigens for immunization, in combination with HuProt analysis, provides the highest overall success rates. The efficiencies built into this pipeline ensure substantial cost savings compared to current standard practices.",

To practically implement GS in cassava breeding, it is useful to evaluate different GS models and to develop suitable models for an optimized breeding pipeline.\\n\\nMethodsWe compared prediction accuracies from a single-trait (uT) and a multi-trait (MT) mixed model for single environment genetic evaluation (Scenario 1) while for multi-environment evaluation accounting for genotype-by-environment interaction (Scenario 2) we compared accuracies from a univariate (uE) and a multivariate (ME) multi-environment mixed model. We used sixteen years of data for six target cassava traits for these analyses. All models for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 were based on the one-step approach. A 5-fold cross validation scheme with 10-repeat cycles were used to assess model prediction accuracies.\\n\\nResultsIn Scenario 1, the MT models had higher prediction accuracies than the uT models for most traits and locations analyzed amounting to 32 percent better prediction accuracy on average. However for Scenario 2, we observed that the ME model had on average (across all locations and traits) 12 percent better predictive power than the uE model.\\n\\nConclusionWe recommend the use of multivariate mixed models (MT and ME) for cassava genetic evaluation. These models may be useful for other plant species.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a complex disease and studying DNA methylation (DNAm) in tumors is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We compared DNAm in breast tumors with normal-adjacent breast samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We constructed models stratified by tumor stage and PAM50 molecular subtype and performed cell-type reference-free deconvolution on each model. We identified nineteen differentially methylated gene regions (DMGRs) in early stage tumors across eleven genes (AGRN, C1orf170, FAM41C, FLJ39609, HES4, ISG15, KLHL17, NOC2L, PLEKHN1, SAMD11, WASH5P). These regions were consistently differentially methylated in every subtype and all implicated genes are localized on chromosome 1p36.3. We also validated seventeen DMGRs in an independent data set. Identification and validation of shared DNAm alterations across tumor subtypes in early stage tumors advances our understanding of common biology underlying breast carcinogenesis and may contribute to biomarker development. We also provide evidence on the importance and potential function of 1p36 in cancer.",
