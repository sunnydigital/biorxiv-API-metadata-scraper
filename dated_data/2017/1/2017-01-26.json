    "abstract": "Bacteria can evolve rapidly under positive selection owing to their vast numbers, allowing their genes to diversify by adapting to different environments. We asked whether the same genes that are fast evolving in the long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli (LTEE) have also diversified extensively in nature. We identified ~2000 core genes shared among 60 E. coli strains. During the LTEE, core genes accumulated significantly more nonsynonymous mutations than flexible (i.e., noncore) genes. Furthermore, core genes under positive selection in the LTEE are more conserved in nature than the average core gene. In some cases, adaptive mutations appear to fine-tune protein functions, rather than merely knocking them out. The LTEE conditions are novel for E. coli, at least in relation to the long sweep of its evolution in nature. The constancy and simplicity of the environment likely favor the complete loss of some unused functions and the fine-tuning of others.\\n\\nCompeting Interests StatementWe, the authors, declare that we have no conflicts of interest.",

    "abstract": "Humans prioritize different semantic qualities of a complex stimulus depending on their behavioral goals. These semantic features are encoded in distributed neural populations, yet it is unclear how attention might operate across these distributed representations. To address this, we presented participants with naturalistic video clips of animals behaving in their natural environments while the participants attended to either behavior or taxonomy. We used models of representational geometry to investigate how attentional allocation affects the distributed neural representation of animal behavior and taxonomy. Attending to animal behavior transiently increased the discriminability of distributed population codes for observed actions in anterior intraparietal, pericentral, and ventral temporal cortices. Attending to animal taxonomy while viewing the same stimuli increased the discriminability of distributed animal category representations in ventral temporal cortex. For both tasks, attention selectively enhanced the discriminability of response patterns along behaviorally relevant dimensions. These findings suggest that behavioral goals alter how the brain extracts semantic features from the visual world. Attention effectively disentangles population responses for downstream read-out by sculpting representational geometry in late-stage perceptual areas.",

    "abstract": "As the EEG inverse problem does not have a unique solution, the sources reconstructed from EEG and their connectivity properties depend on forward and inverse modeling parameters such as the choice of an anatomical template and electrical model, prior assumptions on the sources, and further implementational details. In order to use source connectivity analysis as a reliable research tool, there is a need for stability across a wider range of standard estimation routines. Using resting state EEG recordings of N=65 participants acquired within two studies, we present the first comprehensive assessment of the consistency of EEG source localization and functional/effective connectivity metrics across two anatomical templates (ICBM152 and Colin27), three electrical models (BEM, FEM and spherical harmonics expansions), three inverse methods (WMNE, eLORETA and LCMV), and three software implementations (Brainstorm, Fieldtrip and our own toolbox). Source localizations were found to be more stable across reconstruction pipelines than subsequent estimations of functional connectivity, while effective connectivity estimates where the least consistent. All results were relatively unaffected by the choice of the electrical head model, while the choice of the inverse method and source imaging package induced a considerable variability. In particular, a relatively strong difference was found between LCMV beamformer solutions on one hand and eLORETA/WMNE distributed inverse solutions on the other hand. We also observed a gradual decrease of consistency when results are compared between studies, within individual participants, and between individual participants. In order to provide reliable findings in the face of the observed variability, additional simulations involving interacting brain sources are required. Meanwhile, we encourage verification of the obtained results using more than one source imaging procedure.",

A primary consideration was to make the mechanism accessible and affordable, and in doing so, lower the cases of Obstructive Sleep Apnea that go undiagnosed due to the cost and inconvenience associated with the traditional diagnosis method--a Polysomnogram. Bluetooth capability was an additional consideration so that the device would transmit data directly to an android smartphone, eliminating the need for an additional output mechanism. The total cost of the device, quite surprisingly, did not exceed $30, and therein rendered the device an accessible, affordable mechanism for diagnosis. Tests of the device on diagnosed patients yielded data consistent with the diagnosis, with a few false positives as a result of the excessive sensitivity of the sensors.",

The cyanobacterial carboxysome is a proteinaceous microcompartment that protects and concentrates the carbon-fixing enzyme RuBisCO in a paracrystalline lattice, making it possible for these organisms to fix CO2 from the atmosphere. The protein responsible for the organization of this lattice in beta-type carboxysomes of the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, CcmM, occurs in two isoforms thought to localize differentially within the carboxysome matrix. Here we use widefield timelapse and 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to study the recruitment and localization of these two isoforms. We demonstrate that this super-resolution technique is capable of successfully resolving the outer protein shell of the carboxysome from its internal cargo. We develop an automated analysis pipeline to analyze and quantify 3D-SIM images and generate a population level description of carboxysome shell protein, RuBisCO, and CcmM isoform localization. We find that both CcmM isoforms colocalize in space and time, prompting a revised model of the internal arrangement of the beta carboxysome.",

In 2015, the improved framework VEGAS2, using more detailed reference panels, was published. Both versions provide user-friendly web- and offline-based tools for the analysis. However, the implementation of the popular top-percentage test is erroneous in both versions. The p-values provided by VEGAS2 are deflated/anti-conservative.

    "abstract": "Active forces generated at kinetochores move chromosomes, and the dynamic spindle must robustly anchor kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers) to bear this load. We know that the mammalian spindle body can bear the load of chromosome movement far from poles, but do not know where and how - physically and molecularly - this load is distributed across the spindle. In part, this is because perturbing and reading out spindle mechanics in live cells is difficult. Yet, answering this question is key to understanding how the spindle generates and responds to force, and performs its diverse mechanical functions. Here, we map load-bearing across the mammalian spindle in space-time, and dissect local anchorage mechanics and mechanism. To do so, we laser ablate single k-fibers at different spindle locations, and in different molecular backgrounds, and quantify at high time resolution the immediate relaxation of chromosomes, k-fibers, and microtubule speckles. We find that load redistribution is locally confined in all directions: along the first 3-4 m from kinetochores, scaling with k-fiber length, and laterally within ~2 m of k-fiber sides, without neighboring k-fibers sharing load. A phenomenological model constrains the mechanistic underpinnings of these data: it suggests that dense, transient crosslinks to the spindle along k-fibers bear the load of chromosome movement, but that these connections do not limit the timescale of spindle reorganization. The microtubule crosslinker NuMA is needed for the local load-bearing observed, while Eg5 and PRC1 are not, suggesting specialization in mechanical function and a novel function for NuMA throughout the spindle body. Together, the data and model suggest that widespread NuMA-mediated crosslinks locally bear load, providing mechanical isolation and redundancy while allowing spindle fluidity. These features are well-suited to support robust chromosome segregation.",

Their internal phylogeny is still in parts unresolved, and the position of their proposed phylum Xenacoelomorpha (Xenoturbella+Acoela) is still debated.\\n\\nHere we describe mitochondrial genome sequences from two acoel species: Paratomella rubra and Isodiametra pulchra. The 14,954 nucleotide-long P. rubra sequence is typical for metazoans in size and gene content. The larger I. pulchra mitochondrial genome contains both ribosomal genes, 21 tRNAs, but only 11 protein-coding genes. We find evidence suggesting a duplicated sequence in the I. pulchra mitochondrial genome.\\n\\nMitochondrial sequences for both P. rubra and I. pulchra have a unique genome organisation in comparison to other published metazoan mitochondrial genomes. We found a large degree of protein-coding gene and tRNA overlap in P. rubra, with little non-coding sequence making the genome compact. Conversely, the I. pulchra mitochondrial genome has many long non-coding sequences between genes, likely driving the genome size expansion. Phylogenetic trees inferred from concatenated alignments of mitochondrial genes grouped the fast-evolving Acoela and Tunicata, almost certainly due to the systematic error of long branch attraction: a reconstruction artefact that is probably compounded by the fast substitution rate of mitochondrial genes in this taxon.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence indicates that species respond idiosyncratically when exposed to the same changes in climate. As a result, understanding the potential influence of biological traits on species distributional responses is a research priority. Yet, empirical support for hypothesised influences of traits on climate change responses remains equivocal.\\n\\nIn this paper, we developed a novel approach to determine whether biological traits predict the degree of climatic niche tracking of British breeding birds in response to recent climate change. First, we quantified how well predicted positive and negative changes in probability of presence from climate-based species distribution models agreed with observed local gains and losses in species occupancy - our measure of climatic niche tracking. Second, we examined whether the degree of climatic niche tracking could be predicted by species ecological and life-history traits, as well as phylogenetic relationships.\\n\\nOverall, British breeding birds displayed a low degree of climatic niche tracking over the period of our study, though this varied substantially among species. Models incorporating traits and phylogeny explained a low proportion of the variation in climatic niche tracking. Nevertheless, we did find statistical evidence that species with lower lifespans tracked their climatic niches more closely, whilst species with a mixed diet displayed a lower degree of climatic niche tracking.\\n\\nWe present here a tractable approach for quantifying the degree to which observed local range gains and losses can be related to climate redistribution and apply it to British breeding birds. Although we do not find strong evidence that traits predict the degree of climatic niche tracking, we discuss why this is likely to be a consequence of the features of our study system rather than the approach itself.

Homologs of V. dahliae Ave1 (VdAve1) are found in plants and in few plant pathogenic microbes, and are differentially recognized by Ve1. However, how VdAve1 is recognized by Ve1 remained unknown. Interestingly, C-terminally affinity-tagged versions of VdAve1 failed to activate Ve1-mediated immunity, suggesting that exposure of the C-terminus of VdAve1 is required for Ve1-mediated recognition. This was confirmed by subsequent analysis of C-terminal deletion mutants, and by domain swap experiments. Although required, only the C-terminus of VdAve1 is not sufficient to activate Ve1-mediated immunity. Intriguingly, a three-dimensional structural model of VdAve1 revealed that the N- and C-termini co-localize on a surface-exposed patch of the VdAve1 protein. Indeed, subsequent analyses of N-terminal deletion mutants confirmed that also the N-terminus of VdAve1 is required to activate Ve1-mediated immunity. Thus, we conclude that a surface-exposed patch of the VdAve1 protein that is composed by co-localized N- and C-termini is recognized by the tomato immune receptor Ve1.",

    "abstract": "The capacity of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fuel substrate supply are key determinants of cardiac muscle performance. Although temperature exerts a strong effect on energy metabolism, until recently numerous respiratory studies of mammalian mitochondria have been carried out below physiological temperature, with substrates supporting submaximal respiratory capacity. We measured mitochondrial respiration as a function of temperature in permeabilized fibers from the left ventricle of the mouse heart. At 37 {degrees}C, OXPHOS capacity with electron entry through either Complex I or Complex II into the Q-junction was about half of respiratory capacity with the corresponding physiological substrate combination reconstituting tricarboxylic acid cycle function with convergent electron flow through the NADH&succinate (NS) pathway. When separating the component core mitochondrial pathways, the relative contribution of the NADH pathway increased with a decrease of temperature from 37 to 25 {o}C. The additive effect of convergent electron flow has profound consequences for optimization of mitochondrial respiratory control. The apparent excess capacity of cytochrome c oxidase (CIV) was 0.7 above convergent NS-pathway capacity, but would be overestimated nearly 2-fold with respect to respiration restricted by provision of NADH-linked substrates only. The apparent excess capacity of CIV increased sharply at 4 {degrees}C, caused by a strong temperature dependence of and OXPHOS limitation by NADH-linked dehydrogenases. This mechanism of mitochondrial respiratory control in the hypothermic mammalian heart is comparable to the pattern in ectotherm species, pointing towards NADH-linked mt-matrix dehydrogenases and the phosphorylation system rather than electron transfer complexes as the primary drivers of thermal sensitivity at low temperature and likely modulators of temperature adaptation and acclimatization. Delineating the link between stress and remodeling of OXPHOS is critically important for improving our understanding of metabolic perturbations in disease evolution and cardiac protection. Temperature is not a trivial experimental parameter to consider when addressing these questions.",

We here show that a single, within-trial information-theoretic measure (weighted permutation entropy) captures neural irregularity in the human electroencephalogram as a proxy for both, trait-like differences between individuals of varying age, and state-like fluctuations that bias perceptual decisions. First, the overall level of neural irregularity increased with participants  age, paralleled by a decrease in variability over time, likely indexing age-related disintegration on structural and functional levels of brain activity. Second, states of higher neural irregularity were associated with optimized sensory encoding and a subsequently increased probability of choosing the first of two physically identical stimuli. In sum, neural irregularity not only characterizes behaviorally relevant brain states, but also can identify trait-like changes that come with age.",

    "abstract": "White tail disease in the giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii causes significant economic losses in shrimp farms and hatcheries and poses a threat to food-security in many developing countries. Outbreaks of Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV), the causative agent of white tail disease (WTD) are associated with up to 100% mortality rates. Recombinant expression of the capsid protein of MrNV in insect cells leads to the production of VLPs closely resembling the native virus. We have investigated the structure of MrNV VLPs by cryogenic electron microscopy, determining a structure of the viral capsid at 7 angstroms resolution. Our data show that MrNV VLPs package nucleic acids in a manner reminiscent of other known nodavirus structures. The structure of the capsid however shows striking differences from insect and fish infecting nodaviruses, which have been shown to assemble trimer-clustered T=3 icosahedral virus particles. MrNV particles have pronounced dimeric blade-shaped spikes extending up to 6 nm from the outer surface of the capsid shell. Our structural analysis supports the assertion that MrNV along with the related virus of marine shrimp Penaeus vannamei nodavirus (PvNV) may represent a new genus of the Nodaviridae.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMacrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV) is the causative agent of white tail disease (WTD) which leads to 100% mortality in shrimp-farms growing giant freshwater prawn (M. rosenbergii). MrNV is therefore a significant threat to food security and causes severe economic losses in developing countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand and India. Here we have used electron microscopy to study the three-dimensional structure of MrNV, revealing that the viral capsid - the protein shell that encloses the viral genome, protecting it and transporting it from one host to the next - is differently organised to capsids produced by other viruses in the nodavirus family. The virus was found to have large blade-like spikes on its outer surface that are likely important in the early stages of infection, when the virus attaches to and enters a host cell.",

    "abstract": "The filaggrin gene (FLG) is essential for skin differentiation and epidermal barrier formation with links to skin diseases, however it has a highly repetitive nucleotide sequence containing very limited stretches of unique nucleotides for precise mapping to reference genomes. Sequencing strategies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and conventional Sanger sequencing have been successful for complete FLG coding DNA sequence amplification to identify pathogenic mutations but this time-consuming, labour intensive method has restricted utility. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers obvious benefits to accelerate FLG analysis but standard re-sequencing techniques such as oligoprobe-based exome or customized targeted-capture can be expensive, especially for a single target gene of interest. We therefore designed a protocol to improve FLG sequencing throughput using a set of FLG-specific PCR primer assays compatible with microfluidic amplification, multiplexing and current NGS protocols. Using DNA reference samples with known FLG genotypes for benchmarking, this protocol is shown to be concordant for variant detection across different sequencing methodologies. We applied this methodology to analyze cohorts from ethnicities previously not studied for FLG variants and demonstrate usefulness for discovery projects. This comprehensive coverage sequencing protocol is labour-efficient and offers an affordable solution to scale up FLG sequencing for larger cohorts. Robust and rapid FLG sequencing can improve patient stratification for research projects and provide a framework for gene specific diagnosis in the future.",

    "abstract": "In evolutionary biology, bet-hedging refers to a strategy that reduces the variance of reproductive success at the cost of reduced mean reproductive success. In unpredictably fluctuating environments, bet-hedgers benefit from higher geometric mean fitness despite having lower arithmetic mean fitness than their specialist competitors. We examine the extent to which sexual reproduction can be considered a type of bet-hedging, by clarifying past arguments, examining parallels and differences to evolutionary games, and by presenting a simple model examining geometric and arithmetic mean payoffs of sexual and asexual reproduction. Sex typically has lower arithmetic mean fitness than asex, while the geometric mean fitness can be higher if sexually produced offspring are not identical. However, asexual individuals that are heterozygotes can gain conservative bet-hedging benefits of similar magnitude while avoiding the costs of sex. This highlights that bet-hedging always has to be specified relative to the payoff structure of relevant competitors. It also makes it unlikely that sex, at least when associated with significant male production, evolves solely based on bet-hedging in the context of frequently and repeatedly occupied environmental states. Future work could usefully consider bet-hedging in open-ended evolutionary scenarios with de novo mutations.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to human-induced environmental change has the potential to profoundly influence the genomic architecture of affected species. This is particularly true in agricultural ecosystems, where anthropogenic selection pressure is strong. Heliothis virescens feeds on cotton in its larval stages and US populations have been declining since the widespread planting of transgenic cotton, which endogenously express proteins derived Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). No physiological adaptation to Bt toxin has been found in the field, so adaptation to this altered environment could involve: 1) shifts in host plant selection mechanisms to avoid cotton, 2) changes in detoxification mechanisms required for cotton-feeding versus feeding on other host plants, or 3) loss of resistance to previously used management practices including insecticides. Here we begin to address the question of whether such changes occurred in H. virescens populations between the years 1997 and 2012. As part of our study, we produced an H. virescens genome assembly and used this in concert with a ddRAD-seq enabled genome scan to identify loci with significant allele frequency changes over the 15 year period after Bt crops became widespread in the agricultural landscape. Confirmation that a known genetic change at a previously described H. virescens target of selection was detectable in our genome scan increased our confidence in this methodology. We quantified the strength of selection required to elicit the observed allele frequency changes at loci under selection. Potential contributions of genes near the loci under selection to adaptive phenotypes in the H. virescens cotton system are discussed.",

In addition to the annotated translation initiation sites (TISs), the translation process may also start at multiple alternative TISs (including both AUG and non-AUG codons), which makes it challenging to predict TISs and study the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Meanwhile, the advent of several high-throughput sequencing techniques for profiling initiating ribosomes at single-nucleotide resolution, e.g., GTI-seq and QTI-seq, provides abundant data for systematically studying the general principles of translation initiation and the development of computational method for TIS identification.\\n\\nMethodsWe have developed a deep learning based framework, named TITER, for accurately predicting TISs on a genome-wide scale based on QTI-seq data. TITER extracts the sequence features of translation initiation from the surrounding sequence contexts of TISs using a hybrid neural network and further integrates the prior preference of TIS codon composition into a unified prediction framework.\\n\\nResultsExtensive tests demonstrated that TITER can greatly outperform the state-of-the-art prediction methods in identifying TISs. In addition, TITER was able to identify important sequence signatures for individual types of TIS codons, including a Kozak-sequence-like motif for AUG start codon. Furthermore, the TITER prediction score can be related to the strength of translation initiation in various biological scenarios, including the repressive effect of the upstream open reading frames (uORFs) on gene expression and the mutational effects influencing translation initiation efficiency.\\n\\nAvailabilityTITER is available as an open-source software and can be downloaded from https://github.com/zhangsaithu/titer\\n\\nContactlzhang20@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn and zengjy321@tsinghua.edu.cn",

Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) represents an individual-based analytic framework for overcoming this fundamental obstacle that has limited the utility of ecological theory. SCR methods make explicit use of spatial encounter information on individuals in order to model density and other spatial aspects of animal population structure, and have been widely adopted in the last decade. We review the historical context and emerging developments in SCR models that enable the integration of explicit ecological hypotheses about landscape connectivity, movement, resource selection, and spatial variation in density, directly with individual encounter history data obtained by new technologies (e.g., camera trapping, non-invasive DNA sampling).

    "abstract": "With the availability of genotyping data of very large samples, there is an increasing need for tools that can efficiently identify genetic relationships among all individuals in the sample. One fundamental measure of genetic relationship of a pair of individuals is identity by descent (IBD), chromosomal segments that are shared among two individuals due to common ancestry. However, the efficient identification of IBD segments among a large number of genotyped individuals is a challenging computational problem. Most existing methods are not feasible for even thousands of individuals because they are based on pairwise comparisons of all individuals and thus scale up quadratically with sample size. Some methods, such as GERMLINE, use fast dictionary lookup of short seed sequence matches to achieve a near-linear time efficiency. However, the number of short seed matches often scales up super-linearly in real population data.\\n\\nIn this paper we describe a new approach for IBD detection. We take advantage of an efficient population genotype index, Positional BWT (PBWT), by Richard Durbin. PBWT achieves linear time query of perfectly identical subsequences among all samples. However, the original PBWT is not tolerant to genotyping errors which often interrupt long IBD segments into short fragments. We introduce a randomized strategy by running PBWTs over random projections of the original sequences. To boost the detection power we run PBWT multiple times and merge the identified IBD segments through interval tree algorithms. Given a target IBD segment length, RaPID adjust parameters to optimize detection power and accuracy.\\n\\nSimulation results proved that our tool (RaPID) achieves almost linear scaling up to sample size and is orders of magnitude faster than GERMLINE. At the same time, RaPID maintains a detection power and accuracy comparable to existing mainstream algorithms, GERMLINE and IBDseq. Running multiple times with various target detection lengths over the 1000 Genomes Project data, RaPID can detect population events at different time scales.

    "abstract": "It is nearly half a century past the age of the introduction of the Central Dogma (CD) of molecular biology. This biological axiom has been developed and currently appears to be all the more complex. In this study, we modified CD by adding further species to the CD information flow and mathematically expressed CD within a dynamic framework by using Boolean network based on its present-day and 1965 editions. We show that the enhancement of the Dogma not only now entails a higher level of complexity, but it also shows a higher level of robustness, thus far more consistent with the nature of biological systems. Using this mathematical modeling approach, we put forward a logic-based expression of our conceptual view of molecular biology. Finally, we show that such biological concepts can be converted into dynamic mathematical models using a logic-based approach and thus may be useful as a framework for improving static conceptual models in biology.",

    "abstract": "Category learning in animals is typically trained explicitly, in most instances by varying the exemplars of a single category in a matching-to-sample task. Here, we show that rhesus macaques can learn categories by a transitive inference paradigm in which novel exemplars of five categories were presented throughout each training session. Instead of requiring decisions about a constant set of repetitively presented stimuli, we studied the macaques ability to determine the relative order of multiple exemplars of particular stimuli that were rarely repeated. Ordinal decisions generalized both to novel stimuli and, as a consequence, to novel pairings. Thus, we showed that rhesus monkeys could learn to categorize on the basis of implied ordinal position, and that they could then make inferences about category order. Our results challenge the plausibility of association models of category learning and broaden the scope of the transitive inference paradigm.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe cognitive abilities of non-human animals are of enduring interest to scientists and the general public because they blur the dividing line between human and non-human intelligence. Categorization and sequence learning are highly abstract cognitive abilities each in their own right. This study is the first to provide evidence that visual categories can be ordered serially by macaque monkeys using a behavioral paradigm that provides no explicit feedback about category or serial order. These results strongly challenge accounts of learning based on stimulus-outcome associations.",

    "abstract": "Deep water environments are characterized by low levels of available light at increasingly narrow spectra, great hydrostatic pressure and reduced dissolved oxygen - conditions predicted to exert highly specific selection pressures. In Lake Malawi over 800 cichlid species have evolved, and this adaptive radiation extends into the \\\"twilight zone\\\" below 100 metres. We use population-level RAD-seq data to investigate whether four endemic deep water species (Diplotaxodon spp.) have experienced divergent selection within this environment. We identify candidate genes including regulators of photoreceptor function, photopigments, lens morphology and haemoglobin, many not previously implicated in cichlid adaptive radiations. Co-localization of functionally linked genes suggests co-adapted \\\"supergene\\\" complexes. Comparisons of Diplotaxodon to the broader Lake Malawi radiation using genome resequencing data revealed functional substitutions in candidate genes. Our data provide unique insights into genomic adaptation to life at depth, and suggest genome-level specialisation for deep water habitat as an important process in cichlid radiation.",

    "abstract": "Noncoding regulatory variants play an important role in the genetics of complex traits. Although quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping is a powerful approach to identify these variants, many genetic effects may remain unobserved when cells are sampled in only one of a large number of possible environments. Using a novel induced pluripotent stem cell-derived system, we mapped QTLs regulating chromatin accessibility and gene expression in macrophages in four conditions mimicking the interplay between interferon-gamma response and Salmonella infection. We found that approximately 50% of condition-specific effects on gene expression altered chromatin accessibility prior to stimulation. Furthermore, 6% of the chromatin accessibility QTLs regulated multiple neighbouring regions and these interactions were modulated by stimulation, occasionally producing condition-specific changes in gene expression. Profiling additional states also doubled the number of expression QTLs that could be confidently colocalised with disease associations. Thus, a substantial fraction of disease-associated variants may affect  primed regulatory elements in naive cells.",
