    "abstract": "Patterns of local adaptation at fine spatial scales are central to understanding how evolution proceeds, and are essential to the effective management of economically and ecologically important forest tree species. Here, we employ single and multilocus analyses of genetic data (n = 116,231 SNPs) to describe signatures of fine-scale adaptation within eight whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) populations across the local extent of the environmentally heterogeneous Lake Tahoe Basin, USA. We show that despite highly shared genetic variation (FST = 0.0069) there is strong evidence for adaptation to the rain shadow experienced across the eastern Sierra Nevada. Specifically, we build upon evidence from a common garden study and find that allele frequencies of loci associated with four phenotypes (mean = 236 SNPs), 18 environmental variables (mean = 99 SNPs), and those detected through genetic differentiation (n = 110 SNPs) exhibit significantly higher signals of selection (covariance of allele frequencies) than could be expected to arise, given the data. We also provide evidence that this covariance tracks environmental measures related to soil water availability through subtle allele frequency shifts across populations. Our results replicate empirical support for theoretical expectations of local adaptation for populations exhibiting strong gene flow and high selective pressures, and suggest that ongoing adaptation of many P. albicaulis populations within the Lake Tahoe Basin will not be constrained by the lack of genetic variation. Even so, some populations exhibit low levels of heritability for the traits presumed to be related to fitness. These instances could be used to prioritize management to maintain adaptive potential. Overall, we suggest that established practices regarding whitebark pine conservation be maintained, with the additional context of fine-scale adaptation.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the effectiveness of 2-phenylethanol (PET) in combination with acetic acid (AA) as a binary lure for monitoring male and female obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris). Studies were conducted in apple, Malus domestica Borkhausen, orchards treated with or without sex pheromone dispensers for mating disruption (MD). Open polypropylene vials, closed membrane cups, and rubber septa loaded with AA and/or PET in varying amounts were first evaluated in a series of trapping experiments. Membrane cups loaded with 800 mg of PET were as effective as 10-mg septa, but longer lasting, and were comparable to the open vials. A membrane cup AA lure was effective in tests, but further work is needed to increase its release rate and extend its activity. Catches of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), and C. rosaceana were unaffected by combining PET with (E,E)-8,10-dodecadien-1-ol, the sex pheromone of codling moth, pear ester, (E,Z)-2,4-ethyl-decadienoate, and AA lures. Adding (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene to this blend to enhance codling moth catch, significantly reduced catches of C. rosaceana. PET+AA was a more attractive binary lure than AA plus phenylacetonitrile (PAN) for C. rosaceana. The addition of PET or PAN to traps already baited with the sex pheromone of C. rosaceana significantly reduced male catches. Traps baited with PET+AA placed in blocks not treated with MD caught significantly fewer C. rosaceana than traps baited with sex pheromone. In comparison, sex pheromone-baited traps in MD blocks caught [&le;] 1 male moth per season which was significantly lower than total moth (> 10) or female moth ([&ge;] 3) catch in these blocks with PET+AA. A high proportion (> 70%) of trapped females were mated in both untreated and MD-treated orchards. Further refinement of this binary, bisexual lure using membrane cup technology may allow the establishment of action thresholds and improve management timings for C. rosaceana.",

The function of temporally regulated centromeric transcription, and transcripts, is consequently a topic of intense investigation. In this study, we use high throughput approaches to identify and describe lncRNAs associated with the centromere specific histone variant CENP-A that arise from the transcription of specific centromeres at early G1, which we then show are physically associated with centromeres, and which are functionally necessary for accurate chromosome segregation. Targeted depletion of one such centromeric RNA, which originates from a single centromere, is sufficient to increase the frequency of chromosome segregation defects. These data support the emerging paradigm of the necessity of centromere-specific lncRNAs in the integrity of faithful chromosome segregation.",

More subtle mutations are also required for perception of cues witnessing the presence of the target host and optimal conditions for colonization. The decision to activate the pathogenic lifestyle is not  taken lightly and involves efficient systems monitoring environmental conditions. But how can a pathogen timely trigger the expression of virulence genes if the main signal inducing its pathogenic behavior originates from cellulose, the most abundant polysaccharide on earth? This situation is encountered by Streptomyces scabies responsible for common scab disease on tuber and root crops. We here propose a series of hypotheses of how S. scabies could optimally distinguish whether cello-oligosaccharides originate from decomposing lignocellulose (nutrient sources) or, instead, emanate from living and expanding plant tissue (virulence signals), and accordingly adapt its physiological response.",

Determining the composition of pooled samples can be difficult, especially at the scale of modern sequencing data and reference databases. Here we propose the novel pooled DNA classification method Karp. Karp combines the speed and low-memory requirements of k-mer based pseudoalignment with a likelihood framework that uses base quality information to better resolve multiply mapped reads. In this text we apply Karp to the problem of classifying 16S rRNA reads, commonly used in microbiome research. Using simulations, we show Karp is accurate across a variety of read lengths and when samples contain reads originating from organisms absent from the reference. We also assess performance in real 16S data, and show that relative to other widely used classification methods Karp can reveal stronger statistical association signals and should empower future discoveries.",

    "abstract": "In many contexts, the problem arises of determining which of many candidate mutations is the most likely to be causative for some phenotype. It is desirable to have a way to evaluate this probability that relies as little as possible on previous knowledge, to avoid bias against discovering new genes or functions. We are isolating mutants with blocked cell cycle progression in Chlamydomonas, and determining mutant genome sequences. Due to the intensity of UV mutagenesis required for efficient mutant collection, the mutants contain multiple mutations altering coding sequence. To provide a quantitative estimate of probability that each individual mutation in a given mutant is the causative one, we develop a Bayesian approach. The approach employs four independent indicators: sequence conservation of the mutated coding sequence with Arabidopsis; severity of the mutation relative to Chlamydomonas wild type based on Blosum62 scores; meiotic mapping information for location of the causative mutation relative to known molecular markers; and, for a subset of mutants, transcriptional profile of the candidate wild type genes through the mitotic cell cycle.\\n\\nThese indicators are statistically independent, and so can be combined quantitatively into a single probability calculation. We validate this calculation: recently isolated mutations that were not in the training set for developing the indicators, with high calculated probability of causality, are confirmed in every case by additional genetic data to indeed be causative. Analysis of best reciprocal blast relationships among Chlamydomonas and other eukaryotes indicate that the Ts-lethal mutants that our procedure recovers are highly enriched for fundamental cell-essential functions conserved broadly across plants and other eukaryotes, accounting for the high information content of sequence alignment to Arabidopsis.",

To explain the observed richness of species in a given habitat, food web theory has explored nonlinear functional responses, self-interaction or spatial structure and dispersal -- model ingredients that have proven to promote stability and diversity. We here instead return to classical Lotka-Volterra equations, where species-species interaction is characterized by a simple product and spatial restrictions are ignored. We quantify how this idealization imposes constraints on coexistence and diversity for many species. To this end, we introduce the concept of free and controlled species and use this to demonstrate how stable food webs can be constructed by sequential addition of species. When we augment the resulting network by additional weak interactions we are able to show that it is possible to construct large food webs of arbitrary connectivity. Our model thus serves as a formal starting point for the study of sustainable interaction patterns between species.",

    "abstract": "Most studies that have investigated the brain mechanisms underlying learning have focused on the ability to learn simple stimulus-response associations. However, in everyday life, outcomes are often obtained through complex behavioral patterns involving a series of actions. In such scenarios, parallel learning systems are important to reduce the complexity of the learning problem, as proposed in the framework of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). One of the key features of HRL is the computation of pseudo-reward prediction errors (PRPEs) which allow the reinforcement of actions that led to a sub-goal before the final goal itself is achieved. Here we wanted to test the hypothesis that, despite not carrying any rewarding value per se, pseudo-rewards might generate a bias in choice behavior when reward contingencies are not well-known or uncertain. Second, we also hypothesized that this bias might be related to the strength of PRPE striatal representations. In order to test these ideas, we developed a novel decision-making paradigm to assess reward prediction errors (RPEs) and PRPEs in two studies (fMRI study: n = 20; behavioural study: n = 19). Our results show that overall participants developed a preference for the most pseudo-rewarding option throughout the task, even though it did not lead to more monetary rewards. fMRI analyses revealed that this preference was predicted by individual differences in the relative striatal sensitivity to PRPEs vs RPEs. Together, our results indicate that pseudo-rewards generate learning signals in the striatum and subsequently bias choice behavior despite their lack of association with actual reward.",

    "abstract": "Informational cues such as the price of a wine can trigger expectations about its taste quality and thereby modulate the sensory experience on a reported and neural level. Yet it is unclear how the brain translates such expectations into sensory pleasantness. We used multilevel mediation analysis of neural and behavioral data obtained in participants who tasted identical wines cued with different prices. We found that the brain's valuation system (BVS) in concert with the anterior prefrontal cortex explained the effect of price cues on taste pleasantness ratings. The sensitivity of the BVS to rewards outside the taste domain moderated the strength of these effects. Moreover, brain mediators of price cue effects overlapped with brain regions previously found to be involved in placebo analgesia. These findings provide novel evidence for the fundamental role that neural pathways linked to motivation and affective regulation play for the effect of informational cues on sensory experiences.",

    "abstract": "In a polio-free world there might be reduced funding for poliovirus surveillance. There is therefore the need to ensure that enterovirologist globally, especially those outside the global polio laboratory network (GPLN), can participate in poliovirus surveillance without neglecting their enterovirus type of interest. To accomplish this, assays are needed that allow such active participation.\\n\\nIn this light, we used 15 previously identified enterovirus isolates as reference samples for assay development. The first eight were enterovirus species B (EV-B). The remaining seven were EV-Cs; three of which were poliovirus (PV) 1, 2 and 3, respectively. A 16th sample was compounded; a mixture of two EV-Bs, three PVs and one nonPV EV-Cs (all part of the 15). In all, four samples contained PVs with the 16th consisting of mixture of the three PV types. All were subjected to the WHO recommended RT-snPCR assay, and five other modified (with substitution of the second round PCR forward primer) assays. The new primers included the previously described Species Resolution Primers (SRPs; 187and 189) and the Poliovirus Resolution Primers (PRPs: Sab 1, 2 and 3). All amplicons were sequenced and isolate identity confirmed using the Enterovirus Genotyping Tool.\\n\\nThe PRPs detected PV types in only the four samples that contained PVs. In addition, it was able to show that the sample 16 (mixture) contained all the three PV types. On the other hand, though the SRPs and the WHO assay also detected the three singleton PVs, in sample 16, they both detected only one of the three PV types present.\\n\\nThis study describes a sensitive and specific utility extension of the recently recommended WHO RT-snPCR assay that enables independent detection of the three poliovirus types especially in cases of co-infection. More importantly, it piggy-backs on the first round PCR product of the WHO recommended assay and consequently ensures that enterovirologists interested in nonpolio enteroviruses can continue their investigations, and contribute significantly and specifically to poliovirus surveillance, by using the excess of their first round PCR product.",

We developed an online platform for collecting large amounts of drawing and recognition data, and applied a deep convolutional neural network model of visual cortex trained only on natural images to explore the hypothesis that drawing recruits the same abstract feature representations that support natural visual object recognition. Consistent with this hypothesis, higher layers of this model captured the abstract features of both drawings and natural images most important for recognition, and people learning to produce more recognizable drawings of objects exhibited enhanced recognition of those objects. These findings could explain why drawing is so effective for communicating visual concepts, they suggest novel approaches for evaluating and refining conceptual knowledge, and they highlight the potential of deep networks for understanding human learning.",

In mammals, masking requires melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells that detect blue light and project to the thalamus. It is not known whether masking is wavelength-dependent in other vertebrates, nor is it clear what higher circuits are involved. Here, we address these questions in zebrafish. We find that diel vertical migration, a circadian behavior in larval zebrafish, is effectively masked by blue, but not by red light. Two-photon calcium imaging reveals that a retino-recipient thalamic nucleus and a downstream structure, the habenula, are tuned to blue light. Lesioning the habenula inhibits light-evoked climbing. These data suggest that a thalamo-habenula pathway may be involved in the ability of blue light to mask circadian behavior.",

This variability can be separated into specific kinematic components such as extent and direction, which are thought to be governed by distinct neural processes. Here, we report that individual subjects exhibit different magnitudes of kinematic variability, which are consistent (within individual) across movements to different targets and regardless of which arm (right or left) was used to perform the movements. Simultaneous fMRI recordings revealed that the same subjects also exhibited different magnitudes of fMRI variability across movements in a variety of motor system areas. These fMRI variability magnitudes were also consistent across movements to different targets when performed with either arm. Cortical fMRI variability in the posterior-parietal cortex of individual subjects predicted their movement-extent variability. This relationship was apparent only in posterior-parietal cortex and not in other motor system areas, thereby suggesting that individuals with more variable movement preparation exhibit larger kinematic variability. We, therefore, propose that neural and kinematic variability are reliable and interrelated individual characteristics that may predispose individual subjects to exhibit distinct motor capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Learning from reward feedback is essential for survival but can become extremely challenging with myriad choice options. Here, we propose that learning reward values of individual features can provide a heuristic for estimating reward values of choice options in dynamic, multidimensional environments. We hypothesized that this feature-based learning occurs not just because it can reduce dimensionality, but more importantly because it can increase adaptability without compromising precision of learning. We experimentally tested this hypothesis and found that in dynamic environments, human subjects adopted feature-based learning even when this approach does not reduce dimensionality. Even in static, low-dimensional environments, subjects initially adopted feature-based learning and gradually switched to learning reward values of individual options, depending on how accurately objects values can be predicted by combining feature values. Our computational models reproduced these results and highlight the importance of neurons coding feature values for parallel learning of values for features and objects.",

    "abstract": "Comparative studies of genomic differentiation among independent lineages can provide insights into aspects of the speciation process, such as the relative importance of selection and drift in shaping genomic landscapes, the role of genomic regions of high differentiation, and the prevalence of convergent molecular evolution. We investigated patterns of genetic diversity and divergence in stonechats (genus Saxicola), a widely distributed avian species complex with phenotypic variation in plumage, morphology, and migratory behavior, to ask whether similar genomic regions are important in the evolution of independent, but closely related, taxa. We used whole-genome pooled sequencing of 262 individuals from 5 taxa and found that patterns of genetic diversity and divergence are highly similar among different stonechat taxa. We then asked if these patterns remain correlated at deeper evolutionary scales and found that homologous genomic regions have become differentiated in stonechats and the closely related Ficedula flycatchers. Such correlation across a range of evolutionary divergence and among phylogenetically independent comparisons suggests that similar processes may be driving the differentiation of these independently evolving lineages, which in turn may be the result of intrinsic properties of particular genomic regions (e.g., areas of low recombination). Consequently, studies employing genome scans to search for areas important in reproductive isolation should account for corresponding regions of differentiation, as these regions may not necessarily represent speciation islands or facilitate local adaptation.",

    "abstract": "The consumption of cognitive enhancers like energy drinks (EnD) is on the rise, but do they really improve cognitive performance, and, if yes, why? We examined two novel psychological mechanisms. First, we dissociated the role of expectations and actual consumption by crossing what people consumed--Red Bull Silver Edition or a similar-tasting Sprite soda--and what they thought they consumed. We found that participants performed better in a numerical Stroop task when they believed that they had consumed an EnD, irrespective of what they had actually consume, Second, we investigated the role of motivation for such a placebo effect of EnD. We found that expected, but not actual, consumption of EnD increased the effects of incentives on cognitive performance. Our results suggest that believing that one consumes an EnD increased participants motivation to perform and thus enhanced their performance.\\n\\nSignificance statementAcademic doping has become increasingly popular on campuses around the globe over the last years. However, it remains unknown if and how commercially available cognitive enhancers such as energy drinks (EnD) impact cognitive performance. We varied actual and believed consumption of an EnD and measured cognitive performance and its allocation according to the magnitude of points to earn. We found that the belief that one has consumed an EnD but not its actual consumption, increased cognitive performance specifically in high point trials compared to low point trials. These findings provide novel insights into motivational processes underpinning marketing-led expectancy effects, and contribute to the current public policy debate on the use and abuse of increased alertness and concentration claims for EnD.",

    "abstract": "Cortical entrainment of the auditory cortex to the broad-band temporal envelope of a speech signal is crucial for speech comprehension. This entrainment results in phases of high and low neural excitability which structure and decode the incoming speech signal. Entrainment to speech is strongest in the theta frequency range (4-8 Hz), the average frequency of the speech envelope. If a speech signal is degraded, for example masked by irrelevant information such as noise, entrainment to the speech envelope is weaker and speech intelligibility declines.\\n\\nBesides perceptually evoked cortical entrainment, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can entrain neural oscillations by applying an electric signal to the brain. Accordingly, tACS-induced entrainment in auditory cortex has been shown to improve auditory perception. The aim of the current study was to externally modulate speech intelligibility by means of tACS such that the electric current corresponds to the envelope of the presented speech stream.\\n\\nParticipants performed the Oldenburg sentence test with sentences presented in noise in combination with tACS. Critically, the time lag between sentence presentation and tACS was manipulated from 0 to 250 ms in 50-ms steps (auditory stimuli were simultaneous to or preceded tACS).\\n\\nFirst, we were able to show that envelope-tACS modulated sentence comprehension such that on average sentence comprehension at the time lag of the best performance was significantly better than sentence comprehension of the worst performance. Second, sentence comprehension across time lags was modulated sinusoidally.\\n\\nIn sum, envelope tACS modulates intelligibility of speech in noise presumably by enhancing (time lag with in-phase stimulation) and disrupting (time lag with out-of-phase stimulation) cortical entrainment to the speech envelope in auditory cortex.",

    "abstract": "To derive meaning from speech, we must extract multiple dimensions of concurrent information from incoming speech signals, including phonetic and prosodic cues. Equally important is the detection of acoustic cues that give structure and context to the information we hear, such as sentence boundaries. How the brain organizes this information processing is unknown. Here, using data-driven computational methods on an extensive set of high-density intracranial recordings, we reveal a large-scale partitioning of the entire human speech cortex into two spatially distinct regions that detect important cues for parsing natural speech. These caudal (Zone 1) and rostral (Zone 2) regions work in parallel to detect onsets and prosodic information, respectively, within naturally spoken sentences. In contrast, local processing within each region supports phonetic feature encoding. These findings demonstrate a fundamental organizational property of the human auditory cortex that has been previously unrecognized.",

    "abstract": "To stand straight and upright along their growth, plants needs to regulate actively their posture. Gravitropic movement, which occurs when plants modify their growth and curvature to orient their aerial organ against the force of gravity, is a major feature of this postural control. A recent model has shown that graviception and proprioception are sufficient to account for the gravitropic movement and subsequent organ posture demonstrated by a range of species. However, some plants, including wheat coleoptiles, exhibit a stronger regulation of posture than predicted by the model. Here, we performed an extensive kinematics study on wheat coleoptiles during a gravitropic perturbation experiment in order to better understand this unexpectedly strong regulation. Close temporal observation of the data revealed that both perturbed and unperturbed coleoptiles showed oscillatory pulses of elongation and curvature variation that propagated from the apex to the base of their aerial organs. In perturbed (tilted) coleoptiles, we discovered a non-trivial coupling between the oscillatory dynamics of curvature and elongation. This relationship appears to be critical to the postural control of the organ, and indicates the presence of a mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between elongation rate, differential growth, and curvature.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor RpaA is the master regulator of circadian transcription in cyanobacteria, driving genome-wide oscillations in mRNA abundance. Deletion of rpaA has no effect on viability in constant light conditions, but renders cells inviable in cycling conditions when light and dark periods alternate. We investigated the mechanisms underlying this viability defect, and demonstrate that the rpaA- strain cannot maintain appropriate energy status at night, does not accumulate carbon reserves during the day, and is defective in transcription of genes crucial for utilization of carbohydrate stores at night. Reconstruction of carbon utilization pathways combined with provision of an external carbon source restores energy charge and viability of the rpaA- strain in light/dark cycling conditions. Our observations highlight how a circadian program controls and temporally coordinates essential pathways in carbon metabolism to maximize fitness of cells facing periodic energy limitations.",
