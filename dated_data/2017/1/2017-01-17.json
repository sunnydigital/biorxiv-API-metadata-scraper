    "abstract": "Copper is essential for life but toxic, therefore all organisms control tightly its intracellular abundance. Bacteria have indeed whole operons devoted to copper resistance, with genes that code for efflux pumps, oxidases, etc. Recently, the CopM protein of the CopMRS operon was described as a novel important element for copper tolerance in Synechocystis. This protein consists of a domain of unknown function, and was proposed to act as a periplasmic/extracellular copper binder. This work describes a bioinformatic study of CopM including structural models based on homology modeling and on residue coevolution, to help expand on its recent biochemical characterization. The protein is predicted to be periplasmic but membrane-anchored, not secreted. Two disordered regions are predicted, both possibly involved in protein-protein interactions. The 3D models disclose a 4-helix bundle with several potential copper-binding sites, most of them largely buried inside the bundle lumen. Some of the predicted copper-binding sites involve residues from the disordered regions, suggesting they could gain structure upon copper binding and thus possibly modulate the interactions they mediate.

    "abstract": "T cells mount an immune response by measuring the binding strength of its T cell receptor (TCR) for peptide-loaded MHCs (pMHC) on an antigen-presenting cell. How T cells convert the lifetime of the extracellular TCR-pMHC interaction into an intracellular signal remains unknown. Here, we developed a synthetic signaling system in which the extracellular domains of the TCR and pMHC were replaced with short hybridizing strands of DNA. Remarkably, T cells can discriminate between DNA ligands differing by a single base pair. Single molecule imaging reveals that signaling is initiated when single ligand-bound receptors are converted into clusters, a time-dependent process requiring ligands with longer bound times. A computation model reveals that receptor clustering serves a kinetic proofreading function, enabling ligands with longer bound times to have disproportionally greater signaling outputs. These results suggest that spatial reorganization of receptors plays an important role in ligand discrimination in T cell signaling.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression changes with age have consequences for healthy aging and disease development. Here we investigate age-related changes in gene expression measured by RNA-seq in four tissues and the interplay between genotypes and age-related changes in expression. Using concurrently measured methylation array data from fat we also investigate the relationship between methylation, gene expression and age. We identified age-dependent changes in mean levels of gene expression in 5,631 genes and in splicing of 904 genes. Age related changes were widely shared across tissues, with up to 60% of age-related changes in expression and 47% on splicing in multi-exonic genes shared; amongst these we highlight effects on genes involved in diseases such as Alzheimer and cancer. We identified 137 genes with age-related changes in variance and 42 genes with age-dependent discordance between genetically identical individuals; implying the latter are driven by environmental effects. We also give four examples where genetic control of expression is affected by the aging process. Analysis of methylation observed a widespread and stronger effect of age on methylation than expression; however we did not find a strong relationship between age-related changes in both expression and methylation. In summary, we quantified aging affects in splicing, level and variance of gene expression, and show that these processes can be both environmentally and genetically influenced.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies suggest that factual learning, that is learning from obtained outcomes, is biased, such that participants preferentially take into account positive, as compared to negative, prediction errors. However, whether or not the prediction error valence also affects counterfactual learning, that is, learning from forgone outcomes, is unknown. To address this question, we analysed the performance of two cohorts of participants on reinforcement learning tasks using a computational model that was adapted to test if prediction error valance influences learning. Concerning factual learning, we replicated previous findings of a valence-induced bias, whereby participants learned preferentially from positive, relative to negative, prediction errors. In contrast, for counterfactual learning, we found the opposite valence-induced bias: negative prediction errors were preferentially taken into account relative to positive ones. When considering valence-induced bias in the context of both factual and counterfactual learning, it appears that people tend to preferentially take into account information that confirms their current choice. By documenting these valence-induced learning biases, our findings demonstrate the presence of a confirmation bias in human reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "The readiness potential (RP)--a key ERP correlate of upcoming action--is known to precede subjects reports of their decision to move. Some view this as evidence against a causal role for consciousness in human decision-making and thus against free-will. Yet those studies focused on arbitrary decisions--purposeless, unreasoned, and without consequences. It remains unknown to what degree the RP generalizes to deliberate, more ecological decisions. We directly compared deliberate and arbitrary decision-making during a $1000-donation task to non-profit organizations. While we found the expected RPs for arbitrary decisions, they were strikingly absent for deliberate ones. Our results and drift-diffusion model are congruent with the RP representing accumulation of noisy, random fluctuations that drive arbitrary--but not deliberate--decisions. They further point to different neural mechanisms underlying deliberate and arbitrary decisions, challenging the generalizability of studies that argue for no causal role for consciousness in decision-making to real-life decisions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe extent of human free will has been debated for millennia. Previous studies demonstrated that neural precursors of action--especially the readiness potential--precede subjects reports of deciding to move. Some viewed this as evidence against free-will. However, these experiments focused on arbitrary decisions--e.g., randomly raising the left or right hand. We directly compared deliberate (actual $1000 donations to NPOs) and arbitrary decisions, and found readiness potentials before arbitrary decisions, but--critically--not before deliberate decisions. This supports the interpretation of readiness potentials as byproducts of accumulation of random fluctuations in arbitrary but not deliberate decisions and points to different neural mechanisms underlying deliberate and arbitrary choice. Hence, it challenges the generalizability of previous results from arbitrary to deliberate decisions.",

    "abstract": "One in five people with Down syndrome (DS) are born with an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), an incidence 2,000 times higher than in the euploid population. The genetic loci that contribute to this risk are poorly understood. In this study, we tested two hypotheses: 1) individuals with DS carrying chromosome 21 copy number variants (CNVs) that interrupt exons may be protected from AVSD, because these CNVs return AVSD susceptibility loci back to disomy, and 2) individuals with DS carrying chromosome 21 genes spanned by microduplications are at greater risk for AVSD because these microduplications boost the dosage of AVSD susceptibility loci beyond a tolerable threshold. We tested 198 case individuals with DS+AVSD and 211 control individuals with DS and a normal heart using a custom microarray with dense probes tiled on chromosome 21 for array CGH. We found that neither an individual chromosome 21 CNV nor any individual gene intersected by a CNV was associated with AVSD in DS. Burden analyses revealed that African American controls had more bases covered by rare deletions than did African American cases. Inversely, we found that Caucasian cases had more genes intersected by rare duplications than did Caucasian controls. Pathway analyses indicated copy number perturbations of genes involved in protein heterotrimerization and histone methylating proteins. Finally, we showed that previously DS+AVSD-associated common CNVs on chromosome 21 are likely false positives. This research adds to the swell of evidence indicating that DS-associated AVSD is similarly heterogeneous, as is AVSD in the euploid population.",

    "abstract": "All biological populations are to a greater or lesser degree evolvable, but the forces that shape evolvability, especially the evolution of evolvability as an adaptive response to a changing environment, have been a source of controversy. One source of enhanced evolvability is the benign status of \\\"cryptic sequences\\\" typically expressed at low levels due to molecular errors, but with the potential to be expressed more fully following mutational co-option. A genome enriched for benign cryptic sequences has a more benign mutational neighborhood, via the possibility of co-option, and thus enhanced evolvability. Whether selection for evolvability itself can be the cause of a more benign mutational neighborhood remains an open question. Here, we show that environmental change can cause the evolution of increased evolvability, despite our use of a strong-selection weak mutation regime that precludes, by design, the adaptive evolution of evolvability. Instead, enhanced evolvability arises as a byproduct of environmental change via a novel mechanism that we call \\\"emergent evolutionary capacitance\\\". When the environment changes, increased molecular error rates evolve as a strategy to rapidly change phenotypes, with the side effect of purging deleterious cryptic sequences and enhancing the mutational neighborhood for future adaptation. The behavior is strikingly similar to that seen in a model system for capacitance, the yeast prion [PSI+].",

    "abstract": "Pluripotent stem cells are able to self-renew indefinitely in culture and differentiate into all somatic cell types in vivo. While much is known about the molecular basis of pluripotency, the molecular mechanisms of lineage commitment are complex and only partially understood. Here, using a combination of single cell profiling and mathematical modeling, we examine the differentiation dynamics of individual mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as they progress from the ground state of pluripotency along the neuronal lineage. In accordance with previous reports we find that cells do not transit directly from the pluripotent state to the neuronal state, but rather first stochastically permeate an intermediate primed pluripotent state, similar to that found in the maturing epiblast in development. However, analysis of rate at which individual cells enter and exit this intermediate metastable state using a hidden Markov model reveals that the observed ESC and epiblast-like  macrostates conceal a chain of unobserved cellular  microstates, which individual cells transit through stochastically in sequence. These hidden microstates ensure that individual cells spend well-defined periods of time in each functional macrostate and encode a simple form of epigenetic  memory that allows individual cells to record their position on the differentiation trajectory. To examine the generality of this model we also consider the differentiation of mouse hematopoietic stem cells along the myeloid lineage and observe remarkably similar dynamics, suggesting a general underlying process. Based upon these results we suggest a statistical mechanics view of cellular identities that distinguishes between functionally-distinct macrostates and the many functionally-similar molecular microstates associated with each macrostate. Taken together these results indicate that differentiation is a discrete stochastic process amenable to analysis using the tools of statistical mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of core histones have studied for over 2 decades, and are correlated with changes in transcriptional status, chromatin fiber folding, and nucleosome dynamics. However, within the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A, few modifications have been reported, and their functions remain largely unexplored. In this multidisciplinary report, we utilize in silico computational and in vivo approaches to dissect lysine 124 of human CENP-A, which was previously reported to be acetylated in advance of replication. Computational modeling demonstrates that acetylation of K124 causes tightening of the histone core, and hinders accessibility to its C-terminus, which in turn diminishes CENP-C binding. Additionally, CENP-A K124ac/H4 K79ac containing nucleosomes are prone to DNA sliding. In vivo experiments using an acetyl or unacetylatable mimic (CENP-A K124Q and K124A respectively) reveal alterations in CENP-C levels, and a modest increase in mitotic errors. Furthermore, mutation of K124 results in alterations in centromeric replication timing, with the permanently acetylated form replicating centromeres early, and the unacetylable form replicating centromeres late. Purification of native CENP-A proteins followed by mass spectrometry analysis reveal that while CENP-A K124 is acetylated at G1/S, it switches to monomethylation during early and mid-S phase. Finally, we provide evidence that the HAT p300 is involved in this cycle. Taken together, our data suggest that cyclical modifications within the CENP-A nucleosome can influence the binding of key kinetochore proteins, the integrity of mitosis and centromeric replication. These data support the emerging paradigm that core modifications in histone variant nucleosomes transduce defined changes to key biological processes.",

With the increase of sequenced and assembled plant genomes, we now have the opportunity to use synteny to analyze the dynamics of gene family expansion and contraction across broad phylogenetic groups. Here we present an integrated approach to organize plant kingdom-wide gene synteny networks using k-clique percolation. As an example, we analyzed the gene synteny network of the MADS-box transcription factor family based on fifty-one completed plant genomes. We conclude from two massive gene clusters that one of the two Type II MADS-box gene clades evolved from an ancient tandem gene duplication likely predating the radiation of seed plants, which then expanded by polyploidy events and sub-functionalization. This gene clade now contains key regulators of major phenotypes of angiosperms including flower development. Moreover, we find lineage-specific gene clusters derived from transposition events. For example, lineage-specific clusters in the Brassicales containing genes that are well-known for their function in controlling flower morphology (AP3 and PI). Our phylogenomic synteny network approach can be applied to any group of species to gain new insights into the evolution and dynamics of any set of genes.",

PacBio sequencing generates much longer reads compared to second-generation sequencing technologies, with a trade-off of lower throughput, higher error rate and more cost per base. Here, this transcriptome was analyzed using the YeATS pipeline, with additionally introduced kmer based algorithms, reducing computational times to a few hours on a simple workstation. Out of ~300 transcripts that have no match in both RefSeq and GENCODE, ~250 are absent in the transcriptomes of the heart, liver and brain, also provided by PacBio. Also, ~200 transcripts are absent in a recent catalogue of un-annotated long non-coding RNAs from 6,503 samples (~43 Terabases of sequence data) [1], and among 2,556 novel transcripts reported in an experimental workflow RACE-Seq [2]. 65 transcripts have >100 amino acid open reading frames, and have the potential of being protein coding genes. ORF based annotation also identified few bacterial transcripts in the PacBio database mapped to the human genome, and one human transcript that has been annotated as bacterial in the NCBI database. The current work reiterates the under-utilization of transcriptomes for annotating genomes. It also provides new leads for investigating breast cancer by virtue of exclusively expressed transcripts not expressed in other tissues, which have the prospects of breast cancer biomarkers based on further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have revealed certain genetic control by the host over the microbiome composition, although in many species the host genetic link controlling microbial composition is yet unknown. This potential association is important in livestock to study all factors and interactions that rule the effect of the microbiome in complex traits. This report aims to study whether the host genotype exerts any genetic control on the microbiome composition of the rumen in cattle. Data on 16S and 18S rRNA gene-based analysis of the rumen microbiome in 18 dairy cows from two different breeds (Holstein and Brown Swiss) were used. The effect of the genetic background of the animal (through the breed and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms; SNP) on the relative abundance (RA) of archaea, bacteria and ciliates (with average relative abundance per breed >0.1%) was analysed using Bayesian statistics. In total, 13 genera were analysed for bacteria (5), archaea (1), and ciliates (7). All these bacteria and archaea genera showed association to the host genetic background both for breed and SNP markers, except RA for the genera Butyrivibrio and Ruminococcus that showed association with the SNP markers but not with the breed composition. Relative abundance of 57% (4/7) of ciliate analysed showed to be associated to the genetic background of the host. This host genetic link was observed in some genus of Trichostomatia family. For instance, the breed had a significant effect on Isotricha, Ophryoscolex and Polyplastron, and the SNP markers on Entodinium, Ophryoscolex and Polyplastron. In total, 77% (10/13) of microbes analysed showed to be associated to the host genetic background (either by breed or SNP genotypes). Further, the results showed a significant association between DGAT1, ACSF3, AGPAT3 and STC2 genes with the relative abundance Prevotella genus with a false discovery rate lower than 15%. The results in this study support the hypothesis and provide some evidence that there exist a host genetic component in cattle that can partially regulate the composition of the microbiome.",

The emergence of globally disseminated lineages of E. coli carrying ESBL genes has been well characterised. An increase in strains producing carbapenemase enzymes and mobile colistin resistance is now being reported, but to date there is little genomic characterisation of such strains. Routine screening of patients within an ICU of West China Hospital identified a number of E. coli carrying the blaNDM-5 carbapenemase gene, found to be two distinct clones, E. coli ST167 and ST617. Interrogation of publically available data shows isolation of ESBL and carbapenem resistant strains of both lineages from clinical cases across the world. Further analysis of a large collection of publically available genomes shows that ST167 and ST617 have emerged in distinct patterns from the ST10 clonal complex of E. coli, but share evolutionary events involving switches in LPS genetics, intergenic regions and anaerobic metabolism loci. These may be evolutionary events which underpin the emergence of carbapenem resistance plasmid carriage in E. coli.",

    "abstract": "Trisomy of chromosome 21, the genetic cause of Down syndrome, has the potential to alter expression of genes on chromosome 21, as well as other locations throughout the genome. These transcriptome changes are likely to underlie the Down syndrome clinical phenotypes. We have employed RNA-seq to undertake an in-depth analysis of transcriptome changes resulting from trisomy of chromosome 21, using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a single individual with Down syndrome. These cells were originally derived by Li et al, who genetically targeted chromosome 21 in trisomic iPSCs, allowing selection of disomic sibling iPSC clones. Analyses were conducted on trisomic/disomic cell pairs maintained as iPSCs or differentiated into cortical neuronal cultures. In addition to characterization of gene expression levels, we have also investigated patterns of RNA adenosine-to-inosine editing, alternative splicing, and repetitive element expression, aspects of the transcriptome that have not been significantly characterized in the context of Down syndrome. We identified significant changes in transcript accumulation associated with chromosome 21 trisomy, as well as changes in alternative splicing and repetitive element transcripts. Unexpectedly, the trisomic iPSCs we characterized expressed higher levels of neuronal transcripts than control disomic iPSCs, and readily differentiated into cortical neurons, in contrast to another reported study. Comparison of our transcriptome data with similar studies of trisomic iPSCs suggests that trisomy of chromosome 21 may not intrinsically limit neuronal differentiation, but instead may interfere with the maintenance of pluripotency.",

Here we present ARCS, an application that utilizes the barcoding information contained in linked reads to further organize draft genomes into highly contiguous assemblies. We show how the contiguity of an ABySS H. sapiens genome assembly can be increased over six-fold using moderate coverage (25-fold) Chromium data.

    "abstract": "Simultaneous EEG-fMRI has been vastly used to investigate functional networks of brain combining high spatial resolution (millimeter) of fMRI with high temporal resolution (millisecond) of EEG. However, to extract the most relevant information from the acquired data, it is necessary to develop analysis methods with less ad hoc assumptions. To this end, brain rhythms are often used which are the specific frequency-bands of EEG signal and assumed to represent diverse sub-second cognitive processes at different parts of the cortex. Furthermore, single-trial analysis of EEG is believed to show more realistic picture of ongoing and event-related activities of brain. Here, we present a nonparametric multiple change-point detection and estimation method for the single-trial analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiment recorded during auditory and visual oddball tasks. In a simple attention task like oddball, the frontal cortex of brain is responsible to distinguish and respond appropriately to target versus standard events. By using EEG signal at the frontal cortex, we show that the -band activity changes according to \\\"inhibition timing\\\" hypothesis and the {beta}-band activity is in line with \\\"maintaining the status quo\\\" hypothesis. Furthermore, using these activities to build regressors in the GLM analysis of fMRI, we localize active brain regions with high spatial and temporal resolutions and elaborate further on the coordination of attentional networks across brain.",

Observed F, G, and inhomogeneous K and L functions from the spatial distribution of naloxone-involved calls were compared to their null sampling distributions obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation.\\n\\nResultsCases of naloxone administration demonstrated spatial clustering in the range of 0 to 5000 meters, and particularly around 2500 meters, beyond what could be attributable to the spatial heterogeneity of all EMS calls.\\n\\nConclusionsEfforts to understand the fundamental nature of opioid overdose as a spatial point process could yield innovative public health interventions to control the epidemic.",
