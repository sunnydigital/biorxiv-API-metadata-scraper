    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomic data has the potential to radically redefine our view of cell type identity. Cells that were previously believed to be homogeneous are now clearly distinguishable in terms of their expression phenotype. Methods for automatically characterizing the functional identity of cells, and their associated properties, can be used to uncover processes involved in lineage differentiation as well as sub-typing cancer cells. They can also be used to suggest personalized therapies based on molecular signatures associated with pathology. We develop a new method, called ACTION, to infer the functional identity of cells from their transcriptional profile, classify them based on their dominant function, and reconstruct regulatory networks that are responsible for mediating their identity. Using ACTION, we identify novel Melanoma sub-types with differential survival rates and therapeutic responses, for which we provide biomarkers along with their underlying regulatory networks.",

First, measurements on a series of freely diffusing doubly-labeled dsDNA samples allow us to demonstrate that data acquired in multiple spots in parallel can be properly corrected and result in measured sample characteristics identical to those obtained with a standard single-spot setup. We then take advantage of the higher throughput provided by parallel acquisition to address an outstanding question about the kinetics of the initial steps of bacterial RNA transcription. Our real-time kinetic analysis of promoter escape by bacterial RNA polymerase confirms results obtained by a more indirect route, shedding additional light on the initial steps of transcription.\\n\\nFinally, we discuss the advantages of our multispot setup, while pointing potential limitations of the current single laser excitation design, as well as analysis challenges and their solutions.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we present a theoretical framework combining experimental characterizations and analytical calculus to capture the firing rate input-output properties of single neurons in the fluctuation-driven regime. Our framework consists of a two-step procedure to treat independently how the dendritic input translates into somatic fluctuation variables, and how the latter determine action potential firing. We use this framework to investigate the functional impact of the heterogeneity in firing responses found experimentally in young mice layer V pyramidal cells. We first design and calibrate in vitro a simplified morphological model of layer V pyramidal neurons with a dendritic tree following Rall's branching rule. Then, we propose an analytical derivation for the membrane potential fluctuations at the soma as a function of the properties of the synaptic input in dendrites. This mathematical description allows us to easily emulate various forms of synaptic input: either balanced, unbalanced, synchronized, purely proximal or purely distal synaptic activity. We find that those different forms of input activity lead to various impact on the membrane potential fluctuations properties, thus raising the possibility that individual neurons will differentially couple to specific forms of activity as a result of their different firing response. We indeed found such a heterogeneous coupling between synaptic input and firing response for all types of presynaptic activity. This heterogeneity can be explained by different levels of cellular excitability in the case of the balanced, unbalanced, synchronized and purely distal activity. A notable exception appears for proximal dendritic inputs: increasing the input level can either promote firing response in some cells, or suppress it in some other cells whatever their individual excitability. This behavior can be explained by different sensitivities to the speed of the fluctuations, which was previously associated to different levels of sodium channel inactivation and density. Because local network connectivity rather targets proximal dendrites, our results suggest that this aspect of biophysical heterogeneity might be relevant to neocortical processing by controlling how individual neurons couple to local network activity.",

    "abstract": "As high-throughput biological sequencing becomes faster and cheaper, the need to extract useful information from sequencing becomes ever more paramount, often limited by low-throughput experimental characterizations. For proteins, accurate prediction of their functions directly from their primary amino-acid sequences has been a long standing challenge. Here, machine learning using artificial recurrent neural networks (RNN) was applied towards classification of protein function directly from primary sequence without sequence alignment, heuristic scoring or feature engineering. The RNN models containing long-short-term-memory (LSTM) units trained on public, annotated datasets from UniProt achieved high performance for in-class prediction of four important protein functions tested, particularly compared to other machine learning algorithms using sequence-derived protein features. RNN models were used also for out-of-class predictions of phylogenetically distinct protein families with similar functions, including proteins of the CRISPR-associated nuclease, ferritin-like iron storage and cytochrome P450 families. Applying the trained RNN models on the partially unannotated UniRef100 database predicted not only candidates validated by existing annotations but also currently unannotated sequences. Some RNN predictions for the ferritin-like iron sequestering function were experimentally validated, even though their sequences differ significantly from known, characterized proteins and from each other and cannot be easily predicted using popular bioinformatics methods. As sequencing and experimental characterization data increases rapidly, the machine-learning approach based on RNN could be useful for discovery and prediction of homologues for a wide range of protein functions.",

    "abstract": "During the asymmetric division of the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode zygote, the polarity cues distribution and daughter cell fates depend on the correct positioning of the mitotic spindle, which results from both centering and cortical pulling forces. Revealed by anaphase spindle rocking, these pulling forces are regulated by the force generator dynamics, which are in turn consequent of mitotic progression. We found a novel, additional, regulation of these forces by the spindle position. It controls astral microtubule availability at the cortex, on which the active force generators can pull. Importantly, this positional control relies on the polarity dependent LET-99 cortical band, which restricts or concentrates generators to a posterior crescent. After delaying anaphase onset, we detected this positional pulling force regulation in C. elegans as a precocious spindle rocking with respect to anaphase onset. We ascribed this control to the microtubule dynamics at the cortex. Indeed, in mapping the cortical contacts, we found a correlation between the centrosome-cortex distance and the microtubule contact density. In turn, it modulates pulling force generator activity. We modelled this control, predicting and experimentally validating that the posterior crescent extent controlled where the anaphase oscillations started, in addition to mitotic progression. We found in particular that the oscillation onset position resists changes in cellular geometry and moderate variations of active force generator count. Finally, we propose that spatially restricting force generator to a posterior crescent sets the spindles final position, reflecting polarity through the LET-99 dependent restriction of force generators to a posterior crescent. This regulation superimposes that of force generator processivity. This novel control confers a low dependence on microtubule and active force generator exact numbers or dynamics, provided that they exceed the threshold needed for posterior displacement. Interestingly, this robustness originates in cell mechanics rather than biochemical networks.",

    "abstract": "MotivationComparing the human genome to the genomes of closely related mammalian species has been a powerful tool for discovering functional elements in the human genome. Millions of conserved elements have been discovered. However, understanding the functional roles of these elements still remain a challenge, especially in noncoding regions. In particular, it is still unclear why these elements are evolutionarily conserved and what kind of functional elements are encoded within these sequences.\\n\\nResultsWe present a deep learning framework, called DeepCons, to uncover potential functional elements within conserved sequences. DeepCons is a convolutional neural net (CNN) that receives a short segment of DNA sequence as input and outputs the probability of the sequence of being evolutionary conserved. DeepCons utilizes hundreds of convolution kernels to detect features within DNA sequences, and automatically learns these kernels after training the CNN model using 887,577 conserved elements and a similar number of nonconserved elements in the human genome. On a balanced test dataset, DeepCons can achieve an accuracy of 75% in determining whether a sequence element is conserved or not, and the area under the ROC curve of 0.83, based on information from the human genome alone. We further investigate the properties of the learned kernels. Some kernels are directly related to well-known regulatory motifs corresponding to transcription factors. Many kernels show positional biases relative to transcriptional start sites or transcription end sites. But most of discovered kernels do not correspond to any known functional element, suggesting that they might represent unknown categories of functional elements. We also utilize DeepCons to annotate how changes at each individual nucleotide might impact the conservation properties of the surrounding sequences.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe source code of DeepCons and all the learned convolution kernels in motif format is publicly available online at https://github.com/uci-cbcl/DeepCons.\\n\\nContactxhx@ics.uci.edu",

However, often genes of interest are not completely or accurately assembled, leading to unknown errors in analyses or additional cloning efforts for the correct sequences. A promising solution to this problem is long-read sequencing. Here we tested PacBio-based long-read sequencing and diploid assembly for potential improvements to the Sanger-based intermediate-read zebra finch reference and Illumina-based short-read Annas hummingbird reference, two vocal learning avian species widely studied in neuroscience and genomics. With DNA of the same individuals used to generate the reference genomes, we generated diploid assemblies with the FALCON-Unzip assembler, resulting in contigs with no gaps in the megabase range (N50s of 5.4 and 7.7 Mb, respectively), and representing 150-fold and 200-fold improvements over the current zebra finch and hummingbird references, respectively. These long-read assemblies corrected and resolved what we discovered to be misassemblies, including due to erroneous sequences flanking gaps, complex repeat structure errors in the references, base call errors in difficult to sequence regions, and inaccurate resolution of allelic differences between the two haplotypes. We analyzed protein-coding genes widely studied in neuroscience and specialized in vocal learning species, and found numerous assembly and sequence errors in the reference genes that the PacBio-based assemblies resolved completely, validated by single long genomic reads and transcriptome reads. These findings demonstrate, for the first time in non-human vocal learning species, the impact of higher quality, phased and gap-less assemblies for understanding gene structure and function.",

    "abstract": "Microbiomes influence plant development, establishment, nutrient acquisition, pathogen defense, and the myriad of roles that ultimately impacts plant health. Plants microbiome are shaped through interactions between the microbes (ranging from cooperative functions to chemical warfare) and a selection process entailed by the host plants that distinguishes between pathogens, commensals, symbionts and transient bacteria. The soil is a primary source for microbes colonizing plants, along with other environmental sources including rain and interactions with other organisms. In this work, we explore the microbiomes through massive sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in the eldest terrestrial plants: Marchantia liverworts. We compared microbiomes from M. polymorpha, and M. paleacea plants collected in the wild and their soils, all together luckily in the same geographical location (sympatric) thus reducing geographic effects; and also from plants grown in vitro and established from gemmae obtained from the same population of wild plants. Qualitative and quantitative microbiome analysis allowed us to identify microbes conserved in both native and in vitro Marchantia species. While M. polymorpha native plants microbiomes richness is reduced about M. paleacea, containing almost half of the Operative Taxonomic Units (OTUs) observed in M. paleacea, M. polymorpha grown in vitro exhibits larger OTUs. This diversity differences might be the result of impairment to recognize their microbial partners and being an open niche for opportunistic bacteria. The main OTUs in Marchantia microbiomes were assigned to the genera: Methylobacterium, Rhizobium, Paenibacillus, Lysobacter, Pirellula, Steroidobacter, and Bryobacter. The assigned genera correspond to bacteria capable of plant-growth promotion, complex exudates degradation, nitrogen fixation, methylotrophs, and disease-suppressive bacteria, all hosted in the relatively simple anatomy of the plant that provides refuge on their surfaces, rhizoids, and multiple gas chambers that work as specialized niches for different bacterial groups. Marchantia is a promising model to study not only long-term relationships between plants and their microbes but also the transgenerational impact of microbiomes because of Marchantia long 450 million years under climate change conditions testing microbiome configurations.",

To verify specificity and extent of these associations, mixed cultures were established from three different freshwater environments. These cultures contained free-living streamlined organisms lacking multiple biosynthetic pathways. Among the co-occurring members of the mixed cultures, there was no clear recurring pattern of metabolic complementarity and dependencies. This, together with weak temporal co-occurrence patterns observed using time-series metagenomics, suggests that free-living freshwater bacteria form loose and unspecific cooperative loops. Comparative genomics suggests that the proportion of accessory genes in populations of streamlined bacteria allows for flexibility in interaction partners. Altogether this renders these free-living bacterial lineages functionally versatile despite their streamlining tendencies.",

We apply neural network based techniques from the natural language processing (NLP) domain. The first method does not rely on the GO tree, whereas the second indirectly depends on the GO tree. In our first approach, we compare two GO definitions by treating them as two unordered sets of words. The word similarity is estimated by a word embedding model that maps words into an N-dimensional space. In our second approach, we account for the word-ordering within a sentence. We use a sentence encoder to embed GO definitions into vectors and estimate how likely one definition entails another. We validate our methods in two ways. In the first experiment, we test the models ability to differentiate a true protein-protein network from a randomly generated network. In the second experiment, we test the model in identifying orthologs from randomly-matched genes in human, mouse, and fly. In both experiments, a hybrid of NLP and GO-tree based method achieves the best classification accuracy.\\n\\nAvailabilitygithub.com/datduong/NLPMethods2CompareGOterms",

    "abstract": "Recently, Hi-C has been used to probe the 3D chromatin architecture of multiple organisms and cell types. The resulting collections of pairwise contacts across the genome have connected chromatin architecture to many cellular phenomena, including replication timing and gene regulation. However, high resolution (10 kb or finer) contact maps remain scarce due to the expense and time required for collection. A computational method for predicting pairwise contacts without the need to run a Hi-C experiment would be invaluable in understanding the role that 3D chromatin architecture plays in genome biology. We describe Rambutan, a deep convolutional neural network that predicts Hi-C contacts at 1 kb resolution using nucleotide sequence and DNaseI assay signal as inputs. Specifically, Rambutan identifies locus pairs that engage in high confidence contacts according to Fit-Hi-C, a previously described method for assigning statistical confidence estimates to Hi-C contacts. We first demonstrate Rambutans performance across chromosomes at 1 kb resolution in the GM12878 cell line. Subsequently, we measure Rambutans performance across six cell types. In this setting, the model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.7662 and 0.8246 and an area under the precision-recall curve between 0.3737 and 0.9008. We further demonstrate that the predicted contacts exhibit expected trends relative to histone modification ChlP-seq data, replication timing measurements, and annotations of functional elements such as promoters and enhancers. Finally, we predict Hi-C contacts for 53 human cell types and show that the predictions cluster by cellular function. [NOTE: After our original submission we discovered an error in our calling of statistically significant contacts. Briefly, when calculating the prior probability of a contact, we used the number of contacts at a certain genomic distance in a chromosome but divided by the total number of bins in the full genome. While we investigate what impact this had on our results, we ask that readers treat this manuscript skeptically.]",

    "abstract": "Samples of bacteria collected over a period of time are attractive for several reasons, including the ability to estimate the molecular clock rate and to detect fluctuations in allele frequencies over time. However, longitudinal datasets are occasionally used in analyses that assume samples were collected contemporaneously. Using both simulations and genomic data from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus mutans, Campylobacter jejuni, and Helicobacter pylori, we show that longitudinal samples (spanning more than a decade in real data) may suffer from considerable bias that inflates estimates of recombination and the number of rare mutations in a sample of genomic sequences. While longitudinal data are frequently accounted for using the serial coalescent, many studies use other programs or metrics, such as Tajimas D, that are sensitive to these sampling biases and contain genomic data collected across many years. Notably, longitudinal samples from a population of constant size may exhibit evidence of exponential growth. We suggest that population genomic studies of bacteria should routinely account for temporal diversity in samples or provide evidence that longitudinal sampling bias does not affect conclusions.",

Often characterised simply as direct targets for leptin, recent data suggest a more complex architecture. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we have generated an atlas of gene expression in murine POMC neurons. Of 163 neurons, 118 expressed high levels of Pomc with little/no Agrp expression and were considered \\\"canonical\\\" POMC neurons (P+). The other 45/163 expressed low levels of Pomc and high levels of Agrp (A+P+). Unbiased clustering analysis of P+ neurons revealed four different classes, each with distinct cell surface receptor gene expression profiles. Further, only 12% (14/118) of P+ neurons expressed the leptin receptor (Lepr) compared with 58% (26/45) of A+P+ neurons. In contrast, the insulin receptor (Insr) was expressed at similar frequency on P+ and A+P+ neurons (64% and 55%, respectively). These data reveal arcuate POMC neurons to be a highly heterogeneous population.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTranslation initiation is a key step in the regulation of gene expression. In addition to the annotated translation initiation sites (TISs), the translation process may also start at multiple alternative TISs (including both AUG and non-AUG codons), which makes it challenging to predict TISs and study the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Meanwhile, the advent of several high-throughput sequencing techniques for profiling initiating ribosomes at single-nucleotide resolution, e.g., GTI-seq and QTI-seq, provides abundant data for systematically studying the general principles of translation initiation and the development of computational method for TIS identification.\\n\\nMethodsWe have developed a deep learning based framework, named TITER, for accurately predicting TISs on a genome-wide scale based on QTI-seq data. TITER extracts the sequence features of translation initiation from the surrounding sequence contexts of TISs using a hybrid neural network and further integrates the prior preference of TIS codon composition into a unified prediction framework.\\n\\nResultsExtensive tests demonstrated that TITER can greatly outperform the state-of-the-art prediction methods in identifying TISs. In addition, TITER was able to identify important sequence signatures for individual types of TIS codons, including a Kozak-sequence-like motif for AUG start codon. Furthermore, the TITER prediction score can be related to the strength of translation initiation in various biological scenarios, including the repressive effect of the upstream open reading frames (uORFs) on gene expression and the mutational effects influencing translation initiation efficiency.\\n\\nAvailabilityTITER is available as an open-source software and can be downloaded from https://github.com/zhangsaithu/titer\\n\\nContactlzhang20@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn and zengjy321@tsinghua.edu.cn",

    "abstract": "AbstractBacterial nanowires have garnered recent interest as a proposed Extracellular Electron Transfer (EET) pathway that links the bacterial electron transport chain to solid-phase electron acceptors away from the cell. In vivo fluorescence Light Microscopy (fLM) imaging recently showed that Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 nanowires are extensions of the outer membrane that contain EET components. However, their fine structure and distribution of cytochrome electron carriers remained unclear, making it difficult to evaluate the electron transport mechanism along the nanowires. Here, we report high-resolution images of nanowires using Electron Cryo-Tomography (ECT). We developed a robust method for fLM imaging of nanowire growth on electron microscopy grids and used correlative light and electron microscopy to identify and image the same nanowires by ECT. Our results confirm that S. oneidensis nanowires are outer membrane extensions, and further reveal that nanowires are dynamic chains of interconnected Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) with variable dimensions, curvature, and extent of tubulation. Junction densities that potentially stabilize OMV chains are seen between neighboring vesicles in cryotomograms. Our ECT results also provide the first hints of the positions and packing of periplasmic and outer membrane proteins consistent with cytochromes. We observe tight packing of putative cytochromes along lateral patches that extend tens of nanometers, but not across the micrometer scale of whole nanowires. We therefore propose that electron transfer along nanowires involves a combination of direct hopping and diffusive events that link neighboring redox proteins.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear actin influences transcription in a manner dependent on its dynamics of polymerisation and nucleocytoplasmic translocation. Using human somatic cells and transcriptionally-silent Xenopus egg extracts, we show that actin dynamics is also required for DNA replication. We identify many actin regulators in replicating nuclei from Xenopus egg extracts, and show that in human cells, nuclear actin filaments form in early G1 and disassemble prior to S-phase. In either system, treatments that stabilise nuclear actin filaments abrogate nuclear transport and initiation of DNA replication. Mechanistically, actin directly binds RanGTP-importin complexes and disruption of its dynamics hinders cargo release. This prevents both nuclear pore complex (NPC) formation and active nuclear transport, which we show is required throughout DNA replication. Nuclear formin activity is required for two further steps: loading of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto chromatin and initiation of DNA replication. Thus, actin dynamics and formins are involved in several nuclear processes essential for cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in technological tools such as next generation sequencing along with peaking interest in the study of single cells has enabled single-cell RNA-sequencing, in which whole transcriptomes are analyzed on a single-cell level. Studies, however, have been hindered by the ability to effectively analyze these single cell RNA-seq datasets, due to the high-dimensional nature and intrinsic noise in the data. While many techniques have been introduced to reduce dimensionality of such data for visualization and subpopulation identification, the utility to identify new cellular subtypes in a reliable and robust manner remains unclear. Here, we compare dimensionality reduction visualization methods including principle component analysis and t-stochastic neighbor embedding along with various distance metric modifications to visualize single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and assess their performance in identifying known cellular subtypes. Our results suggest that selecting variable genes prior to analysis on single-cell RNA-seq data is vital to yield reliable classification, and that when variable genes are used, the choice of distance metric modification does not particularly influence the quality of classification. Still, in order to take advantage of all the gene expression information, alternative methods must be used for a reliable classification.",

We developed a new approach - information transfer mapping - to test the hypothesis that resting-state functional network topology describes the computational mappings between brain regions that carry cognitive task information. Here we report that the transfer of diverse, task-rule information in distributed brain regions can be predicted based on estimated activity flow through resting-state network connections. Further, we find that these task-rule information transfers are coordinated by global hub regions within cognitive control networks. Activity flow over resting-state connections thus provides a large-scale network mechanism for cognitive task information transfer and global information coordination in the human brain, demonstrating the cognitive relevance of resting-state network topology.",

We present the first haplotype model that operates on a variation graph-embedded population reference cohort. We describe an algorithm to calculate the likelihood that a haplotype arose from this cohort through recombinations and demonstrate time complexity linear in haplotype length and sublinear in population size.
