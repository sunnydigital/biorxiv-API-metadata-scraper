    "abstract": "Diverse eukaryotic cells crawl through complex environments using distinct modes of migration. To understand the underlying mechanisms and their evolutionary relationships, we must define each mode, and identify its phenotypic and molecular markers. Here, we focus on a widely dispersed migration mode characterized by dynamic, actin-filled pseudopods that we call \\\"-motility.\\\" Mining genomic data reveals a clear trend: only organisms with both WASP and SCAR/WAVE--activators of branched actin assembly--make actin-filled pseudopods. While SCAR has been shown to drive pseudopod formation, WASPs role in this process is controversial. We hypothesize that these genes together represent a genetic signature of -motility, because both are used for pseudopod formation. WASP depletion from human neutrophils confirms that both proteins are involved in explosive actin polymerization, pseudopod formation, and cell migration, and colocalize to dynamic signaling structures. Moreover, retention of WASP together with SCAR correctly predicts -motility in disease-causing chytrid fungi, which we show crawl at >30 m/min with actin-filled pseudopods. By focusing on one migration mode in many eukaryotes, we identify a genetic marker of pseudopod formation, the morphological feature of -motility, providing evidence for a widely distributed mode of cell crawling with a single evolutionary origin.",

    "abstract": "The Perigord black truffle (Tuber melanosporum Vittad.) is a heterothallic ascomycete that establishes ectomycorrhizal symbiosis with trees and shrubs. Small-scale genetic structures of female genotypes in truffle orchards are known, but it has not yet been studied in male genotypes. In this study, our aim was to characterize the small-scale genetic structure of both male and female genotypes over five years in an orchard to better understand the T. melanosporum sexual reproduction strategy, male genotype dynamics, and origins. Two-hundred forty-one ascocarps, 475 ectomycorrhizas, and 20 soil cores were harvested and genotyped using microsatellites and mating type genes. Isolation by distance analysis revealed pronounced small-scale genetic structures for both female and male genotypes. The genotypic diversity was higher for male than female genotypes with numerous small size genotypes suggesting an important turnover due to ascospore recruitment. Larger and perennial female and male genotypes were also detected. Only three genotypes (1.5 %) were found as both female and male genotypes (hermaphrodites) while most were detected only as female or male genotype (dioecy). Our results suggest that germinating ascospores act as male genotypes, but we also proposed that soil mycelium could be a reservoir of male genotypes.",

    "abstract": "The alternative sigma factor RpoS is a central regulator of a many stress responses in Escherichia coli. The level of functional RpoS differs depending on the stress. The effect of these differing concentrations of RpoS on global transcriptional responses remains unclear. We investigated the effect of RpoS concentration on the transcriptome during stationary phase in rich media. We show that 23% of genes in the E. coli genome are regulated by RpoS level, and we identify many RpoS-transcribed genes and promoters. We observe three distinct classes of response to RpoS by genes in the regulon: genes whose expression changes linearly with increasing RpoS level, genes whose expression changes dramatically with the production of only a little RpoS (\\\"sensitive\\\" genes), and genes whose expression changes very little with the production of a little RpoS (\\\"insensitive\\\"). We show that sequences outside the core promoter region determine whether a RpoS-regulated gene in sensitive or insensitive. Moreover, we show that sensitive and insensitive genes are enriched for specific functional classes, and that the sensitivity of a gene to RpoS corresponds to the timing of induction as cells enter stationary phase. Thus, promoter sensitivity to RpoS is a mechanism to coordinate specific cellular processes with growth phase, and may also contribute to the diversity of stress responses directed by RpoS.\\n\\nImportanceThe sigma factor RpoS is a global regulator that controls the response to many stresses in Escherichia coli. Different stresses result in different levels of RpoS production, but the consequences of this variation are unknown. We describe how changing the level of RpoS does not influence all RpoS-regulated genes equally. The cause of this variation is likely the action of transcription factors that bind the promoters of the genes. We show that the sensitivity of a gene to RpoS levels explains the timing of expression as cells enter stationary phase, and that genes with different RpoS sensitivities are enriched for specific functional groups. Thus, promoter sensitivity to RpoS is a mechanism to coordinate specific cellular processes in response to stresses.",

    "abstract": "Plasmids are autonomous extra-chromosomal elements in bacterial cells that can carry genes that are important for bacterial survival. To benchmark algorithms for automated plasmid sequence reconstruction from short read sequencing data, we selected 42 publicly available complete bacterial genome sequences which were assembled by a combination of long- and short-read data. The selected bacterial genome sequence projects span 12 genera, containing 148 plasmids. We predicted plasmids from short-read data with four different programs (PlasmidSPAdes, Recycler, cBar and PlasmidFinder) and compared the outcome to the reference sequences.\\n\\nPlasmidSPAdes reconstructs plasmids based on coverage differences in the assembly graph. It reconstructed most of the reference plasmids (recall = 0.82) but approximately a quarter of the predicted plasmid contigs were false positives (precision = 0.76). PlasmidSPAdes merged 83 % of the predictions from genomes with multiple plasmids in a single bin. Recycler searches the assembly graph for sub-graphs corresponding to circular sequences and correctly predicted small plasmids but failed with long plasmids (recall = 0.12, precision = 0.30). cBar, which applies pentamer frequency composition analysis to detect plasmid-derived contigs, showed an overall recall and precision of 0.78 and 0.64. However, cBar only categorizes contigs as plasmid-derived and does not bin the different plasmids correctly within a bacterial isolate. PlasmidFinder, which searches for matches in a replicon database, had the highest precision (1.0) but was restricted by the contents of its database and the contig length obtained from de novo assembly (recall = 0.36).\\n\\nSurprisingly, PlasmidSPAdes and Recycler detected single isolated components corresponding to putative novel small plasmids (<10 kbp) which were also predicted as plasmids by cBar.\\n\\nThis study shows that it is possible to automatically predict plasmid sequences, but only for small plasmids. The reconstruction of large plasmids (>50 kbp) containing repeated sequences remains challenging and limits the high-throughput analysis of WGS data.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryShort read sequencing of the DNA of bacteria is often used to understand characteristics such as antibiotic resistance. However the assembly of short read sequencing data with the goal of reconstructing a complete genome is often fragmented and leaves gaps. Therefore independently replicating DNA fragments called plasmids cannot easily be identified from an assembly. Lately a number of programs have been developed to enable the automated prediction of the sequences of plasmids. Here we tested these programs by comparing their outcomes with complete genome sequences. None of the tested programs were able to fully and unambiguously predict distinct plasmid sequences. All programs performed best with the prediction of plasmids smaller than 50 kbp. Larger plasmids were only correctly predicted if they were present as a single contig in the assembly. While predictions by PlasmidSPAdes and cBar contained most of the plasmids, they were merged with or indistinguishable from other plasmids and sometimes chromosome sequences. PlasmidFinder missed most plasmids but all its predictions were correct. Without manual steps or long-read sequencing information, plasmid reconstruction from short read sequencing data remains challenging.",

    "abstract": "The birth of genes that encode new protein sequences is a major source of evolutionary innovation. However, we still understand relatively little about how these genes come into being and which functions they are selected for. To address these questions we have obtained a large collection of mammalian-specific gene families that lack homologues in other eukaryotic groups. We have combined gene annotations and de novo transcript assemblies from 30 different mamalian species, obtaining about 6,000 gene families. In general, the proteins in mammalian-specific gene families tend to be short and depleted in aromatic and negatively charged residues. Proteins which arose early in mammalian evolution include milk and skin polypeptides, immune response components, and proteins involved in reproduction. In contrast, the functions of proteins which have a more recent origin remain largely unknown, despite the fact that these proteins also have extensive proteomics support. We identify several previously described cases of genes originated de novo from non-coding genomic regions, supporting the idea that this mechanism frequently underlies the evolution of new protein-coding genes in mammals. Finally, we show that most young mammalian genes are preferentially expressed in testis, suggesting that sexual selection plays an important role in the emergence of new functional genes.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy and senescence are both well-established responses to chemotherapy and radiation that often occur in parallel, contributing to growth arrest in tumor cells. However, it has not been established whether this growth arrest is reversible. This question was addressed using non-small cell lung cancer models exposed to the cancer chemotherapeutic drug, etoposide. Senescent cells that were sorted, identified by {beta}-galactosidase staining and alterations in morphology, isolated by flow cytometric cell sorting based on C12FDG staining, and real-time live microscopy were found to be capable of recovering proliferative capacity. Autophagy, monitored by vacuole formation, SQSTM1/p62 degradation, and LC3BII generation did not interfere with either the senescence arrest or proliferative recovery and was nonprotective in function (i.e. autophagy inhibition via both pharmacological and genetic strategies had negligible impact on the response to etoposide).\\n\\nThese observations argue against the premise that (chemotherapy-induced) senescence is irreversible and indicate that therapy-induced senescence may ultimately be a transient process in that at least a subpopulation of tumor cells can and will remain metabolically active and recover proliferative capacity independently of autophagic turnover. We therefore propose that dormant tumor cells may be capable of prolonged survival in a state of autophagy/senescence and that disease recurrence may reflect escape from this senescence-arrested state.",

The extent and biological significance of viral presence/infection in actual tumor samples is generally unknown but could be measured using human transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from tumor samples.\\n\\nWe present an open source bioinformatics pipeline viGEN, which combines existing well-known and novel RNA-seq tools for not only the detection and quantification of viral RNA, but also variants in the viral transcripts.\\n\\nThe pipeline includes 4 major modules: The first module allows to align and filter out human RNA sequences; the second module maps and count (remaining un-aligned) reads against reference genomes of all known and sequenced human viruses; the third module quantifies read counts at the individual viral genes level thus allowing for downstream differential expression analysis of viral genes between experimental and controls groups. The fourth module calls variants in these viruses. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available pipelines or packages that would provide this type of complete analysis in one open source package.\\n\\nIn this paper, we applied the viGEN pipeline to two case studies. We first demonstrate the working of our pipeline on a large public dataset, the TCGA cervical cancer cohort. We also performed additional in-depth analyses on a small focused study of TCGA liver cancer patients. In this cohort, we perform viral-gene quantification, viral-variant extraction and survival analysis. This allowed us to find differentially expressed viral-transcripts and viral-variants between the groups of patients, and connect them to clinical outcome.\\n\\nFrom our analyses, we show that we were able to successfully detect the human papilloma virus among the TCGA cervical cancer patients. We compared the viGEN pipeline with two metagenomics tools and demonstrate similar sensitivity/specificity. We were also able to quantify viral-transcripts and extract viral-variants using the liver cancer dataset. The results presented corresponded with published literature in terms of rate of detection, viral gene expression patterns and impact of several known variants of HBV genome. Results also show novel information about distinct patterns of expression and co-expression in Hepatitis B and the Human Endogenous Retrovirus (HERV) K113 viruses.\\n\\nThis pipeline is generalizable, and can be used to provide novel biological insights into the significance of viral and other microbial infections in complex diseases, tumorigeneses and cancer immunology.

    "abstract": "A wide variety of protein and peptidomimetic design tasks require matching functional three-dimensional motifs to potential oligomeric scaffolds. Enzyme design, for example, aims to graft active-site patterns typically consisting of 3 to 15 residues onto new protein surfaces. Identifying suitable proteins capable of scaffolding such active-site engraftment requires costly searches to identify protein folds that can provide the correct positioning of side chains to host the desired active site. Other examples of biodesign tasks that require simpler fast exact geometric searches of potential side chain positioning include mimicking binding hotspots, design of metal binding clusters and the design of modular hydrogen binding networks for specificity. In these applications the speed and scaling of geometric search limits downstream design to small patterns. Here we present an adaptive algorithm to searching for side chain take-off angles compatible with an arbitrarily specified functional pattern that enjoys substantive performance improvements over previous methods. We demonstrate this method in both genetically encoded (protein) and synthetic (peptidomimetic) design scenarios.

However, to what extent immunoediting is shaping the cancer genome is still a matter of debate. Moreover, the impact of cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint blockers on modulating immunoediting remains largely unexplored. Here we elucidated the impact of evolutionary and immune-related forces on editing the tumor in a mouse model of colorectal cancer (CRC). We first show that MC38 cell line is a valid model for hypermutated and microsatellite-unstable (MSI) CRC. Analyses of longitudinal samples of wild type and immunodeficient RAG1 knockout mice transplanted with MC38 cells revealed that upregulation of checkpoint molecules and infiltration of Tregs are the major tumor escape mechanisms. Strikingly, the impact of neutral evolution on sculpting the tumor outweighed immunoediting. Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway potentiated immunoediting and rendered tumors more homogeneous in the MC38 model. The immunoediting effects were less pronounced in a nonhypermutated/MSI- model CT26. Our study demonstrates that neutral evolution is the major force that sculpts the tumor, and that checkpoint blockade effectively enforces T cell dependent immunoselective pressure in a hypermutated/MSI model of CRC.",

Here we show that locomotor activity independently modulates performance in delay eyeblink conditioning, a cerebellum-dependent form of associative learning. Increased locomotor speed in head-fixed mice was associated with earlier onset of learning and trial-by-trial enhancement of learned responses. The influence of locomotion on conditioned responses was dissociable from changes in arousal and was independent of the sensory modality of the conditioned stimulus. Eyelid responses evoked by optogenetic stimulation of mossy fiber terminals within the cerebellar cortex, but not at sites downstream, were also positively modulated by ongoing locomotion. We conclude that locomotor activity modulates delay eyeblink conditioning through mechanisms acting on the mossy fiber pathway within the cerebellar cortex. Taken together, these results suggest a novel role for behavioral state modulation in associative learning and provide a potential mechanism through which engaging in movement can improve an individuals ability to learn.",

    "abstract": "1Recent investigations on the aerodynamics of natural fliers have illuminated the significance of the Leading-Edge Vortex (LEV) for lift generation in a variety of flight conditions. A well documented example of an LEV is that generated by aircraft with highly swept, delta shaped wings. While the wing aerodynamics of a manoeuvring aircraft, a bird gliding and a bird in flapping flight vary significantly, it is believed that this existing knowledge will serve to add understanding to the complex aerodynamics of natural fliers. In this investigation, the wing of a common swift Apus apus is simplified to a model with swept wings and a sharp leading-edge, making it readily comparable to a model delta shaped wing of the same leading-edge geometry. Particle image velocimetry provides an understanding of the effect of the tapering swift wing on LEV development and stability, compared with the delta wing model. For the first time a dual LEV is recorded on a swift shaped wing, where it is found across all tested conditions. It is shown that the span-wise location of LEV breakdown is governed by the local chord rather than Reynolds number or angle of attack. These findings suggest that the common swift is able to generate a dual LEV while gliding, potentially delaying vortex breakdown by exploiting other features non explored here, such as wing twist and flexibility. It is further suggested that the vortex system could be used to damp loading fluctuations, reducing energy expenditure, rather than for lift augmentation.",

    "abstract": "RNA editing in African trypanosomes represents an RNA-processing reaction that generates functional mitochondrial transcripts from sequence-deficient pre-mRNAs. The reaction is catalyzed by a macromolecular protein complex known as the editosome. Editosomes have been demonstrated to execute RNA-chaperone activity to overcome the highly folded nature of pre-edited substrate mRNAs. The molecular basis of this activity is unknown. Here we test five OB-fold proteins of the editosome as potential candidates. We show that the different proteins interact by hetero-oligomerization and we demonstrate that all proteins execute RNA-chaperone activity. Activity differences correlate with the surface areas of the proteins and map predominantly to the intrinsically disordered subdomains of the polypeptides. To provide a structural context for our findings we present a coarse-grained model of the editosome. The model suggests that an inner core of catalytically active editosome components is separated from an outer shell of IDP-domains that act as RNA-remodeling sites.",

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoids--stress hormones released from the adrenal cortex--reduce phobic fear in anxiety disorders and enhance psychotherapy, possibly by reducing the retrieval of fear memories and enhancing the consolidation of new corrective memories. Glucocorticoid signaling in the basolateral amygdala can influence connected fear and memory-related cortical regions, but this is not fully understood. Previous studies investigated specific pathways moderated by glucocorticoids, for example, visual-temporal pathways; however, these analyses were limited to a-priori selected regions. Here, we performed whole-brain pattern analysis to localize phobic stimulus decoding related to the fear-reducing effect of glucocorticoids. We reanalyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a previously published study with spider-phobic patients and healthy controls. The patients received either glucocorticoids or a placebo treatment before the exposure to spider images. There was moderate evidence that patients with phobia had higher decoding of phobic content in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the left and right anterior insula compared to controls. Decoding in the ACC and the right insula showed strong evidence for correlation with experienced fear. Patients with cortisol reported a reduction of fear by 10-13%; however, there was only weak evidence for changes in neural decoding compared to placebo which was found in the precuneus, the opercular cortex, and the left cerebellum.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila segmentation is a well-established paradigm for developmental pattern formation. However, the later stages of segment patterning, regulated by the \\\"pair-rule\\\" genes, are still not well understood at the systems level. Building on established genetic interactions, I construct a logical model of the Drosophila pair-rule system that takes into account the demonstrated stage-specific architecture of the pair-rule gene network. Simulation of this model can accurately recapitulate the observed spatiotemporal expression of the pair-rule genes, but only when the system is provided with dynamic \\\"gap\\\" inputs. This result suggests that dynamic shifts of pair-rule stripes are essential for segment patterning in the trunk, and provides a functional role for observed posterior-to-anterior gap domain shifts that occur during cellularisation. The model also suggests revised patterning mechanisms for the parasegment boundaries, and accounts for the even-skipped null mutant phenotype. Strikingly, a slightly modified version of the model is able to pattern segments in either simultaneous or sequential modes, depending only on initial conditions. This suggest that fundamentally similar mechanisms may underlie segmentation in short-germ and long-germ arthropods.",

    "abstract": "The short and long term effects of polyploidization on the evolutionary fate of lineages is still unclear despite much interest. First recognized in land plants, it has become clear that polyploidization is widespread in eukaryotes, notably at the origin of vertebrates and teleost fishes. Many hypotheses have been proposed to link the evolutionary success of lineages and whole genome duplications. For instance, the radiation time lag model suggests that paleopolyploidy would favour the apparition of key innovations, although the evolutionary success would not become apparent until a later dispersion event. Some results indicate that this model may be observed during land plant evolution. In this work, we test predictions of the radiation time lag model using both fossil data and molecular phylogenies in ancient and more recent teleost whole genome duplications. We fail to find any evidence of delayed evolutionary success after any of these events and conclude that paleopolyploidization still remains to be unambiguously linked to evolutionary success in fishes.",

    "abstract": "The failure of chemotherapeutic drugs in treatment of various cancers is attributed to the acquisition of drug resistance. However, the invasion mechanisms of drug-resistant cancer cells remains incompletely understood. Here we address this question from a biophysical perspective by mapping the phenotypic alterations in ovarian cancer cells (OCCs) resistant to cisplatin and paclitaxel. We show that cisplatin-resistant (CisR), paclitaxel-resistant (PacR) and dual drug-resistant (i.e., resistant to both drugs) OCCs are softer and more contractile than drug-sensitive cells. Protease inhibition suppresses invasion of CisR cells but not of PacR and dual cells, suggesting protease-dependent mode of invasion in CisR cells and protease-independent mode in PacR and dual cells. Despite these differences, actomyosin contractility, mediated by the RhoA-ROCK2-Myosin IIB signaling pathway regulates both modes of invasion. Myosin IIB modulates matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) secretion in CisR cells and nuclear squeezing in PacR and dual cells, thereby highlighting its importance as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells.\\n\\nFinancial SupportAuthors acknowledge financial support from IIT Bombay Healthcare Initiative, CSIR andDepartment of Biotechnology (Govt. of India) (Grant # BT/PR14658/MED/31/107/2010).AK and BTwere supported by fellowships from UGC and CSIR respectively (Govt. of India).\\n\\nAuthors declare no competing financial interests\\n\\nAuthor contributions: AK, PR and SS designed the experiments.

    "abstract": "We report on female Asian elephant social structure in Nagarahole and Bandipur National Parks (Kabini population), southern India, and examine the role of group size in affecting the outcome of social structure analysis in female elephants, which show high fission-fusion dynamics. Based on five years of data, we found the Kabini association network structured into highly modular communities that we call clans. We then modified the dataset (to obtain the Kabini 500-m dataset) to match sampling methods previously used in a study each of Asian (Uda Walawe) and African savannah (Samburu) elephants, so that network and association statistics could be compared across populations. Measures of association and network structure previously used were more similar amongst the Asian elephant populations compared to Samburu. The Samburu population formed a hierarchically-nested multilevel society whereas the Asian populations did not. However, we found hierarchical clustering levels in all three populations using Louvain community detection. Moreover, the average community sizes obtained through the Louvain method were not significantly different across populations, indicating basic similarities in social structure. Since fission-fusion dynamics allow for community members to form groups of different sizes, we examined the effect of average group size on association and network statistics. Higher average association index and degree, and lower average path length in Samburu compared to the Kabini 500-m dataset were explained by the larger average group size in Samburu. Thus, underlying similarities in the social networks of species showing fission-fusion dynamics may be obscured by differences in average group size.\\n\\nSignificance StatementVarious measures of associations and social network analyses have been used to compare social structures of different populations. We studied the social structure of female Asian elephants in a southern Indian population and compared it with those of a Sri Lankan Asian elephant population and an African savannah elephant population. We showed that, while there were social differences between the Asian and African savannah elephant populations using previous methods, there were basic similarities across all three populations using a method of network community detection. This discrepancy across analyses partly stemmed from differences in average group size between populations. Average group size in fission-fusion societies variously affected different association and network statistics, which has implications for inferences about social structure.",

Overall proportions of 21nt and 24nt RNA pools were shifted due to grandparental treatments. While individual genes did not show strong up- or downregulation of associated sRNAs, the subset of genes that showed the strongest shifts in sRNA abundance was significantly enriched for several GO terms including stress-specific functions. This indicates that a stress-induced signal was transmitted across multiple unexposed generations leading to persistent and functional changes in epigenetic gene regulation.",

While there is increasing focus on the role of dietary sugars, there remains a paucity of data establishing the association between sugar intake and obesity in the general public. The objective of this study was to investigate associations of estimated sugar intake with odds for obesity in a representative samples of English adults. We used data from 434 participants of the 2005 Health Survey of England. Biomarkers for total sugar intake were measured in 24h urine samples and used to estimate intake. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to investigate associations between estimated intake and measures of obesity (BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio) and obesity risk., respectively. Estimated sugars intake was significantly associated with BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio, and these associations remained significant after adjustment for estimated protein intake. Estimated sugars intake was also associated with increased odds for obesity based on BMI (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00; 1.04 per 10 g), waist-circumference (OR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01; 1.05) and waist-to-hip ratio (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.02; 1.06); all OR estimates remained significant after adjusting for estimated protein intake. Our results show a significant association between biomarker-estimated total sugars intake and both measures of obesity and obesity risk, confirming positive associations between total sugar intake, measures of obesity and obesity risk.

    "abstract": "SUMMARYTo capture the transcriptional dynamics within proliferating cells, methods to differentiate nascent transcription from pre-existing mRNAs are desired. One approach is to label newly synthesized mRNA transcripts in vivo through the incorporation of modified pyrimidines. However, the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, is incapable of pyrimidine salvage for mRNA biogenesis. To capture cellular mRNA dynamics during Plasmodium development, we have engineered parasites that can salvage pyrimidines through the expression of a single bifunctional yeast fusion gene, cytosine deaminase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (FCU). We show that expression of FCU allows for the direct incorporation of thiol-modified pyrimidines into nascent mRNAs. Using developmental stage-specific promoters to express FCU-GFP enables the biosynthetic capture and in-depth analysis of mRNA dynamics from subpopulations of cells undergoing differentiation. We demonstrate the utility of this method by examining the transcriptional dynamics of the sexual gametocyte stage transition, a process that is essential to malaria transmission between hosts. We find that sexual stage commitment is governed by transcriptional reprogramming and the stabilization of a subset of essential gametocyte transcripts. This new method for biosynthetic labeling of Plasmodium mRNAs is incredibly versatile and can be used to measure transcriptional dynamics at any stage of parasite development, and thiol-modified RNAs will allow for future applications to measure RNA-protein interactions in the malaria parasite.",

Combining genome editing and quantitative live imaging we simultaneously visualize physical enhancer-promoter communication and transcription in Drosophila embryos. Enhancers regulating pair rule stripes of even-skipped expression activate transcription of a reporter gene over a distance of 150 kb. We show in individual cells that activation only occurs after the enhancer comes into close proximity with its regulatory target and that upon dissociation transcription ceases almost immediately. We further observe distinct topological conformations of the eve locus, depending on the spatial identity of the activating stripe enhancer. In addition, long-range activation results in transcriptional competition at the endogenous eve locus, causing corresponding developmental defects. Overall, we demonstrate that sustained physical proximity and enhancer-promoter engagement are required for enhancer action, and we provide a path to probe the implications of long-range regulation on cellular fates.",

    "abstract": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of transmitter release probability (Pr) are thought to be triggered by the activation of glutamate receptors. Here, we demonstrate that glutamate release at CA3-CA1 synapses is in fact inhibitory and unnecessary for increases in Pr. Instead, at active presynaptic terminals, postsynaptic depolarization alone can increase Pr by promoting the release of nitric oxide from neuronal dendrites in a manner dependent on L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The release of glutamate, in contrast, decreases Pr by activating presynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDAR). Thus, net changes in Pr are determined by the combined effect of both LTP-promoting and LTD-promoting processes, that is, by the amount of glutamate release and postsynaptic depolarization that accompany presynaptic activity, respectively. Neither of these processes directly depends on the activation of postsynaptic NMDARs. We further show that presynaptic changes can be captured by a simple learning rule, in which the role of presynaptic plasticity is to ensure that the ability for a presynaptic terminal to release glutamate is matched with its ability to predict postsynaptic spiking.",

    "abstract": "While large carnivores are recovering in Europe, assessing their distributions can help to predict and mitigate conflicts with human activities. Because they are highly mobile, elusive and live at very low density, modeling their distributions presents several challenges due to i) their imperfect detectability, ii) their dynamic ranges over time and iii) their monitoring at large scales consisting mainly of opportunistic data without a formal measure of the sampling effort. Not accounting for these issues can lead to flawed inference about the distribution.\\n\\nHere, we focused on the wolf (Canis lupus) that has been recolonizing France since the early 90s. We evaluated the sampling effort a posteriori as the number of observers present per year in a cell based on their location and professional activities. We then assessed wolf range dynamics from 1993 to 2014, while accounting for species imperfect detection and time- and space-varying sampling effort using dynamic site-occupancy models.\\n\\nIgnoring the effect of sampling effort on species detectability led to underestimating the number of occupied sites by 50% on average. Colonization increased with increasing number of occupied sites at short and long-distances, as well as with increasing forest cover, farmland cover and mean altitude. Colonization decreased when high-altitude increased. The growth rate, defined as the number of sites newly occupied in a given year divided by the number of occupied sites in the previous year, decreased over time, from over 100% in 1994 to 5% in 2014. This suggests that wolves are expanding in France but at a rate that is slowing down. Our work shows that opportunistic data can be analyzed with species distribution models that control for imperfect detection, pending a quantification of sampling effort. Our approach has the potential for being used by decision-makers to target sites where large carnivores are likely to occur and mitigate conflicts.",

    "abstract": "The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance is a crisis in health care today. Antibiotic resistance is often horizontally transferred to susceptible bacteria by means of multi-drug resistance plasmids that may or may not persist in the absence of antibiotics. Because bacterial pathogens often grow as biofilms, there is a need to better understand the evolution of plasmid persistence in these environments. Here we compared the evolution of plasmid persistence in the pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii when grown under antibiotic selection in biofilms versus well-mixed liquid cultures. After four weeks, clones in which the plasmid was more stably maintained in the absence of antibiotic selection were present in both populations. On average plasmid persistence increased more in liquid batch cultures, but variation in the degree of persistence was greater among biofilm-derived clones. The results of this study show for the first time that the persistence of MDR plasmids improves in biofilms.",
