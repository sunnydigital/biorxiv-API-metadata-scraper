    "abstract": "Human prefrontal cortex supports flexible decision-making by representing abstract information about task context. The organizational basis of these context representations, and of representations underlying other higher-order processes, is unknown. Here, we use multivariate decoding and analyses of spontaneous correlations to show that context representations are distributed across subnetworks within prefrontal cortex. Examining targeted prefrontal regions, we found that pairs of voxels with similar context preferences exhibited spontaneous correlations that were approximately twice as large as those between pairs with opposite context preferences. This subnetwork organization was stable across task-engaged and resting states, suggesting that abstract context representations are constrained by an intrinsic functional architecture. These results reveal a principle of fine-scaled functional organization in association cortex.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation in utero may result in life-long neurological disabilities. Microglia play a pivotal role, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. No early postnatal treatment strategies exist to enhance neuroprotective potential of microglia. We hypothesized that agonism on 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7nAChR) in fetal microglia will augment their neuroprotective transcriptome profile, while the antagonistic stimulation of 7nAChR will achieve the opposite. Using an in vivo - in vitro model of developmental programming of neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we validated this hypothesis in primary fetal sheep microglia cultures re-exposed to LPS in presence of a selective 7nAChR agonist or antagonist. Our RNAseq and protein level findings show that a pro-inflammatory microglial phenotype acquired in vitro by LPS stimulation is reversed with 7nAChR agonistic stimulation. Conversely, antagonistic 7nAChR stimulation potentiates the pro-inflammatory microglial phenotype. Surprisingly, under conditions of LPS double-hit an interference of a postulated 7nAChR - ferroportin signaling pathway may impede this mechanism. These results suggest a therapeutic potential of 7nAChR agonists in early re-programming of microglia in neonates exposed to in utero inflammation via an endogenous cerebral cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Future studies will assess the role of interactions between inflammation-triggered microglial iron sequestering and 7nAChR signaling in neurodevelopment.",

In many situations however flexibility is required and the motion capturing system can only temporarily be placed. The Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor is comparatively cheap and with respect to gait analysis promising results have been published. We here present a motion capturing system that is easy to set up, flexible with respect to the sensor locations and delivers high accuracy in gait parameters comparable to a gold standard motion capturing system (VICON). Further, we demonstrate that sensor setups which track the person only from one-side are less accurate and should be replaced by two-sided setups.

    "abstract": "Dynamic remodelling of the microtubule cytoskeleton and local interactions with intracellular targets are central to many polarized cell biological processes, an idea first formalized as search-and-capture hypothesis three decades ago1. However, because of the rapid timescale of microtubule polymerization dynamics, it is difficult to directly ask how, when and where dynamic microtubules participate in specific biological processes. Here, we employ a blue light-sensitive interaction with the oat phototropin LOV2 domain2 to generate a photo-inactivated variant of the microtubule end-binding protein EB1, a small adaptor that is central to the interaction of functionally and structurally diverse proteins with growing microtubule ends3,4, that can replace endogenous EB1 function. Acute and reversible blue light-mediated n-EB1 photo-dissociation allows spatially and temporally precise control of intracellular microtubule polymerization dynamics. In addition to demonstrating that neither the GTP cap nor the MT polymerase CKAP5 are sufficient to sustain persistent MT polymerization at physiological growth rates, our data illustrate accurate subcellular control of a freely diffusible, cytoplasmic protein at the second and micrometer scale. This novel design may serve as a template for precise control of many other intracellular protein activities.",

    "abstract": "We report a high-quality assembly of the tilapia genome, a perciform fish important in aquaculture around the world. A homozygous clonal XX female Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was sequenced to 44X coverage using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) SMRT sequencing. Dozens of candidate de novo assemblies were generated and an optimal assembly (contig NG50 of 3.3Mbp) was selected using principal component analysis of likelihood scores calculated from several paired-end sequencing libraries. Comparison of the new assembly to the previous O. niloticus genome assembly reveals that recently duplicated portions of the genome are now well represented. The overall number genes in the new assembly increased by 27.3%, including a 67% increase in pseudogenes. The new tilapia genome assembly correctly represents two recent vasa gene duplication events that have been verified with BAC sequencing. At total of 146Mbp of additional transposable element sequence are now assembled, a large proportion of which are recent insertions. Large centromeric satellite repeats are assembled and annotated in cichlid fish for the first time. Finally, the new assembly identifies the long-range structure of both an ~9Mbp XY sex-determination region on LG1 in O. niloticus, and a ~50Mbp WZ sex-determination region on LG3 in the related species O. aureus. This study highlights the use of long read sequencing to correctly assemble recent duplications and to characterize repeat-filled regions of the genome.",

    "abstract": "Plant resistance to drought has long been thought to be associated with the ability to maintain transpiration and photosynthesis longer during drought, through the opening of stomata. This premise is at the root of most current framework used to assess drought impacts on land plants in vegetation models. We examined this premise by coupling a meta-analysis of functional traits of stomatal response to drought (i.e. the water potential causing stomatal closure,{Psi} close) and embolism resistance (the water potential at the onset of embolism formation,{Psi} 12), with simulations from a soil-plant hydraulic model. We found that{Psi} close and{Psi} 12 were equal (isometric) only for a restricted number of species, but as {Psi}12 decreases, the departure from isometry increases, with stomatal closure occurring far before embolism occurs. For the most drought resistant species ({Psi}12<-4.2 MPa),{Psi} close was remarkably independent of embolism resistance and remained above -4.5 MPa, suggesting the existence of a restrictive boundary by which stomata closure must occur. This pattern was supported by model simulations. Indeed, coordinated decrease in both{Psi} close and{Psi} 12 leads to unsuspected accelerated death under drought for embolism resistant species, in contradiction with observations from drought mortality experiments. Overall our results highlight that most species have similarity in stomatal behavior, and are highly conservative in terms of their water use during drought. The modelling framework presented here provides a baseline to simulate the temporal dynamic leading to mortality under drought by accounting for multiple, measurable traits.",

    "abstract": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of transmitter release probability (Pr) are thought to be triggered by the activation of glutamate receptors. Here, we demonstrate that glutamate release at CA3-CA1 synapses is in fact inhibitory and unnecessary for increases in Pr. Instead, at active presynaptic terminals, postsynaptic depolarization alone can increase Pr by promoting the release of nitric oxide from neuronal dendrites in a manner dependent on L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The release of glutamate, in contrast, decreases Pr by activating presynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDAR). Thus, net changes in Pr are determined by the combined effect of both LTP-promoting and LTD-promoting processes, that is, by the amount of glutamate release and postsynaptic depolarization that accompany presynaptic activity, respectively. Neither of these processes directly depends on the activation of postsynaptic NMDARs. We further show that presynaptic changes can be captured by a simple learning rule, in which the role of presynaptic plasticity is to ensure that the ability for a presynaptic terminal to release glutamate is matched with its ability to predict postsynaptic spiking.",

    "abstract": "Metabarcoding is a promising DNA-based method for identifying airborne pollen from environmental samples with advantages over microscopic methods. This method requires several preparatory steps of the samples, with the extraction protocol being of fundamental importance to obtain an optimal DNA yield. Currently, there is no consensus in sample preparation and DNA extraction, especially for gravimetric pollen samplers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop protocols to process environmental samples for pollen DNA extraction and further metabarcoding analysis, and to assess the efficacy of these protocols for the taxonomic assignment of airborne pollen, collected by gravimetric (Tauber trap) and volumetric samplers (Burkard spore trap). Protocols were tested across an increasing complexity of samples, from single-species pure pollen to environmental samples. A short fragment (about 150 base pair) of chloroplast DNA was amplified by universal primers for plants (trnL). After PCR amplification, amplicons were Sanger-sequenced and taxonomic assignment was accomplished by comparison to a custom-made reference database including chloroplast DNA sequences of 46 plant families, including most of the anemophilous taxa occurring in the study area (Trentino, Italy, Eastern Italian Alps). Using as a benchmark the classical morphological pollen analysis, it emerged that DNA metabarcoding is applicable efficiently across a complexity of samples, provided that sample preparation, DNA extraction and amplification protocols are specifically optimized.",

Methanol fixation allowed us to stabilize and preserve dissociated cells for weeks. By using mixtures of fixed human and mouse cells, we showed that individual transcriptomes could be confidently assigned to one of the two species. Single-cell gene expression from live and fixed samples correlated well with bulk mRNA-seq data. We then applied methanol fixation to transcriptionally profile primary single cells from dissociated complex tissues. Low RNA content cells from Drosophila embryos, as well as mouse hindbrain and cerebellum cells sorted by FACS, were successfully analysed after fixation, storage and single-cell droplet RNA-seq.

While the biosynthetic pathway of MAs is well studied, the mechanism(s) by which these lipids are transported across the cell envelope is(are) much less known. MmpL3, an essential inner membrane (IM) protein, is implicated in MA transport, but its exact function has not been elucidated. It is believed to be the cellular target of several anti-mycobacterial compounds; however, evidence for direct inhibition of MmpL3 activity is also lacking. Here, we establish that MmpL3 is the MA flippase at the IM of mycobacteria, and is the molecular target of BM212, a 1,5-diarylpyrrole compound. We develop assays that selectively access mycolates on the surface of Mycobacterium smegmatis spheroplasts, allowing us to monitor flipping of MAs across the IM. Using these assays, we establish the mechanism-of-action of BM212 as a potent MmpL3 inhibitor, and employ it as a molecular probe to demonstrate the requirement for functional MmpL3 in the transport of MAs across the IM. Finally, we show that BM212 binds MmpL3 directly and inhibits its activity. Our work provides fundamental insights into OM biogenesis and MA transport in mycobacteria. Furthermore, our assays serve as an important platform for accelerating the validation of small molecules that target MmpL3, and their development as future anti-tuberculosis drugs.",

    "abstract": "Decisions are accompanied by a feeling of confidence, i.e., a belief about the decision being correct. Confidence accuracy is critical, notably in high-stakes situations such as medical or financial decisionmaking. Here, we investigated how incentive motivation influences confidence accuracy by combining a perceptual task with a confidence incentivization mechanism. Importantly, by varying the magnitude and valence (gains or losses) of monetary incentives, we orthogonalized their motivational and affective components. Corroborating theories of rational decision-making and motivation, our results first reveal that the motivational value of incentives improves aspects of confidence accuracy. However, in line with a value-confidence interaction hypothesis we further show that the affective value of incentives concurrently biases confidence reports, thus degrading confidence accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that the motivational and affective effects of incentives differentially impact how confidence builds on perceptual evidence. Altogether, these findings may provide new hints about confidence miscalibration in healthy or pathological contexts.",

    "abstract": "1AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWBiofilms improve microbes resistance to a variety of extreme physical and chemical conditions on Earth. The discovery of putative aqueous environments on other planetary bodies such as Mars motivates an interest in understanding the viability of life, and the potential role of biofilms, in previously unexplored geochemical extremes. We investigated the loss of viability of planktonic cells and biofilms of Sphingomonas desiccabilis (a Gram-negative, desiccation resistant, soil crust-forming organism) to simulated Martian brines. These brines were produced from geochemical modelling of past aqueous environments on Mars, and their high sulfate concentrations make them different to most terrestrial brines, although similar briny environments have been found in locations such as the Basque Lakes in Canada or in deep subsurface groundwater systems. Biofilms grown on basaltic scoria were subjected to the simulated martian brines and the viability of cells was measured over time and compared to equivalent planktonic cultures. Crystal violet assay was used to measure how the biomass of the biofilms changed over time in response to the brines. While certain brines were highly hostile to microbial viability, we found that biofilms that were desiccated prior to being treated with brines maintained viability over a longer treatment period when compared to planktonic cells. Our results show that biofilms confer short-term protection to the harsh osmotic, ionic, and acidic conditions of Mars-relevant brines. However, in the most extreme simulated brines, even biofilms eventually lost viability. By demonstrating that biofilms confer protection to conditions that are potentially analogous to current day recurrent slope lineae (thought to be produced by the flow of briny fluids) on Mars, our results show that contaminant biofilm-forming microorganisms may have a greater chance of surviving in so-called  Special Regions on Mars, with implications for planetary protection in missions that aim to explore these regions.",

This immune response process is regulated by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein which is encoded by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. Understanding the binding potential between MHC and peptides can lead to the design of more potent, peptide-based vaccines and immunotherapies for infectious autoimmune diseases.\\n\\nWe apply machine learning techniques from the natural language processing (NLP) domain to address the task of MHC-peptide binding prediction.

We then propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture, name HLA-CNN, for the task of HLA class I-peptide binding prediction. Experimental results show combining the new distributed representation with our HLA-CNN architecture acheives state-of-the-art results in the majority of the latest two Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) weekly automated benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Across the domains of spatial navigation and episodic memory, the hippocampus is thought to play a critical role in disambiguating (pattern separating) representations of overlapping events. However, the mechanisms underlying hippocampal pattern separation are not fully understood. Here, using a naturalistic route-learning paradigm and spatiotemporal pattern analysis of human fMRI data, we found that hippocampal representations of overlapping routes gradually diverged with learning to the point that they became less similar than representations of non-overlapping events. This representational  reversal of the objective route similarity (a) was selective to the hippocampus, (b) only occurred for the specific route segments that were shared across routes, and (c) was predicted by the degree to which individual hippocampal voxels were initially shared across route representations. These findings indicate that event overlap triggers a repulsion of hippocampal representations--a finding that provides critical mechanistic insight into how and why hippocampal representations become separated.",

First, we give volumetric estimates of regions within the anterior and posterior piriform cortex. Second, we estimate the neuronal densities in each of these regions. From these two estimates, we calculate that the mouse piriform contains around half a million neurons equally distributed over the anterior and posterior piriform cortex. Quantitative descriptions such as these are important because they make it possible to construct realistic models and provide a constraint that theories of the olfactory circuit must fulfil. We show how quantitative descriptions can be useful for modelling by using our data to refine and improve earlier models of piriform cortex activity.",

We introduce an analogous system for representing sensations from within the body, called interoception, and demonstrate its relation to regulating peripheral systems in the body, called allostasis. Employing the recently introduced Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding (EPIC) model, we used tract-tracing studies of macaque monkeys, followed by two intrinsic functional magnetic resonance imaging samples (N = 280 and N = 270) to evaluate the existence of an intrinsic allostatic/interoceptive system in the human brain. Another sample (N = 41) allowed us to evaluate the convergent validity of the hypothesized allostatic/interoceptive system by showing that individuals with stronger connectivity between system hubs performed better on an implicit index of interoceptive ability related to autonomic fluctuations. Implications include novel insights for the brains functional architecture, dissolving the artificial boundary between mind and body, and unifying mental and physical illness.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTDynamically unstable polymers capture and move cellular cargos in both bacteria and eukaryotes, but the regulation of their assembly remains poorly understood. Here we describe polymerization of Alp7A, a bacterial Actin-Like Protein (ALP) that segregates the low copy-number plasmid pLS20 in Bacillus subtilis. Purified Alp7A forms dynamically unstable polymers with two critical points: an intrinsic critical concentration (0.6 M), observed when ATP hydrolysis is blocked, and a dynamic critical concentration (10.3 M), observed when ATP hydrolysis occurs. From biochemical and kinetic analysis, the intrinsic critical concentration reflects a balance between filament elongation and shortening, while the dynamic critical concentration reflects a balance between filament nucleation and catastrophic disassembly. Although Alp7A does not form stable polymers at physiological concentrations, rapid nucleation by an accessory factor, Alp7R, decreases the dynamic critical concentration into the physiological range. Intrinsic and dynamic critical concentrations are fundamental parameters that can be used to describe the behavior of all dynamically unstable polymers.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAt present Docker technology has received increasing level of attention throughout the bioinformatics community. However, its implementation details have not yet been mastered by most biologists and applied widely in biological researches. In order to popularizing this technology in the bioinformatics and sufficiently use plenty of public resources of bioinformatics tools (Dockerfile and image of scommunity, officially and privately) in Docker Hub Registry and other Docker sources based on Docker, we introduced full and accurate instance of a bioinformatics workflow based on Docker to analyse and visualize pan-genome and biosynthetic gene clusters of a bacteria in this article, provided the solutions for mining bioinformatics big data from various public biology databases. You could be guided step-by-step through the workflow process from docker file to build up your own images and run an container fast creating an workflow.\\n\\nResultsWe presented a BGDMdocker (bacterial genome data mining docker-based) workflow based on docker. The workflow consists of three integrated toolkits, Prokka v1.11, panX, and antiSMASH3.0. The dependencies were all written in Dockerfile, to build docker image and run container for analysing pan-genome of total 44 Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strains, which were retrieved from public? database. The pan-genome totally includes 172,432 gene, 2,306 Core gene cluster. The visualized pan-genomic data such as alignment, phylogenetic trees, maps mutations within that cluster to the branches of the tree, infers loss and gain of genes on the core-genome phylogeny for each gene cluster were presented. Besides, 997 known (MIBiG database) and 553 unknown (antiSMASH-predicted clusters and Pfam database) genes of biosynthesis gene clusters types and orthologous groups were mined in all strains. This workflow could also be used for other species pan-genome analysis and visualization. The display of visual data can completely duplicated as well as done in this paper. All result data and relevant tools and files can be downloaded from our website with no need to register. The pan-genome and biosynthetic gene clusters analysis and visualization can be fully reusable immediately in different computing platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac and deployed in the cloud), achieved cross platform deployment flexibility, rapid development integrated software package.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationBGDMdocker is available at http://42.96.173.25/bapgd/ and the source code under GPL license is available at https://github.com/cgwyx/debian_prokka_panx_antismash_biodocker.\\n\\nContactchenggongwyx@foxmail.com\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at biorxiv online.",

    "abstract": "Wine is a complex beverage, comprising hundreds of metabolites produced through the action of yeasts and bacteria in fermenting grape must. To ensure a robust and reliable fermentation, most commercial wines are produced via inoculation with commercial strains of the major wine yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, there is a growing trend towards the use of uninoculated or \\\"wild\\\" fermentations, in which the yeasts and bacteria that are naturally associated with the vineyard and winery, perform the fermentation. In doing so, the varied metabolic contributions of the numerous non-Saccharomyces species in this microbial community are thought to impart complexity and desirable taste and aroma attributes to wild ferments in comparison to their inoculated counterparts.\\n\\nIn order the map the microflora of spontaneous fermentation, metagenomic techniques were used to characterize and monitor the progression of fungal species in several wild fermentations. Both amplicon-based ITS phylotyping (meta-barcoding) and shotgun metagenomics were used to assess community structure. While providing a sensitive and highly accurate means of characterizing the wine microbiome, the shotgun metagenomic data also uncovered a significant over-abundance bias in the ITS phylotyping abundance estimations for the common non-Saccharomyces wine yeast genus Metschnikowia.",
