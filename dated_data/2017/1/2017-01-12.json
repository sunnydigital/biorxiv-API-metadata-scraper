    "abstract": "Both species and their interactions are affected by changes that occur at evolutionary time-scales, and these changes shape both ecological communities and their phylogenetic structure. That said, extant ecological community structure is contingent upon random chance, environmental filters, and local effects. It is therefore unclear how much ecological signal local communities should retain. Here we show that, in a host-parasite system where species interactions vary substantially over a continental gradient, the ecological significance of individual interactions is maintained across different scales. Notably, this occurs despite the fact that observed community variation at the local scale frequently tends to weaken or remove community-wide phylogenetic signal. When considered in terms of the interplay between community ecology and coevolutionary theory, our results demonstrate that individual interactions are capable and indeed likely to show a consistent signature of past evolutionary history even when woven into communities that do not.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the dependence of the site frequency spectrum (SFS) on the topological structure of genealogical trees. We show that basic population genetic statistics - for instance estimators of{theta} or neutrality tests such as Tajimas D - can be decomposed into components of waiting times between coalescent events and of tree topology. Our results clarify the relative impact of the two components on these statistics. We provide a rigorous interpretation of positive or negative values of an important class of neutrality tests in terms of the underlying tree shape. In particular, we show that values of Tajimas D and Fay and Wus H depend in a direct way on a peculiar measure of tree balance which is mostly determined by the root balance of the tree. We present a new test for selection in the same class as Fay and Wus H and discuss its interpretation and power. Finally, we determine the trees corresponding to extreme expected values of these neutrality tests and present formulae for these extreme values as a function of sample size and number of segregating sites.",

    "abstract": "Pattern formation during development is a highly dynamic process. In spite of this, few experimental and modelling approaches take into account the explicit time-dependence of the rules governing regulatory systems. We address this problem by studying dynamic morphogen interpretation by the gap gene network in Drosophila melanogaster. Gap genes are involved in segment determination during early embryogenesis. They are activated by maternal morphogen gradients encoded by bicoid (bcd) and caudal (cad). These gradients decay at the same time-scale as the establishment of the antero-posterior gap gene pattern. We use a reverse-engineering approach, based on data-driven regulatory models called gene circuits, to isolate and characterise the explicitly time-dependent effects of changing morphogen concentrations on gap gene regulation. To achieve this, we simulate the system in the presence and absence of dynamic gradient decay. Comparison between these simulations reveals that maternal morphogen decay controls the timing and limits the rate of gap gene expression. In the anterior of the embyro, it affects peak expression and leads to the establishment of smooth spatial boundaries between gap domains. In the posterior of the embryo, it causes a progressive slow-down in the rate of gap domain shifts, which is necessary to correctly position domain boundaries and to stabilise the spatial gap gene expression pattern. We use a newly developed method for the analysis of transient dynamics in non-autonomous (time-variable) systems to understand the regulatory causes of these effects. By providing a rigorous mechanistic explanation for the role of maternal gradient decay in gap gene regulation, our study demonstrates that such analyses are feasible and reveal important aspects of dynamic gene regulation which would have been missed by a traditional steady-state approach. More generally, it highlights the importance of transient dynamics for understanding complex regulatory processes in development.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAnimal development is a highly dynamic process. Biochemical or environmental signals can cause the rules that shape it to change over time. We know little about the effects of such changes. For the sake of simplicity, we usually leave them out of our models and experimental assays. Here, we do exactly the opposite. We characterise precisely those aspects of pattern formation caused by changing signalling inputs to a gene regulatory network, the gap gene system of Drosophila melanogaster. Gap genes are involved in determining the body segments of flies and other insects during early development. Gradients of maternal morphogens activate the expression of the gap genes. These gradients are highly dynamic themselves, as they decay while being read out. We show that this decay controls the peak concentration of gap gene products, produces smooth boundaries of gene expression, and slows down the observed positional shifts of gap domains in the posterior of the embryo, thereby stabilising the spatial pattern. Our analysis demonstrates that the dynamics of gene regulation not only affect the timing, but also the positioning of gene expression. This suggests that we must pay closer attention to transient dynamic aspects of development than is currently the case.",

    "abstract": "Insects determine their body segments in two different ways. Short-germband insects, such as the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, use a molecular clock to establish segments sequentially. In contrast, long-germband insects, such as the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, determine all segments simultaneously through a hierarchical cascade of gene regulation. Gap genes constitute the first layer of the Drosophila segmentation gene hierarchy, downstream of maternal gradients such as that of Caudal (Cad). We use data-driven mathematical modelling and phase space analysis to show that shifting gap domains in the posterior half of the Drosophila embryo are an emergent property of a robust damped oscillator mechanism, suggesting that the regulatory dynamics underlying long- and short-germband segmentation are much more similar than previously thought. In Tribolium, Cad has been proposed to modulate the frequency of the segmentation oscillator. Surprisingly, our simulations and experiments show that the shift rate of posterior gap domains is independent of maternal Cad levels in Drosophila. Our results suggest a novel evolutionary scenario for the short- to long-germband transition, and help explain why this transition occurred convergently multiple times during the radiation of the holometabolan insects.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDifferent insect species exhibit one of two distinct modes of determining their body segments during development: they either use a molecular oscillator to position segments sequentially, or they generate segments simultaneously through a hierarchical gene-regulatory cascade. The sequential mode is ancestral, while the simultaneous mode has been derived from it independently several times during evolution. In this paper, we present evidence which suggests that simultaneous segmentation also involves an oscillator in the posterior of the embryo of the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This surprising result indicates that both modes of segment determination are much more similar than previously thought. Such similarity provides an important step towards explaining the frequent evolutionary transitions between sequential and simultaneous segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Myosins play countless critical roles in the cell, each requiring it to be activated at a specific location and time. To control myosin VI with this specificity, we created a novel optogenetic tool for activating myosin VI by fusing the light-sensitive Avena sativa phototropin1 LOV2 domain to a peptide from Dab2 (LOVDab), a myosin VI cargo protein. Our approach harnesses the native targeting and activation mechanism of myosin VI, allowing direct inferences on myosin VI function. LOVDab robustly recruits human full length myosin VI to various organelles in vivo and hinders peroxisome motion in a light-controllable manner. LOVDab also activates myosin VI in an in vitro gliding filament assay. Our data suggest that protein and lipid cargoes cooperate to activate myosin VI, allowing myosin VI to integrate Ca2+, lipid, and protein cargo signals in the cell to deploy in a site-specific manner.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMyosins are a broad class of motor proteins that generate force on actin filaments and fulfill contractile, transport, and anchoring roles. Myosin VI, the only myosin to walk toward the pointed end of actin filaments, is implicated in cancer metastasis and deafness. Intriguingly, myosin VI may play both transport and anchoring roles, depending upon where it is activated in the cell. Here we develop an optogenetic tool for studying myosin VI activation with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our approach photoactivates unmodified myosin VI through its native cargo pathway, enabling investigation of motor function and activation partners with minimal perturbation. This approach allows us to detect how and where myosin VI integrates multiple protein and second messenger signals to activate.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary history of vertebrates is marked by three ancient whole-genome duplications: two successive rounds in the ancestor of vertebrates, and a third one specific to teleost fishes. Biased loss of most duplicates enriched the genome for specific genes, such as slow evolving genes, but this selective retention process is not well understood. To understand what drives the long-term preservation of duplicate genes, we characterized duplicated genes in terms of their expression patterns. We used a new method of expression enrichment analysis, TopAnat, applied to in situ hybridization data from thousands of genes from zebrafish and mouse. We showed that the presence of expression in the nervous system is a good predictor of a higher rate of retention of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Further analyses suggest that purifying selection against the toxic effects of misfolded or misinteracting proteins, which is particularly strong in non-renewing neural tissues, likely constrains the evolution of coding sequences of nervous system genes, leading indirectly to the preservation of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Whole-genome duplications thus greatly contributed to the expansion of the toolkit of genes available for the evolution of profound novelties of the nervous system at the base of the vertebrate radiation.",

Experimental Hut Trials (EHTs) mostly focus on two main indicators (i.e. mortality and blood feeding reduction) that serve as efficacy criteria to obtain WHO interim recommendation. However, several other outputs that rely on counts of vectors collected in the huts are neglected although they can give useful information about vectors behavior and personal protection provided by ITNs. In particular, EHTs allow to measure the deterrent effect and personal protection of ITNs.\\n\\nTo provide a better assessment of ITNs efficacy, we performed a retrospective analysis of the deterrence and the personal protection against malaria transmission for 12 unwashed and 13 washed ITNs evaluated through EHTs conducted in West Africa.\\n\\nA significant deterrent effect was shown for six of the 12 unwashed ITNs tested. When washed 20 times, only three ITNs had significant deterrent effect (Rate Ratios (RR)<1; p<0.05) and three showed an apparent \\\"attractiveness\\\" (RR>1; p<0.01). When compared to the untreated net, all unwashed ITNs showed lower number of blood-fed Anopheles indicating a significant personal protection (RR<1, p<0.05).

    "abstract": "Subsurface groundwater-surface water mixing zones (hyporheic zones) have enhanced biogeochemical activity, but assembly processes governing subsurface microbiomes remain a critical uncertainty in understanding hyporheic biogeochemistry. To address this obstacle, we investigated (a) biogeographical patterns in attached and waterborne microbiomes across three hydrologically-connected, physicochemically-distinct zones (inland hyporheic, nearshore hyporheic, and river); (b) assembly processes that generated these patterns; (c) groups of organisms that corresponded to deterministic changes in the environment; and (d) correlations between these groups and hyporheic metabolism. All microbiomes remained dissimilar through time, but consistent presence of similar taxa suggested dispersal and/or common selective pressures among zones. Further, we demonstrated a pronounced impact of deterministic assembly in all microbiomes as well as seasonal shifts from heterotrophic to autotrophic microorganisms associated with increases in groundwater discharge. The abundance of one statistical cluster of organisms increased with active biomass and respiration, revealing organisms that may strongly influence hyporheic biogeochemistry. Based on our results, we propose a conceptualization of hyporheic zone metabolism in which increased organic carbon concentrations during surface water intrusion support heterotrophy, which succumbs to autotrophy under groundwater discharge. These results provide new opportunities to enhance microbially-explicit ecosystem models describing hyporheic zone biogeochemistry and its influence over riverine ecosystem function.\\n\\nOriginality-Significance StatementSubsurface zones of groundwater and surface water mixing (hyporheic zones) are hotspots of biogeochemical activity and strongly influence carbon, nutrient and contaminant dynamics within riverine ecosystems. Hyporheic zone microbiomes are responsible for up to 95% of riverine ecosystem respiration, yet the ecology of these microbiomes remains poorly understood. While significant progress is being made in the development of microbially-explicit ecosystem models, poor understanding of hyporheic zone microbial ecology impedes development of such models in this critical zone. To fill the knowledge gap, we present a comprehensive analysis of biogeographical patterns in hyporheic microbiomes as well as the ecological processes that govern their composition and function through space and time. Despite pronounced hydrologic connectivity throughout the hyporheic zone--and thus a strong potential for dispersal--we find that ecological selection deterministically governs microbiome composition within local environments, and we identify specific groups of organisms that correspond to seasonal changes in hydrology. Based on our results, we propose a conceptual model for hyporheic zone metabolism in which comparatively high-organic C conditions during surface water intrusion into the hyporheic zone support heterotrophic metabolisms that succumb to autotrophy during time periods of groundwater discharge. These results provide new opportunities to develop microbially-explicit ecosystem models that incorporate the hyporheic zone and its influence over riverine ecosystem function.",

However, to what extent immunoediting is shaping the cancer genome is still a matter of debate. Moreover, the impact of cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint blockers on modulating immunoediting remains largely unexplored. Here we elucidated the impact of evolutionary and immune-related forces on editing the tumor in a mouse model of colorectal cancer (CRC). We first show that MC38 cell line is a valid model for hypermutated and microsatellite-unstable (MSI) CRC. Analyses of longitudinal samples of wild type and immunodeficient RAG1 knockout mice transplanted with MC38 cells revealed that upregulation of checkpoint molecules and infiltration of Tregs are the major tumor escape mechanisms. Strikingly, the impact of neutral evolution on sculpting the tumor outweighed immunoediting. Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway potentiated immunoediting and rendered tumors more homogeneous in the MC38 model. The immunoediting effects were less pronounced in a nonhypermutated/MSI- model CT26. Our study demonstrates that neutral evolution is the major force that sculpts the tumor, and that checkpoint blockade effectively enforces T cell dependent immunoselective pressure in a hypermutated/MSI model of CRC.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYTo capture the transcriptional dynamics within proliferating cells, methods to differentiate nascent transcription from pre-existing mRNAs are desired. One approach is to label newly synthesized mRNA transcripts in vivo through the incorporation of modified pyrimidines. However, the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, is incapable of pyrimidine salvage for mRNA biogenesis. To capture cellular mRNA dynamics during Plasmodium development, we have engineered parasites that can salvage pyrimidines through the expression of a single bifunctional yeast fusion gene, cytosine deaminase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (FCU). We show that expression of FCU allows for the direct incorporation of thiol-modified pyrimidines into nascent mRNAs. Using developmental stage-specific promoters to express FCU-GFP enables the biosynthetic capture and in-depth analysis of mRNA dynamics from subpopulations of cells undergoing differentiation. We demonstrate the utility of this method by examining the transcriptional dynamics of the sexual gametocyte stage transition, a process that is essential to malaria transmission between hosts. We find that sexual stage commitment is governed by transcriptional reprogramming and the stabilization of a subset of essential gametocyte transcripts. This new method for biosynthetic labeling of Plasmodium mRNAs is incredibly versatile and can be used to measure transcriptional dynamics at any stage of parasite development, and thiol-modified RNAs will allow for future applications to measure RNA-protein interactions in the malaria parasite.",

While it is well-known that negative (positive) feedback reduces (increases) intrinsic noise, we give a precise result on the resulting fluctuations in protein numbers. The technique we use is an extension of the Langevin approximation and is an application of a central limit theorem under stochastic averaging for Markov jump processes (Kang, Kurtz and Popovic, 2014).

    "abstract": "RNA molecules fold cotranscriptionally as they emerge from RNA polymerase. Cotranscriptional folding is an important process for proper RNA structure formation as the order of folding can determine an RNA molecules structure, and thus its functional properties. Despite its fundamental importance, the experimental study of RNA cotranscriptional folding has been limited by the lack of easily approachable methods that can interrogate nascent RNA structures at nucleotide resolution during transcription. We previously developed cotranscriptional selective 2-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-seq) to simultaneously probe all of the intermediate structures an RNA molecule transitions through during transcription elongation. Here, we improve the broad applicability of cotranscriptional SHAPE-Seq by developing a sequence-independent streptavidin roadblocking strategy to simplify the preparation of roadblocking transcription templates. We determine the fundamental properties of streptavidin roadblocks and show that randomly distributed streptavidin roadblocks can be used in cotranscriptional SHAPE-Seq experiments to measure the Bacillus cereus crcB fluoride riboswitch folding pathway. Comparison of EcoRIE111Q and streptavidin roadblocks in cotranscriptional SHAPE-Seq data shows that both strategies identify the same RNA structural transitions related to the riboswitch decision-making process. Finally, we propose guidelines to leverage the complementary strengths of each transcription roadblock for use in studying cotranscriptional folding.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila, the receptor tyrosine kinase Alk and its ligand Jeb are required to drive founder cell (FC) specification in the visceral mesoderm (VM). Alk-signalling activates downstream MAPK/ERK- and PI3K-pathways in human and Drosophila but little is known about immediate downstream signalling events. Here we report that the scaffolding protein Cnk interacts directly with Alk via a novel c-terminal binding motif. Cnk is required for Alk-signalling as ectopic expression of the minimal interaction motif as well as loss of maternal and zygotic cnk blocks visceral FC-formation, resembling the phenotype of jeb and Alk mutants. We also show that the Cnk-interactor Aveugle/Hyphen (Ave/HYP) is critical, while the (pseudo-) kinase Ksr is not required for Alk-signalling in the developing VM. Taken together, Cnk and Ave represent the first molecules downstream of Alk whose loss genocopies the lack of visceral FC-specification of Alk and jeb mutants indicating an essential role in Alk-signalling.",

We analyzed pure-culture E. coli and P. fluorescens, as well as a low-diversity mixed community sample from hydraulic fracturing produced water. Both closed and open reference operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking failed, necessitating the direct use of sequences without OTU picking. The Ribosomal Database Project classifier against the Green Genes database was found to be the optimal annotation approach, with average pure-culture annotation accuracies of 93.8% and 82.0% at the phyla and genus levels, respectively. Comparative analysis of an environmental sample using Nanopore and Illumina MiSeq sequencing identified high taxonomic similarity when using a weighted metric (Bray-Curtis), and significantly reduced similarity when using an unweighted metric (Jaccard). These results highlight the great potential of Nanopore sequencing to analyze broad microbial community trends, and the challenge of applying Nanopore sequencing to discern rare taxa in mixed microbial communities. Finally, we observed that between-run carryover following washes on the same flowcell accounted for >10% of sequence reads, necessitating future development to either prevent carryover or filter sequences of interest (e.g. barcoding).",

    "abstract": "Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are iconic Australian marsupials currently threatened by several processes. Infectious reproductive tract disease, caused by Chlamydia pecorum, and koala retrovirus infection are considered key drivers of population decline. The clinical sign of  wet bottom, a staining of the rump associated with urinary incontinence, is often caused by chlamydial urogenital tract infections. However, wet bottom has been recorded in koalas free of C. pecorum, suggesting other causative agents in those individuals. Current understanding of the bacterial community of the koala urogenital tract is limited. We used 16S rRNA diversity profiling to investigate the microbiome of the urogenital tract of ten female koalas. This was to produce baseline data on the female koala urogenital tract microbiome, and to undertake preliminary investigations of potential causative agents of wet bottom, other than C. pecorum. Five urogenital samples were processed from koalas presenting with wet bottom and five were clinically normal. We detected thirteen phyla across the ten samples, with Firmicutes occurring at the highest relative abundance (77.6%). The order Lactobacillales, within the Firmicutes, comprised 70.3% of the reads from all samples. After normalising reads using DESeq2 and testing for significant differences (P < 0.05), there were 25 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) more commonly found in one group over the other. The families Aerococcaceae and Tissierellaceae both had four significantly differentially abundant OTUs. These four Tissierellaceae OTUs were all significantly more abundant in koalas with wet bottom.\\n\\nImportanceThis study provides an essential foundation for future investigations of both the normal microflora of the koala urogenital tract, and better understanding of the causes of koala urogenital tract disease. Koalas in the states of Queensland and New South Wales are currently undergoing decline, and have been classified as vulnerable populations. Urogenital tract disease is a leading cause of hospital admissions in these states, yet previously little was known of the normal flora of this site. Wet bottom is a clinical sign of urogenital tract disease, which is often assumed to be caused by C. pecorum and treated accordingly. Our research highlights that other organisms may be causing wet bottom, and these potential aetiological agents need to be further investigated to fully address the problems this species faces.",

To see whether similar phenomena could be observed in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, we challenged drug-na{iota}ve nematodes with a chronic low (0.01 mM) and high (1 mM) nicotine concentration for 55 h (from hatching to adulthood). After that, we recorded changes in their behavior in a nicotine gradient, where they could choose a desired nicotine concentration. By using a combination of behavioral and morphometric methods, we found that both nicotine and food modulate worm behavior. In the presence of food the nematodes adapted to the low nicotine concentration, when placed in the gradient, chose a similar nicotine concentration like C. elegans adapted to the high nicotine concentration. However, in the absence of food, the nematodes adapted to the low nicotine concentration, when placed in the gradient of this alkaloid, chose a similar nicotine concentration like naive worms. The nematodes growing up in the presence of high concentrations of nicotine had a statistically smaller body size, compared to the control condition, and the presence of food did not cause any enhanced slowing movement. These results provide a platform for more detailed molecular and cellular studies of nicotine addiction and food intake in this model organism.",

    "abstract": "Interhemispheric functional connectivity abnormalities are often reported in autism and it is thus not surprising that structural defects of the corpus callosum (CC) are consistently found using both traditional MRI and DTI techniques. Past DTI studies however, have subdivided the CC into 2 or 3 segments without regard for where fibers may project to within the cortex, thus placing limitations on our ability to understand the nature, timing and neurobehavioral impact of early CC abnormalities in autism. Leveraging a unique cohort of 97 toddlers (68 autism; 29 typical) we utilized a novel technique that identified seven CC tracts according to their cortical projections. Results revealed that younger (<2.5 years old), but not older toddlers with autism exhibited abnormally low mean, radial, and axial diffusivity values in the CC tracts connecting the occipital lobes and the temporal lobes. Fractional anisotropy and the cross sectional area of the temporal CC tract were significantly larger in young toddlers with autism. These findings indicate that water diffusion is more restricted and unidirectional in the temporal CC tract of young toddlers who develop autism. Such results may be explained by a potential overabundance of small caliber axons generated by excessive prenatal neural proliferation as proposed by previous genetic, animal model, and postmortem studies of autism. Furthermore, early diffusion measures in the temporal CC tract of the young toddlers were correlated with outcome measures of autism severity at later ages. These findings regarding the potential nature, timing, and location of early CC abnormalities in autism add to accumulating evidence, which suggests that altered inter-hemispheric connectivity, particularly across the temporal lobes, is a hallmark of the disorder.",

In this study, we built a model of U1 snRNA over-expression in a rat cell line. By comparing the gene expression profiles of U1 snRNA over-expressed cells with those of their controls using the microarray experiments, 916 genes or loci were identified significantly differentially expressed. These 595 up-regulated genes and 321 down-regulated genes were further analyzed using the annotations from the GO terms and the KEGG database. As a result, three of 12 enriched pathways are well-known cancer pathways, while nine of them were associated to cancers in previous studies. The further analysis of 73 genes involved in 12 pathways suggests that U1 snRNA regulates cancer gene expression. The microarray data with ID GSE84304 is available in the NCBI GEO database.",

In this article, our mathematical modeling study demonstrates that the bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) driven differential differentiation dynamics of NSC's in central and peripheral nervous systems essentially function through two distinct bi-stable switches that are mutually interconnected. Stochastic simulations of the model reveal that the mixed population originates due to the existence of these bistable switching regulations while the maintenance of such mixed states depends on the level of stochastic fluctuations of the system. Importantly, the model predicts that by individually altering the expression level of key regulatory proteins, the NSC's can be converted entirely to a preferred phenotype for BMP2 doses that earlier resulted into mixed population. Our findings show that efficient neuronal regeneration can be achieved by systematically maneuvering the differentiation dynamics.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryUnraveling the differential dynamical origin, maintenance and escape route of mixed population in the midst of developmental fate commitment in central and peripheral nervous systems",

We sought to analyze the global splicing regulatory network of CELF2 in human T cells, a well-studied splicing regulator critical to T cell development and function. By integrating high-throughput sequencing data for binding and splicing quantification with sequence features and probabilistic splicing code models, we find evidence of splicing antagonism between CELF2 and the RBFOX family of splicing factors. We validate this functional antagonism through knockdown and overexpression experiments in human cells and find CELF2 represses RBFOX2 mRNA and protein levels. Because both families of proteins have been implicated in the development and maintenance of neuronal, muscle, and heart tissues, we analyzed publicly available data in these systems. Our analysis suggests global, antagonistic co-regulation of splicing by the CELF and RBFOX proteins in mouse muscle and heart in several physiologically relevant targets including proteins involved in calcium signaling and members of the MEF2 family of transcription factors. Importantly, a number of these co-regulated events are aberrantly spliced in mouse models and human patients with diseases that affect these tissues including heart failure, diabetes, or myotonic dystrophy. Finally, analysis of exons regulated by ancient CELF family homologs in chicken, and Drosophila suggests this antagonism is conserved through evolution.",

However the majority of these polypeptides are partially translated or inactive since the signal from firefly luciferase (Fluc) translated in PURE is only ~2/3rd of that measured using the S30 crude extract system. Both of the two systems suffer from low ribosome recycling efficiency when translating proteins from 90 kD to 220 kD. A systematic fed-batch analysis of PURE shows replenishment of 6 small molecule substrates individually or in combination prior to energy depletion increased Fluc protein yield by ~1.5 to ~2-fold, while accumulation of inorganic phosphate contributes to reaction termination. Additionally, while adding EF-P to PURE reduced total protein translated, it also increased the fraction of active product and reduced partial translated product probably by slowing down the translation process. Finally, ArfA, rather than YaeJ or PrfH, helped reduce ribosome stalling when translating Fluc and improved system productivity in a template-dependent fashion.",

We apply the method to high-resolution resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from medial temporal lobe regions of interest of a single healthy individual measured repeated times over a year and a half.\\n\\nResultsThe FGES algorithm recovered subsets of voxels within larger medial temporal lobe ROIs of entorhinal cortex and hippocampus subfields that show spatially consistency across different scanning sessions, and are statistically significant under tests that validate the role of these subsets as main drivers of effective connectivity between hippocampal regions of interest.\\n\\nComparison with Existing MethodsIn contrast to standard functional connectivity methods, the FGES algorithm is robust against false positive connections produced by transitive closures of adjacencies (correlation methods) and common effect conditioning (Markov random field methods).\\n\\nConclusionsThe FGES algorithm allows for identification of communication subsets of voxels driving the connectivity between regions of interest, recovering valuable anatomical and functional information that is lost when ROIs are aggregated. The FGES algorithm is specially suited for voxelwise connectivity research, given its short running time and scalability to big data problems.",

    "abstract": "The locations of chromatin loops in Drosophila were determined by Hi-C (chemical cross-linking, restriction digestion, ligation, and high-throughput DNA sequencing). Whereas most loop boundaries or \\\"anchors\\\" are associated with CTCF protein in mammals, loop anchors in Drosophila were found most often in association with the polycomb group (PcG) protein Polycomb (Pc), a subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1). Loops were frequently located within domains of PcG-repressed chromatin. Promoters located at PRC1 loop anchors regulate some of the most important developmental genes and are less likely to be expressed than those not at PRC1 loop anchors. Although DNA looping has most commonly been associated with enhancer-promoter communication, our results indicate that loops are also associated with gene repression.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are macromolecules that bind to cis-regulatory specific sub-regions of DNA promoters and initiate transcription. Finding the exact location of these binding sites (aka motifs) is important in a variety of domains such as drug design and development. To address this need, several in vivo and in vitro techniques have been developed so far that try to characterize and predict the binding specificity of a protein to different DNA loci. The major problem with these techniques is that they are not accurate enough in prediction of the binding affinity and characterization of the corresponding motifs. As a result, downstream analysis is required to uncover the locations where proteins of interest bind. Here, we propose DeeperBind, a long short term recurrent convolutional network for prediction of protein binding specificities with respect to DNA probes. DeeperBind can model the positional dynamics of probe sequences and hence reckons with the contributions made by individual sub-regions in DNA sequences, in an effective way. Moreover, it can be trained and tested on datasets containing varying-length sequences. We apply our pipeline to the datasets derived from protein binding microarrays (PBMs), an in-vitro high-throughput technology for quantification of protein-DNA binding preferences, and present promising results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most accurate pipeline that can predict binding specificities of DNA sequences from the data produced by high-throughput technologies through utilization of the power of deep learning for feature generation and positional dynamics modeling.",

    "abstract": "Heavy metal contamination is a serious issue in many post-mining regions around the world. Kabwe town, Zambia, is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world, where high lead (Pb) levels have been reported in soils, plants, animals and human blood. Multidisciplinary approaches are critically needed to understand the current situation and to remediate the polluted area. In the current research, a large-scale preliminary field survey was performed to understand the current situation in Kabwe and to plan future mitigation approaches. Three aspects were mainly observed; 1) plant communities during the dry season in Kabwe city, 2) spectral images of the land surfaces in various locations in Kabwe and 3) Pb concentrations in soils and water. Overall, >15 different plant species were observed and many of them maintained their green colour even during the dry season. Some tree species, for example, Caesalpiniaceae and Fabaceae families may be utilised as phytostabilization approaches although their impacts on the soil Pb mobility should be further studied. For the spectral images, we used a handmade portable spectrometer, and our obtained spectral images showed typical curves observed from soils. These data may be used to understand the distribution of different soil types in this area, using aboveground images such as satellite images. For Pb concentrations in soils, extremely high total Pb levels (>1,000 ppm) was observed only within 2 km from the mining site. There was a weak but a positive correlation between the total and soluble Pb thus further study should also focus on the mobility of Pb from soils to plant ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The adult mammalian kidney has a complex, highly-branched collecting duct epithelium that arises as a ureteric bud sidebranch from an epithelial tube known as the nephric duct. Subsequent branching of the ureteric bud to form the collecting duct tree is regulated by subcellular interactions between the epithelium and a population of mesenchymal cells that surround the tips of outgrowing branches. The mesenchymal cells produce glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), that binds with RET receptors on the surface of the epithelial cells to stimulate several subcellular pathways in the epithelium. Such interactions are known to be a prerequisite for normal branching development, although competing theories exist for their role in morphogenesis. Here we introduce the first agent-based model of ex vivo kidney uretic branching. Through comparison with experimental data, we show that growth factor-regulated growth mechanisms can explain early epithelial cell branching, but only if epithelial cell division depends in a switch-like way on the local growth factor concentration; cell division occurring only if the driving growth factor level exceeds a threshold. We also show how a recently-developed method, \\\"Approximate Approximate Bayesian Computation\\\", can be used to infer key model parameters, and reveal the dependency between the parameters controlling a growth factor-dependent growth switch. These results are consistent with a requirement for signals controlling proliferation and chemotaxis, both of which are previously identified roles for GDNF.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA number of important congenital disorders arise due to incomplete development of the mammalian kidney. Elucidating the cause of these conditions requires an understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to kidney morphogenesis. Whilst experimental work has suggested several candidate mechanisms, their importance is still not well understood. Here we develop a computational model of kidney morphogenesis at the individual cell level to compare these different hypotheses. Guided by existing experimental evidence we propose that a generic growth factor, that we term \\\"GDNF\\\", produced from the mesenchyme surrounding the epithelium, can drive a number of cellular responses. Simulations of our agent-based model reveal that diffusion of GDNF, coupled with GDNF-stimulated epithelial cell division, can generate the branching patterns seen in ex vivo kidney explant experiments. We also find that branching depends on the sensitivity of cell proliferation to changes in GDNF levels. In particular our model only generates realistic branching when there is significant variation in GDNF levels along the boundary of the epithelium, and most cells divide only if the local concentration of GDNF exceeds a threshold value. We conclude that feedback between mesenchymal cells that produce GDNF, and epithelial cells that consume it, is vital for normal kidney organogenesis.",
