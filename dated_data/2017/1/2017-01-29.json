    "abstract": "BackgroundSpiral cleavage is a remarkably conserved pattern of embryogenesis present in animals of the clade Spiralia, such as annelids, molluscs, flatworms and nemerteans. However, not all spiralians display spiral cleavage. Recent phylogenies suggest that the spiral arrangement of embryonic blastomeres is an ancestral trait for the Spiralia and that it was secondarily modified in several spiralian lineages, such as gastrotrichs, brachiopods and bryozoans. To better understand the evolution of cleavage patterns in relation to blastomere fate maps and embryonic gene expression, we describe the cell lineage and molecular patterning in the embryogenesis of the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea.\\n\\nResultsM. membranacea develops through a unique stereotypic cleavage pattern with biradial symmetry and an embryo organized in identical quadrants with synchronous cell divisions. The quadrant identities are established as early as the 28-cell stage, when one vegetal blastomere (3D) activates the MAPK pathway, marking the future posterior region of the larva. Cells from this posterior quadrant divide asynchronously in subsequent stages leading to the morphological differentiation between quadrants. The first quartet of M. membranacea gives rise to the apical organ and ciliated band, the second and third quartet forms the oral/anal ectoderm, the fourth quartet the mesoderm and the vegetal blastomeres form the endoderm. We found that the early embryonic organization and the fate map of these early blastomeres in the bryozoan embryo are similar to a typical spiral-cleaving embryo. Furthermore we observe that correspondent blastomeres between the bryozoan and spiral-cleaving embryos share similar molecular identities, as revealed by the activity of MAPK and the expression of otx and foxa. The development of M. membranacea mainly differs from spiral-cleaving embryos in the downstream portions of the cell lineage, and in the origin of the mesoderm, which is formed by multiple fourth quartet blastomeres.\\n\\nConclusionsThe similarity between the fate map of M. membranacea and spiral-cleaving embryos indicates that the cleavage geometry of the bryozoan evolved decoupled from other spiralian developmental traits. In this case, the blastomere fates remained evolutionarily conserved despite the drastic modification in the cleavage pattern from spiral to biradial. These findings suggest that blastomere fates of spiral-cleaving embryos might not be linked to the stereotypic spiral cleavage pattern, but depend on other factors, such as the underlying molecular patterning. Our comparative analysis on the bryozoan reveals yet another facet of how early development evolves and helps to shed some light into the developmental diversity of spiralians.",

    "abstract": "The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is the primary source for post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Though potentially highly useful, the database reflects reporting biases, stimulated reporting, and suffers from lack of standardization and the use of multiple drug synonyms. These biases can suggest adverse drug reactions (ADRs) where none exist, and can obscure others that do exist. To decrease the noise in FAERS, and to reinforce important associations, we mapped over 750,000 drug identifiers in FAERS to the normalized chemical structures of their ingredients. This illuminated associations that would not otherwise be apparent, and also allowed a time-resolved analysis of ADR reporting. It also revealed similarities between drugs and adverse events across therapeutic classes, enabling unbiased classification of adverse events, indications, and drugs with similar clinical profiles. For instance, comparison of two selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, celecoxib and rofecoxib finds distinctive FAERS profiles after time-resolved analysis. We also investigated key idiosyncrasies, such as confusion between drug indications and drug ADRs, which can tar a drug treating a life-threatening disease, like thalidomides use against myeloma, with a deadly ADR that is likely the result of the disease itself, multiplications of the same report, which unjustifiably increases its apparent importance, and the correlation of reported ADRs with public events, regulatory announcements, and with publications. Comparing the pharmacological, pharmacokinetic, and clinical ADR profiles of methylphenidate, aripiprazole and risperidone, and of kinase drugs targeting the VEGF receptor (VEGF-R2), demonstrates how underlying molecular mechanisms can emerge from ADR co-analysis. The precautions and methods we describe may enable investigators to avoid confounding chemistry-based associations and reporting biases in FAERS, and illustrate how comparative analysis of ADRs can reveal underlaying mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to the plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the world. In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). The portability of these applications (BIDS Apps) is achieved by using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in one convenient package. BIDS Apps run on all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness richness of the BIDS standard they require little manual user input. Previous containerized data processing solutions were limited to single user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High Performance Computing systems. BIDS Apps overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use BIDS Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging algorithms.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive way to measure human brain structure and activity that has been used for over 25 years. There are thousands MRI studies performed every year generating a substantial amount of data. At the same time, many new data analysis methods are being developed every year. The potential of using new analysis methods on the variety of existing and newly acquired data is hindered by difficulties in software deployment and lack of support for standardized input data. Here we propose to use container technology to make deployment of a wide range of data analysis techniques easy. In addition, we adapt the existing data analysis tools to interface with data organized in a standardized way. We hope that this approach will enable researchers to access a wider range of methods when analyzing their data which will lead to accelerated progress in human neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "The recent global dissemination of Chikungunya and Zika has fostered public health concern worldwide. To better understand the drivers of transmission of these two arboviral diseases, we propose a joint analysis of Chikungunya and Zika epidemics in the same territories, taking into account the common epidemiological features of the epidemics: transmitted by the same vector, in the same environments, and observed by the same surveillance systems. We analyse eighteen outbreaks in French Polynesia and the French West Indies using a hierarchical time-dependent SIR model accounting for the effect of virus, location and weather on transmission, and based on a disease specific serial interval. We show that Chikungunya and Zika have similar transmission potential in the same territories (transmissibility ratio between Zika and Chikungunya of 1.04 [95% credible interval: 0.97; 1.13]), but that detection and reporting rates were different (around 19% for Zika and 40% for Chikungunya). Temperature variations between 22{degrees}C and 29{degrees}C did not alter transmission, but increased precipitation showed a dual effect, first reducing transmission after a two-week delay, then increasing it around five weeks later. The present study provides valuable information for risk assessment and introduces a modelling framework for the comparative analysis of arboviral infections that can be extended to other viruses and territories.",

They have considerable potential for applications throughout synthetic biology and bio-manufacturing as they are able to sense a wide range of small molecules and regulate gene expression in response. Despite over a decade of research they have yet to reach this considerable potential as they cannot yet be treated as modular components. This is due to several limitations including sensitivity to changes in genetic context, low tunability, and variability in performance. To overcome the associated difficulties with riboswitches, we have designed and introduced a novel genetic element called a Ribo-attenuator in Bacteria. This genetic element allows for predictable tuning, insulation from contextual changes, and a reduction in expression variation. Ribo-attenuators allow riboswitches to be treated as truly modular and tunable components, and thus increases their reliability for a wide range of applications.",

    "abstract": "Carbon fixation in cyanobacteria makes a major contribution to the global carbon cycle. The cyanobacterial carboxysome is a proteinaceous microcompartment that protects and concentrates the carbon-fixing enzyme RuBisCO in a paracrystalline lattice, making it possible for these organisms to fix CO2 from the atmosphere. The protein responsible for the organization of this lattice in beta-type carboxysomes of the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, CcmM, occurs in two isoforms thought to localize differentially within the carboxysome matrix. Here we use widefield timelapse and 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to study the recruitment and localization of these two isoforms. We demonstrate that this super-resolution technique is capable of successfully resolving the outer protein shell of the carboxysome from its internal cargo. We develop an automated analysis pipeline to analyze and quantify 3D-SIM images and generate a population level description of carboxysome shell protein, RuBisCO, and CcmM isoform localization. We find that both CcmM isoforms colocalize in space and time, prompting a revised model of the internal arrangement of the beta carboxysome.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) can be developed by computational approaches that infer regulator-target gene interactions from transcriptional assays. Successful algorithms that generate predictive, accurate TRNs enable the identification of regulator-target relationships in conditions where experimentally determining regulatory interactions is a challenge. Improving the ability of TRNs to successfully predict known regulator-target relationships in model species will enhance confidence in applying these approaches to determine regulator-target interactions in non-model species where experimental validation is challenging. Many transcriptional profiling experiments are performed across multiple time points; therefore we sought to improve regulator-target predictions by adjusting how time is incorporated into the network. We created ExRANGES, which incorporates Expression in a Rate-Normalized GEne Specific manner that adjusts how expression data is provided to the network algorithm. We tested this on a two different network construction approaches and found that ExRANGES prioritizes targets differently than traditional expression and improves the ability of these networks to accurately predict known regulator targets. ExRANGES improved the ability to correctly identify targets of transcription factors in large data sets in four different model systems: mouse, human, Arabidopsis, and yeast. Finally, we examined the performance of ExRANGES on a small data set from field-grown Oryza sativa and found that it also improved the ability to identify known targets even with a limited data set.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTo understand how organisms can turn a collection of genes into a physiological response, we need to understand how certain genes are turned on and off. In model organisms, the ability to identify direct targets of transcription factors via ChIP-Seq in a high-throughput manner has advanced our understanding of transcriptional regulatory networks and how organisms regulate gene expression. However, for non-model organisms, it remains a challenge to identify TF-target relationships through experimental approaches such as ChIP-Seq. Without this information, the ability to understand regulatory control is limited. Computational approaches to identify regulator-target relationships in silico from easily attainable transcriptional data offer a solution. Several approaches exist for identifying gene regulatory networks, including many that take advantage of time series data. Most of these approaches weigh the relationship between regulators and putative targets at all time points equally. However, many regulators may control a single target in response to different inputs. In our approach, we focus on the association between regulators and targets primarily at times when there is a significant change in expression. ExRANGES essentially weights the expression value of each time point by the slope change after that time point so that relationships between regulators and targets are emphasized at the time points when the transcript levels are changing. This change in input into network identification algorithms improves the ability to predict regulator-target interactions and could be applied to many different algorithms We hope this improvement will increase the ability to identify regulators of interest in non-model species.",

Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) has provided open access to the transcriptome of MCF-7, a breast cancer cell line that has provided significant therapeutic advancement in breast cancer research since the 1970s. PacBio sequencing generates much longer reads compared to second-generation sequencing technologies, with a trade-off of lower throughput, higher error rate and more cost per base. Here, this transcriptome was analyzed using the YeATS pipeline, with additionally introduced kmer based algorithms, reducing computational times to a few hours on a simple workstation. Out of ~300 transcripts that have no match in both RefSeq and GENCODE, ~250 are absent in the transcriptomes of the heart, liver and brain, also provided by PacBio. Also, ~200 transcripts are absent in a recent catalogue of un-annotated long non-coding RNAs from 6,503 samples (~43 Terabases of sequence data) [1], and among 2,556 novel transcripts reported in an experimental workflow RACE-Seq [2]. 65 transcripts have >100 amino acid open reading frames, and have the potential of being protein coding genes. ORF based annotation also identified few bacterial transcripts in the PacBio database mapped to the human genome, and one human transcript that has been annotated as bacterial in the NCBI database. The current work reiterates the under-utilization of transcriptomes for annotating genomes. It also provides new leads for investigating breast cancer by virtue of exclusively expressed transcripts not expressed in other tissues, which have the prospects of breast cancer biomarkers based on further investigations.",

This fixation sequence from contextual cue to the associated target could be observed even when there were multiple goals and when the focus was shifted from one goal to another. To causally investigate the effects of sequential simulation, we directly manipulated the processing of the contextual cues and found its influence on the final choice of target. Furthermore, past episodes of the sequences influenced both final choices of targets and initial gaze to contextual cues. We interpret the results as suggesting that the internal process of simulating goal-directed event sequence drives information-seeking behavior such as attention/gaze in decision situations.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic chromatin, DNA makes about 1.7 left superhelical turns around an octamer of core histones implying that formation of nucleosomes would alter the overall topology of DNA by a comparable difference of the DNA linking number ({Delta}Lk) per nucleosome. However, earlier experiments have documented a significantly (about 50%) lower absolute value |{Delta}Lk| than expected from the nucleosome geometry. Recently, using computer modeling, we have predicted two families of energetically stable conformations of the arrays with precisely positioned nucleosomes, one with an integer number of DNA turns in the linker DNA {L = 10n} and the other with extra five base pairs in the linker {L = 10n + 5}, to be topologically different. Here, using arrays of precisely positioned clone 601 nucleosomes, topological electrophoretic assays, and electron microscopy we experimentally tested these predictions. First, for small 12-mer nucleosome circular arrays we observed that dLk per nucleosome changes from -1.4 to -0.9 for the linkers {L = 10n} and {L = 10n + 5}, respectively. Second, for larger hybrid arrays containing a mixture of positioned and non-positioned nucleosomes we found that changing the DNA linker length within the positioned arrays was sufficient to significantly alter the overall DNA topology fully consistent with our prediction. The observed topological polymorphism of the circular nucleosome arrays provides a simple explanation for the DNA topology in native chromatin with variable DNA linker length. Furthermore, our results may reflect a more general tendency of chromosomal domains containing active or repressed genes to acquire different nucleosome spacing to retain topologically distinct higher-order structures.",

    "abstract": "The minimizers scheme is a method for selecting k-mers from sequences. It is used in many bioinformatics software tools to bin comparable sequences or to sample a sequence in a deterministic fashion at approximately regular intervals, in order to reduce memory consumption and processing time. Although very useful, the minimizers selection procedure has undesirable behaviors (e.g., too many k-mers are selected when processing certain sequences). Some of these problems were already known to the authors of the minimizers technique, and the natural lexicographic ordering of k-mers used by minimizers was recognized as their origin. Many software tools using minimizers employ ad hoc variations of the lexicographic order to alleviate those issues.\\n\\nWe provide an in-depth analysis of the effect of k-mer ordering on the performance of the minimizers technique. By using small universal hitting sets (a recently defined concept), we show how to significantly improve the performance of minimizers and avoid some of its worse behaviors. Based on these results, we encourage bioinformatics software developers to use an ordering based on a universal hitting set or, if not possible, a randomized ordering, rather than the lexicographic order. This analysis also settles negatively a conjecture (by Schleimer et al.) on the expected density of minimizers in a random sequence.\\n\\nThe software used for this analysis is available on GitHub: https://github.com/gmarcais/minimizers.git.\\n\\nContact: gmarcais@cs.cmu.edu",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe protein Zelda was shown to play a key role in early Drosophila development, binding thousands of promoters and enhancers prior to maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), and marking them for transcriptional activation. Recently, we showed that Zelda acts through specific chromatin patterns of histone modifications to mark developmental enhancers and active promoters. Intriguingly, some Zelda sites still maintain these chromatin patterns in Drosophila embryos lacking maternal Zelda protein. This suggests that additional Zelda-like pioneer factors may act in early fly embryos.\\n\\nResultsWe developed a computational method to analyze and refine the chromatin landscape surrounding early Zelda peaks, using a multi-channel spectral clustering. This allowed us to characterize their chromatin patterns through MZT (mitotic cycles 8-14). Specifically, we focused on H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K18ac, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 and identified three different classes of chromatin signatures, matching \\\"promoters\\\", \\\"enhancers\\\" and \\\"transiently bound\\\" Zelda peaks.\\n\\nWe then further scanned the genome using these chromatin patterns and identified additional loci - with no Zelda binding - that show similar chromatin patterns, resulting with hundreds of Zelda-independent putative enhancers. These regions were found to be enriched with GAGA factor (GAF, Trl), and are typically located near early developmental zygotic genes. Overall our analysis suggests that GAF, together with Zelda, plays an important role in activating the zygotic genome.\\n\\nAs we show, our computational approach offers an efficient algorithm for characterizing chromatin signatures around some loci of interest, and allows a genome-wide identification of additional loci with similar chromatin patterns.\\n\\nContact: tommy@cs.huji.ac.il",

However, during data production researchers often lack clear definitions to what constitutes a \\\"bad\\\" replicate which should be discarded and if data from failed replicates is published downstream analysis by groups using this data can be hampered.

    "abstract": "Metagenomic datasets contain billions of protein sequences that could greatly enhance large-scale functional annotation and structure prediction. Utilizing this enormous resource would require reducing its redundancy by similarity clustering. However, clustering hundreds of million of sequences is impractical using current algorithms because their runtimes scale as the input set size N times the number of clusters K, which is typically of similar order as N, resulting in runtimes that increase almost quadratically with N. We developed Linclust, the first clustering algorithm whose runtime scales as N, independent of K. It can also cluster datasets several times larger than the available main memory. We cluster 1.6 billion metagenomic sequence fragments in 10 hours on a single server to 50% sequence identity, > 1000 times faster than has been possible before. Linclust will help to unlock the great wealth contained in metagenomic and genomic sequence databases. (Open-source software and Metaclust database: https://mmseqs.org/).",

    "abstract": "Mendelian randomization, the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables (IV), can test for and estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. Most IV methods assume that the function relating the exposure to the expected value of the outcome (the exposure-outcome relationship) is linear. However, in practice this assumption may not hold. Indeed, often the primary question of interest is to assess the shape of this relationship. We present two novel IV methods for investigating the shape of the exposure-outcome relationship: a fractional polynomial method and a piecewise linear method. We divide the population into strata using the exposure distribution, and estimate a causal effect, referred to as a localized average causal effect (LACE), in each stratum of population. The fractional polynomial method performs meta-regression on these LACE estimates. The piecewise linear method estimates a continuous piecewise linear function, the gradient of which is the LACE estimate in each stratum. Both methods were demonstrated in a simulation study to estimate the true exposure-outcome relationship well, particularly when the relationship was a fractional polynomial (for the fractional polynomial method) or was piecewise linear (for the piecewise linear method). The methods were used to investigate the shape of relationship of body mass index with systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.\\n\\nAvailability and implementation: https://github.com/jrs95/nlmr",

    "abstract": "West Nile Virus (WNV) is the one of most widespread arboviruses worldwide. WNV exists in a bird-mosquito transmission cycle where passerine birds act as the primary reservoir host. As a public health concern, the mammalian immune response to WNV has been studied in detail. Little, however, is known about the avian immune response to WNV. Avian taxa show variable susceptibility to WNV and what drives this variation is unknown. Thus, to study the immune response to WNV in birds, we experimentally infected captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Zebra finches provide a useful model, as like many natural avian hosts they are moderately susceptible to WNV and thus provide sufficient viremia to infect mosquitoes. We performed splenic RNAseq during peak viremia to provide an overview of the transcriptional response. In general, we find strong parallels with the mammalian immune response to WNV, including up-regulation of five genes in the Rig-I-like receptor signaling pathway, and offer insights into avian specific responses. Together with complementary immunological assays, we provide a model of the avian immune response to WNV and set the stage for future comparative studies among variably susceptible populations and species.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in technological tools such as next generation sequencing along with peaking interest in the study of single cells has enabled single-cell RNA-sequencing, in which whole transcriptomes are analyzed on a single-cell level. Studies, however, have been hindered by the ability to effectively analyze these single cell RNA-seq datasets, due to the high-dimensional nature and intrinsic noise in the data. While many techniques have been introduced to reduce dimensionality of such data for visualization and subpopulation identification, the utility to identify new cellular subtypes in a reliable and robust manner remains unclear. Here, we compare dimensionality reduction visualization methods including principle component analysis and t-stochastic neighbor embedding along with various distance metric modifications to visualize single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and assess their performance in identifying known cellular subtypes. Our results suggest that selecting variable genes prior to analysis on single-cell RNA-seq data is vital to yield reliable classification, and that when variable genes are used, the choice of distance metric modification does not particularly influence the quality of classification. Still, in order to take advantage of all the gene expression information, alternative methods must be used for a reliable classification.",

    "abstract": "The phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) is vital in plant defense and development. Although biosynthesis of JA and activation of JA-responsive gene expression by the bioactive form JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) have been well-studied, knowledge on JA metabolism is incomplete. In particular, the enzyme that hydroxylates JA to 12-OH-JA, an inactive form of JA that accumulates after wounding and pathogen attack, is unknown. Here, we report the identification of four paralogous 2-oxoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent oxygenases in Arabidopsis thaliana as JA hydroxylases and show that they down-regulate JA-dependent responses. As they are induced by JA we named them JASMONATE-INDUCED OXYGENASEs (JOXs). Concurrent mutation of the four genes in a quadruple Arabidopsis mutant resulted in increased defense gene expression and increased resistance to the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea and the caterpillar Mamestra brassicae. In addition, root and shoot growth of the plants was inhibited. Metabolite analysis of leaves showed that loss of function of the four JOX enzymes resulted in over-accumulation of JA and in reduced turnover of JA into 12-OH-JA. Transformation of the quadruple mutant with each JOX gene strongly reduced JA levels, demonstrating that all four JOXs inactivate JA in plants. The in vitro catalysis of 12-OH-JA from JA by recombinant enzyme could be confirmed for three JOXs. The identification of the enzymes responsible for hydroxylation of JA reveals a missing step in JA metabolism, which is important for the inactivation of the hormone and subsequent down-regulation of JA-dependent defenses.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn plants, the hormone jasmonic acid (JA) is synthesized in response to attack by pathogens and herbivores, leading to activation of defense responses. Rapidly following JA accumulation, the hormone is metabolized, presumably to prevent inhibitive effects of high JA levels on growth and development. The enzymes that directly inactivate JA were so far unknown. Here, we identify four jasmonate-induced oxygenases (JOXs) in Arabidopsis that hydroxylate jasmonic acid to form inactive 12-OH-JA. A mutant that no longer produces the four enzymes hyperaccumulates JA, exhibits reduced growth, and is highly resistant to attackers that are sensitive to JA-dependent defense. The JOX enzymes thus play an important role in determining the amplitude and duration of JA responses to balance the growth-defense tradeoff.",
