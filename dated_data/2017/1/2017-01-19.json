    "abstract": "Alpine regions are under increased attention worldwide do their role in storing freshwater of high quality and their high sensitivity to climate change - comparable only to the poles. Riparian ecosystems in such regions, integrating water and nutrient fluxes from aquatic and terrestrial environments, host a disproportionally rich biodiversity, despite experiencing severe climate and nutrient restrictions. With climate change rapidly encroaching in the alpine biome, it is important to fully understand how the lake and its surrounding landscape elements sustain such rich ecosystems, before their functional connectivity could be seriously severed.\\n\\nA total of 189 glacial origin lakes in the Central Pyrenees were surveyed to test how key elements of lake and terrestrial environments work together at different scales to shape the riparian plant composition. Secondly, we evaluated how these ecotope features drive the formation of riparian communities potentially sensitive to environmental change, and assessed their habitat distribution. At each lake plant taxonomic composition was assessed together with elemental composition of water and sediment and ecosystem-relevant geographical factors.\\n\\nAt macroscale vegetation composition responded to pan-climatic gradients altitude and latitude, which captured, in a narrow geographic area the transition between large European climatic zones. Hydrodynamics was the main catchment-scale factor connecting riparian vegetation with large-scale water fluxes, followed by topography and geomorphology. Lake sediment Mg and Pb, and water Mn and Fe contents reflected local connections with nutrient availability, and water saturation of the substrate.\\n\\nCommunity analysis identified four keystone plant communities of large niche breadths, present in a wide range of habitats, from (i) damp environments, (ii) snow bed-silicate bedrock, (iii) wet heath, and (iv) limestone bedrock. With environmental change advancing in the alpine biome, this study provides critical information on fundamental linkages between riparian ecosystem and surrounding landscape elements, which could prove invaluable in assessing future biomic impacts.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/035576_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 6\\\">\\nView larger version (99K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f7ed3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f8c49org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a3493dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11d5a2c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstractRiparian ecosystem of Lake Cardal (0.3ha, 2224m a.s.l) in the Pyrenees National Park (France), with a network diagram of connected landscape elements.

    "abstract": "Author SummaryHost-associated bacterial communities vary extensively between individuals, but it can be very difficult to determine the sources of this variation. In this manuscript, we demonstrate experimentally how randomness in colonization can result in large differences in the composition of host-associated bacterial communities, using the nematode worm C. elegans as a tractable host model. Here, the amount of variation between individual communities is a function of two rates relevant to how bacteria colonize the host intestine, the colonization rate and the birth rate. We can therefore control the degree of variation between communities by controlling the colonization rate, using the amount of bacteria presented to the worms to control the rate at which migrants enter the intestine. When worms are fed with two neutrally-competing fluorescently labeled bacterial strains at low colonization rates, we are able to produce noise-induced bistability in this system, where each community is dominated by bacteria of only one color. These results demonstrate the potential importance of noise as a driver of variation between communities and highlight the utility of the simple model organism C. elegans for studying questions relevant to host-associated microbial communities.\\n\\nAbstractHost-associated bacterial communities vary extensively between individuals, but it can be very difficult to determine the sources of this heterogeneity. Here we demonstrate that stochastic bacterial community assembly in the C. elegans intestine is sufficient to produce strong inter-worm heterogeneity in community composition. When worms are fed with two neutrally-competing fluorescently labeled bacterial strains, we observe stochastically-driven bimodality in community composition, where approximately half of the worms are dominated by each bacterial strain. A simple model incorporating stochastic colonization suggests that heterogeneity between worms is driven by the low rate at which bacteria successfully establish new intestinal colonies. We can increase this rate experimentally by feeding worms at high bacterial density; in these conditions the bimodality disappears. These results demonstrate that demographic noise is a potentially important driver of diversity in bacterial community formation and suggest a role for C. elegans as a model system for ecology of host-associated communities.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing of whole tumor genomes holds the promise of revealing functional somatic regulatory mutations, such as those described in the TERT promoter. Recurrent promoter mutations have been identified in many additional genes and appear to be particularly common in melanoma, but convincing functional data such as influence on gene expression has been more elusive. Here, we show that frequently recurring promoter mutations in melanoma occur almost exclusively at cytosines flanked by a distinct sequence signature, TTCCG, with TERT as a notable exception. In active, but not inactive, promoters, mutation frequencies for cytosines at the 5 end of this ETS-like motif were considerably higher than expected based on a UV trinucleotide mutational signature. Additional analyses solidify this pattern as an extended context-specific mutational signature that mediates an exceptional position-specific vulnerability to UV mutagenesis, arguing against positive selection. We further use ultra-sensitive amplicon sequencing to demonstrate that cell cultures exposed to UV light quickly develop subclonal mutations specifically in affected positions. Our findings have implications for the interpretation of somatic mutations in regulatory regions, and underscore the importance of genomic context and extended sequence patterns to accurately describe mutational signatures in cancer.",

We insert GFP into the rigid head of the full integrin, model with Rosetta the orientation of GFP and its transition dipole relative to the integrin, and measure orientation with fluorescence polarization microscopy. Dependent on coupling to the cytoskeleton, integrins orient in the same direction as retrograde actin flow with their cytoskeleton-binding {beta}-subunits tilted by applied force.

    "abstract": "Mareks disease virus is a herpesvirus of chickens that costs the worldwide poultry industry over 1 billion USD annually. Two generations of Mareks disease vaccines have shown reduced efficacy over the last half century due to evolution of the virus. Understanding where the virus is present may give insight into whether continued reductions in efficacy are likely. We conducted a three-year surveillance study to assess the prevalence of Mareks disease virus on commercial poultry farms, determine the effect of various factors on virus prevalence, and document virus dynamics in broiler chicken houses over short (weeks) and long (years) timescales. We extracted DNA from dust samples collected from commercial chicken and egg production facilities in Pennsylvania, USA. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to assess wild-type virus detectability and concentration. Using data from 1018 dust samples with Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects models, we determined the factors that correlated with virus prevalence across farms. Maximum likelihood and autocorrelation function estimation on 3727 additional dust samples were used to document and characterize virus concentrations within houses over time. Overall, wild-type virus was detectable at least once on 36 of 104 farms at rates that varied substantially between farms. Virus was detected in 1 of 3 broiler-breeder operations (companies), 4 of 5 broiler operations, and 3 of 5 egg layer operations. Mareks disease virus detectability differed by production type, bird age, day of the year, operation (company), farm, house, flock, and sample. Operation (company) was the most important factor, accounting for between 12% and 63.4% of the variation in virus detectability. Within individual houses, virus concentration often dropped below detectable levels and reemerged later. These data characterize Mareks disease virus dynamics, which are potentially important to the evolution of the virus.",

    "abstract": "Damage to the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) has long been known to impair declarative memory and recent evidence suggests that it also impairs visual perception. A theory termed the representational-hierarchical account explains such impairments by assuming that MTL stores conjunctive representations of items and events, and that individuals with MTL damage must rely upon representations of simple visual features in posterior visual cortex, which are inadequate to support memory and perception under certain circumstances. One recent study of visual discrimination behavior revealed a surprising anti-perceptual learning effect in MTL-damaged individuals: with exposure to a set of visual stimuli, discrimination performance worsened rather than improved (Barense et al., 2012). We extend the representational-hierarchical account to explain this paradox by assuming that difficult visual discriminations are performed by comparing the relative  representational tunedness - or familiarity - of the to-be-discriminated items. Exposure to a set of highly similar stimuli entails repeated presentation of simple visual features, eventually rendering all feature representations maximally, and thus equally, familiar [-] hence, they are inutile for solving the task. Discrimination performance in patients with MTL lesions is therefore impaired by stimulus exposure. Because the unique conjunctions represented in MTL do not occur repeatedly, healthy individuals are shielded from this perceptual interference. We simulate this mechanism with a neural network previously used to explain recognition memory, thereby providing a model that accounts for both mnemonic and perceptual deficits caused by MTL damage with a unified architecture and mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The stability of mRNA is one of the major determinants of gene expression. Although a wealth of sequence elements regulating mRNA stability has been described, their quantitative contributions to half-life are unknown. Here, we built a quantitative model for Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on functional mRNA sequence features that explains 60% of the half-life variation between genes and predicts half-life at a median relative error of 30%. The model revealed a new destabilizing 3UTR motif, ATATTC, which we functionally validated. Codon usage proves to be the major determinant of mRNA stability. Nonetheless, single-nucleotide variations have the largest effect when occurring on 3UTR motifs or upstream AUGs. Analyzing mRNA half-life data of 34 knockout strains showed that the effect of codon usage not only requires functional decapping and deadenylation, but also the 5-to-3 exonuclease Xrn1, the non-sense mediated decay genes, but not no-go decay. Altogether, this study quantitatively delineates the contributions of mRNA sequence features on stability in yeast, reveals their functional dependencies on degradation pathways, and allows accurate prediction of half-life from mRNA sequence.",

    "abstract": "Participation in open data initiatives require two semi-independent actions: the sharing of data produced by a researcher or group, and a consumer of shared data. Consumers of shared data range from people interested in validating the results of a given study to people who actively transform the available data. These data transformers are of particular interest because they add value to the shared data set through the discovery of new relationships and information which can in turn be shared with the same community. The complex and often reciprocal relationship between producers and consumers can be better understood using game theory, namely by using three variations of the Prisoners Dilemma (PD): a classical PD payoff matrix, a simulation of the PD n-person iterative model that tests three hypotheses, and an Ideological Game Theory (IGT) model used to formulate how sharing strategies might be implemented in a specific institutional culture. To motivate these analyses, data sharing is presented as a trade-off between economic and social payoffs. This is demonstrated as a series of payoff matrices describing situations ranging from ubiquitous acceptance of Open Science principles to a community standard of complete non-cooperation. Further context is provided through the IGT model, which allows from the modeling of cultural biases and beliefs that influence open science decision-making. A vision for building a CC-BY economy are then discussed using an approach called econosemantics, which complements the treatment of data sharing as a complex system of transactions enabled by social capital.",

    "abstract": "Modern digital pathology departments have grown to produce whole-slide image data at petabyte scale, an unprecedented treasure chest for medical machine learning tasks. Unfortunately, most digital slides are not annotated at the image level, hindering large-scale application of supervised learning. Manual labeling is prohibitive, requiring pathologists with decades of training and outstanding clinical service responsibilities. This problem is further aggravated by the United States Food and Drug Administrations ruling that primary diagnosis must come from a glass slide rather than a digital image. We present the first end-to-end framework to overcome this problem, gathering annotations in a nonintrusive manner during a pathologists routine clinical work: (i) microscope-specific 3D-printed commodity camera mounts are used to video record the glass-slide-based clinical diagnosis process; (ii) after routine scanning of the whole slide, the video frames are registered to the digital slide; (iii) motion and observation time are estimated to generate a spatial and temporal saliency map of the whole slide. Demonstrating the utility of these annotations, we train a convolutional neural network that detects diagnosis-relevant salient regions, then report accuracy of 85.15% in bladder and 91.40% in prostate, with 75.00% accuracy when training on prostate but predicting in bladder, despite different pathologists examining the different tissues. When training on one patient but testing on another, AUROC in bladder is 0.7929 0.1109 and in prostate is 0.9568{+/-}0.0374. Our tool is available at https://bitbucket.org/aschaumberg/deepscope.",

    "abstract": "The bottleneck governing infectious disease transmission describes the size of the pathogen population transferred from a donor to a recipient host. Accurate quantification of the bottleneck size is of particular importance for rapidly evolving pathogens such as influenza virus, as narrow bottlenecks would limit the extent of transferred viral genetic diversity and, thus, have the potential to slow the rate of viral adaptation. Previous studies have estimated the transmission bottleneck size governing viral transmission through statistical analyses of variants identified in pathogen sequencing data. The methods used by these studies, however, did not account for variant calling thresholds and stochastic dynamics of the viral population within recipient hosts. Because these factors can skew bottleneck size estimates, we here introduce a new method for inferring transmission bottleneck sizes that explicitly takes these factors into account. We compare our method, based on beta-binomial sampling, with existing methods in the literature for their ability to recover the transmission bottleneck size of a simulated dataset. This comparison demonstrates that the beta-binomial sampling method is best able to accurately infer the simulated bottleneck size. We then apply our method to a recently published dataset of influenza A H1N1p and H3N2 infections, for which viral deep sequencing data from inferred donor-recipient transmission pairs are available. Our results indicate that transmission bottleneck sizes across transmission pairs are variable, yet that there is no significant difference in the overall bottleneck sizes inferred for H1N1p and H3N2. The mean bottleneck size for influenza virus in this study, considering all transmission pairs, was Nb = 196 (95% confidence interval 66-392) virions. While this estimate is consistent with previous bottleneck size estimates for this dataset, it is considerably higher than the bottleneck sizes estimated for influenza from other datasets.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe transmission bottleneck size describes the size of the pathogen population transferred from the donor to recipient host at the onset of infection and is a key factor in determining the rate at which a pathogen can adapt within a host population. Recent advances in sequencing technology have enabled the bottleneck size to be estimated from pathogen sequence data, though there is not yet a consensus on the statistical method to use. In this study, we introduce a new approach for inferring the transmission bottleneck size from sequencing data that accounts for the criteria used to identify sequence variants and stochasticity in pathogen replication dynamics. We show that the failure to account for these factors may lead to underestimation of the transmission bottleneck size. We apply this method to a previous dataset of human influenza A infections, showing that transmission is governed by a loose transmission bottleneck and that the bottleneck size is highly variable across transmission events. This work advances our understanding of the bottleneck size governing influenza infection and introduces a method for estimating the bottleneck size that can be applied to other rapidly evolving RNA viruses, such as norovirus and RSV.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is influenced by numerous factors, which results in diverse genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional scenarios, thus posing obvious challenges for disease management. We scrutinized the molecular heterogeneity of HCC with a multi-omics approach in two small cohorts of resected and explanted livers. Whole-genome transcriptomics was conducted, including polyadenylated transcripts and micro (mi)-RNAs. Copy number variants (CNV) were inferred from whole genome low-pass sequencing data. Fifty-six cancer-related genes were screened using an oncology panel assay. HCC was associated with a dramatic transcriptional deregulation of hundreds of protein-coding genes suggesting downregulation of drugs catabolism, induction of inflammatory responses, and increased cell proliferation in resected livers. Moreover, several long non-coding RNAs and miRNAs not reported previously in the context of HCC were found deregulated. In explanted livers, downregulation of genes involved in energy-producing processes and upregulation of genes aiding in glycolysis were detected. Numerous CNV events were observed, with conspicuous hotspots on chromosomes 1 and 17. Amplifications were more common than deletions, and spanned regions containing genes potentially involved in tumorigenesis. CSF1R, FGFR3, FLT3, NPM1, PDGFRA, PTEN, SMO and TP53 were mutated in all tumors, while other 26 cancer-related genes were mutated with variable penetrance. Our results highlight a remarkable molecular heterogeneity between HCC tumors and reinforce the notion that precision medicine approaches are urgently needed for cancer treatment. We expect that our results will serve as a valuable dataset that will generate hypotheses for us or other researchers to evaluate to ultimately improve our understanding of HCC biology.",

    "abstract": "Cross-species transmission (CST) has led to many devastating epidemics, but is still a poorly understood phenomenon. HIV-1 and HIV-2 (human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2), which have collectively caused over 35 million deaths, are the result of multiple CSTs from chimpanzees, gorillas, and sooty mangabeys. While the immediate history of HIV is known, there are over 45 lentiviruses that infect specific species of primates, and patterns of host switching are not well characterized. We thus took a phylogenetic approach to better understand the natural history of SIV recombination and CST. We modeled host species as a discrete character trait on the viral phylogeny and inferred historical host switches and the pairwise transmission rates between each pair of 24 primate hosts. We identify 14 novel, well-supported, ancient cross-species transmission events. We also find that lentiviral lineages vary widely in their ability to infect new host species: SIVcol (from colobus monkeys) is evolutionarily isolated, while SIVagms (from African green monkeys) frequently move between host subspecies. We also examine the origins of SIVcpz (the predecessor of HIV-1) in greater detail than previous studies, and find that there are still large portions of the genome with unknown origins. Observed patterns of CST are likely driven by a combination of ecological circumstance and innate immune factors.",

While a number of reference-based deconvolution algorithms have emerged, their potential remains underexplored and a comparative evaluation of these algorithms beyond tissues such as blood is still lacking.\\n\\nResultsHere we present a novel framework for reference-based inference, which leverages cell-type specific DNAse Hypersensitive Site (DHS) information from the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap to construct an improved reference DNA methylation database. We show that this leads to a marginal but statistically significant improvement of cell-count estimates in whole blood as well as in mixtures involving epithelial cell-types. Using this framework we compare a widely used state-of-the-art reference-based algorithm (called constrained projection) to two non-constrained approaches including CIBERSORT and a method based on robust partial correlations. We conclude that the widely-used constrained projection technique may not always be optimal. Instead, we find that the method based on robust partial correlations is generally more robust across a range of different tissue types and for realistic noise levels. We call the combined algorithm which uses DHS data and robust partial correlations for inference, EpiDISH (Epigenetic Dissection of Intra-Sample Heterogeneity). Finally, we demonstrate the added value of EpiDISH in an EWAS of smoking.\\n\\nConclusionsEstimating cell-type fractions and subsequent inference in EWAS may benefit from the use of non-constrained reference-based cell-type deconvolution methods.",

    "abstract": "Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many risk loci for complex traits and common diseases, most of the identified associations reside in noncoding regions and have unknown biological functions. Recent genomic sequencing studies have produced a rich resource of annotations that help characterize the function of genetic variants. Integrative analysis that incorporates these functional annotations into GWAS can help elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying the identified associations and help prioritize causal-variants. Here, we develop a novel, flexible Bayesian variable selection model with efficient computational techniques for such integrative analysis. Different from previous approaches, our method models the effect-size distribution and probability of causality for variants with different annotations and jointly models genome-wide variants to account for linkage disequilibrium (LD), thus prioritizing associations based on the quantification of the annotations and allowing for multiple causal-variants per locus. Our efficient computational algorithm dramatically improves both computational speed and posterior sampling convergence by taking advantage of the block-wise LD structures of human genomes. With simulations, we show that our method accurately quantifies the functional enrichment and performs more powerful for identifying true causal-variants than several competing methods. The power gain brought up by our method is especially apparent in cases when multiple causal-variants in LD reside in the same locus. We also apply our method for an in-depth GWAS of age-related macular degeneration with 33,976 individuals and 9,857,286 variants. We find the strongest enrichment for causality among non-synonymous variants (54x more likely to be causal, 1.4x larger effect-sizes) and variants in active promoter (7.8x more likely, 1.4x larger effect-sizes), as well as identify 5 potentially novel loci in addition to the 32 known AMD risk loci. In conclusion, our method is shown to efficiently integrate functional information in GWASs, helping identify causal variants and underlying biology.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical model to account for linkage disequilibrium (LD) and multiple functional annotations in GWAS, paired with an expectation-maximization Markov chain Monte Carlo (EM-MCMC) computational algorithm to jointly analyze genome-wide variants. Our method improves the MCMC convergence property to ensure accurate Bayesian inference of the quantifications of the functional enrichment pattern and fine-mapped association results. By applying our method to the real GWAS of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with various functional annotations (i.e., gene-based, regulatory, and chromatin states), we find that the variants of non-synonymous, coding, and active promoter annotations have the highest causal probability and the largest effect-sizes. In addition, our method produces fine-mapped association results in the identified risk loci, two of which are shown as examples (C2/CFB/SKIV2L and C3) with justifications by haplotype analysis, model comparison, and conditional analysis. Therefore, we believe our integrative method will be useful for quantifying the enrichment pattern of functional annotations in GWAS, and then prioritizing associations with respect to the learned functional enrichment pattern.",

A sub-class of HAS, PionX sites, represent first contacts on the X. Here, we explored the chromosomal interactions of representative PionX sites by high-resolution 4C and determined the global chromosome conformation by Hi-C in sex-sorted embryos. Male and female X chromosomes display similar nuclear architecture, concordant with clustered, constitutively active genes. PionX sites, like HAS, are evenly distributed in the active compartment and engage in short- and long-range interactions beyond compartment boundaries. By de novo induction of DCC in female cells, we monitored the extent of activation surrounding PionX sites. This revealed a remarkable range of DCC action not only in linear proximity, but also at megabase distance if close in space, suggesting that DCC profits from pre-existing chromosome folding to activate genes.",

Herein, we report the genetic and molecular mechanisms underling the formation of the minute wing. Fine mapping and positional cloning revealed that a palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC18-like gene (BmAPP)was responsible for the mw mutation. CRISPR/Cas9 screening of the BmAPP gene in wild-type embryos revealed that a significant proportion of adults had the mw mutation. In an mw mutant strain, u11, a 10-bp insertion in the promoter of a novel gene resulted in low-level translation of a protein belonging to the DHHC family. A PiggyBac-based transgenic analysis showed that the promoter induced the expression of aBmAPP gene promoter in the wild type but not the mw mutant. These findings indicate that functional deletion of this gene promoter accounts for the mw mutation in silkworm. The possibility that BmAPP gene is involved in Hippo signalling pathway, an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that controls organ size, is discussed.",

Despite existing as a large, dense structure with specialised cytoskeletal architecture, the AIS is surprisingly plastic, with sustained alterations in neuronal activity bringing about significant alterations to its position, length or molecular composition. However, although the upstream activity-dependent signalling pathways that lead to such plasticity have begun to be elucidated, the downstream mechanisms that produce structural changes at the AIS are completely unknown. Here, we use dissociated cultures of rat hippocampus to show that two forms of AIS plasticity in dentate granule cells - long-term relocation, and more rapid shortening - are completely blocked by treatment with blebbistatin, a potent and selective myosin II ATPase inhibitor. These data establish a link between myosin II and AIS function, and suggest that myosin IIs primary role at the structure may be to effect activity-dependent morphological alterations.",

    "abstract": "The antagonistic coevolution of parasite infectivity and host resistance alters the biological functionality of species, with effects spanning to communities and ecosystems. Still, studies describing long-term host-parasite coevolutionary dynamics in nature are largely missing. Furthermore, the role of host resistance mechanisms for parasite evolution is poorly understood, necessitating for the molecular and phenotypic characterization of both coevolving parasites and their hosts. We combined long-term field sampling (2007-2014), in vitro cross-infections and time-shift experiments with bacteriophage whole genome sequencing and bacterial (Flavobacterium columnare) CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) profiling to show the molecular details of the phage-bacterium arms race in the environment. Bacteria were generally resistant to phages from the past and susceptible to phages in the future. The bacterial resistance selected for increased phage infectivity and host range, correlating directly with the expansion of phage genome size by 2656 bp. In the bacterial host, two CRISPR loci were identified: a type II-C locus and an RNA-targeting type VI-B locus. While maintaining a core set of conserved spacers, phage-matching spacers appeared in the variable end of both CRISPR loci over time. The appearance of these CRISPR spacers in the bacterial host often corresponded with arms race -manner molecular changes in the protospacers of the coevolving phage population. However, the phenotypic data indicated that the relative role of constitutive defence may be more important in high phage pressure, highlighting the importance of our findings for understanding microbial community ecology and in the development of phage therapy applications.",

    "abstract": "Rise of atmospheric CO2 is one of the main causes of global warming. Catastrophic climate change can be avoided by reducing emissions and increasing sequestration of CO2. Trees are known to sequester CO2 during photosynthesis, and then store it as wood biomass. Thus, breeding of trees with higher wood yield would mitigate global warming as well as augment production of renewable construction materials, energy, and industrial feedstock. Wood is made of cellulose-rich xylem cells produced through proliferation of a specialized stem cell niche called cambium. Importance of cambium in xylem cells production makes it an ideal target for the tree breeding programs; however our knowledge about control of cambium proliferation remains limited. The morphology and regulation of cambium differs from stem cell niches that control axial growth. For this reason, translating the knowledge about axial growth to radial growth has limited use. Furthermore, genetic approaches cannot be easily applied because overlaying tissues conceal cambium from direct observation and complicate identification of mutants. To overcome the paucity of experimental tools in cambium biology, we constructed a Boolean network CARENET (CAmbium Regulation gene NETwork) for modelling cambium activity, which includes the key transcription factors WOX4 and HD-ZIP III as well as their potential regulators. Our simulations revealed that: (1) auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, and brassinosteroids act cooperatively in promoting transcription of WOX4 and HD-ZIP III; (2) auxin and cytokinin pathways negatively regulate each other; (3) hormonal pathways act redundantly in sustaining cambium activity; (4) individual cells in the stem cell niches can have diverse molecular identities. CARENET can be extended to include components of other signalling pathways and be integrated with models of xylem and phloem differentiation. Such extended models would facilitate breeding trees with higher wood yield.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous analysis of genetic associations with multiple phenotypes may reveal shared genetic susceptibility across traits (pleiotropy). For a locus exhibiting overall pleiotropy, it is important to identify which specific traits underlie this association. We propose a Bayesian meta-analysis approach (termed CPBayes) that uses summary-level data across multiple phenotypes to simultaneously measure the evidence of aggregate-level pleiotropic association and estimate an optimal subset of traits associated with the risk locus. This method uses a unified Bayesian statistical framework based on a spike and slab prior. CPBayes performs a fully Bayesian analysis by employing the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique Gibbs sampling. It takes into account heterogeneity in the size and direction of the genetic effects across traits. It can be applied to both cohort data and separate studies of multiple traits having overlapping or non-overlapping subjects. Simulations show that CPBayes produces a substantially better accuracy in the selection of associated traits underlying a pleiotropic signal than the subset-based meta-analysis ASSET. We used CPBayes to undertake a genome-wide pleiotropic association study of 22 traits in the large Kaiser GERA cohort and detected nine independent pleiotropic loci associated with at least two phenotypes. This includes a locus at chromosomal region 1q24.2 which exhibits an association simultaneously with the risk of five different diseases: Dermatophytosis, Hemorrhoids, Iron Deficiency, Osteoporosis, and Peripheral Vascular Disease. The GERA cohort analysis suggests that CPBayes is more powerful than ASSET with respect to detecting independent pleiotropic variants.

We propose a Bayesian meta-analysis method CPBayes that simultaneously evaluates the evidence of aggregate-level pleiotropic association and selects an optimal subset of associated traits underlying a pleiotropic signal. CPBayes analyzes pleiotropy using summary-level data across a wide range of studies for two or more phenotypes - separate GWASs with or without shared subjects, cohort study for multiple traits. It performs a fully Bayesian analysis and offers various flexibilities in the inference. In addition to parameters of primary interest (e.g., the measures of overall pleiotropic association, the optimal subset of associated traits), it provides additional interesting insights into a pleiotropic signal (e.g., the trait-specific posterior probability of association, the credible interval of unknown true genetic effects). Using computer simulations and a real data application to the large Kaiser GERA cohort, we demonstrate that CPBayes offers substantially better accuracy while selecting the non-null traits compared to a well known subset-based meta analysis ASSET. In the GERA cohort analysis, CPBayes detected a larger number of independent pleiotropic variants than ASSET. We provide a user-friendly R-package  CPBayes for general use.",

Typically, a choice is made between a constant (frequency-dependence) and a linear (density-dependence) contact-density function, but it is becoming increasingly clear that intermediate, nonlinear functions intermediate are more realistic. It is currently not clear however what the exact consequences would be of different contact-density functions in fluctuating populations. By combining field data on rodent host (Mastomys natalensis) demography, experimentally-derived contact-density data, and laboratory and field data Morogoro virus infection dynamics, we explored the effects of different contact-density function shapes on transmission dynamics and invasion/persistence. While invasion and persistence were clearly affected by the shape of the function, the effects on outbreak characteristics such as infection prevalence and seroprevalence were less obvious. This means that it may be difficult to distinguish between the different shapes based on how well models fit to real data. The shape of the transmission-density function should therefore be chosen with care, and is ideally based on existing information such as a previously quantified contact- or transmission-density relationship or the underlying biology of the host species in relation to the infectious agent.",

Similarly, in many social situations where scrutinizing each individuals expression is inefficient, human observers make snap judgments of crowds of people by reading \\\"crowd emotion\\\" to avoid danger (e.g., mass panic or violent mobs) or to seek help. However, how the brain accomplishes this feat remains unaddressed. Here we report a set of behavioral and fMRI studies in which participants made avoidance or approach decisions by choosing between two facial crowds presented in the left and right visual fields (LVF/RVF). Participants were most accurate for crowds containing task-relevant cues: avoiding angry crowds and approaching happy crowds. This effect was amplified by sex-linked facial cues (angry male/happy female crowds) and highly lateralized, with better recognition of the task-congruent facial crowd when presented in LVF. fMRI results showed that the dorsal visual stream was preferentially activated in crowd emotion processing, with intraparietal sulcus and superior frontal gyrus predicting behavioral crowd emotion efficiency, whereas the ventral visual stream showed greater involvement in individual face emotion processing, with fusiform cortex activity predicting the accuracy of decisions about individual face emotion. Our results shed new light on the distinction between global vs. local processing of face stimuli, revealing differential involvement of the left and right hemispheres and the dorsal and ventral pathways in reading crowd vs. individual emotion.",

    "abstract": "Primary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) is important for individuals at increased risk, and largely consists of healthy lifestyle modifications and initiation of medications when appropriate - including statins. Defining the inherent risk for any given individual typically relies on traditional risk factors established decades ago by the Framingham Heart Study. Unfortunately, recent studies have indicated that these traditional clinical risk factors systematically overestimate the risk of CAD across all major ancestries. This has increased the number of patients that would be eligible for statin therapy for the primary prevention of CAD but would likely receive little benefit and potentially incur negative consequences. On the other hand, researchers have demonstrated that genetic factors can effectively identify a subset of high risk individuals, and that the benefit from statin therapy is greatest among individuals with the highest genetic risk score (GRS). These individuals also receive the greatest absolute benefit from healthy lifestyle choices, being able to titrate their risk to normal levels despite high genetic predisposition. However, it is not yet possible for the average individual to discover their genetic risk because no tools are currently available to make such a determination. Here, we present a free mobile app - MyGeneRank - that can provide this information. Individuals may choose to use this knowledge to complement traditional risk assessments, and make critical decisions regarding lifelong statin therapy and lifestyle changes. As of 1/25/2017, MyGeneRank is currently in closed beta and will soon be available to the public.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe underlying biological mechanisms through which epidemiologically defined breast cancer risk factors contribute to disease risk remain poorly understood. Identification of the molecular changes associated with cancer risk factors in normal tissues may aid in determining the earliest events of carcinogenesis and informing cancer prevention strategies.\\n\\nResultsHere we investigated the impact cancer risk factors have on the normal breast epigenome by analyzing DNA methylation genome-wide (Infinium 450K array) in cancer-free women from the Susan G. Komen Tissue Bank (n = 100). We tested the relation of established breast cancer risk factors: age, body mass index, parity, and family history of disease with DNA methylation adjusting for potential variation in cell-type proportions. We identified 787 CpG sites that demonstrated significant associations (Q-value < 0.01) with subject age. Notably, DNA methylation was not strongly associated with the other evaluated breast cancer risk factors. Age-related DNA methylation changes are primarily increases in methylation enriched at breast epithelial cell enhancer regions (P = 7.1E-20), and binding sites of chromatin remodelers (MYC and CTCF). We validated the age-related associations in two independent populations of normal breast tissue (n = 18) and normal-adjacent to tumor tissue (n = 97). The genomic regions classified as age-related were more likely to be regions altered in cancer in both pre-invasive (n = 40, P=3.0E-03) and invasive breast tumors (n = 731, P=1.1E-13).\\n\\nConclusionsDNA methylation changes with age occur at regulatory regions, and are further exacerbated in cancer suggesting that age influences breast cancer risk in part through its contribution to epigenetic dysregulation in normal breast tissue.",

    "abstract": "Electrical recordings from a large array of electrodes give us access to neural population activity with single-cell, single-spike resolution. These recordings contain extracellular spikes which must be correctly detected and assigned to individual neurons. Despite numerous spike-sorting techniques developed in the past, a lack of high-quality ground-truth datasets hinders the validation of spike-sorting approaches. Furthermore, existing approaches requiring manual corrections are not scalable for hours of recordings exceeding 100 channels. To address these issues, we built a comprehensive spike-sorting pipeline that performs reliably under noise and probe drift by incorporating covariance-based features and unsupervised clustering based on fast density-peak finding. We validated performance of our workflow using multiple ground-truth datasets that recently became available. Our software scales linearly and processes up to 1000-channel recording in real-time using a single workstation. Accurate, real-time spike sorting from large recording arrays will enable more precise control of closed-loop feedback experiments and brain-computer interfaces.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a practical roadmap for scholarly publishers to implement data citation in accordance with the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (JDDCP), a synopsis and harmonization of the recommendations of major science policy bodies. It was developed by the Publishers Early Adopters Expert Group as part of the Data Citation Implementation Pilot (DCIP) project, an initiative of FORCE11.org and the NIH BioCADDIE program. The structure of the roadmap presented here follows the \\\"life of a paper\\\" workflow and includes the categories Pre-submission, Submission, Production, and Publication. The roadmap is intended to be publisher-agnostic so that all publishers can use this as a starting point when implementing JDDCP-compliant data citation. Authors reading this roadmap will also better know what to expect from publishers and how to enable their own data citations to gain maximum impact, as well as complying with what will become increasingly common funder mandates on data transparency.",
