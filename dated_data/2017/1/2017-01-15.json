    "abstract": "The ability to process time on the scale of milliseconds and seconds is essential for behaviour. A growing number of studies have started to focus on brain dynamics as a mechanism for temporal encoding. Although there is growing evidence in favour of this view from computational and in vitro studies, there is still a lack of results from experiments in humans. We show that high-dimensional brain states revealed by multivariate pattern analysis of human EEG are correlated to temporal judgements. First, we show that, as participants estimate temporal intervals, the spatiotemporal dynamics of their brain activity are consistent across trials. Second, we present evidence that these dynamics exhibit properties of temporal perception, such as the scalar property. Lastly, we show that it is possible to predict temporal judgements based on brain states. These results show how scalp recordings can reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of human brain activity related to temporal processing.",

    "abstract": "SNP heritability, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by SNPs, has been reported for many hundreds of traits. Its estimation requires strong prior assumptions about the distribution of heritability across the genome, but the assumptions in current use have not been thoroughly tested. By analyzing imputed data for a large number of human traits, we empirically derive a model that more accurately describes how heritability varies with minor allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium and genotype certainty. Across 19 traits, our improved model leads to estimates of common SNP heritability on average 43% (SD 3) higher than those obtained from the widely-used software GCTA, and 25% (SD 2) higher than those from the recently-proposed extension GCTA-LDMS. Previously, DNaseI hypersensitivity sites were reported to explain 79% of SNP heritability; using our improved heritability model their estimated contribution is only 24%.",

    "abstract": "A recent discovery have demonstrated that herbivore induced plant volatile compounds from apple tree infested with leafrollers were highly attractive to con-specific adult male and female leafrollers. However, this work has been conducted in New Zealand and Canada testing only low doses of kairomone. This study has been conducted in US to assess the attractiveness of higher doses of the six apple volatiles provisory identified in apple trees infested by tortricid larvaeto the leafroller, Pandemis pyrusana Kearfott. These volatiles included, {beta}-caryophyllene, germacrene D, benzyl alcohol, phenylacetonitrile, (E)-nerolidol, and indole. No volatiles were attractive to P. pyrusana when used alone. However, traps baited with phenylacetonitrile plus acetic acid caught both sexes of P. pyrusana. Traps baited with the other volatiles plus acetic acid caught zero to only incidental numbers of moths, [&le;] 1.0. Adding phenylacetonitrile to traps baited with pear ester, ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate plus acetic acid significantly reduced catches of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.). However, adding phenylacetonitrile to traps baited with codling moth sex pheromone, pear ester, and acetic acid did not similarly reduce moth catches of C. pomonella. Interestingly, traps baited with phenylacetonitrile plus acetic acid caught significantly more P. pyrusana than traps baited with a commercial sex pheromone lure. The evaporation rate of the acetic acid co-lure was an important factor affecting catches of P. pyrusana with phenylacetonitrile, and studies are needed to optimize the emission rates of both lure components. Further studies are warranted to develop phenylacetonitrile and possibly other aromatic plant volatiles as bisexual lures for the range of tortricid pests attacking horticultural crops.",

    "abstract": "The factors guiding retrotransposon insertion site preference are not well understood. Different types of retrotransposons share common replication machinery and yet occupy distinct genomic domains. Autonomous long interspersed elements accumulate in gene-poor domains and their non-autonomous short interspersed elements accumulate in gene-rich domains. To determine genomic factors that contribute to this discrepancy we analysed the distribution of retrotransposons within the framework of chromosomal domains and regulatory elements. Using comparative genomics, we identified large-scale conserved patterns of retrotransposon accumulation across several mammalian genomes. Importantly, retrotransposons that were active after our sample-species diverged accumulated in orthologous regions. This suggested a similar evolutionary interaction between retrotransposon activity and conserved genome architecture across our species. In addition, we found that retrotransposons accumulated at regulatory element boundaries in open chromatin, where accumulation of particular retrotransposon types depended on insertion size and local regulatory element density. From our results, we propose a model where density and distribution of genes and regulatory elements canalise retrotransposon accumulation. Through conservation of synteny, gene regulation and nuclear organisation, mammalian genomes with dissimilar retrotransposons follow similar evolutionary trajectories.",

    "abstract": "The main application of ChIP-seq technology is the detection of genomic regions that bind to a protein of interest. A large part of functional genomics public catalogs are based on ChIP-seq data. These catalogs rely on peak calling algorithms that infer protein-binding sites by detecting genomic regions associated with more mapped reads (coverage) than expected by chance as a result of the experimental protocol's lack of perfect specificity. We find that GC-content bias accounts for substantial variability in the observed coverage for ChIP-Seq experiments and that this variability leads to false-positive peak calls. More concerning is that GC-effect varies across experiments, with the effect strong enough to result in a substantial number of peaks called differently when different laboratories perform experiments on the same cell-line. However, accounting for GC-content in ChIP-Seq is challenging because the binding sites of interest tend to be more common in high GC-content regions, which confounds real biological signal with the unwanted variability. To account for this challenge we introduce a statistical approach that accounts for GC-effects on both non-specific noise and signal induced by the binding site. The method can be used to account for this bias in binding quantification as well to improve existing peak calling algorithms. We use this approach to show a reduction in false positive peaks as well as improved consistency across laboratories.",

    "abstract": "Effective management of fisheries depends on the selectivity of different fishing methods, control of fishing effort, and the life history and mating system of the target species. For sex-changing species, it is unclear how the truncation of age structure or selection of specific size or age classes (by fishing for specific markets) affects population dynamics. We specifically address the consequences of plate-sized selectivity, whereby sub-mature,  plate-sized fish are preferred in the live reef food fish trade. We use an age-structured model to investigate the decline and recovery of populations fished with three different selectivity scenarios (asymptotic, dome-shaped, and plate-sized) applied to two sexual systems (female-first hermaphroditism and gonochorism). We parameterized our model with life-history data from Brown-marbled grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus) and Napoleon fish (Cheilinus undulatus).  Plate-sized selectivity had the greatest negative effect on population trajectories, assuming accumulated fishing effort across ages was equal, while the relative effect of fishing on biomass was greatest with low natural mortality. Fishing such sex-changing species before maturation decreased egg production (and the spawning potential ratio) in two ways: average individual size decreased, and, assuming plasticity, females became males at a smaller size. Somatic growth rate affected biomass if selectivity was based on size-at-age because in slow growers, a smaller proportion of total biomass was vulnerable to fishing. We recommend fisheries avoid taking individuals near their maturation age, regardless of mating system, unless catch is tightly controlled. We also discuss the implications of fishing post-settlement individuals on population dynamics and offer practical management recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Gene synthesis, the process of assembling gene-length fragments from shorter groups of oligonucleotides (oligos), is becoming an increasingly important tool in molecular and synthetic biology. The length, quality, and cost of gene synthesis is limited by errors produced during oligo synthesis and subsequent assembly. Enzymatic error correction methods are cost-effective means to ameliorate errors in gene synthesis. Previous analyses of these methods relied on cloning and Sanger sequencing to evaluate their efficiencies, limiting quantitative assessment and throughput. Here we develop a method to quantify errors in synthetic DNA by next-generation sequencing. We analyzed errors in a model gene assembly and systematically compared six different error correction enzymes across 11 conditions. We find that ErrASE and T7 Endonuclease I are the most effective at decreasing average error rates (up to 5.8-fold relative to the input), whereas MutS is the best for increasing the number of perfect assemblies (up to 25.2-fold). We are able to quantify differential specificities such as ErrASE preferentially corrects C/G [-&gt;] G/C transversions whereas T7 Endonuclease I preferentially corrects A/T [-&gt;] T/A transversions. More generally, this experimental and computational pipeline is a fast, scalable, and extensible way to analyze errors in gene assemblies, to profile error correction methods, and to benchmark DNA synthesis methods.",

Temporal filtering can play a key role in filtering noise, choreographing the timing of events, and mediating the interpretation of dynamically encoded signals. To define the biochemical circuits capable of kinetic filtering, we comprehensively searched the space of three-node networks. We define a metric of \\\"temporal ultrasensitivity\\\", a measure of the steepness of activation as a function of stimulus duration. We identified five classes of core network motifs capable of temporal filtering, each with different functional properties such as rejecting high frequency noise, committing to response (bistability), and distinguishing between long stimuli. Combinations of the two most robust motifs, double inhibition (DI) and positive feedback with AND logic (PFAND), underlie several natural timer circuits involved in processes such as cell cycle transitions, T cell activation, and departure from the pluripotent state. The biochemical network motifs described in this study form a basis for understanding the common ways in which cells make dynamic decisions.",

    "abstract": "Bradyzoite differentiation is marked by major changes in gene expression resulting in a parasite that expresses a new repertoire of surface antigens hidden inside a modified parasitophorous vacuole called the tissue cyst. The factors that control this important life cycle transition are not well understood. Here we describe an important Toxoplasma transcriptional repressor mechanism controlling bradyzoite differentiation that operates exclusively in the tachyzoite stage. The ApiAP2 factor, AP2IV-4, is a nuclear factor dynamically expressed in late S phase through mitosis/cytokinesis of the tachyzoite cell cycle. Remarkably, deletion of the AP2IV-4 locus resulted in the increased expression of bradyzoite mRNAs in replicating tachyzoites, and in two different genetic lineages we confirmed the misexpression of tissue cyst wall components (e.g. BPK1, MCP4, CST1) and the bradyzoite surface antigen SRS9 in the tachyzoite stage. In the murine animal model, the loss of AP2IV-4 had profound biological consequences. Type II prugniaud strain parasites lacking AP2IV-4 were unable to form tissue cysts in brain tissue and the absence of this factor also recruited a potent immune response characterized by increases inflammatory monocytes, IFN-{gamma} and higher numbers of both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells. Altogether, these results indicate that suppression of bradyzoite antigens by AP2IV-4 during acute infection is required for Toxoplasma to establish a chronic infection in the immune-competent host.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe Toxoplasma biology that underlies the establishment of a chronic infection is developmental conversion of the acute tachyzoite stage into the latent bradyzoite-tissue cyst stage. Despite the important clinical consequences of this developmental pathway, the molecular basis of the switch mechanisms that control formation of the tissue cyst is still poorly understood. A fundamental feature of tissue cyst formation is the expression of bradyzoite-specific genes. Here we show the transcription factor AP2IV-4 directly silences bradyzoite mRNA and protein expression in the acute tachyzoite stage demonstrating that developmental control of tissue cyst formation is as much about when not to express bradyzoite genes as it is about when to activate them. Loosing the suppression of bradyzoite gene expression in the acute tachyzoite stage caused by deleting AP2IV-4 blocked the establishment of chronic disease in healthy animals through the pre-arming of the immune system suggesting a possible strategy for preventing chronic Toxoplasma infections.",

    "abstract": "Microbial production of fuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass provides promising bio-renewable alternatives to the conventional petroleum-based products. However, heterogeneous sugar composition of lignocellulosic biomass hinders efficient microbial conversion due to carbon catabolite repression. The most abundant sugar monomers in lignocel-lulosic biomass materials are glucose and xylose. While industrial Escherichia coli strains efficiently utilize glucose, their ability to utilize xylose is often repressed in the presence of glucose. Here we independently evolved three E. coli strains from the same ancestor to achieve high efficiency for xylose fermentation. Each evolved strain has a point mutation in a transcriptional activator for xylose catabolic operons, either CRP or XylR, and these mutations are demonstrated to enhance xylose fermentation by allelic replacements. Identified XylR variants (R121C and P363S) have a higher affinity to their DNA binding sites, leading to a xylose catabolic activation independent of catabolite repression control. Upon introducing these amino acid substitutions into the E. coli D-lactate producer TG114, 94 % of a glucose-xylose mixture (50 g L-1 each) was utilized in mineral salt media that led to a 50 % increase in product titer after 96 h of fermentation. The two amino acid substitutions in XylR enhance xylose utilization and release glucose-induced repression in different E. coli hosts, including wild-type, suggesting its potential wide application in industrial E. coli biocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed, single-stranded RNA molecules. Recent studies in human showed that circRNAs can arise via transcription of reverse complementary pairs of transposons. Given the prevalence of transposons in the maize genome and dramatic genomic variation driven by transposons, we hypothesize that transposons in maize may be involved in the formation of circRNAs and further modulate phenotypic variation. To test our hypothesis, we performed circRNA-Seq on B73 seedling leaves and integrate these data with 977 publicly available mRNA-Seq datasets. We uncovered 1,551 high-confidence maize circRNAs, which show distinct genomic features as compared to linear transcripts. Comprehensive analyses demonstrated that LINE1-like elements (LLE) and their Reverse Complementary Pairs (LLERCPs) are significantly enriched in the flanking regions of circRNAs. Interestingly, the accumulation of circRNA transcripts increases, while the accumulation of linear transcripts decreases as the number of LLERCPs increases. Furthermore, genes with LLERCP-mediated circRNAs are enriched among loci that are associated with phenotypic variation. These results suggest that LLERCPs can modulate phenotypic variation by the formation of circRNAs. As a proof of concept, we showed that the presence/absence variation of LLERCPs could result in expression variation of one cicrRNA, circ352, and further related to plant height through the interaction between circRNA and functional linear transcript. Our first glimpse of circRNAs uncovers a new role for transposons in the modulation of transcriptomic and phenotypic variation via the formation of circRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Species in the genus Cercospora cause economically devastating diseases in sugar beet, maize, rice, soy bean and other major food crops. Here we sequenced the genome of the sugar beet pathogen C. beticola and found it encodes 63 putative secondary metabolite gene clusters, including the cercosporin toxin biosynthesis (CTB) cluster. We show that the CTB gene cluster has experienced multiple duplications and horizontal transfers across a spectrum of plant pathogenic fungi, including the wide host range Colletotrichum genus as well as the rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Although cercosporin biosynthesis has been thought to-date to rely on an eight gene CTB cluster, our phylogenomic analysis revealed gene collinearity adjacent to the established cluster in all CTB cluster-harboring species. We demonstrate that the CTB cluster is larger than previously recognized and includes cercosporin facilitator protein (CFP) previously shown to be involved with cercosporin auto-resistance, and four additional genes required for cercosporin biosynthesis including the final pathway enzymes that install the unusual cercosporin methylenedioxy bridge. Finally, we demonstrate production of cercosporin by Colletotrichum fioriniae, the first known cercosporin producer within this agriculturally important genus. Thus, our results provide new insight into the intricate evolution and biology of a toxin critical to agriculture and broaden the production of cercosporin to another fungal genus containing many plant pathogens of important crops worldwide.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSpecies in the fungal genus Cercospora cause diseases in many important crops worldwide. Their success as pathogens is largely due to the secretion of cercosporin during infection. We report that the cercosporin toxin biosynthesis (CTB) cluster is ancient and was horizontally transferred to diverse fungal pathogens on an unprecedented scale. Since these analyses revealed genes adjacent to the established CTB cluster, we evaluated their role in C. beticola to show that four are necessary for cercosporin biosynthesis. Finally, we confirmed that the apple pathogen Colletotrichum fioriniae produces cercosporin, the first case outside the family Mycosphaerellaceae. Other Colletotrichum plant pathogens also harbor the CTB cluster, which points to a wider concern that this toxin may play in virulence and human health.",

Such compartmentalization processes could occur within retrosplenial cortex, a structure whose neurons simultaneously encode position within routes and other spatial coordinate systems. Here, retrosplenial cortex neurons were recorded as rats traversed a track having recurrent structure at multiple scales. Consistent with a major role in compartmentalization of complex routes, individual RSC neurons exhibited periodic activation patterns that repeated across route segments having the same shape. Concurrently, a larger population of RSC neurons exhibited single-cycle periodicity over the full route, effectively defining a framework for encoding of sub-route positions relative to the whole. The same population simultaneously provides a novel metric for distance from each route position to all others. Together, the findings implicate retrosplenial cortex in the extraction of path sub-spaces, the encoding of their spatial relationships to each other, and path integration.",

    "abstract": "Genomic loci with regulatory potential can be identified and annotated with various properties. For example, genomic sites may be annotated as being bound by a given transcription factor (TF) in one or more cell types. The same sites may be further labeled as being proximal or distal to known promoters. Given such a collection of labeled sites, it is natural to ask what sequence features are associated with each annotation label. However, discovering such label-specific sequence features is often confounded by overlaps between annotation labels; e.g. if regulatory sites specific to a given cell type are also more likely to be promoter-proximal, it is difficult to assess whether motifs identified in that set of sites are associated with the cell type or associated with promoters. In order to meet this challenge, we developed SeqUnwinder, a principled approach to deconvolving interpretable discriminative sequence features associated with overlapping annotation labels. We demonstrate the novel analysis abilities of SeqUnwinder using three examples. Firstly, we show SeqUnwinders ability to unravel sequence features associated with the dynamic binding behavior of TFs during motor neuron programming from features associated with chromatin state in the initial embryonic stem cells. Secondly, we characterize distinct sequence properties of multi-condition and cell-specific TF binding sites after controlling for uneven associations with promoter proximity. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of SeqUnwinder to discover cell-specific sequence features from over one hundred thousand genomic loci that display DNase I hypersensitivity in one or more ENCODE cell lines.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/seqcode/sequnwinder",

    "abstract": "Cell size and individual growth rates vary substantially across genetically identical cell populations. This variation cannot entirely be explained by asynchronous cell division cycles, but also needs to take into account the differences in the histories that cells experience during their lifespan. We describe a stochastic framework to characterise cell size histories in an exponentially growing population. We show that these histories differ from cells observed in isolation, such as observed in mother machines. Quantifying these historical fluctuations allows us to predict the population growth rate. We highlight that the maximum attainable population growth cannot exceed the rate at which an average cell grows, but the population doubles faster than an average cell doubles its size. We validate this prediction using recent single-cell data. The theory thus provides fundamental limits on population fitness in terms of individual cell properties.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous EEG-fMRI has been vastly used to investigate functional networks of brain combining high spatial resolution (millimeter) of fMRI with high temporal resolution (millisecond) of EEG. However, to extract the most relevant information from the acquired data, it is necessary to develop analysis methods with less ad hoc assumptions. To this end, brain rhythms are often used which are the specific frequency-bands of EEG signal and assumed to represent diverse sub-second cognitive processes at different parts of the cortex. Furthermore, single-trial analysis of EEG is believed to show more realistic picture of ongoing and event-related activities of brain. Here, we present a nonparametric multiple change-point detection and estimation method for the single-trial analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiment recorded during auditory and visual oddball tasks. In a simple attention task like oddball, the frontal cortex of brain is responsible to distinguish and respond appropriately to target versus standard events. By using EEG signal at the frontal cortex, we show that the -band activity changes according to \\\"inhibition timing\\\" hypothesis and the {beta}-band activity is in line with \\\"maintaining the status quo\\\" hypothesis. Furthermore, using these activities to build regressors in the GLM analysis of fMRI, we localize active brain regions with high spatial and temporal resolutions and elaborate further on the coordination of attentional networks across brain.",

    "abstract": "Using a novel fMRI-based inter-subject functional correlation (ISFC) approach, which isolates stimulus-locked inter-regional correlation patterns, we compared the cortical topology of the neural circuit for face processing in participants with congenital prosopagnosia (CP) and matched controls. Whereas the anterior temporal lobe served as the major network hub for face processing in controls, this was not the case for the CPs. Instead, this group evinced hyper-connectivity in posterior regions of the visual cortex, mostly associated with the lateral occipital and the inferior temporal cortices. Moreover, the extent to which the network organization was atypical differed as a function of the severity of the face recognition deficit. These results offer new insights into the perturbed cortical topology in CP, which may serve as the underlying neural basis of the behavioral deficits typical of this disorder. The approach adopted here has the potential to uncover altered topologies in other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCongenital prosopagnosia (CP;  face blindness), a developmental deficit in face recognition, is thought to affect up to 3% of the population. Understanding its neural basis is challenging as there is no obvious deficit on conventional structural or functional MRI scans. Using an innovative, fMRI-based inter-subject correlation approach geared towards tracking inter-regional stimulus-locked brain activation, the present study uncovers marked topological differences in a distributed brain network of higher-order visual regions in CP relative to controls. Alteration in topology also differs as a function of the severity of the deficit. These findings shed new light on the neural perturbations underlying CP, and the analytic approach we have adopted may have utility in elucidating the neural basis of other neurodevelopmental disorders such as dyslexia or amusia.",

Tunable genotyping-by-sequencing (tGBS(R)), a novel genome reduction method, consists of the ligation of single-strand oligos to restriction enzyme fragments. DNA barcodes are added during PCR amplification; additional (selective) nucleotides included at the 3-end of the PCR primers result in more genome reduction as compared to conventional GBS methods. By adjusting the number of selective bases different numbers of genomic sites can be targeted for sequencing. Because this genome reduction strategy concentrates sequencing reads on fewer sites, SNP calls are based on more reads than conventional GBS, resulting in higher SNP calling accuracy (>97-99%) even for heterozygous sites and less missing data per marker. tGBS genotyping is expected to be particularly useful for genomic selection, which requires the ability to genotype populations of individuals that are heterozygous at many loci.",

However, little is known about the formation of the underlying circuits, or how they integrate sensory information for motor actions. Here, we show that paired embryonic neuroblasts generate central complex ring neurons that mediate sensory-motor transformation and action selection in Drosophila. Lineage analysis resolves four ring neuron subtypes, R1-R4, that form GABAergic inhibition circuitry among inhibitory sister cells. Genetic manipulations, together with functional imaging, demonstrate subtype-specific R neurons mediate the selection and maintenance of behavioural activity. A computational model substantiates genetic and behavioural observations suggesting that R neuron circuitry functions as salience detector using competitive inhibition to amplify, maintain or switch between activity states. The resultant gating mechanism translates facilitation, inhibition and disinhibition of behavioural activity as R neuron functions into selection of motor actions and their organisation into action sequences.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils are responsible for the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Their nuclei are uniquely structured as multiple lobes that establish a highly constrained nuclear environment. Here we found that neutrophil differentiation was not associated with large-scale changes in the number and sizes of topologically associating domains. However, neutrophil genomes were enriched for long-range genomic interactions that spanned multiple topologically associating domains. Population-based simulation of spherical and toroid genomes revealed declining radii of gyration for neutrophil chromosomes. We found that neutrophil genomes were highly enriched for heterochromatic genomic interactions across vast genomic distances, a process named super-contraction. Super-contraction involved genomic regions located in the heterochromatic compartment in both progenitors and neutrophils or genomic regions that switched from the euchromatic to the heterochromatic compartment during neutrophil differentiation. Super-contraction was accompanied by the repositioning of centromeres, pericentromeres and Long-Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) to the neutrophil nuclear lamina. We found that Lamin-B Receptor expression was required to attach centromeric and pericentromeric repeats but not LINE-1 elements to the lamina. Differentiating neutrophils also repositioned ribosomal DNA and mini-nucleoli to the lamina: a process that was closely associated with sharply reduced ribosomal RNA expression. We propose that large-scale chromatin reorganization involving super-contraction and recruitment of heterochromatin and nucleoli to the nuclear lamina facilitate the folding of the neutrophil genome into a confined geometry imposed by a multi-lobed nuclear architecture.",

    "abstract": "Genome structures are dynamic and non-randomly organized in the nucleus of higher eukaryotes. To maximize the accuracy and coverage of 3D genome structural models, it is important to integrate all available sources of experimental information about a genomes organization. It remains a major challenge to integrate such data from various complementary experimental methods. Here, we present an approach for data integration to determine a population of complete 3D genome structures that are statistically consistent with data from both genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and lamina-DamID experiments. Our structures resolve the genome at the resolution of topological domains, and reproduce simultaneously both sets of experimental data. Importantly, this framework allows for structural heterogeneity between cells, and hence accounts for the expected plasticity of genome structures. As a case study we choose Drosophila melanogaster embryonic cells, for which both data types are available. Our 3D geome structures have strong predictive power for structural features not directly visible in the initial data sets, and reproduce experimental hallmarks of the D. melanogaster genome organization from independent and our own imaging experiments. Also they reveal a number of new insights about the genome organization and its functional relevance, including the preferred locations of heterochromatic satellites of differnet chromosomes, and observations about homologous pairing that cannot be directly observed in the original Hi-C or lamina-DamID data. To our knowledge our approach is the first that allows systematic integration of Hi-C and lamina DamID data for complete 3D genome structure calculation, while also explicitly considering genome structural variability.",

The advent of third generation sequencing technologies is providing new insights into genomic contribution to diseases with complex mutation events, but have prohibitively high computational costs. Over 1,300 CPU hours are required to align reads from a 54x coverage of the human genome to a reference (estimated using [1]), and over 15,600 CPU hours to assemble the reads de novo [2]. This paper proposes \\\"Darwin\\\" - a hardware-accelerated framework for genomic sequence alignment that, without sacrificing sensitivity, provides 125x and 15.6x speedup over the state-of-the-art software counterparts for reference-guided and de novo assembly of third generation sequencing reads, respectively. For pairwise alignment of sequences, Darwin is over 39,000x more energy-efficient than software. Darwin uses (i) a novel filtration strategy, called D-SOFT, to reduce the search space for sequence alignment at high speed, and (ii) a hardware-accelerated version of GACT, a novel algorithm to generate near-optimal alignments of arbitrarily long genomic sequences using constant memory for trace-back. Darwin is adaptable, with tunable speed and sensitivity to match emerging sequencing technologies and to meet the requirements of genomic applications beyond read assembly.",
