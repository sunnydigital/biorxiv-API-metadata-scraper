    "abstract": "To understand the forces driving differentiation and diversification in wild bacterial populations, we must be able to delineate and track ecologically relevant units through space and time. Mapping metagenomic sequences to reference genomes derived from the same environment can reveal genetic heterogeneity within populations, and in some cases, be used to identify boundaries between genetically similar, but ecologically distinct, populations. Here we examine population-level heterogeneity within abundant and ubiquitous freshwater bacterial groups such as the acI Actinobacteria and LD12 Alphaproteobacteria (the freshwater sister clade to the marine SAR11) using 33 single cell genomes and a 5-year metagenomic time series. The single cell genomes grouped into 15 monophyletic clusters (termed \\\"tribes\\\") that share at least 97.9% 16S rRNA identity. Distinct populations were identified within most tribes based on the patterns of metagenomic read recruitments to single-cell genomes representing these tribes. Genetically distinct populations within tribes of the acI actinobacterial lineage living in the same lake had different seasonal abundance patterns, suggesting these populations were also ecologically distinct. In contrast, sympatric LD12 populations were less genetically differentiated. This suggests that within one lake, some freshwater lineages harbor genetically discrete (but still closely related) and ecologically distinct populations, while other lineages are composed of less differentiated populations with overlapping niches. Our results point at an interplay of evolutionary and ecological forces acting on these communities that can be observed in real time.",

Recently introduced methods perform this task under the infinite-sites assumption, violations of which, due to chromosomal deletions and loss of heterozygosity, necessitate the development of inference methods that utilize finite-site models. We propose a statistical inference method for tumor phylogenies from noisy SCS data under a finite-sites model. The performance of our method on synthetic and experimental datasets from two colorectal cancer patients to trace evolutionary lineages in primary and metastatic tumors suggest that employing a finite-sites model leads to improved inference of tumor phylogenies.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100045). Parallel evolution, defined as identical changes arising in independent populations, is often attributed to similar selective pressures favoring the fixation of identical genetic changes. However, some level of parallel evolution is also expected if mutation rates are heterogeneous across regions of the genome. Theory suggests that mutation and selection can have equal impacts on patterns of parallel evolution, however empirical studies have yet to jointly quantify the importance of these two processes. Here, we introduce several statistical models to examine the contributions of mutation and selection heterogeneity to shaping parallel evolutionary changes at the gene-level. Using this framework we analyze published data from forty experimentally evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations. We can partition the effects of a number of genomic variables into those affecting patterns of parallel evolution via effects on the rate of arising mutations, and those affecting the retention versus loss of the arising mutations (i.e. selection). Our results suggest that gene-to-gene heterogeneity in both mutation and selection, associated with gene length, recombination rate, and number of protein domains drive parallel evolution at both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites. While there are still a number of parallel changes that are not well described, we show that allowing for heterogeneous rates of mutation and selection can provide improved predictions of the prevalence and degree of parallel evolution.\\n\\nData archival locationDryad, doi to be included later",

    "abstract": "The duration of sleep varies dramatically between species, yet little is known about genetic bases or evolutionary factors driving this variation in behavior. The Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, exists as surface populations that inhabit rivers, and multiple independently derived cave populations with convergent evolution on sleep loss. The number of Hypocretin/Orexin (HCRT)-positive hypothalamic neurons is increased significantly in cavefish, and HCRT is upregulated at both the transcript and protein levels. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of HCRT signaling increases sleep duration in cavefish without affecting sleep in surface fish, suggesting enhanced HCRT signaling underlies sleep loss in cavefish. Ablation of the lateral line or starvation, manipulations that selectively promote sleep in cavefish, inhibit hcrt expression in cavefish while having little effect in surface fish. These findings provide the first evidence of genetic and neuronal changes that contribute to the evolution of sleep loss, and support a conserved role for HCRT in sleep regulation.",

However, while there is general agreement within ecology that the first author is the person who contributed the most to a particular project, there is less agreement regarding whether being last author is a position of significance and regarding what is indicated by someone being the corresponding author on a manuscript. Using an analysis of papers published in American Naturalist, Ecology, Evolution, and Oikos, I found that: 1) the number of authors on papers is increasing over time; 2) the proportion of first authors as corresponding author has increased over time, as has the proportion of last authors as corresponding author; 3) 84% of papers published in 2016 had the first author as corresponding author; and 4) geographic regions differed in the likelihood of having the first (or last) author as corresponding author. I also carried out an online survey to better understand views on last and corresponding authorship. This survey revealed that most ecologists view the last author as the \\\"senior\\\" author on a paper (that is, the person who runs the research group in which most of the work was carried out), and most ecologists view the corresponding author as the person taking full responsibility for a paper. However, there was substantial variation in views on authorship, especially corresponding authorship. Given these results, I suggest that discussions of authorship have as their starting point that the first author will be corresponding author and the senior author will be last author. I also suggest ways of deciding author order in cases where two senior authors contributed equally.",

    "abstract": "Tubulins, the building block of microtubules (MTs), play a critical role in both supporting and regulating neurite growth. Eukaryotic genomes contain multiple tubulin isotypes, and their missense mutations cause a range of neurodevelopmental defects. Using the C. elegans touch receptor neurons, we analyzed the effects of 67 tubulin missense mutations on neurite growth. Three types of mutations emerged: 1) loss-of-function mutations, which cause mild defects in neurite growth; 2) antimorphic mutations, which map to the GTP binding site and intradimer and interdimer interfaces, significantly reduce MT stability, and cause severe neurite growth defects; and 3) neomorphic mutations, which map to the exterior surface, increase MT stability, and cause ectopic neurite growth. Structure-function analysis reveals a causal relationship between tubulin structure and MT stability. This stability affects neuronal morphogenesis. As part of this analysis, we engineered several disease-associated human tubulin mutations into C. elegans genes and examined their impact on neuronal development at the cellular level. We also discovered an -tubulin (TBA-7) that appears to destabilize MTs. Loss of TBA-7 led to the formation of hyperstable MTs and the generation of ectopic neurites; the lack of potential sites for polyamination and polyglutamination on TBA-7 may be responsible for this destabilization.\\n\\nTable of Content (TOC) Highlight SummaryDifferent tubulin isotypes perform different functions in the regulation of MT structure and neurite growth, and missense mutations of tubulin genes have three types of distinct effects on MT stability and neurite growth. One -tubulin isotype appears to induce relative instability due to the lack of potential post-translational modification sites.",

    "abstract": "Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) is a regression based method to study task modulated brain connectivity. Despite its popularity in functional MRI (fMRI) studies, its reliability and reproducibility have not been evaluated. We investigated reproducibility and reliability of PPI effects during a simple visual task, and examined the effect of deconvolution on the PPI results. A large open-access dataset was analyzed (n = 138), where a visual task was scanned twice with repetition times (TRs) of 645 ms and 1400 ms, respectively. We first replicated our previous results by using the left and right middle occipital gyrus as seeds. Then ROI-wise (regions of interest) analysis was performed among twenty visual-related thalamic and cortical regions, and negative PPI effects were found between many ROIs with the posterior fusiform gyrus as a hub region. Both the seed-based and ROI-wise results were similar between the two runs and between the two PPI methods with and without deconvolution. The non-deconvolution method and the short TR run in general had larger effect sizes and greater extents. However, the deconvolution method performed worse in the 645 ms TR run than the 1400 ms TR run in the voxel-wise analysis. Given the general similar results between the two methods and the uncertainty of deconvolution, we suggest that deconvolution may be not necessary for PPI analysis on block-designed data. Lastly, intraclass correlations between the two runs were much lower for the PPI effects than the activation main effects, which raise cautions on performing inter-subject correlations and group comparisons on PPI effects.",

    "abstract": "Microbes are critical in carbon and nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems. Members of the Verrucomicrobia are ubiquitous in such systems, yet their roles and ecophysiology are not well understood. In this study, we recovered 19 Verrucomicrobia draft genomes by sequencing 184 time-series metagenomes from a eutrophic lake and a humic bog that differ in carbon source and nutrient availabilities. These genomes span four of the seven previously defined Verrucomicrobia subdivisions, and greatly expand the known genomic diversity of freshwater Verrucomicrobia. Genome analysis revealed their potential role as (poly)saccharide-degraders in freshwater, uncovered interesting genomic features for this life style, and suggested their adaptation to nutrient availabilities in their environments. Between the two lakes, Verrucomicrobia populations differ significantly in glycoside hydrolase gene abundance and functional profiles, reflecting the autochthonous and terrestrially-derived allochthonous carbon sources of the two ecosystems respectively. Interestingly, a number of genomes recovered from the bog contained gene clusters that potentially encode a novel porin-multiheme cytochrome c complex and might be involved in extracellular electron transfer in the anoxic humic-rich environment. Notably, most epilimnion genomes have large numbers of so-called \\\"Planctomycete-specific\\\" cytochrome c-containing genes, which exhibited nearly opposite distribution patterns with glycoside hydrolase genes, probably associated with the different environmental oxygen availability and carbohydrate complexity between lakes/layers. Overall, the recovered genomes are a major step towards understanding the role, ecophysiology and distribution of Verrucomicrobia in freshwater.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEFreshwater Verrucomicrobia are cosmopolitan in lakes and rivers, yet their roles and ecophysiology are not well understood, as cultured freshwater Verrucomicrobia are restricted to one subdivision of this phylum. Here, we greatly expand the known genomic diversity of this freshwater lineage by recovering 19 Verrucomicrobia draft genomes from 184 metagenomes collected from a eutrophic lake and a humic bog across multiple years. Most of these genomes represent first freshwater representatives of several Verrucomicrobia subdivisions. Genomic analysis revealed Verrucomicrobia as potential (poly)saccharide-degraders, and suggested their adaptation to carbon source of different origins in the two contrasting ecosystems. We identified putative extracellular electron transfer genes and so-called \\\"Planctomycete-specific\\\" cytochrome c-containing genes, and found their distinct distribution patterns between the lakes/layers. Overall, our analysis greatly advances the understanding of the function, ecophysiology and distribution of freshwater Verrucomicrobia, while highlighting their potential role in freshwater carbon cycling.",

    "abstract": "Most breast cancer deaths are caused by metastasis and treatment options beyond radiation and cytotoxic drugs, which have severe side effects, and hormonal treatments, which are or become ineffective for many patients, are urgently needed. This study reanalyzed existing data from three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using a novel computational biostatistics approach (muGWAS), which had been validated in studies of 600-2000 subjects in epilepsy and autism. MuGWAS jointly analyzes several neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms while incorporating knowledge about genetics of heritable diseases into the statistical method and about GWAS into the rules for determining adaptive genome-wide significance.\\n\\nResults from three independent GWAS of 1000-2000 subjects each, which were made available under the National Institute of Healths \\\"Up For A Challenge\\\" (U4C) project, not only confirmed cell-cycle control and receptor/AKT signaling, but, for the first time in breast cancer GWAS, also consistently identified many genes involved in endo-/exocytosis (EEC), most of which had already been observed in functional and expression studies of breast cancer. In particular, the findings include genes that translocate (ATP8A1, ATP8B1, ANO4, ABCA1) and metabolize (AGPAT3, AGPAT4, DGKQ, LPPR1) phospholipids entering the phosphatidylinositol cycle, which controls EEC. These novel findings suggest scavenging phospholipids via alpha-cyclodextrins (CD) as a novel intervention to control local spread of cancer, packaging of exosomes (which prepare distant microenvironment for organ-specific metastases), and endocytosis of {beta}1 integrins (which are required for spread of metastatic phenotype and mesenchymal migration of tumor cells).\\n\\nBeta-cyclodextrins ({beta}CD) have already been shown to be effective in in vitro and animal studies of breast cancer, but exhibits cholesterol-related ototoxicity. The smaller CDs also scavenges phospholipids, but cannot fit cholesterol. An in-vitro study presented here confirms hydroxypropyl (HP)-CD to be twice as effective as HP{beta}CD against migration of human cells of both receptor negative and estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer.\\n\\nIf the previous successful animal studies with {beta}CDs are replicated with the safer and more effective CDs, clinical trials of adjuvant treatment with CDs are warranted. Ultimately, all breast cancer are expected to benefit from treatment with HPCD, but women with triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) will benefit most, because they have fewer treatment options and their cancer advances more aggressively.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIssues of balancing data accessibility with ethical considerations and governance of a genomics research biobank, Generation Scotland, are explored within the evolving policy landscape of the past ten years. During this time data sharing and open data access have become increasingly important topics in biomedical research. Decisions around data access are influenced by local arrangements for governance and practices such as linkage to health records, and the global through policies for biobanking and the sharing of data with large-scale biomedical research data resources and consortia.\\n\\nMethodsWe use a literature review of policy relevant documents which apply to the conduct of biobanks in two areas: support for open access and the protection of data subjects and researchers managing a bioresource. We present examples of decision making within a biobank based upon observations of the Generation Scotland Access Committee. We reflect upon how the drive towards open access raises ethical dilemmas for established biorepositories containing data and samples from human subjects.\\n\\nResultsDespite much discussion in science policy literature about standardisation, the contextual aspects of biobanking are often overlooked. Using our engagement with GS we demonstrate the importance of local arrangements in the creation of a responsive ethical approach to biorepository governance. We argue that governance decisions regarding access to the biobank are intertwined with considerations about maintenance and viability at the local level. We show that in addition to the focus upon ever more universal and standardised practices, the local expertise gained in the management of such repositories must be supported.\\n\\nConclusionsA commitment to open access in genomics research has found almost universal backing in science and health policy circles, but repositories of data and samples from human subjects may have to operate under managed access, to protect privacy, align with participant consent and ensure that the resource can be managed in a sustainable way. Data access committees need to be reflexive and flexible, to cope with changing technology and opportunities and threats from the wider data sharing environment. To understand these interactions also involves nurturing what is particular about the biobank in its local context.",

Traditionally, MLST is based on identifying sequence types from a small number of housekeeping genes.

Such large-scale MLST schemes have been shown to provide a finer resolution and are increasingly used in various contexts such as hospital outbreaks or foodborne pathogen outbreaks. This methodological shift raises new computational challenges, especially given the large size of the schemes involved.

    "abstract": "Secondary metabolites are heterogeneous natural products that often mediate interactions between species. The tryptophan-derived secondary metabolite, psilocin, is a serotonin receptor agonist that induces altered states of consciousness. A phylogenetically disjunct group of mushroom-forming fungi in the Agaricales produce the psilocin prodrug, psilocybin. Spotty phylogenetic distributions of fungal compounds are sometimes explained by horizontal transfer of metabolic gene clusters among unrelated fungi with overlapping niches. We report the discovery of a psilocybin gene cluster in three hallucinogenic mushroom genomes, and evidence for its horizontal transfer between fungal lineages. Patterns of gene distribution and transmission suggest that psilocybin provides a fitness advantage in the dung and late wood-decay niches, which may be reservoirs of fungal indole-based metabolites that alter behavior of mycophagous and wood-eating invertebrates. These hallucinogenic mushroom genomes will serve as models in neurochemical ecology, advancing the prospecting and synthetic biology of novel neuropharmaceuticals.",

    "abstract": "Protein folding in the cell requires ATP-driven chaperone machines. It is poorly understood, however, how these machines fold proteins. Here we propose that the conserved Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones support formation of the folding nucleus by providing a gradient of decreasing hydrophobicity. Early on the folding pathway Hsp70 uses its highly hydrophobic binding pocket to recover a stalled, unproductive folding intermediate. The aggressive nature of Hsp70 action, however, blocks productive folding by grabbing hydrophobic, core-forming segments. This precludes on-pathway nucleation at high, physiological Hsp70 levels. Transfer to the less hydrophobic Hsp90 enables the intermediate to resume forming its folding nucleus. Subsequently, the protein enters a spontaneous folding trajectory towards its native state, independent of the ATPase activities of both Hsp70 and Hsp90. Our findings provide a general mechanistic concept for chaperoned protein folding.",

    "abstract": "1Microbes are present in high abundances in the environment and in human-associated microbiomes, often exceeding one million per milliliter. Viruses of microbes are present in even higher abundances and are important in shaping microbial populations, communities, and ecosystems. Given the relative specificity of viral infection, it is essential to identify the functional linkages between viruses and their microbial hosts, particularly given dynamic changes in virus and host abundances. Multiple approaches have been proposed to infer infection networks from time-series of in situ communities, among which correlation-based approaches have emerged as the de facto standard. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of correlation-based inference methods using an in silico approach. In doing so, we compare predicted networks to actual networks to assess the self-consistency of correlation-based inference. At odds with assumptions underlying its widespread use, we find that correlation is a poor predictor of interactions in the context of viral infection and lysis of microbial hosts. The failure to predict interactions holds for methods which leverage product-moment, time-lagged, and relative-abundance based correlations. In closing, we discuss alternative inference methods, particularly model-based methods, as a means to infer interactions in complex microbial communities with viruses.\\n\\n2 ImportanceInferring interactions from population time-series is an active and ongoing area of research. It is relevant across many biological systems - in particular in virus-microbe communities, but also in gene regulatory networks, neural networks, and ecological communities broadly. Correlation-based inference - using correlations to predict interactions - is widespread. However, it is well known that \\\"correlation does not imply causation\\\". Despite this, many studies apply correlation-based inference methods to experimental time-series without first assessing the potential scope for accurate inference. Here, we find that several correlation-based inference methods fail to recover interactions within in silica virus-microbe communities, raising questions on their relevance when applied in situ.",

    "abstract": "More than 30% of mRNAs are repressed by microRNAs (miRNAs) but most repressions are too weak to have a phenotypic consequence. The diffuse actions have been a central conundrum in understanding the functions of miRNAs. By applying the May-Wigner theory used in foodweb studies, we show that i) weak repressions cumulatively enhance the stability of gene regulatory network (GRN), and ii) broad and weak repressions confer greater stability than a few strong ones. Transcriptome data show that yeast cells, which do not have miRNAs, use strong and non-specific mRNA degradation to stabilize their GRN; in contrast, human cells use miRNAs to increase degradation more modestly and selectively. Simulations indicate that miRNA repressions should be distributed broadly to >25% of mRNAs, in agreement with observations. As predicted, extremely highly expressed genes are avoided and transcription factors are preferred by miRNAs. In conclusion, the diffuse repression by miRNAs is likely a system-level strategy for enhancing GRN stability. This stability control may be the mechanistic basis of \\\"canalization\\\" (i.e., developmental homeostasis within each species), sometimes hypothesized to be a main function of miRNAs.",

However, this conclusion is largely drawn from the observation that promoter DNA methylation inversely correlates with gene expression. The effect of forced DNA methylation on endogenous promoters has yet to be comprehensively assessed. Here, we conducted artificial methylation of thousands of promoters in human cells using an artificial zinc finger-DNMT3A fusion protein, enabling assessment of the effect of forced DNA methylation upon transcription and histone modifications, and the durability of DNA methylation after the removal of the fusion protein. We find that DNA methylation is frequently insufficient to transcriptionally repress promoters. Furthermore, DNA methylation deposited at promoter regions associated with H3K4me3 is rapidly erased after removal of the zinc finger-DNMT3A fusion protein. Finally, we demonstrate that induced DNA methylation can exist simultaneously on promoter nucleosomes that possess the active histone modification H3K4me3. These findings suggest that promoter DNA methylation is not generally sufficient for transcriptional inactivation, with implications for the emerging field of epigenome engineering.",

The growth, stability and adhesive functionality of these structures are tightly regulated by mechanical stress, yet, despite the extensive characterization of the integrin adhesome, the mechanisms underlying FA mechanosensitivity are still poorly understood. One of the key candidates for regulating FA-associated mechanosensing is vinculin, a prominent FA component, which was proposed to possess either closed (\\\"auto-inhibited\\\") or open (active) conformations. However, a direct demonstration of the nature of conformational transition between the two states is still absent. In this study we combined multiple structural and biological approaches to probe the transition from auto-inhibited to active conformation, and determine its effects on FA structure and dynamics. We further show here that the closed to open transition requires two sequential steps that can differentially regulate FA growth and stability.",

However, a persistent challenge is the development of assays capable of defining KAT activity directly in living cells. Towards this goal, here we report the application of a previously reported dCas9-p300 fusion as a transcriptional reporter of KAT activity. First we benchmark the activity of dCas9-p300 relative to other dCas9-based transcriptional activators, and demonstrate its compatibility with second generation short guide RNA architectures. Next, we repurpose this technology to rapidly identify small molecule inhibitors of acetylation-dependent gene expression. These studies validate a recently reported p300 inhibitor chemotype, and reveal a role for p300s bromodomain in dCas9-p300-mediated transcriptional activation. Comparison with other CRISPR-Cas9 transcriptional activators highlights the inherent ligand tuneable nature of dCas9-p300 fusions, suggesting new opportunities for orthogonal gene expression control. Overall, our studies highlight dCas9-p300 as a powerful tool for studying gene expression mechanisms in which acetylation plays a causal role, and provide a foundation for future applications requiring spatiotemporal control over acetylation at specific genomic loci.",

The in-vitro aggregation data was complemented using measurements inside live neuroblastoma cells by employing a small molecule labeling technique. An inhibitor molecule (arginine), which delayed the late event of amyloidosis, was found to bind to the protein, shifting the early conformational fluctuations towards a compact state. In contrast, a facilitator of late aggregation (glutamate), was found to be excluded from the protein surface. The presence of glutamate was found to speed up the oligomer formation at the early stage. We found that the effects of the inhibitor and facilitator were additive and as a result they maintained a ratio at which they cancelled each others influence on different stages of alpha synuclein aggregation.",

This method, called variable dose analysis (VDA), is highly sensitive to viability phenotypes and reproducibly detects SS/L interactions. We applied the VDA method to search for SS/L interactions with TSC1 and TSC2, the two tumor suppressors underlying tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and generated a SS/L network for TSC.

The transcriptional expression of genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis was altered. The mRNA expression levels of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH{beta}) were significantly increased.

However, the underlying causes of sexual conflict, and the potential for resolution, remains hotly debated. Using transcriptome resequencing data from male and female guppies, we use a novel approach, combining patterns of genetic diversity and inter-sexual divergence in allele frequency, to distinguish the different scenarios that give rise to sexual conflict, and how this conflict may be resolved through regulatory evolution. We show that reproductive fitness is the main source of sexual conflict, and this is resolved via the evolution of male-biased expression. Furthermore, resolution of sexual conflict produces significant differences in genetic architecture between males and females, which in turn leads to specific alleles influencing sex-specific viability. Together, our findings suggest an important role for sexual conflict in shaping broad patterns of genome diversity, and show that regulatory evolution is a rapid and efficient route to the resolution of conflict.",

Here we report a genome wide association study in 116 255 UK Biobank participants who responded yes/no to the question \\\"Would you consider yourself a risk-taker?\\\" Risk-takers (compared to controls) were more likely to be men, smokers and have a history of psychiatric disorder.

Risk-taking behaviour shared significant genetic risk with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as with smoking and total obesity.

The severity and consequences of barcode swapping for single-cell transcriptomic studies remain poorly understood. We have used two statistical approaches to robustly quantify the fraction of swapped reads in each of two plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. We found that approximately 2.5% of reads were mislabeled between samples on the HiSeq 4000 machine, which is lower than previous reports. We observed no correlation between the swapped fraction of reads and the concentration of free barcode across plates. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that barcode swapping may generate complex but artefactual cell libraries in droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing studies. To eliminate these artefacts, we have developed an algorithm to exclude individual molecules that have swapped between samples in 10X Genomics experiments, exploiting the combinatorial complexity present in the data. This permits the continued use of cutting-edge sequencing machines for droplet-based experiments while avoiding the confounding effects of barcode swapping.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have revealed many loci contributing to the variation of complex traits, yet the majority of loci that contribute to the heritability of complex traits remain elusive. Large study populations with sufficient statistical power are required to detect the small effect sizes of the yet unidentified genetic variants. However, the analysis of huge cohorts, like UK Biobank, is complicated by incidental structure present when collecting such large cohorts. For instance, UK Biobank comprises 107,162 third degree or closer related participants. Traditionally, GWAS have removed related individuals because they comprised an insignificant proportion of the overall sample size, however, removing related individuals in UK Biobank would entail a substantial loss of power. Furthermore, modelling such structure using linear mixed models is computationally expensive, which requires a computational infrastructure that may not be accessible to all researchers. Here we present an atlas of genetic associations for 118 non-binary and 599 binary traits of 408,455 related and unrelated UK Biobank participants of White-British descent. Results are compiled in a publicly accessible database that allows querying genome-wide association summary results for 623,944 genotyped and HapMap2 imputed SNPs, as well downloading whole GWAS summary statistics for over 30 million imputed SNPs from the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel. Our atlas of associations (GeneATLAS, http://geneatlas.roslin.ed.ac.uk) will help researchers to query UK Biobank results in an easy way without the need to incur in high computational costs.",

It has been detected in the environment and biota; however, its potential affect to the wildlife and human health remains largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of long-term exposure to TDCPP on fish reproduction. Zebrafish eggs were treated with various concentration of TDCPP (0, 1, 10 and 100 g/L) from 1 day post-fertilization (hpf) to 6 months. The fecundity of female fish was significantly decreased as indicated by reduced embryos production. The egg quality was decreased and the malformation rates were increased in the F1 generation. Taken together, long-term exposure to TDCPP affects the reproduction of zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing transcriptomes in non-model organisms has resulted in a massive increase in our understanding of biological phenomena. This boon, largely made possible via high-throughput sequencing, means that studies of functional, evolutionary and population genomics are now being done by hundreds or even thousands of labs around the world. For many, these studies begin with a de novo transcriptome assembly, which is a technically complicated process involving several discrete steps. The Oyster River Protocol (ORP), described here, implements a standardized and benchmarked set of bioinformatic processes, resulting in an assembly with enhanced qualities over other standard assembly methods. Specifically, ORP produced assemblies have higher TransRate scores and mapping rates, which is largely a product of the fact that it leverages a multi-assembler and kmer assembly process, thereby bypassing the shortcomings of any one approach. These improvements are important, as previously unassembled transcripts are included in ORP assemblies, resulting in a significant enhancement of the power of downstream analysis. Further, as part of this study, we show that assembly quality is unrelated to taxonomy, nor is it related to the number of reads generated, above 30 million reads.\\n\\nCode AvailabilityThe version controlled open-source code is available at https://github.com/macmanes-lab/Oyster_River_Protocol.

    "abstract": "Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved pathway, by which eukaryotic cells degrade long-living cellular proteins and intracellular organelles, to maintain a pool of available nutrients. Impaired autophagy has been associated to important pathophysiological conditions, and this is the reason why several techniques have been developed for its correct assessment and monitoring. Fluorescence microscopy is one of these tools, which relies on the detection of specific fluorescence changes of targeted GFP-based reporters in dot-like organelles in which autophagy is executed. Currently, several procedures exist to count and segment this punctate structures in the resulting fluorescence images, however, they are either based on subjective criteria, or no information is available related to them. Here we present the concept of an algorithm for a semi-automatic detection and segmentation in 2D fluorescence images of spot-like structures similar to those observed under induction of autophagy. By evaluating the algorithm on more than 20000 simulated images of cells containing a variable number of punctate structures of different sizes and different levels of applied noise, we demonstrate its high robustness of puncta detection, even on a high noise background. We further demonstrate this feature of our algorithm by testing it in experimental conditions of a high non-specific background signal. We conclude that our algorithm is a suitable tool to be tested in biologically-relevant contexts.",

However, a dedicated bioinformatic design utility has yet to be created specifically for the purpose of identifying optimal oligo FISH probe sequences on the genome-wide scale. Here, we introduce OligoMiner, a rapid and robust computational pipeline for the genome-scale design of oligo FISH probes that affords the scientist exact control over the parameters of each probe. Our streamlined method uses standard bioinformatic file formats, allowing users to seamlessly integrate existing and new utilities into the pipeline as desired, and introduces a novel method for evaluating the specificity of each probe molecule that connects simulated hybridization energetics to rapidly generated sequence alignments using supervised learning. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach by performing genome-scale probe discovery in numerous model organism genomes and showcase the performance of the resulting probes with both diffraction-limited and single-molecule super-resolution imaging of chromosomal and RNA targets. We anticipate this pipeline will make the FISH probe design process much more accessible and will more broadly facilitate the design of pools of hybridization probes for a variety of applications.",

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause cellular damage and are thought to promote cancer-development. Nevertheless, under physiological conditions, all cells constantly produce ROS, either as chemical by-products or for signaling purpose. During differentiation cells induce the NADPH oxidase Nox4, which constitutively produces low amounts of H2O2. We infer that this constitutive H2O2 is unlikely to be carcinogenic and may rather maintain basal activity of cellular surveillance systems.\\n\\nUtilizing two different murine tumor models we demonstrate that Nox4 prevents malignant transformation and facilitated the recognition of DNA-damage. Upon DNA-damage repair is initiated as consequence of phosphorylation of H2AX ({gamma}H2AX). Repair only occurs if nuclear activity of the {gamma}H2AX-dephosphorylating phosphatase PP2A is kept sufficiently low, a task fulfilled by Nox4: Nox4 continuously oxidizes AKT, and once oxidized AKT captures PP2A in the cytosol. Absence of Nox4 facilitates nuclear PP2A translocation and dephosphorylation of {gamma}H2AX. Simultaneously the proportion of active, phosphorylated AKT is increased. Thus, DNA-damage is not recognized and the increase in AKT activity promotes proliferation. The combination of both events resulted in genomic instability and tumor initiation.\\n\\nWith the identification of the first cancer-protective source of reactive oxygen species, Nox4, the paradigm of reactive-oxygen species-induced initiation of malignancies should be revised.\\n\\nSignificanceThe stereotype of ROS produced by NADPH oxidases as cause of malignant diseases persists generalized since decades. We demonstrate that the NADPH oxidase Nox4, as constitutive source of ROS, prevents malignant transformation and that its pharmacological inhibition as currently aspired by several companies will potentially increase the risk of malignant cell transformation and eventually tumor formation.\\n\\nPrecisBy oxidizing AKT and keeping PP2A in the cytosol, the NADPH oxidase Nox4 allows proper DNA damage repair and averts cancer development.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we classified colorectal cancers (CRCs) into five CRCA subtypes with different prognoses and potential treatment responses, using a 786-gene signature. We merged our subtypes and those described by five other groups into four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) that are similar to CRCA subtypes. Here we demonstrate the analytical development and application of a custom NanoString platform-based biomarker assay to stratify CRC into subtypes. To reduce costs, we switched from the standard protocol to a custom modified protocol (NanoCRCA) with a high Pearson correlation coefficient (>0.88) between protocols. Technical replicates were highly correlated (>0.96). The assay included a reduced robust 38-gene panel from the 786-gene signature that was selected using an in-laboratory developed computational pipeline of class prediction methods. We applied our NanoCRCA assay to untreated CRCs including fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples (n=81) with matched microarray or RNA-Seq profiles. We further compared the assay results with CMS classification, different platforms (microarrays/RNA-Seq) and gene-set classifiers (38 and 786 genes). NanoCRCA classified fresh-frozen samples (n=39; not including those showing a mixture of subtypes) into all five CRCA subtypes with overall high concordance across platforms (89.7%) and with CMS subtypes (84.6%), independent of tumour cellularity. This analytical validation of the assay shows the association of subtypes with their known molecular, mutational and clinical characteristics. Overall, our modified NanoCRCA assay with further clinical assessment may facilitate prospective validation of CRC subtypes in clinical trials and beyond.\\n\\nNovelty and ImpactWe previously identified five gene expression-based CRC subtypes with prognostic and potential predictive differences using a 786-gene signature and microarray platform. Subtype-driven clinical trials require a validated assay suitable for routine clinical use. This study demonstrates, for the first time, how molecular CRCA subtype can be detected using NanoString Technology-based biomarker assay (NanoCRCA) suitable for clinical validation. NanoCRCA is suitable for analysing FFPE samples, and this assay may facilitate patient stratification within clinical trials.",

Little is known about when the EIHM is disrupted and how the disruption contributes to blast disease. Here we show that EIHM disruption correlates with the hyphal growth stage in first-invaded susceptible rice cells. Our approach utilized GFP secreted from invasive hyphae as an EIHM integrity reporter. Secreted-GFP accumulated in the EIHM compartment but appeared in the rice cytoplasm when the EIHM integrity was compromised. Live-cell imaging of secreted-GFP and various fluorescent reporters revealed that EIHM disruption led to rice vacuole rupture and cell death limited to the invaded cell with closed plasmodesmata. We report that EIHM disruption and host cell death are landmarks delineating three distinct infection phases (early biotrophic, late biotrophic, and transient necrotrophic phases) within the first-invaded cell before reestablishment of biotrophy in second-invaded cells. M. oryzae effectors exhibited phase-specific localizations, including entry of the apoplastic effector Bas4 into the rice cytoplasm during the late biotrophic phase. Understanding how the phase-specific dynamics are regulated and linked to host susceptibility will offer potential targets that can be exploited to control blast disease.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities are typically incredibly diverse, and this diversity is thought to play a key role in community function. However, explaining how this diversity can be maintained is a major challenge in ecology. Temporal fluctuations and spatial structure in the environment likely play a key role, but it has also been suggested that the structure of interactions within the community may act as a stabilizing force for species diversity. In particular, if competitive interactions are non-transitive as in the classic rock-paper-scissors game, they can contribute to the maintenance of species diversity; on the other hand, if they are predominantly hierarchical, any observed diversity must be maintained via other mechanisms. Here, we investigate the network of pairwise competitive interactions in a model community consisting of 20 strains of naturally co-occurring soil bacteria. We find that the interaction network is strongly hierarchical and lacks significant non-transitive motifs, a result that is robust across multiple environments. Moreover, in agreement with recently proposed community assembly rules, the full 20-strain competition resulted in extinction of all but three of the most highly competitive strains, indicating that higher order interactions do not play a major role in structuring this community. The lack of non-transitivity and higher order interactions in vitro indicates that other factors, such as temporal or spatial heterogeneity, must be at play in enabling these strains to coexist in nature.",

These ecological interactions result in coevolution between genes belonging to different partners. A well-understood example are secreted fungal effector proteins and their host targets, which play an important role in pathogenic interactions. Biotrophic smut fungi (Basidiomycota) are well-suited to investigate the evolution of plant pathogens, because several reference genomes and genetic tools are available for these species. Here, we used the genomes of Sporisorium reilianum f. sp. zeae and S. reilianum f. sp. reilianum, two closely related formae speciales infecting maize and sorghum, respectively, together with the genomes of Ustilago hordei, Ustilago maydis and Sporisorium scitamineum to identify and characterize genes displaying signatures of positive selection. We identified 154 gene families having undergone positive selection during species divergence in at least one lineage, among which 77% were identified in the two investigated formae speciales of S. reilianum. Remarkably, only 29% of positively selected genes encode predicted secreted proteins. We assessed the contribution to virulence of nine of these candidate effector genes in S. reilianum f. sp. zeae by deleting individual genes, including a homologue of the effector gene pit2 previously characterized in U. maydis. Only the pit2 deletion mutant was found to be strongly reduced in virulence. Additional experiments are required to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the selection forces acting on the other candidate effector genes, as well as the large fraction of positively selected genes encoding predicted cytoplasmic proteins.",

    "abstract": "To detect a direction to evolution, without the pitfalls of reconstructing ancestral states, we need to compare \\\"more evolved\\\" to \\\"less evolved\\\" entities. But because all extant species have the same common ancestor, none are chronologically more evolved than any other. However, different gene families were born at different times, allowing us to compare young protein-coding genes to those that are older and hence have been evolving for longer. To be retained during evolution, a protein must not only have a function, but must also avoid toxic dysfunction such as protein aggregation. There is conflict between the two requirements; hydrophobic amino acids form the cores of protein folds, but also promote aggregation. Young genes avoid strongly hydrophobic amino acids, which is presumably the simplest solution to the aggregation problem. Here we show that young genes few hydrophobic residues are clustered near one another along the primary sequence, presumably to assist folding. The higher aggregation risk created by the higher hydrophobicity of older genes is counteracted by more subtle effects in the ordering of the amino acids, including a reduction in the clustering of hydrophobic residues until they eventually become more interspersed than if distributed randomly. This interspersion has previously been reported to be a general property of proteins, but here we find that it is restricted to old genes. Quantitatively, the index of dispersion delineates a gradual trend, i.e. a decrease in the clustering of hydrophobic amino acids over billions of years.",

In the present report, we present the largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cognitive ability to date (N=107,207), and further enhance signal by combining results with a large-scale GWAS of educational attainment. We identified 70 independent genomic loci associated with cognitive ability, 34 of which were novel. A total of 350 genes were implicated, and this list showed significant enrichment for genes associated with Mendelian disorders with an intellectual disability phenotype. Competitive pathway analysis of gene results implicated the biological process of neurogenesis, as well as the gene targets of two pharmacologic agents: cinnarizine, a T-type calcium channel blocker; and LY97241, a potassium channel inhibitor. Transcriptome-wide analysis revealed that the implicated genes were strongly expressed in neurons, but not astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, and were more strongly associated with fetal brain expression than adult brain expression. Several tissue-specific gene expression relationships to cognitive ability were observed (for example, DAG1 levels in the hippocampus).

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the most abundant class of non-coding RNAs that regulate expression of >60% genes and are frequently deregulated in many human diseases. Sequence variants in miRNAs are expected to have a high impact on miRNA function. However, the lack of miRNA variant annotation and prioritization guidelines has hampered this analysis from whole genome/exome sequencing (WGS/WES) studies. Through the development of an Annotative Database of miRNA Elements, ADmiRE workflow, we re-annotated the publicly available population dataset of gnomAD 15,596 WGS and 123,136 WES and describe 26,094 precursor-miRNA variants. AdmiRE annotates twice the miRNA variants predicted by existing tools which prioritize variation relative to protein coding regions. We provide the allele frequency distribution of miRNA variation which is comparable to variation in exonic regions. This distribution is similar for miRNAs located in the intragenic and intergenic genomic context. Moreover,  high confidence miRNAs (designated by miRBase) harbor less variation (the majority contributed by rare variants) compared with the remaining miRNAs. We identify 279 miRNAs highly constrained with little or no variation in gnomAD. We further describe the evolutionary conservation of miRNAs across 100 vertebrates and identify 434 highly conserved miRNAs. We demonstrate that these constraint and conservation metrics (now incorporated into the ADmiRE workflow) characterize miRNAs previously implicated in human diseases. In conclusion, through the development of ADmiRE, we comprehensively analyze the landscape of miRNA sequence variation in large human population datasets and provide miRNA vertebrate conservation scores to aid future studies of miRNA variation in human diseases.",

We determined gastrointestinal colonisation prevalence of ESC-resistant E. coli (ESC-R-EC) and K. pneumoniae (ESC-R-KP) in Cambodian children/adolescents and associated risk factors; characterised relevant resistance genes, their genetic contexts, and the genetic relatedness of ESC-R strains using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Faeces and questionnaire data were obtained from individuals <16 years in northwestern Cambodia, 2012. WGS of cultured ESC-R-EC/KP was performed (Illumina). Maximum likelihood phylogenies were used to characterise relatedness of isolates; ESC-R-associated resistance genes and their genetic contexts were identified from de novo assemblies using BLASTn and automated/manual annotation. 82/148 (55%) of children/adolescents were ESC-R-EC/KP colonised; 12/148 (8%) were co-colonised with both species. Independent risk factors for colonisation were hospitalisation (OR: 3.12, 95%, CI [1.52-6.38]) and intestinal parasites (OR: 3.11 [1.29-7.51]); school attendance conferred decreased risk (OR: 0.44 [0.21-0.92]. ESC-R strains were diverse; the commonest ESC-R mechanisms were blaCTX-M 1 and 9 sub-family variants. Structures flanking these genes were highly variable, and for blaCTX-M-15, -55 and -27, frequently involved IS26. Chromosomal blaCTX-M integration was common in E. coli. Gastrointestinal ESC-R-EC/KP colonisation is widespread in Cambodian children/adolescents; hospital admission and intestinal parasites are independent risk factors. The genetic contexts of blaCTX-M are highly mosaic, consistent with rapid horizontal exchange. Chromosomal integration of blaCTX-M may result in stable propagation in these community-associated pathogens.",

Although much is known about their biochemical properties, how PRC1 and PRC2 are targeted to specific genes is poorly understood. Here we establish the Cyclin D2 (CCND2) oncogene as a simple model to address this question. We provide the evidence that coordinated recruitment of PRC1 and PRC2 complexes to CCND2 involves a combination of a specialized PRC1 targeting element (PTE) and an adjacent CpG-island, which together act as a human Polycomb Response Element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of CCND2 in different transcriptional states indicates that histone modifications produced by PRC1 and PRC2 are not sufficient to recruit either of the complexes. However, catalytic activity of PRC2 helps to anchor PRC1 at the PTE. Our analyses suggest that coordinated targeting of PRC1 and PRC2 complexes by juxtaposed AT-rich PTEs and CpG-islands may be a general feature of Polycomb repression in mammals.",

    "abstract": "The Morris water task (MWT) is commonly used to assess rodent spatial learning and memory. Our goal was to develop a 3-phase variant of the hidden goal water task to assess old and new spatial memories acquired in the same context using various measures of spatial learning in C57BL/6 mice. In the first phase, mice were pre-trained to an initially hidden location. The second phase consisted of a massed training session to a new location in the same apparatus and context. The final phase consisted of a competition test between the original and new platform locations. AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice, a novel transgenic mouse model for Alzheimers disease (AD), were also used as an independent variable to validate this 3-phase variant of MWT. The results of the present study showed that C57 mice acquired and retained both the old and new location representations; however, AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice retained a recently acquired spatial memory but did not remember the old location acquired in the same apparatus and context. The results showed that C57 mice can show precise place learning and memory with the right amount of training and acquire and retain multiple spatial memory locations in the same environment whereas this ability was impaired in AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice. In the visible platform test, however, all groups of mice showed normal sensorimotor ability and motivation. These findings indicate that this new version of the MWT provides a robust way for assessment of old and new memories in mice. This paradigm could also be exploited to assess manipulations of neural circuits implicated in learning and memory processes as well as for research investigating human brain diseases.",

Here, we empirically test whether people are drawn to rewards (at the neural level) following cognitive effort and when bored. This elucidates the experiences and consequences of engaging in cognitive effort, and compares it to the consequences of experiencing boredom, an affective state with predicted similar motivational consequences. Event-related potentials were recorded after participants (N=243) were randomized into one of three conditions - boredom (observing strings of numbers), cognitive effort (adding 3 to each digit of a four-digit number), or control. In the subsequent task, we focused on the feedback negativity (FN) to assess the brains immediate response to the presence or absence of reward. Phenomenologically, participants in the boredom condition reported more fatigue than those in the cognitive effort condition. Results suggest participants in the boredom condition exhibited larger FN amplitude than participants in the control condition, while the cognitive effort condition was neither different from boredom nor control. The neural and methodological implications for ego depletion research, including issues of replicability, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Connectomes derived from volume EM imaging of the brain can generate detailed physical models of every neuron, and simulators such as NEURON or GENESIS are designed to work with such models. In principal, combining these technologies, plus transmitter and channel models, should allow detailed and accurate simulation of real neural circuits. Here we experiment with this combination, using a well-studied system (motion detection in Drosophila). Since simulation requires both the physical geometry (which we have) and the models of the synapses (which are not currently available), we built approximate synapses corresponding to their known and estimated function. Once we did so, we reproduced direction selectivity in T4 cells, one of the main functions of this neural circuit. This verified the basic functionality of both extraction and simulations, and provided a biologically relevant computation we could use in further experiments. We then compared models with different degrees of physical realism, from full detailed models down to models consisting of a single node, to examine the tradeoff of simulation resources required versus accuracy achieved.\\n\\nOur results show that much simpler models may be adequate, at least in the case of medulla neurons in Drosophila. Such models can be easily derived from fully detailed models, and result in simulations that are much smaller, much faster, and accurate enough for many purposes. Biologically, we show that a lumped neuron model reproduces the main motion detector operation, confirming the result of Gruntman[1], that dendritic compution is not required for this function.",

In the sham group, all surgical procedures were kept the same except no AC was implanted and stenosis was not performed. One month following the surgical procedures, fear conditioning and object recognition tests were conducted to evaluate learning and memory functions and motor functions were assessed using a balance beam test. At the experimental endpoint, mice were perfused and brains were collected for immunostaining and histology. Learning and memory as well as motor functions were significantly impaired in the hypoperfusion group. The immunoreactivity to choline acetyltransferase was decreased in dorsal striatum and basal forebrain of the hypoperfusion group indicating that cholinergic tone in these brain regions was compromised. In addition, an increased number of Fluoro-Jade positive neurons was also found in cerebral cortex, dorsal striatum and hippocampus indicating neurodegeneration in these brain regions. Based on this pattern of data, we argued that this mouse model would be a useful tool to investigate the therapeutic interventions for the treatment of vascular dementia. Additionally, this model could be employed to exploit the effect of microvascular occlusions on cognitive impairment in the absence and presence of Alzheimer pathology.",

    "abstract": "The soilborne pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum is the causal agent of bacterial wilt, and causes significant crop loss in the Solanaceae family. The pathogen first infects roots, which are a critical source of resistance in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Roots of both resistant and susceptible plants are colonized by the pathogen, yet rootstocks can provide significant levels of resistance. Currently, mechanisms of this  root-mediated resistance remain largely unknown. To identify the molecular basis of this resistance, we analyzed the genome-wide transcriptional response of roots of resistant (Hawaii 7996) and susceptible (West Virginia700) tomatoes at multiple time points after inoculation with R. solanacearum. We found that defense pathways in roots of the resistant Hawaii7996 are activated earlier and more strongly than roots of susceptible West Virginia700. Further, auxin signaling and transport pathways are suppressed in roots of the resistant variety. Functional analysis of an auxin transport mutant in tomato confirmed a role for auxin pathways in bacterial wilt. Together, our results suggest that roots mediate resistance to R. solanacearum through genome-wide transcriptomic changes that result in strong activation of defense genes and alteration of auxin pathways.",

    "abstract": "We describe a method for measuring genome editing efficiency from in silico analysis of high-resolution melt curve data. The melt curve data derived from amplicons of genome-edited or unmodified target sites were processed to remove the background fluorescent signal emanating from free fluorophore and then corrected for temperature-dependent quenching of fluorescence of double-stranded DNA-bound fluorophore. Corrected data were normalized and numerically differentiated to obtain the first derivatives of the melt curves. These were then mathematically modeled as a sum or superposition of minimal number of Gaussian components. Using Gaussian parameters determined by modeling of melt curve derivatives of unedited samples, we were able to model melt curve derivatives from genetically altered target sites where the mutant population could be accommodated using an additional Gaussian component. From this, the proportion contributed by the mutant component in the target region amplicon could be accurately determined. Mutant component computations compared well with the mutant frequency determination from next generation sequencing data. The results were also consistent with our earlier studies that used difference curve areas from high-resolution melt curves for determining the efficiency of genome-editing reagents. The advantage of the described method is that it does not require calibration curves to estimate proportion of mutants in amplicons of genome-edited target sites.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGenome editing has been revolutionized by the engineering of molecular scissors that cut DNA at a predetermined location on the chromosome. When these molecular scissors are expressed within cells, these scissors cut the genomic DNA at the designated target site, and the cells respond by repairing the cut sites. This repair process frequently introduces mutations at the target cut site. The more efficient the molecular scissors, the more number of cells in a treated culture dish exhibit these mutations at the cut site. Investigators therefore design several molecular scissors targeting the same region on the chromosome to identify the best ones. We describe a new recipe to measure scissors efficiency in target site cutting.",

It remains unclear to what extent somatic evolutionary divergence is comparable across different regions of the cancer genome versus concentrated in specific genomic elements. We present a novel computational framework, SASE-mapper, to identify genomic regions that show signatures of accelerated somatic evolution (SASE) in a subset of samples in a cohort, marked by accumulation of an excess of somatic mutations compared to that expected based on local, context-aware background mutation rates in the cancer genomes. Analyzing tumor whole genome sequencing data for 365 samples from 5 cohorts we detect recurrent SASE at a genome-wide scale. The SASEs were enriched for genomic elements associated with active chromatin, and regulatory regions of several known cancer genes had SASE in multiple cohorts. Regions with SASE carried specific mutagenic signatures and often co-localized within the 3D nuclear space suggesting their common basis. A subset of SASEs was frequently associated with regulatory changes in key cancer pathways and also poor clinical outcome. While the SASE-associated mutations were not necessarily recurrent at base-pair resolution, the SASEs recurrently targeted same functional regions, with similar consequences. It is likely that regulatory redundancy and plasticity promote prevalence of SASE-like patterns in the cancer genomes.",

Specifically, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the feature map sets extracted from the tertiary protein structures. Each feature map set represents particular biological features associated with the atomic coordinates appearing on the outer surface of proteins three dimensional structure. The experimental results on the collected dataset for classifying TSGs and OGs demonstrate promising performance with 82.57% accuracy and 0.89 area under ROC curve. The initial success of the proposed model warrants further study to develop a comprehensive model to identify the cancer driver genes or events using the principle cancer genes (TSG and OG).",
