    "abstract": "Cancer sequencing predicts driver genes using recurrent protein-altering mutations, but detecting recurrence for non-coding mutations remains unsolved. Here, we present a convergence framework for recurrence analysis of non-coding mutations using three-dimensional co-localization of epigenomically-identified regions. We define the regulatory plexus of each gene as its cell-type-specific three-dimensional gene-regulatory neighborhood, inferred using Hi-C chromosomal interactions and chromatin state annotations. Using 16 matched tumor-normal prostate transcriptomes, we predict tumor-upregulated genes, and find enriched plexus mutations in distal regulatory regions normally repressed in prostate, suggesting out-of-context de-repression. Using 55 matched tumor-normal prostate genomes, we predict 15 driver genes by convergence of dispersed, low-frequency mutations into high-frequency dysregulation events along prostate-specific plexi, while controlling for mutational heterogeneity across regions, chromatin states, and patients. These putative drivers play roles in growth signaling, immune evasion, mitochondrial function, and vascularization, suggesting higher-order pathway-level convergence. We experimentally validate the PLCB4 plexus and its ability to affect the canonical PI3K cancer pathway.",

    "abstract": "We describe metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of a human coronavirus 229E from a patient with AML and persistent upper respiratory symptoms, who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). mNGS revealed a 548-nucleotide deletion, which comprised the near entirety of the ORF4 gene, and no minor allele variants were detected to suggest a mixed infection. As part of her pre-HCT conditioning regimen, the patient received myeloablative treatment with cyclophosphamide and 12 Gy total body irradiation. Iterative sequencing and RT-PCR confirmation of 4 respiratory samples over the 4-week peritransplant period revealed that the pre-conditioning strain contained an intact ORF4 gene, while the deletion strain appeared just after conditioning and persisted over a 2.5-week period. This sequence represents one of the largest genomic deletions detected in a human RNA virus and describes large-scale viral mutation associated with myeloablation for HCT.",

    "abstract": "Primary microcephaly is a congenital brain malformation characterized by a head circumference less than three standard deviations below the mean for age and sex and results in moderate to severe mental deficiencies and decreased lifespan. We recently studied two children with primary microcephaly in an otherwise unaffected family. Exome sequencing identified an autosomal recessive mutation leading to an amino acid substitution in a WD40 domain of the highly conserved Coatomer Protein Complex, Subunit Beta 2 (COPB2). To study the role of Copb2 in neural development, we utilized genome editing technology to generate an allelic series in the mouse. Two independent null alleles revealed that Copb2 is essential for early stages of embryogenesis. Mice homozygous for the patient variant (Copb2R254C/R254C) appear to have a grossly normal phenotype, likely due to differences in corticogenesis between the two species. Strikingly, mice heterozygous for the patient mutation and a null allele (Copb2R254C/Znf) show a severe perinatal phenotype including low neonatal weight, significantly increased apoptosis in the brain, and death within the first week of life. Immunostaining of the Copb2R254C/Znf brain revealed a reduction in layer V (CTIP2+) neurons, while the overall cell density of the cortex is unchanged. Moreover, disruption of Copb2 in mouse neurospheres resulted in reduced proliferation. These results identify a general requirement for COPB2 in embryogenesis and a specific role in corticogenesis. We further demonstrate the utility of CRISPR-Cas9 generated mouse models in the study of potential pathogenicity of variants of potential clinical interest.",

    "abstract": "Life is perpetuated through a single-cell bottleneck between generations in many organisms. Here, I highlight that this cell holds information in two distinct forms: in the linear DNA sequence that is replicated during cell divisions, and in the three-dimensional arrangement of molecules that can change during development but that is recreated at the start of each generation. These two interdependent stores of information - one replicating with each cell division and the other cycling with a period of one generation - coevolve while perpetuating an organism. Unlike the genome, the cycling arrangement of molecules, which could include RNAs, proteins, sugars, lipids, etc., is not well understood. Because this arrangement and the genome are together transmitted from one generation to the next, analysis of both is necessary to understand evolution, origins of inherited diseases, and consequences of genome engineering. Recent developments suggest that tools are in place to examine how all the information to build an organism is encoded within a single cell, and how this cell code is reproduced in every generation.",

To investigate this, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify transcript heterogeneity in single S. cerevisiae cells treated with and without salt stress, to explore population variation and identify cellular covariates that influence the stress-responsive transcriptome. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of yeast transcriptional regulation, we uncovered significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. We also discovered that a subset of cells decouple expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response, in a manner partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing pairs of fluorescent regulators, including the transcription factor Msn2 with Dot6, Sfp1, or MAP kinase Hog1, revealed both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Together with transcriptomic analysis, our results reveal that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription-factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells.",

    "abstract": "In a recent development of the PORCN-WNT inhibitor ETC-1922159 for colorectal cancer, a list of down-regulated genes were recorded in a time buffer after the administration of the drug. The regulation of the genes were recorded individually but it is still not known which higher ([&ge;] 2) order interactions might be playing a greater role after the administration of the drug. In order to reveal the priority of these higher order interactions among the down-regulated genes or the likely unknown biological hypotheses, a search engine was developed based on the sensitivity indices of the higher order interactions that were ranked using a support vector ranking algorithm and sorted. For example, LGR family (Wnt signal enhancer) is known to neutralize RNF43 (Wnt inhibitor). After the administration of ETC-1922159 it was found that using HSIC (and rbf, linear and laplace variants of kernel) the rankings of the interaction between LGR5-RNF43 were 61, 114 and 85 respectively. Rankings for LGR6-RNF43 were 1652, 939 and 805 respectively. The down-regulation of LGR family after the drug treatment is evident in these rankings as it takes bottom priorities for LGR5-RNF43 interaction. The LGR6-RNF43 takes higher ranking than LGR5-RNF43, indicating that it might not be playing a greater role as LGR5 during the Wnt enhancing signals. These rankings confirm the efficacy of the proposed search engine design. Conclusion: Prioritized unknown biological hypothesis form the basis of further wet lab tests with the aim to reduce the cost of (1) wet lab experiments (2) combinatorial search and (3) lower the testing time for biologist who search for influential interactions in a vast combinatorial search forest. From in silico perspective, a framework for a search engine now exists which can generate rankings for nth order interactions in Wnt signaling pathway, thus revealing unknown/untested/unexplored biological hypotheses and aiding in understanding the mechanism of the pathway. The generic nature of the design can be applied to any signaling pathway or phenomena under investigation where a prioritized order of interactions among the involved factors need to be investigated for deeper understanding. Future improvements of the design are bound to facilitate medical specialists/oncologists in their respective investigations.\\n\\nSignificanceRecent development of PORCN-WNT inhibitor enantiomer ETC-1922159 cancer drug show promise in suppressing some types of colorectal cancer. However, the search and wet lab testing of unknown/unexplored/untested biological hypotheses in the form of combinations of various intra/ extracellular factors/genes/proteins affected by ETC-1922159 is not known. Currently, a major problem in biology is to cherry pick the combinations based on expert advice, literature survey or guesses to investigate a particular combinatorial hypothesis. A search engine has be developed to reveal and prioritise these unknown/untested/unexplored combinations affected by the inhibitor. These ranked unknown biological hypotheses facilitate in narrowing down the investigation in a vast combinatorial search forest of ETC-1922159 affected synergistic-factors.",

    "abstract": "Although complex interactions between hosts and microbial associates are increasingly well documented, we still know little about how and why hosts shape microbial communities in nature. In addition, host genetic effects on microbial communities vary widely depending on the environment, obscuring conclusions about which microbes are impacted and which plant functions are important. We characterized the leaf microbiota of 200 A. thaliana genotypes in eight field experiments and detected consistent host effects on specific, broadly distributed microbial OTUs. Host genetics disproportionately influenced hubs within the microbial communities, with their impact then percolating through the community, as evidenced by a decline in the heritability of particular OTUs with their distance to the nearest hub. By simultaneously measuring host performance, we found that host genetics associated with microbial hubs explained over 10% of the variation in lifetime seed production among host genotypes across sites and years. We successfully cultured one of these microbial hubs and demonstrated its growth-promoting effects on plants grown in sterile conditions. Finally, genome-wide association mapping identified many putatively causal genes with small effects on the relative abundance of microbial hubs across sites and years, and these genes were enriched for those involved in the synthesis of specialized metabolites, auxins and the immune system. Using untargeted metabolomics, we corroborate the consistent association of variation in specialized metabolites and microbial hubs across field sites. Together, our results reveal that host natural variation impacts the microbial communities in consistent ways across environments and that these effects contribute to fitness variation among host genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Histone H3K4 methylation is a feature of meiotic recombination hotspots shared by many organisms including plants and mammals. Meiotic recombination is initiated by programmed double-strand break (DSB) formation that in budding yeast takes place in gene promoters and is promoted by histone H3K4 di/trimethylation. This histone modification is recognized by Spp1, a PHD-finger containing protein that belongs to the conserved histone H3K4 methyltransferase Set1 complex. During meiosis, Spp1 binds H3K4me3 and interacts with a DSB protein, Mer2, to promote DSB formation close to gene promoters. How Set1 complex- and Mer2- related functions of Spp1 are connected is not clear. Here, combining genome-wide localization analyses, biochemical approaches and the use of separation of function mutants, we show that Spp1 is present within two distinct complexes in meiotic cells, the Set1 and the Mer2 complexes. Disrupting the Spp1-Set1 interaction mildly decreases H3K4me3 levels and does not affect meiotic recombination initiation. Conversely, the Spp1-Mer2 interaction is required for normal meiotic recombination initiation, but dispensable for Set1 complex-mediated histone H3K4 methylation. Finally, we evidence that Spp1 preserves normal H3K4me3 levels independently of the Set1 complex. We propose a model where the three populations of Spp1 work sequentially to promote recombination initiation: first by depositing histone H3K4 methylation (Set1 complex), next by \\\"reading\\\" and protecting histone H3K4 methylation, and finally by making the link with the chromosome axis (Mer2-Spp1 complex). This work deciphers the precise roles of Spp1 in meiotic recombination and opens perspectives to study its functions in other organisms where H3K4me3 is also present at recombination hotspots.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMeiotic recombination is a conserved pathway of sexual reproduction that is required to faithfully segregate homologous chromosomes and produce viable gametes. Recombination events between homologous chromosomes are triggered by the programmed formation of DNA breaks, which occur preferentially at places called hotspots. In many organisms, these hotspots are located close to a particular chromatin modification, the methylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3). It was previously shown in the budding yeast model that one protein, Spp1, plays an important function in this process. We further explored the functional link between Spp1 and its interacting partners, and show that Spp1 shows genetically separable functions, by depositing the H3K4me3 mark on the chromatin, \\\"reading\\\" and protecting it, and linking it to the recombination proteins. We provide evidence that Spp1 is in three independent complexes to perform these functions. This work opens perspectives for understanding the process in other eukaryotes such as mammals, where most of the proteins involved are conserved.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) encompasses numerous algorithms that aim at discovering complex patterns between elements within large data using limited prior assumptions or modeling. However, some scientific disciplines still produce small data sets: in particular, empirical studies that try to find the mutations responsible for complex phenotypes are often limited to very small sample sizes (n), while scanning a large number of amino acid sites (p) in a proteome. To date, little is known on how ML performs in this type of so-called \\\"large p, small n\\\" problem. To address this question, we evaluated the performance of two general ML classifiers, adaptive boosting (AB) and random forest, on two data sets. To assess the impact of proteome size, we contrasted a small (viral) genome with a larger (bacterial) one. To analyze large proteomes, we further developed a chunking algorithm, and introduce a repeated random forest (RRF) algorithm that stabilizes model predictions. With the influenza data, we were able to rediscover amino acid sites experimentally implicated in three different complex phenotypes (infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity). Results for the larger proteome, pertaining to three types of drug resistance (Ciprofloxacin, Ceftazidime, and Gentamicin), were more nuanced, with RRF making more sensible pre-dictions, with smaller errors rates, than AB. Furthermore, we show that chunking improved runtimes by an order of magnitude and may increase sensitivity of the predictions. Altogether, we demonstrate that ML algorithms can be used to identify genetic determinants in small proteomes (viruses), even with small numbers of individuals. We further show that even if the size of bacterial proteomes pushes AB to its limits in the context of small n, RRF may deserve more scrutiny, which should be facilitated by the plummeting costs of sequencing and, more critically, by phenotyping large cohorts of individuals.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryFinding the genetic determinants of a phenotype is typically performed by testing for an association between a particular allele and a trait, carrying out the testing over a large number of loci in a large cohort of individuals, itself divided into two subsets of individuals: those who have the trait (cases), and those who do not (controls). However, recruiting large cohorts can be problematic in some experimental fields, while using genotypic information rather than complete genomes can miss some mutations. To address these issues, we implemented two machine learning (ML) algorithms, tweaked for analyzing large genomes and providing stable results. The analysis of a small viral genome, for which genetic determinants of three phenotypes are already known, showed that our approach can rediscover known mutations, almost irrespective of the ML algorithm used. However, the analysis of a larger bacterial genome, for which genetic determinants of three phenotypes are unknown, suggested that the simpler of our modified algorithms performed better, returning more sensitive predictions with lower error rates. This work demonstrates the feasibility of finding genetic determinants of complex phenotypes based on a small number of complete genomes.",

We show that spectral variability is widespread and partly occurs under fixed experimental conditions. Using clustering of preprocessed spectra, we derive a limited number of Multiple Characteristic Intensity Patterns (MCIPs) for each peptide charge pair, which allow almost complete coverage of our heterogeneous dataset without affecting the false discovery rate.

    "abstract": "We propose a new multiscale framework that seamlessly integrates four key components of blood clotting namely, blood rheology, cell mechanics, coagulation kinetics and transport of species and platelet adhesive dynamics. We use transport dissipative particle dynamics (tDPD), which is the extended form of original DPD, as the base solver, while a coarse-grained representation of blood cells membrane accounts for its mechanics. Our results show the dominant effect of blood flow and high Peclet numbers on the reactive transport of the chemical species signifying the importance of membrane bound reactions on the surface of adhered platelets. This new multiscale particle-based methodology helps us probe synergistic mechanisms of thrombus formation, and can open new directions in addressing other biological processes from sub-cellular to macroscopic scales.",

    "abstract": "A diffusion barrier at the transition zone enables the compartmentalization of signaling molecules by cilia. The BBSome and the small GTPase Arl6, which triggers BBSome coat polymerization, are required for the exit of activated signaling receptors from cilia, but how diffusion barriers are crossed when membrane proteins exit cilia remains to be determined. Here we found that activation of the ciliary GPCRs Smoothened and SSTR3 drove the Arl6-dependent assembly of large, highly processive and cargo-laden retrograde BBSome trains. Single-molecule imaging revealed that the assembly of BBSome trains enables the lateral transport of ciliary GPCRs across the transition zone. Yet, the removal of activated GPCRs from cilia was inefficient because a second, periciliary diffusion barrier was infrequently crossed. We conclude that exit from cilia is a two-step process in which BBSome/Arl6 trains first moves activated GPCRs through the transition zone before a periciliary barrier can be crossed.\\n\\nSummaryUpon activation, GPCRs must exit cilia for appropriate signal transduction. Using bulk imaging of BBSome and single molecule imaging of GPCRs, Ye et al. demonstrate that retrograde BBSome trains assemble on-demand upon GPCR activation and ferry GPCRs across the transition zone. Yet, ciliary exit often fails because of a second diffusion barrier.",

    "abstract": "The invasion of toxic cane toads (Rhinella marina) is a major threat to northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus) which are poisoned when they attack this novel prey item. Quolls are now endangered as a consequence of the toad invasion. Conditioned taste aversion can be used to train individual quolls to avoid toads, but we currently lack a training technique that can be used at a landscape scale to buffer entire populations from toad impact. Broad scale deployment requires a bait that can be used for training, but there is no guarantee that such a bait will ultimately elicit aversion to toads. Here we test a manufactured bait--a  toad sausage--for its ability to elicit aversion to toads in northern quolls. To do this, we exposed one group of quolls to a toad sausage and another to a control sausage and compared the quolls predatory responses when presented with a dead adult toad. Captive quolls that consumed a single toad sausage showed substantially reduced interest in cane toads, interacting with them for less than half the time of their untrained counterparts and showing substantially reduced attack behaviour. We also quantified bait uptake in the field, by both quolls and non-target species. These field trials showed that wild quolls were the most frequent species attracted to the baits, and that approximately 61% of quolls consumed toad-aversion baits when first encountered. Between 40-68% of these animals developed aversion to further bait consumption. Our results suggest that toad-aversion sausages can be used to train wild quolls to avoid cane toads. This opens the possibility for broad-scale quoll training with toad aversion sausages: a technique that may allow wildlife managers to prevent quoll extinctions at a landscape scale.",

    "abstract": "Understanding morphological diversity--and morphological constrainto--has been a central question in evolutionary biology since its inception. Nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis, which contains the well-studied model system C. elegans, display remarkable morphological consistency in the face of extensive genetic divergence. Here, we provide a description of the broad developmental patterns of a recently discovered species, C. sp. 34, which was isolated from fresh figs in Okinawa and which is among the closest known relatives of C. elegans. C. sp. 34 displays an extremely large body size and can grow to be nearly twice as long as C. elegans and all other known members of the genus. Observations of the timing of developmental milestones reveal that C. sp. 34 develops about twice as slowly as C. elegans. Measurements of embryo and larval size show that the size difference between C. sp. 34 and C. elegans is largely due to post-embryonic events, particularly during the transition from larval to adult stages. This difference in size is not attributable to differences in germ line chromosome number or the number of somatic cells. The overall difference in body size is therefore largely attributable to changes in cell size via increased cytoplasmic volume. Because of its close relationship to C. elegans, the distinctness of C. sp. 34 provides an ideal system for the detailed analysis of evolutionary diversification. The context of over forty years of C. elegans developmental genetics also reveals clues into how natural selection and developmental constraint act jointly to promote patterns of morphological stasis and divergence in this group.",

    "abstract": "The challenge of linking intergenic mutations to target genes has limited molecular understanding of diverse human diseases. Here, we show H3K27ac HiChIP generates high-resolution contact maps of active enhancers and target genes in rare primary human T cell subtypes and coronary artery smooth muscle cells. Differentiation of naive T cells to either T helper 17 cells or regulatory T cells create subtype-specific enhancer-promoter interactions, specifically at regions of shared DNA accessibility. These data provide a principled means of assigning molecular functions to autoimmune and cardiovascular disease risk variants, linking hundreds of noncoding variants to putative gene targets. Target genes identified with HiChIP are further supported by CRISPR interference and activation at linked enhancers, by the presence of expression quantitative trait loci, and by allele-specific enhancer loops in patient-derived primary cells. The majority of disease-associated enhancers contact genes beyond the nearest gene in the linear genome, leading to a four-fold increase of potential target genes for autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability worldwide, with up to two-thirds of individuals experiencing long-term disabilities. Large-scale neuroimaging studies have shown promise in identifying robust biomarkers (e.g., measures of brain structure) of long-term stroke recovery following rehabilitation. However, analyzing large rehabilitation-related datasets is problematic due to barriers in accurate stroke lesion segmentation. Manually-traced lesions are currently the gold standard for lesion segmentation on T1-weighted MRIs, but are labor intensive and require anatomical expertise. While algorithms have been developed to automate this process, the results often lack accuracy. Newer algorithms that employ machine-learning techniques are promising, yet these require large training datasets to optimize performance. Here we present ATLAS (Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke), an open-source dataset of 304 T1-weighted MRIs with manually segmented lesions and metadata. This large, diverse dataset can be used to train and test lesion segmentation algorithms and provides a standardized dataset for comparing the performance of different segmentation methods. We hope ATLAS release 1.1 will be a useful resource to assess and improve the accuracy of current lesion segmentation methods.",

The dynamics of the place cell activity for familiar environment changes gradually over time, suggesting that this temporal dynamics enables to allocate different neural codes for spatially identical but temporally different episodes. To understand the mechanisms determining the dynamics of place cell populations, activity of hippocampal CA1 neurons was imaged during repeated performance in a spatial memory task. Comparing ensemble representations among multiple task sessions revealed that overlap rate of active place cell population was time-dependent, but independent of the number of tasks within a fixed time. This time-dependent change of hippocampal ensemble activity was suppressed by the administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist. These results suggested that the gradual change of activity pattern works as a time code, and NMDA receptor-dependent processes forms the code.",

The study investigated centrosome amplification in type 2 diabetes and the underlying mechanisms. We found that centrosome amplification was increased in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the type 2 diabetic patients, which correlated with the levels of fasting blood glucose and HbA1c. High glucose, insulin and palmitic acid, alone or in combinations, induced ROS production and centrosome amplification. Together, they increased AKT activation as well as the expression, binding and centrosome translation of ROCK1 and 14-3-3{sigma}. Results from further analyses showed that AKT-ROS-dependent upregulations of expression, binding and centrosome translocation of ROCK1 and 14-3-3{sigma} was the molecular pathway underlying the centrosome amplification induced by high glucose, insulin and palmitic acid. Moreover, the increases in AKT activation and ROS production as well as expression, binding and centrosome distribution of ROCK1 and 14-3-3{sigma} were confirmed in the PBMC from the patients with type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, our results show that type 2 diabetes promotes cell centrosome amplification, and suggest that the diabetic pathophysiological factors-activated AKT-ROS-dependent signalling of ROCK1 and 14-3-3{sigma} is the underlying molecular mechanism.",

Using human embryonic stem cells representing the pre-implantation blastocyst (naive) and post-implantation epiblast (primed), our data demonstrate that a substantial portion of known human enhancers are pre-marked by H3K4me1 in naive cells, providing an enhanced open chromatin state in naive pluripotency. The naive enhancer repertoire occupies nine percent of the genome, three times that of primed cells, and can exist in broad chromatin domains over fifty kilobases. Enhancer chromatin states are largely poised. Seventy-seven percent of naive enhancers are decommissioned in a stepwise manner as cells become primed. While primed topological associated domains are unaltered upon differentiation, naive domains expand across primed boundaries, impacting three dimensional genome architecture. Differential topological associated domain edges coincide with naive H3K4me1 enrichment. Our results suggest that naive-derived cells have a chromatin landscape reflective of early embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Premise of the studyDiatoms are one of the most species-rich lineages of microbial eukaryotes. Similarities in clade age, species richness, and contributions to primary production motivate comparisons to flowering plants, whose genomes have been inordinately shaped by whole genome duplication (WGD). These events that have been linked to speciation and increased rates of lineage diversification, identifying WGDs as a principal driver of angiosperm evolution. We synthesized a relatively large but scattered body of evidence that, taken together, suggests that polyploidy may be common in diatoms.\\n\\nMethodsWe used data from gene counts, gene trees, and patterns of synonymous divergence to carry out the first large-scale phylogenomic analysis of genome-scale duplication histories for a phylogenetically diverse set of 37 diatom taxa.\\n\\nKey resultsSeveral methods identified WGD events of varying age across diatoms, though determining the exact number and placement of events and, more broadly, inferences of WGD at all, were greatly impacted by gene-tree uncertainty. Gene-tree reconciliations supported allopolyploidy as the predominant mode of polyploid formation, with particularly strong evidence for ancient allopolyploid events in the thalassiosiroid and pennate diatom clades.\\n\\nConclusionsWhole genome duplication appears to have been an important driver of genome evolution in diatoms. Denser taxon sampling will better pinpoint the timing of WGDs and likely reveal many more of them. We outline potential challenges in reconstructing paleopolyploid events in diatoms that, together with these results, offer a framework for understanding the evolutionary roles of genome duplication in a group that likely harbors substantial genomic diversity.",

The functional roles of lateralised oscillations for attention are unclear. Here, 20 human participants performed a dichotic listening task under continuous transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at alpha (10 Hz, vs sham) or gamma (47 Hz, vs sham) frequency, targeting left temporo-parietal cortex. Participants attended to four spoken numbers presented to one ear, while ignoring numbers on the other ear. As predicted, we found that alpha-tACS contralateral to the attended ear decreased recall of attended targets. Notably, gamma-tACS reversed the effect. Results provide a proof of concept that externally amplified oscillations can enhance spatial attention and facilitate attentional selection of speech. Furthermore, opposite effects of alpha versus gamma oscillations support the view that, across modalities, states of high alpha are incommensurate with active neural processing as reflected by states of high gamma.",
