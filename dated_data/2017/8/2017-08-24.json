    "abstract": "That biodiversity declines with latitude is well known, but whether a metacommunity process is behind this gradient has received limited attention. We tested the hypothesis that dispersal limitation is progressively replaced by mass effects with increasing latitude, along with a series of related hypotheses. We explored these hypotheses by examining metacommunity structure in stream invertebrate metacommunities spanning the length of New Zealands two largest islands (~1300 km), further disentangling the role of dispersal by deconstructing assemblages into strong and weak dispersers. Given the highly dynamic nature of New Zealand streams, our alternative hypothesis was that these systems are so unpredictable (at different stages of post-flood succession) that metacommunity structure is highly context dependent from region to region. We rejected our primary hypotheses, pinning this lack of fit on the strong unpredictability of New Zealands dynamic stream ecosystems and fauna that has evolved to cope with these conditions. While local community structure turned over along this latitudinal gradient, metacommunity structure was highly context dependent and dispersal traits did not elucidate patterns. Moreover, the emergent metacommunity types exhibited no trends, nor did the important environmental variables. These results provide a cautionary tale for examining singular metacommunities. The considerable level of unexplained contingency suggests that any inferences drawn from one-off snapshot sampling may be misleading and further points to the need for more studies on temporal dynamics of metacommunity processes.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive control mechanisms support the deliberate regulation of thought and behavior based on current goals. Recent work suggests that motivational incentives improve cognitive control, and has begun to elucidate the brain regions that may support this effect. Here, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of motivated cognitive control using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) and Neurosynth in order to delineate the brain regions that are consistently activated across studies. The analysis included functional neuroimaging studies that investigated changes in brain activation during cognitive control tasks when reward incentives were present versus absent. The ALE analysis revealed consistent recruitment in regions associated with the frontoparietal control network including the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), as well as consistent recruitment in regions associated with the salience network including the anterior insula and anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC). A large-scale exploratory meta-analysis using Neurosynth replicated the ALE results, and also identified the caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, medial thalamus, inferior frontal junction/premotor cortex (IFJ/PMC), and hippocampus. Finally, we conducted separate ALE analyses to compare recruitment during cue and target periods, which tap into proactive engagement of rule-outcome associations, and the mobilization of appropriate viscero-motor states to execute a response, respectively. We found that largely distinct sets of brain regions are recruited during cue and target periods. Altogether, these findings suggest that flexible interactions between frontoparietal, salience, and dopaminergic midbrain-striatal networks may allow control demands to be precisely tailored based on expected value.",

We present a theory based upon the crystal structure of UCNPs to estimate the molecular weight of UCNPs: enabling insight into UCNP molecular weight for the first time. We estimate the theoretical molecular weight of various UCNPs reported in the literature, predicting that spherical NaYF4 UCNPs {small tilde} 10 nm in diameter will be {small tilde}1 MDa (i.e. 106 g/mol), whereas UCNPs {small tilde} 45 nm in diameter will be {small tilde}100 MDa (i.e. 108 g/mol). We also predict that hexagonal crystal phase UCNPs will be of greater molecular weight than cubic crystal phase UCNPs. Additionally we find that a Gaussian UCNP diameter distribution will correspond to a lognormal UCNP molecular weight distribution. Our approach could potentially be generalised to predict the molecular weight of other arbitrary crystalline nanoparticles: as such, we provide standalone graphic user interfaces to calculate the molecular weight both UCNPs and arbitrary crystalline nanoparticles. We expect knowledge of UCNP molecular weight to be of wide utility in biomedical applications where reporting UCNP quantity in absolute numbers or molarity will be beneficial for inter-study comparison and repeatability.",

Hitherto, the SecYEG/Sec61 translocon, existing in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, represents the most intensively studied one. According to the current perception, both periplasmic and {beta}-barrel outer membrane proteins ({beta}-barrel OMPs) are translocated via the SecYEG translocon in bacterial cells, although direct living cell evidences remain lacking. Here, mainly via in vivo protein photo-crosslinking analysis, we revealed that the never reported membrane-integrated SecAN protein apparently functions as the translocon for {beta}-barrel OMPs. Additionally, SecAN contains a GXXXG motif known for mediating protein interactions in biomembranes, and processing of {beta}-barrel OMP precursors was severely affected in cells producing an assembly-defective SecAN variant resulted from the GXXXG motif mutations. Furthermore, SecAN was demonstrated to directly interact with the Bam complex, thus likely be a part of the supercomplex that we revealed earlier to be responsible for {beta}-barrel OMP biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Measurement of gene expression levels for multiple genes in single cells provides a powerful approach to study heterogeneity of cell populations and cellular plasticity. While the expression levels of multiple genes in each cell are available in such data, the potential connections among the cells (e.g. the cellular state transition relationship) are not directly evident from the measurement. Classifying the cellular states, identifying their transitions among those states, and extracting the pseudotime ordering of cells are challenging due to the noise in the data and the high-dimensionality in the number of genes in the data. In this paper we adapt the classical self-organizing-map (SOM) approach for single-cell gene expression data (SOMSC), such as those based on single cell qPCR and single cell RNA-seq. In SOMSC, a cellular state map (CSM) is derived and employed to identify cellular states inherited in the population of the measured single cells. Cells located in the same basin of the CSM are considered as in one cellular state while barriers among the basins in CSM provide information on transitions among the cellular states. A cellular state transitions path (e.g. differentiation) and a temporal ordering of the measured single cells are consequently obtained. In addition, SOMSC could estimate the cellular state replication probability and transition probabilities. Applied to a set of synthetic data, one single-cell qPCR data set on mouse early embryonic development and two single-cell RNA-seq data sets, SOMSC shows effectiveness in capturing cellular states and their transitions presented in the high-dimensional single-cell data. This approach will have broader applications to analyzing cellular fate specification and cell lineages using single cell gene expression data",

    "abstract": "Non-equilibrium demography impacts coalescent genealogies leaving detectable, well-studied signatures of variation. However, similar genomic footprints are also expected under models of large reproductive skew, posing a serious problem when trying to make inference. Furthermore, current approaches consider only one of the two processes at a time, neglecting any genomic signal that could arise from their simultaneous effects, preventing the possibility of jointly inferring parameters relating to both offspring distribution and population history. Here, we develop an extended Moran model with exponential population growth, and demonstrate that the underlying ancestral process converges to a time-inhomogeneous psi-coalescent. However, by applying a non-linear change of time scale - analogous to the Kingman coalescent - we find that the ancestral process can be rescaled to its time-homogeneous analogue, allowing the process to be simulated quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the expected site-frequency spectrum under the time-inhomogeneous psi-coalescent and develop an approximate-likelihood framework for the joint estimation of the coalescent and growth parameters. By means of extensive simulation, we demonstrate that both can be estimated accurately given linkage equilibrium, while linkage disequilibrium systematically biases growth rate estimates. In addition, not accounting for demography can lead to serious biases in the inferred coalescent model, with broad implications for genomic studies ranging from ecology to conservation biology. Finally, we use our method to analyze sequence data from Japanese sardine populations and find evidence of high variation in individual reproductive success, but few signs of a recent demographic expansion.",

This algorithm attempts to bridge the gap between fast \\\"mapping\\\" algorithms and more traditional alignment procedures.\\n\\nResultsWe adopt a hybrid approach that is able to increase mapping accuracy while still retaining much of the efficiency of fast mapping algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce a new approach that explores the candidate search space with high sensitivity as well as a collection of carefully-engineered heuristics to efficiently filter these candidates. Additionally, unlike the strategies adopted in most aligners which first align the ends of paired-end reads independently, we introduce a notion of co-mapping. This procedure exploits relevant information between the \\\"hits\\\" from the left and right ends of paired-end reads before full alignments or mappings for each are generated, which improves the efficiency of filtering likely-spurious alignments. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of selective alignment in improving the accuracy of efficient transcript-level quantification from RNA-seq reads. Specifically, we show that selective-alignment is able to resolve certain complex mapping scenarios that can confound existing fast mapping procedures, while simultaneously eliminating spurious alignments that fast mapping approaches can produce.\\n\\nAvailabilitySelective-alignment is implemented in C++11 as a part of Salmon, and is available as open source software, under GPL v3, at: https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/selective-alignment\\n\\nContactrob.patro@cs.stonybrook.edu",

In this work we show how the set of productions of a LoT grammar can be effectively selected from a broad repertoire of possible productions by an inferential process starting from experimental data. We then test this method in the language of geometry, a specific LoT model (Amalric et al., 2017). Finally, despite the fact of the geometrical LoT not being a universal (i.e. Turing-complete) language, we show an empirical relation between a sequences probability and its complexity consistent with the theoretical relationship for universal languages described by Levins Coding Theorem.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100034). Despite being able to conclusively demonstrate local adaptation, we are still often unable to objectively determine the climatic drivers of local adaptation. Given the rapid rate of global change, understanding the climatic drivers of local adaptation is vital. Not only will this tell us which climate axes matter most to population fitness, but such knowledge is critical to inform management strategies such as translocation and targeted gene flow. While simple assessments of geographic trait variation are useful, geographic variation (and its associations with environment) may represent plastic, rather than evolved, differences. Additionally, the vast number of trait-environment combinations makes it difficult to determine which aspects of the environment populations adapt to. Here we argue that by incorporating a measure of landscape connectivity as a proxy for gene flow, we can differentiate between trait-environment relationships underpinned by genetic differences versus those that reflect phenotypic plasticity. By doing so, we can rapidly shorten the list of trait-environment combinations that may be of adaptive significance. We demonstrate how this reasoning can be applied using data on geographic trait variation in a lizard species from Australia's Wet Tropics rainforest. Our analysis reveals an overwhelming signal of local adaptation for the traits and environmental variables we investigated. Our analysis also allows us to rank environmental variables by the degree to which they appear to be driving local adaptation. Although encouraging, methodological issues remain: we point to these issue in the hope that the community can rapidly hone the methods we sketch here. The promise is a rapid and general approach to identifying the environmental drivers of local adaptation.",

Surprisingly, eIF4A accelerated the rate of recruitment of all mRNAs tested, regardless of their degree of structural complexity. Structures in the 5'-UTR and 3' of the start codon synergistically inhibit mRNA recruitment in a manner relieved by eIF4A, indicating that the factor does not act solely to melt hairpins in 5'-UTRs. Our findings that eIF4A functionally interacts with the PIC and plays important roles beyond unwinding 5-UTR structure is consistent with a recent proposal that eIF4A modulates the conformation of the 40S ribosomal subunit to promote mRNA recruitment.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the fine balance between changes of entropy and enthalpy and the competition between a guest and water molecules in molecular binding is crucial in fundamental studies and practical applications. Experiments provide measurements. However, illustrating the binding/unbinding processes gives a complete picture of molecular recognition not directly available from experiments, and computational methods bridge the gaps. Here, we investigated guest association/dissociation with {beta}-cyclodextrin ({beta}-CD) by using microsecond-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, post-analysis and numerical calculations. We computed association and dissociation rate constants, enthalpy, and solvent and solute entropy of binding. All the computed values of kon, koff, {Delta}H, {Delta}S, and {Delta}G using GAFF-CD and q4MD-CD force fields for {beta}-CD could be compared with experimental data directly and agreed reasonably with experiment findings. Both force fields resulted in similar computed {Delta}G from independently computed kinetics rates, {Delta}G=-RTln(kon {middle dot} C{degrees} / k off), and thermodynamics properties, {Delta}G={Delta}H - T{Delta}S. The water entropy calculations show that entropy gain of desolvating water molecules are a major driving force, and both force fields have the same strength of non-polar attractions between solutes and {beta}-CD as well. Water molecules play a crucial role in guest binding to {beta}-CD. However, collective water/{beta}-CD motions could contribute to different computed kon and {Delta}H values by different force fields, mainly because the parameters of {beta}-CD provide different motions of {beta}-CD, hydrogen-bond networks of water molecules in the cavity of free {beta}-CD and the strength of desolvation penalty. As a result, q4MD-CD suggests that guest binding is mostly driven by enthalpy, while GAFF-CD shows that gaining entropy is the major driven force of binding. The study further interprets experiments, deepens our understanding of ligand binding, and suggests strategies for force field parameterization.",

    "abstract": "Categorization allows organisms to generalize existing knowledge to novel stimuli and to discriminate between physically similar yet conceptually different stimuli. Humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents can readily learn arbitrary categories defined by low-level visual features, and learning distorts perceptual sensitivity for category-defining features such that differences between physically similar yet categorically distinct exemplars are enhanced while differences between equally similar but categorically identical stimuli are reduced. We report a basis for these distortions in human occipitoparietal cortex. In three experiments, we used an inverted encoding model to recover population-level representations of stimuli from multivoxel and multi-electrode patterns of human brain activity while human participants (both sexes) classified continuous stimulus sets into discrete groups. In each experiment, reconstructed representations of to-be-categorized stimuli were systematically biased towards the center of the appropriate category. These biases were largest for exemplars near a category boundary, predicted participants overt category judgments, emerged shortly after stimulus onset, and could not be explained by mechanisms of response selection or motor preparation. Collectively, our findings suggest that category learning can influence processing at the earliest stages of cortical visual processing.\n\nSignificance StatementCategory learning enhances perceptual sensitivity for physically similar yet categorically different stimuli. We report a possible mechanism for these distortions in human occipitoparietal cortex.. In three experiments, we used an inverted encoding model to recover population-level representations of stimuli from multivariate patterns in occipitoparietal cortex while participants categorized sets of continuous stimuli into discrete groups.

    "abstract": "Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) belongs to the family Birnaviridae and is economically important to the poultry industry worldwide. IBDV infects B cells in the bursa of Fabricius (BF), causing immunosuppression and morbidity in young chickens. In addition to strains that cause classical Gumboro disease, the so-called  very virulent (vv) strain, also in circulation, causes more severe disease and increased mortality. IBDV has traditionally been controlled through the use of live attenuated vaccines, with attenuation resulting from serial passage in non-lymphoid cells. However, the factors that contribute to the vv or attenuated phenotypes are poorly understood. In order to address this, we aimed to investigate host cell-IBDV interactions using a recently described chicken primary B cell model, where chicken B cells are harvested from the BF and cultured ex vivo in the presence of chicken CD40L. We demonstrated that these cells could support the replication of IBDV when infected ex vivo in the laboratory. Furthermore, we evaluated the gene expression profiles of B cells infected with an attenuated strain (D78) and a very virulent strain (UK661) by microarray. We found that key genes involved in B cell activation and signaling (TNFSF13B, CD72 and GRAP) were down-regulated following infection relative to mock, which we speculate could contribute to IBDV-mediated immunosuppression. Moreover, cells responded to infection by expressing antiviral type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes, but the induction was far less pronounced upon infection with UK661, which we speculate could contribute to its virulence.",

We find that Smed-p53, Sox and Pax transcription factors are essential regulators of epidermal homeostasis, and act cooperatively to regulate genes associated with early epidermal precursor cell differentiation, including a tandemly arrayed novel gene family (prog) of secreted proteins. Additionally, we report on the discovery of distinct and previously undescribed secreted organelles whose production is dependent on the transcriptional activity of soxP-3, and which we term Hyman vesicles.",

    "abstract": "The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (syn. Pyricularia oryzae) is both a threat to global food security and a model for plant pathology. Molecular pathologists need an accurate understanding of the origins and line of descent of M. oryzae populations, to identify the genetic and functional bases of pathogen adaptation, and to guide the development of more effective control strategies. We used a whole-genome sequence analysis of samples from different times and places to infer details about the genetic makeup of M. oryzae from a global collection of isolates. Analyses of population structure identified six lineages within M. oryzae, including two pandemic on japonica and indica rice, respectively, and four lineages with more restricted distributions. Tip-dating calibration indicated that M. oryzae lineages separated about a millenium ago, long after the initial domestication of rice. The major lineage endemic to continental Southeast Asia displayed signatures of sexual recombination and evidence of DNA acquisition from multiple lineages. Tests for weak natural selection revealed that the pandemic spread of clonal lineages entailed an evolutionary  cost, in terms of the accumulation of deleterious mutations. Our findings reveal the coexistence of multiple endemic and pandemic lineages with contrasting population and genetic characteristics within a widely distributed pathogen.\\n\\nImportanceThe rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (syn. Pyricularia oryzae) is a textbook example of a rapidly adapting pathogen, and is responsible for one of the most damaging diseases of rice. Improvements in our understanding of Magnaporthe oryzae diversity and evolution are required, to guide the development of more effective control strategies. We used genome sequencing data for samples from around the world to infer the evolutionary history of M. oryzae. We found that M. oryzae diversified about a thousand years ago ago, separating into six main lineages: two pandemic on japonica and indica rice, respectively, and four with more restricted distributions. We also found that a lineage endemic to continental Southeast Asia displayed signatures of sexual recombination and the acquisition of genetic material from multiple lineages. This work provides a population-level genomic framework for defining molecular markers for the control of rice blast and investigations of the molecular basis of differences in pathogenicity between M. oryzae lineages.",

    "abstract": "Biological evolution generates a surprising amount of site-specific variability in protein sequences. Yet attempts at modeling this process have been only moderately successful, and current models based on protein structural metrics explain, at best, 60% of the observed variation. Surprisingly, simple measures of protein structure, such as solvent accessibility, are often better predictors of site-specific variability than more complex models employing all-atom energy functions and detailed structural modeling. We suggest here that these more complex models perform poorly because they lack consideration of the evolutionary process that is in part captured by the simpler metrics. We compare protein sequences that are computationally designed to sequences that are computationally evolved using the same protein-design energy function and to homologous natural sequences. We find that by a wide variety of metrics, evolved sequences are much more similar to natural sequences than are designed sequences. In particular, designed sequences are too conserved on the protein surface relative to natural sequences whereas evolved sequences are not. Our results suggest that evolutionary simulation produces a realistic sampling of sequence space. By contrast, protein design--at least as currently implemented--does not. Existing energy functions seem to be sufficiently accurate to correctly describe the key thermodynamic constraints acting on protein sequences, but they need to be paired with realistic sampling schemes to generate realistic sequence alignments.",

    "abstract": "Parallel evolution of gene expression commonly underlies convergent niche specialization, but parallel changes in expression could also underlie divergent specialization. We investigated divergence in gene expression and whole-genome genetic variation across three sympatric Cyprinodon pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas. This recent radiation consists of a generalist and two derived specialists adapted to novel niches - a  scale-eater and a  snail-eater. We sampled total mRNA from all three species at two early developmental stages and compared gene expression with whole-genome genetic differentiation among all three species in 42 resequenced genomes. 80% of genes that were differentially expressed between snail-eaters and generalists were up or downregulated in the same direction between scale-eaters and generalists; however, there were no fixed variants shared between species underlying these parallel changes in expression. Genes showing parallel evolution of expression were enriched for effects on metabolic processes, whereas genes showing divergent expression were enriched for effects on cranial skeleton development and pigment biosynthesis, reflecting the most divergent phenotypes observed between specialist species. Our findings reveal that even divergent niche specialists may exhibit convergent adaptation to higher trophic levels through shared genetic pathways. This counterintuitive result suggests that parallel evolution in gene expression can accompany divergent ecological speciation during adaptive radiation.\\n\\nImpact SummaryAdaptations that result in unique forms of ecological specialization are central to research in evolutionary biology, yet little is known about their molecular foundations. We combined transcriptome sequencing with whole-genome divergence scans to study the molecular evolution of two specialist Cyprinodon pupfish species - a  scale-eater and a  snail-eater - that rapidly diverged from a sympatric generalist ancestor within the last 10,000 years. While parallel evolution of gene expression driving convergent niche specialization seems common, we present, to our knowledge, the first example of significant parallel changes in expression coinciding with divergent niche specialization. 80% of genes that were differentially expressed between snail-eaters and generalists showed the same direction of expression in scale-eaters relative to generalists. Furthermore, parallel evolution in expression seem to be controlled by unique genetic variants in each specialist species. Genes showing parallel changes in expression were enriched for metabolic processes that may facilitate adaptation to a higher trophic level, while genes showing divergent expression likely shape the striking morphological differences between specialists. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of convergent adaptations that arise during speciation, and highlight how species can evolve similar expression profiles adapted to divergent niches.",

It showed excellent performance in estimating divergence times for both simulated and empirical molecular sequence datasets in which evolutionary rates varied extensively throughout the tree. RelTime is computationally efficient and scales well with increasing size of datasets. Until now, however, RelTime has not had a formal mathematical foundation. Here, we show that the basis of the RelTime approach is a relative rate framework (RRF) that combines comparisons of evolutionary rates in sister lineages with the principle of minimum rate change between an evolutionary lineage and its descendants. We present analytical solutions for estimating relative lineage rates and divergence times under RRF. We also discuss the relationship of RRF with other approaches, including the Bayesian framework. We conclude that RelTime will be also useful for phylogenies with branch lengths derived not only from molecular data, but also morphological and biochemical traits.",

In this paper, we explore the effects of partial selfing on the equilibrium genetic variance Vg, mutation load L and inbreeding depression{delta} under stabilizing selection acting on a arbitrary number n of quantitative traits coded by biallelic loci with additive effects. Overall, our model predicts a decrease in the equilibrium genetic variance with increasing selfing rates; however, the relationship between self-fertilization and the variables of interest depends on the strength of associations between loci, and three different regimes are observed. When the U/n ratio is low (where U is the total haploid mutation rate on selected traits) and effective recombination rates are sufficiently high, genetic associations between loci are negligible and the genetic variance, mutation load and inbreeding depression are well predicted by approximations based on single-locus models. For higher values of U/n and/or lower effective recombination, moderate genetic associations generated by epistasis tend to increase Vg, L and{delta} , this regime being well predicted by approximations including the effects of pairwise associations between loci. For yet higher values of U/n and/or lower effective recombination, a different regime is reached under which the maintenance of coadapted gene complexes reduces Vg, L and{delta} .

    "abstract": "The bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia manipulates arthropod reproduction to facilitate its maternal spread through populations. The most common manipulation is cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI): Wolbachia-infected males produce modified sperm that cause embryonic mortality, unless rescued by eggs harboring the same Wolbachia. The genes underlying CI, cifA and cifB, were recently identified in the eukaryotic association module of Wolbachias prophage WO. Here, we use transcriptomic and genomic approaches to address three important evolutionary facets of these genes. First, we assess whether or not cifA and cifB comprise a classic toxin-antitoxin operon, and show they do not form an operon in strain wMel. They coevolve but exhibit strikingly distinct expression across host development. Second, we provide new domain and functional predictions across homologs within Wolbachia, and we show amino acid sequences vary substantially across the genus. Lastly, we investigate conservation of cifA and cifB and find degradation and loss of the genes is common in strains that no longer induce CI.

    "abstract": "The Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform offers near real time analysis of DNA reads as they are generated, which makes the device attractive for in-field or clinical deployment, e.g. rapid diagnostics. We used the MinION platform for shotgun metagenomic sequencing and analysis of gut-associated microbial communities; firstly, we used a 20-species human microbiota mock community to demonstrate how Nanopore metagenomic sequence data can be reliably and rapidly classified. Secondly, we profiled faecal microbiomes from preterm infants at increased risk of necrotising enterocolitis and sepsis. In single patient time course, we captured the diversity of the immature gut microbiota and observed how its complexity changes over time in response to interventions, i.e. probiotic, antibiotics and episodes of suspected sepsis. Finally, we performed  real-time runs from sample to analysis using faecal samples of critically ill infants and of healthy infants receiving probiotic supplementation. Real-time analysis was facilitated by our new NanoOK RT software package which analysed sequences as they were generated. We reliably identified potentially pathogenic taxa (i.e. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) and their corresponding antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene profiles within as little as one hour of sequencing. Antibiotic treatment decisions may be rapidly modified in response to these AMR profiles, which we validated using pathogen isolation, whole genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Our results demonstrate that our pipeline can process clinical samples to a rich dataset able to inform tailored patient antimicrobial treatment in less than 5 hours.",

    "abstract": "About half of all cancers have somatic integrations of retrotransposons. To characterize their role in oncogenesis, we analyzed the patterns and mechanisms of somatic retrotransposition in 2,954 cancer genomes from 37 histological cancer subtypes. We identified 19,166 somatically acquired retrotransposition events, affecting 35% of samples, and spanning a range of event types. L1 insertions emerged as the first most frequent type of somatic structural variation in esophageal adenocarcinoma, and the second most frequent in head-and-neck and colorectal cancers. Aberrant L1 integrations can delete megabase-scale regions of a chromosome, sometimes removing tumour suppressor genes, as well as inducing complex translocations and large-scale duplications. Somatic retrotranspositions can also initiate breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, leading to high-level amplification of oncogenes. These observations illuminate a relevant role of L1 retrotransposition in remodeling the cancer genome, with potential implications in the development of human tumours.",

    "abstract": "Anthozoans (e.g., corals, anemones) are an ecologically important and diverse group of marine metazoans that occur from shallow to deep waters worldwide. However, our understanding of the evolutionary relationships among the [~]7500 species within this class is hindered by the lack of phylogenetically informative markers that can be reliably sequenced across a diversity of taxa. We designed and tested 16,308 RNA baits to capture 720 Ultraconserved Element loci and 1,071 exon loci. Library preparation and target enrichment was performed on 33 taxa from all orders within the class Anthozoa. Following Illumina sequencing and Trinity assembly, we recovered 1,774 of 1,791 targeted loci. The mean number of loci recovered from each species was 638 {+/-} 222, with more loci recovered from octocorals (783 {+/-} 138 loci) than hexacorals (475 {+/-}187 loci). Phylogenetically informative sites ranged from 26-49% for alignments at differing hierarchical taxonomic levels (e.g., Anthozoa, Octocorallia, Hexacorallia). The percent of variable sites within each of three genera (Acropora, Alcyonium, and Sinularia) for which multiple species were sequenced ranged from 4.7-30%. Maximum likelihood analyses recovered highly resolved trees with topologies matching those supported by other studies, including the monophyly of the order Scleractinia. Our results demonstrate the utility of this target-enrichment approach to resolve phylogenetic relationships from relatively old to recent divergences. Re-designing the baits with improved affinities to capture loci within each sub-class will provide a valuable toolset to address systematic questions and further our understanding of the timing of diversifications in the class Anthozoa.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHalobacteriovorax are saltwater-adapted predatory bacteria that attack Gram-negative bacteria and therefore may play an important role in shaping microbial communities. To understand the impact of Halobacteriovorax on ecosystems and develop them as biocontrol agents, it is important to characterize variation in predation phenotypes such as prey range and investigate the forces impacting Halobacteriovorax genome evolution across different phylogenetic distances.\\n\\nResultsWe isolated H. marinus BE01 from an estuary in Rhode Island using Vibrio from the same site as prey. Small, fast-moving attack phase BE01 cells attach to and invade prey cells, consistent with the intraperiplasmic predation strategy of H. marinus type strain SJ. BE01 is a prey generalist, forming plaques on Vibrio strains from the estuary as well as Pseudomonas from soil and E. coli. Genome analysis revealed that BE01 is very closely related to SJ, with extremely high conservation of gene order and amino acid sequences. Despite this similarity, we identified two regions of gene content difference that likely resulted from horizontal gene transfer. Analysis of modal codon usage frequencies supports the hypothesis that these regions were acquired from bacteria with different codon usage biases compared to Halobacteriovorax. In BE01, one of these regions includes genes associated with mobile genetic elements, such as a transposase not found in SJ and degraded remnants of an integrase occurring as a full-length gene in SJ. The corresponding region in SJ included unique mobile genetic element genes, such as a site-specific recombinase and bacteriophage-related genes not found in BE01. Acquired functions in BE01 include the dnd operon, which encodes a pathway for DNA modification that may protect DNA from nucleases, and a suite of genes involved in membrane synthesis and regulation of gene expression that was likely acquired from another Halobacteriovorax lineage.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results support previous observations that Halobacteriovorax prey on a broad range of Gram-negative bacteria. Genome analysis suggests strong selective pressure to maintain the genome in the H. marinus lineage represented by BE01 and SJ, although our results also provide further evidence that horizontal gene transfer plays an important role in genome evolution in predatory bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Xanthan gum, a complex polysaccharide comprising glucose, mannose and glucuronic acid residues, is involved in numerous biotechnological applications in cosmetics, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, food and petroleum industries. Additionally, its oligosaccharides were shown to possess antimicrobial, antioxidant and few other properties. Yet, despite its extensive usage, little is known about xanthan gum degradation pathways and mechanisms.\\n\\nThermogutta terrifontis R1 was described as the first thermophilic representative of the Planctomycetes phylum. As other cultivated planctomycetes, it grows well on various carbohydrates including oligo- and polysaccharides, however, its capability of anaerobic growth with or without electron acceptors was a novel finding among the representatives of this phylum.\\n\\nThe aim of this work is to examine T. terrifontis catabolic pathways with a special focus on the xanthan gum degradation pathway using genomic and transriptomic sequencing. Genomic analysis revealed more than a hundred glycosidases, polysaccharide lyases and other CAZymes, involved in oligo- and polysaccharide degradation by T. terrifontis, proteins of central carbohydrate metabolism and aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Furthermore, the combination of genomic and transcriptomic approaches revealed a putative novel xanthan gum degradation pathway involving unusual catalytic steps and enzymes: novel glycosidase(s) of DUF1080 family, hydrolyzing xanthan gum beta-glucosidic backbone linkages and beta-mannosidases instead of xanthan lyases for degradation of terminal beta-mannosidic linkages. Surprisingly, the genes coding DUF1080 proteins were found in high number in T. terrifontis and in many other Planctomycetes genomes, which, together with our observation that xanthan gum being a selective substrate for many planctomycetes, supports the important role of DUF1080 in xanthan gum degradation. Our findings shed light on the metabolism of the first thermophilic planctomycete, capable to degrade a number of polysaccharides, either aerobically or anaerobically, including the biotechnologically important bacterial polysaccharide xanthan gum. The results serve as good foundation for future exploration of T. terrifontis and its enzymes in biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "In the visual system, the response to a stimulus in a neurons receptive field can be modulated by stimulus context, and the strength of these contextual influences vary with stimulus intensity. Recent work has shown how a theoretical model, the stabilized supralinear network (SSN), can account for such modulatory influences, using a small set of computational mechanisms. While the predictions of the SSN have been confirmed in primary visual cortex (V1), its computational principles apply with equal validity to any cortical structure. We have therefore tested the generality of the SSN by examining modulatory influences in the middle temporal area (MT) of the macaque visual cortex, using electrophysiological recordings and pharmacological manipulations. We developed a novel stimulus that can be adjusted parametrically to be larger or smaller in the space of all possible motion directions. We found, as predicted by the SSN, that MT neurons integrate across motion directions for low-contrast stimuli, but that they exhibit suppression by the same stimuli when they are high in contrast. These results are analogous to those found in visual cortex when stimulus size is varied in the space domain. We further tested the mechanisms of inhibition using pharmacologically manipulations of inhibitory efficacy. As predicted by the SSN, local manipulation of inhibitory strength altered firing rates, but did not change the strength of surround suppression. These results are consistent with the idea that the SSN can account for modulatory influences along different stimulus dimensions and in different cortical areas.\\n\\nSignificance StatementVisual neurons are selective for specific stimulus features in a region of visual space known as the receptive field, but can be modulated by stimuli outside of the receptive field. The SSN model has been proposed to account for these and other modulatory influences, and tested in V1. As this model is not specific to any particular stimulus feature or brain region, we wondered whether similar modulatory influences might be observed for other stimulus dimensions and other regions. We tested for specific patterns of modulatory influences in the domain of motion direction, using electrophysiological recordings from MT. Our data confirm the predictions of the SSN in MT, suggesting that the SSN computations might be a generic feature of sensory cortex.",

    "abstract": "Memory performance is highly variable between individuals. Most studies examining human memory, however, have largely focused on the neural correlates of successful memory formation within individuals, rather than the differences between them. As such, what gives rise to this variability is poorly understood. Here, we examined intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings captured from 43 participants (23 male) implanted with subdural electrodes for seizure monitoring as they performed a paired-associates verbal memory task. We identified three separate but related signatures of neural activity that tracked differences in successful memory formation across individuals. High performing individuals consistently exhibited less broadband power, flatter power spectral density (PSD) slopes, and greater complexity in their iEEG signals. Furthermore, within individuals across three separate time scales ranging from seconds to days, successful recall was positively associated with these same metrics. Our data therefore suggest that memory ability across individuals can be indexed by increased neural signal complexity.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe show that participants whose intracranial EEG exhibits less low frequency power, flatter power spectrums, and greater sample entropy overall are better able to memorize associations, and that the same metrics track fluctuations in memory performance across time within individuals. These metrics together signify greater neural signal complexity which may index the brains ability to flexibly engage with information and generate separable memory representations. Critically, the current set of results provide a unique window into the neural markers of individual differences in memory performance which have hitherto been underexplored.",

Although significant progress has been made in understanding the computations underlying confidence judgment, the preponderance of studies focuses on perceptual decisions, in which individuals sequentially sample noisy information and accumulate it as evidence until a threshold is exceeded. Once a decision is made, they initiate an action to implement the choice. However, we often have to make decisions during ongoing actions in dynamic environments where the value and the availability of the alternative options can change with time and previous actions. The current study aims to decipher the computations underlying confidence judgment in action decisions that are made in a dynamic environment. Using a reaching task in which movements are initiated to multiple potential targets, we show that action selection, reaction time and choice confidence all emerge from a common computation in which parallel prepared actions compete based on the overall desirability of targets and action plans.",

Using fMRI, we report corresponding evidence of increasing neural similarity from posterior to anterior hippocampus (dorsoventral homologues) in humans.

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) in plants can move from cell to cell, allowing for systemic spread of an anti-viral immune response. How this cell-to-cell spread of silencing is regulated is currently unknown. Here, we describe that the C4 protein from Tomato yellow leaf curl virus has the ability to inhibit the intercellular spread of RNAi. Using this viral protein as a probe, we have identified the receptor-like kinase (RLK) BARELY ANY MERISTEM 1 (BAM1) as a positive regulator of the cell-to-cell movement of RNAi, and determined that BAM1 and its closest homologue, BAM2, play a redundant role in this process. C4 interacts with the intracellular domain of BAM1 and BAM2 at the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata, the cytoplasmic connections between plant cells, interfering with the function of these RLKs in the cell-to-cell spread of RNAi. Our results identify BAM1 as an element required for the cell-to-cell spread of RNAi and highlight that signalling components have been co-opted to play multiple functions in plants.",

Conventional approaches to reading out cellular barcodes trade off spatial resolution with throughput.

    "abstract": "Some motor impairments associated with Parkinsons disease are thought to arise from pathological activity in the neuronal networks formed by the basal ganglia (BG) and motor cortex. To evaluate several hypotheses proposed to explain the emergence of pathological oscillations in Parkinsonism, we investigated changes to the directed connectivity in these networks following dopamine depletion. We recorded local field potentials in the cortex and basal ganglia of anesthetized rats rendered Parkinsonian by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), with dopamine-intact rats as controls. We performed systematic analyses of the networks using a novel tool for estimation of directed neural interactions, as well as a conditioned variant which permits the analysis of the dependence of a connection upon a third reference signal. We find evidence of the dopamine dependency of both low beta (14-20 Hz) and high beta/low gamma (20-40 Hz) directed interactions within the BG and cortico-BG networks. Notably, 6-OHDA lesions were associated with enhancement of the cortical \\\"hyperdirect\\\" connection to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), as well the STNs feedback to the cortex and striatum. We find beta synchronization to be robust to conditioning using signals from any one structure. Conversely, we find that high beta/gamma drive from the cortex to subcortical regions is weakened by 6-OHDA lesions and is susceptible to conditioning. Furthermore, we provide evidence that gamma is routed from striatum in a pathway that is independent of STN. These results further inform our understanding of the substrates for pathological rhythms in salient brain networks in Parkinsonism.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyWe present a novel analysis of electrophysiological recordings in the cortico-basal ganglia network with the aims of evaluating several hypotheses concerning the origins of abnormal brain rhythms associated with Parkinsons disease. We present evidence for changes in the directed connections within the network following chronic dopamine depletion in rodents. These findings speak to the plausibility of a \\\"short-circuiting\\\" of the network that gives rise to the conditions from which pathological synchronization may arise.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional structure of DNA is increasingly understood to play a decisive role in gene regulation and other vital cellular processes, which has triggered an explosive growth of research on the spatial architecture of the genome. Many studies focus on the role of various DNA-packaging proteins, crowding, and confinement in organizing chromatin, but structural information might also be directly encoded in bare DNA itself. Here, we use a fluorescence-based single-molecule technique to visualize plectonemes, the extended intertwined DNA loops that form upon twisting DNA. Remarkably, we find that the underlying DNA sequence directly encodes the structure of supercoiled DNA by pinning plectonemes at specific positions. We explore a variety of DNA sequences to determine what features influence pinning, and we develop a physical model that predicts the level of plectoneme pinning in excellent agreement with the data. The intrinsic curvature measured over a range of ~70 base pairs is found to be the key property governing the supercoiled structure of DNA. Our model predicts that plectonemes are likely to localize directly upstream of prokaryotic transcription start sites, and this prediction is experimentally verified in vitro. Our results reveal a hidden code in DNA that helps to spatially organize the genome.",

    "abstract": "For many organisms, developmental transitions are triggered by a neuroendocrine axis and are contingent upon multiple organs achieving sufficient growth and maturation. How the status of peripheral organs is communicated to the neuroendocrine axis is not known. In Drosophila larvae, metamorphosis is triggered by the steroid hormone ecdysone, secreted by the prothoracic gland (PG). Here we show that the BMP2/4 ortholog Dpp, which regulates growth and patterning of larval imaginal discs, also functions as a systemic signal to regulate developmental timing. Dpp from peripheral tissues, mostly imaginal discs, can reach the PG and inhibit ecdysone biosynthesis. As the discs grow, Dpp signaling decreases in the PG, thus alleviating the inhibition of ecdysone biosynthesis, and permitting entry into metamorphosis. We suggest that if a tissue can trap more morphogen locally as it grows and matures, then circulating levels of morphogen can provide a systemic readout of organ size and maturation.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryDpp functions as a long-range endocrine signal between peripheral tissues and the prothoracic gland to regulate developmental timing in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "In vivo quantitative imaging reveals that chick cranial neural crest cells throughout the migratory stream are morphologically polarized and migrate by progressively refining the polarity of their protrusions.\\n\\nAbstractTo move directionally, cells can bias the generation of protrusions or select among randomly generated protrusions. Here we use 3D two-photon imaging of chick branchial arch 2 directed neural crest cells to probe how these mechanisms contribute to directed movement, whether a subset or the majority of cells polarize during movement, and how the different classes of protrusions relate to one another. We find that cells throughout the stream are morphologically polarized along the direction of overall stream movement and that there is a progressive sharpening of the morphological polarity program. Neural crest cells have weak spatial biases in filopodia generation and lifetime. Local bursts of filopodial generation precede the generation of larger protrusions. These larger protrusions are more spatially biased than the filopodia, and the subset of protrusions that power motility are the most polarized of all. Orientation rather than position is the best correlate of the protrusions that are selected for cell movement. This progressive polarity refinement strategy may enable neural crest cells to efficiently explore their environment and migrate accurately in the face of noisy guidance cues.",
