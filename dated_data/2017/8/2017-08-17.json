    "abstract": "We develop an overarching framework that combines long-term tag-recapture data and powerful statistical and modeling techniques to investigate how population, environmental, and climate factors determine variation in vital rates and population dynamics in an animal species, using as a model system the population of brown trout living in Upper Volaja (Western Slovenia). This population has been monitored since 2004; Upper Volaja is also a sink, receiving individuals from a source population living above a waterfall. We estimate the numerical contribution of the source population on the sink population and test the effects of temperature, population density, and extreme events on variation in vital rates among more than 2,500 individually tagged brown trout. We found that fish dispersing downstream from the source population help maintain high population densities in the sink population despite poor recruitment. The best model of survival for individuals older than juveniles includes additive effects of year-of-birth and time. Fast growth of older cohorts and higher population densities in 2004-2005 suggest very low population densities in late1990s, which we hypothesize were caused by a flash flood that strongly reduced population size and created the habitat conditions for faster growth and transient higher population densities after the extreme event.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic flagella are complex cellular extensions involved in many human diseases gathered under the term ciliopathies. Currently, detailed insights on flagellar structure come from studies on protozoa. Here, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) of intact human spermatozoon tails showed a variable number of microtubules in the singlet region. Inside their lumen, a novel left-handed interrupted helix which extends several micrometers at their plus ends was discovered. This structure was named Tail Axoneme Intra-Lumenal Spiral (TAILS) and binds directly to 11 protofilaments on the internal microtubule wall, coaxial with the surrounding microtubule lattice. It leaves a gap over the microtubule seam, which was directly visualized in both singlet and doublet microtubules. We suggest that TAILS may stabilize microtubules, enable rapid swimming or play a role in controlling the swimming direction of spermatozoa.",

    "abstract": "New genes, with novel protein functions, can evolve \\\"from scratch\\\" out of intergenic sequences. These de novo genes can integrate the cells genetic network and drive important phenotypic innovations. Therefore, identifying de novo genes and understanding how the transition from noncoding to coding occurs are key problems in evolutionary biology. However, identifying de novo genes is a difficult task, hampered by the presence of remote homologs, fast evolving sequences and erroneously annotated protein coding genes. To overcome these limitations, we developed a procedure that handles the usual pitfalls in de novo gene identification and predicted the emergence of 703 de novo genes in 15 yeast species from two genera whose phylogeny spans at least 100 million years of evolution. We established that de novo gene origination is a widespread phenomenon in yeasts, only a few being ultimately maintained by selection. We validated 82 candidates, by providing new translation evidence for 25 of them through mass spectrometry experiments. We also unambiguously identified the mutations that enabled the transition from non-coding to coding for 30 Saccharomyces de novo genes. We found that de novo genes preferentially emerge next to divergent promoters in GC-rich intergenic regions where the probability of finding a fortuitous and transcribed ORF is the highest. We found a more than 3-fold enrichment of de novo genes at recombination hot spots, which are GC-rich and nucleosome-free regions, suggesting that meiotic recombination would be a major driving force of de novo gene emergence in yeasts.",

    "abstract": "Replication defective viral genomes (DVGs) generated during virus replication are the primary triggers of antiviral immunity in many RNA virus infections. However, DVGs can also facilitate viral persistence. Why and how these two opposing functions of DVGs are achieved remain unknown. Here we report that during Sendai and respiratory syncytial virus infections DVGs selectively protect a subpopulation of cells from death and promote the establishment of persistent infections. We find that during Sendai virus infection this phenotype results from DVGs stimulating a MAVS-mediated TNF response that drives apoptosis of highly infected cells while extending the survival of cells enriched in DVGs. The pro-survival effect of TNF depends on the activity of the TNFR2/TRAF1 pathway that is regulated by MAVS signaling. These results identify TNF as a pivotal factor in determining cell fate during a viral infection and delineate a MAVS/TNFR2-mediated mechanism that drives the persistence of otherwise acute viruses.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of risk loci for autoimmune disease, yet only a minority ([~]25%) share genetic effects with changes to gene expression (eQTLs) in immune cells. RNA-Seq based quantification at whole-gene resolution, where abundance is estimated by culminating expression of all transcripts or exons of the same gene, is likely to account for this observed lack of colocalisation as subtle isoform switches and expression variation in independent exons can be concealed. We performed integrative cis-eQTL analysis using association statistics from twenty autoimmune diseases (560 independent loci) and RNA-Seq data from 373 individuals of the Geuvadis cohort profiled at gene-, isoform-, exon-, junction-, and intron-level resolution in lymphoblastoid cell lines. After stringently testing for a shared causal variant using both the Joint Likelihood Mapping and Regulatory Trait Concordance frameworks, we found that gene-level quantification significantly underestimated the number of causal cis-eQTLs. Only 5.0-5.3% of loci were found to share a causal cis-eQTL at gene-level compared to 12.9-18.4% at exon-level and 9.6-10.5% at junction-level. More than a fifth of autoimmune loci shared an underlying causal variant in a single cell type by combining all five quantification types; a marked increase over current estimates of steady-state causal cis-eQTLs. As an example, we dissected in detail the genetic associations of systemic lupus erythematosus and functionally annotated the candidate genes. Many of the known and novel genes were concealed at gene-level (e.g. BANK1, UBE2L3, IKZF2, TYK2, LYST). By leveraging RNA-Seq, we were able to isolate the specific transcripts, exons, junctions, and introns modulated by the cis-eQTL - which supports the targeted design of follow-up functional studies involving alternative splicing. Causal cis-eQTLs detected at different quantification types were also found to localise to discrete epigenetic annotations. We provide our findings from all twenty autoimmune diseases as a web resource.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIt is well acknowledged that non-coding genetic variants contribute to disease susceptibility through alteration of gene expression levels (known as eQTLs). Identifying the variants that are causal to both disease risk and changes to expression levels has not been easy and we believe this is in part due to how expression is quantified using RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq). Whole-gene expression, where abundance is estimated by culminating expression of all transcripts or exons of the same gene, is conventionally used in eQTL analysis. This low resolution may conceal subtle isoform switches and expression variation in independent exons. Using isoform-, exon-, and junction-level quantification can not only point to the candidate genes involved, but also the specific transcripts implicated. We make use of existing RNA-Seq expression data profiled at gene-, isoform-, exon-, junction-, and intron-level, and perform eQTL analysis using association data from twenty autoimmune diseases. We find exon-, and junction-level thoroughly outperform gene-level analysis, and by leveraging all five quantification types, we find >20% of autoimmune loci share a single genetic effect with gene expression. We highlight that existing and new eQTL cohorts using RNA-Seq should profile expression at multiple resolutions to maximise the ability to detect causal eQTLs and candidate genes.",

GDF8 is held in a latent state through interactions with its N-terminal prodomain, much like TGF-{beta} Using a combination of small angle X-ray scattering and mutagenesis, we characterized the interactions of GDF8 with its prodomain. Our results show that the prodomain:GDF8 complex can exist in a fully latent state and an activated or  triggered state where the prodomain remains in complex with the mature domain. However, these states are not reversible, indicating the latent GDF8 is  spring-loaded. Structural analysis shows that the prodomain:GDF8 complex adopts an  open configuration, distinct from the latency state of TGF- and more similar to the  open state of Activin A and BMP9 (non-latent complexes). We determined that GDF{beta}8 maintains similar features for latency, including the alpha-1 helix and fastener elements, and identified a series of mutations in the prodomain of GDF8 that alleviate latency, including I56E, which does not require activation by the protease Tolloid. In vivo, active GDF8 variants were potent negative regulators of muscle mass, compared to wild-type GDF8. Collectively, these results help characterize the latency and activation mechanisms of GDF8.",

This uncultivable fungus is an obligate pulmonary pathogen which causes pneumonia in immuno-compromised individuals, a major life-threatening infection. Long-read PacBio sequencing was used to assemble a core of subtelomeres of a single P. jirovecii strain from a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen of a single patient. A total of 113 genes encoding surface proteins were identified, including 28 pseudogenes. These genes formed a subtelomeric gene superfamily which included five families encoding adhesive GPI-anchored glycoproteins, and one family encoding excreted glycoproteins. Numerical analyses suggested that diversification of the glycoproteins relies on mosaic genes created by ectopic recombination, and occurs only within each family. DNA motifs suggested that all genes are expressed independently, except those of the family encoding the most abundant surface glycoproteins which are subject to mutually exclusive expression. PCR analyses showed that exchange of the expressed gene of the latter family occurs frequently, possibly favoured by the location of the genes proximal to the telomere because this allows concomitant telomere exchange. Our observations suggest that (i) P. jirovecii cell surface is made of a complex mixture of different surface proteins, with a majority of a single isoform of the most abundant glycoprotein, (ii) genetic mosaicism within each family ensures variation of the glycoproteins, and (iii) the strategy of the fungus consists in the continuous production of new subpopulations composed of cells which are antigenically different.",

    "abstract": "It is believed that eukaryotes arise from prokaryotes, which means that organelles can form in the latter. Such events, however, had not been observed previously. Here, we report the biogenesis of organelles in the endosymbiotic cyanobacterium TDX16 that escaped from its senescent/necrotic host cell of green alga Haematococcus pluvialis. In brief, organelle biogenesis in TDX16 initiated with cytoplasm compartmentalization, followed by de-compartmentalization, DNA allocation, and re-compartmentalization, as such two composite organelles-the primitive chloroplast and primitive nucleus sequestering minor and major fractions of cellular DNA respectively were formed. Thereafter, the eukaryotic cytoplasmic matrix was built up from the matrix extruded from the primitive nucleus; mitochondria were assembled in and segregated from the primitive chloroplast, whereby the primitive nucleus and primitive chloroplast matured into nucleus and chloroplast respectively; while most mitochondria turned into double-membraned vacuoles after matrix degradation. Results of pigment analyses, 16S rRNA and genome sequencing revealed that TDX16 is a phycocyanin-containing cyanobacterium resembling Chroococcidiopsis thermalis, which had acquired 9,017,401bp DNAs with 10301 genes form its host. Therefore, organelle biogenesis in TDX16 was achieved by hybridizing the acquired eukaryotic DNAs with its own ones and expressing the hybrid genome.\\n\\nOrganelle biogenesis in TDX16 results in its transition into a new eukaryotic alga TDX16-DE, which provides a reference to re-understand the development, structure, function and association of organelles in eukaryotes and the reasons behind them, and has implications on other sections of biology, particularly cancer biology and evolutionary biology: (1) the formation and maturation of the small organelle-less nascent cancer cells share striking similarities with TDX16 development and transition, so, it is most likely that cancer cells arise from bacteria; (2) organelle biogenesis in TDX16 uncovers a way of new organelle and new single-celled eukaryote formation, and in light of which, the ancestral organelles were likely formed in rather than transformed form the endosymbiotic prokaryotes that had acquired their hosts DNAs.",

While current methods accurately identify species core parts, they miss many accessory genes or split them into small gene groups that remain unassociated to core clusters.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce MSPminer, a computationally efficient software tool that reconstitutes Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs) by binning co-abundant genes across metagenomic samples. MSPminer relies on a new robust measure of proportionality coupled with an empirical classifier to group and distinguish not only species core genes but accessory genes also. Applied to a large scale metagenomic dataset, MSPminer successfully delineates in a few hours the gene repertoires of 1 661 microbial species with similar specificity and higher sensitivity than existing tools. The taxonomic annotation of MSPs reveals microorganisms hitherto unknown and brings coherence in the nomenclature of the species of the human gut microbiota. The provided MSPs can be readily used for taxonomic profiling and biomarkers discovery in human gut metagenomic samples. In addition, MSPminer can be applied on gene count tables from other ecosystems to perform similar analyses.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe binary is freely available for non-commercial users at enterome.fr/site/downloads/ Contact: florian.plaza-onate@inra.fr\\n\\nSupplementary informationAvailable in the file named Supplementary Information.pdf",

    "abstract": "While deleterious de novo mutations (DNMs) in coding region conferring risk in neuropsychiatric disorders have been revealed by next-generation sequencing, the role of DNMs involved in post-transcriptional regulation in pathogenesis of these disorders remains to be elucidated. Here, we identified 1,736 post-transcriptionally impaired DNMs (piDNMs), and prioritized 1,482 candidate genes in four neuropsychiatric disorders from 7,748 families. Our results revealed higher prevalence of piDNMs in the probands than in controls (P = 8.19x10-17), and piDNM-harboring genes were enriched for epigenetic modifications and neuronal or synaptic functions. Moreover, we identified 86 piDNM-containing genes forming convergent co-expression modules and intensive protein-protein interactions in at least two neuropsychiatric disorders. These cross-disorder genes carrying piDNMs could form interaction network centered on RNA binding proteins, suggesting a shared post-transcriptional etiology underlying these disorders. Our findings illustrate the significant contribution of piDNMs to four neuropsychiatric disorders, and lay emphasis on combining functional and network-based evidences to identify regulatory causes of genetic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Red carotenoid-based coloration is widely distributed across marine and terrestrial animals and has taken a prominent role in studies of how phenotypic traits evolve in response to natural and sexual selection. Key to these studies is an understanding of the physiological mechanisms that give rise to red coloration, yet an ideal model system for such work has not been identified. The red marine copepod Tigriopus californicus is used as a model system for studies in ecotoxicology, genetics, and physiology, but the mechanisms involved in its bright red coloration have not been well studied. Like nearly all animals that display red carotenoid coloration, T. californicus likely convert yellow carotenoids present in their algal diet to red carotenoids. We conducted precursor/product feeding experiments to demonstrate that T. californicus bioconverts dietary carotenoids to the red carotenoid, astaxanthin. In separate treatment groups, copepods were fed carotenoids that are precursors to specific astaxanthin bioconversion pathways. We found that copepods from each precursor pigment group produced astaxanthin, and that the amount produced depended on which carotenoid was supplemented. We also describe the distribution of astaxanthin in developing egg sacs and show that the red color of the naupliar eyespot is not due to astaxanthin. We briefly discuss the potential of Tigriopus californicus to serve as a model system for the study of carotenoid metabolism in animals.",

    "abstract": "It is widely assumed that the addition of DNA methylation at CpG rich gene promoters silences gene transcription. However, this conclusion is largely drawn from the observation that promoter DNA methylation inversely correlates with gene expression. The effect of forced DNA methylation on endogenous promoters has yet to be comprehensively assessed. Here, we conducted artificial methylation of thousands of promoters in human cells using an artificial zinc finger-DNMT3A fusion protein, enabling assessment of the effect of forced DNA methylation upon transcription and histone modifications, and the durability of DNA methylation after the removal of the fusion protein. We find that DNA methylation is frequently insufficient to transcriptionally repress promoters. Furthermore, DNA methylation deposited at promoter regions associated with H3K4me3 is rapidly erased after removal of the zinc finger-DNMT3A fusion protein. Finally, we demonstrate that induced DNA methylation can exist simultaneously on promoter nucleosomes that possess the active histone modification H3K4me3. These findings suggest that promoter DNA methylation is not generally sufficient for transcriptional inactivation, with implications for the emerging field of epigenome engineering.",

In principal, combining these technologies, plus transmitter and channel models, should allow detailed and accurate simulation of real neural circuits. Here we experiment with this combination, using a well-studied system (motion detection in Drosophila). Since simulation requires both the physical geometry (which we have) and the models of the synapses (which are not currently available), we built approximate synapses corresponding to their known and estimated function. Once we did so, we reproduced direction selectivity in T4 cells, one of the main functions of this neural circuit. This verified the basic functionality of both extraction and simulations, and provided a biologically relevant computation we could use in further experiments. We then compared models with different degrees of physical realism, from full detailed models down to models consisting of a single node, to examine the tradeoff of simulation resources required versus accuracy achieved.\\n\\nOur results show that much simpler models may be adequate, at least in the case of medulla neurons in Drosophila. Such models can be easily derived from fully detailed models, and result in simulations that are much smaller, much faster, and accurate enough for many purposes. Biologically, we show that a lumped neuron model reproduces the main motion detector operation, confirming the result of Gruntman[1], that dendritic compution is not required for this function.",

    "abstract": "The human genome is structurally organized in three-dimensional space to facilitate functional partitioning of transcription. We learned that the latent episome of the human Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) preferentially associates with gene-poor chromosomes and avoids gene-rich chromosomes. Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus behaves similarly, but human papillomavirus does not. Contacts localize on the EBV side to OriP, the latent origin of replication. This genetic element, and the EBNA1 protein that binds there, are sufficient to reconstitute chromosome association preferences of the entire episome. Contacts localize on the human side to gene-poor regions of chromatin distant from transcription start sites. Upon reactivation from latency, however, the episome moves away from repressive heterochromatin and toward active euchromatin. Our work adds three-dimensional relocalization to the molecular events that occur during reactivation. Involvement of a myriad of interchromosomal associations also suggests a role for this type of long - range association in gene regulation.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe human genome is structurally organized in three-dimensional space, and this structure functionally affects transcriptional activity. We set out to investigate whether a double stranded DNA virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), uses similar mechanisms as the human genome to regulate transcription. We found that the EBV genome associates with repressive compartments of the nucleus during latency and active compartments during reactivation. This study is advances our knowledge of the EBV life cycle, adding three-dimensional re-localization as a novel component to the molecular events that occur during reactivation. Furthermore, the data adds to our understanding of nuclear compartments, showing that disperse interchromosomal interactions may be important for regulating transcription.",

However, uncoupling the impact of shape and force in tissues remains challenging. Combining stretching of Xenopus laevis tissue with a novel method of inferring relative mechanical stress, we find separate roles for cell shape in orientating division and mechanical stress in cueing division. We demonstrate that division orientation is best predicted by an axis of cell shape defined by the position of tricellular junctions (TCJs), which aligns exactly with the principal axis of local cell stress rather than the tissue-level stress. The alignment of division to cell shape requires functional cadherin and the localisation of the spindle orientation protein, LGN, to TCJs, but is not sensitive to relative cell stress magnitude. In contrast, cell proliferation rate is more directly regulated by mechanical stress, being correlated with relative isotropic stress, and can be decoupled from cell shape when myosin II is depleted.",

    "abstract": "In everyday visual environments, objects are non-uniformly distributed across visual space. Many objects preferentially occupy particular retinotopic locations: for example, lamps more often fall into the upper visual field, whereas carpets more often fall into the lower visual field. The long-term experience with natural environments prompts the hypothesis that the visual system is tuned to such retinotopic object locations. A key prediction is that typically positioned objects should be coded more efficiently. To test this prediction, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while participants viewed briefly presented objects appearing in their typical locations (e.g., an airplane in the upper visual field) or in atypical locations (e.g., an airplane in the lower visual field). Multivariate pattern analysis applied to the EEG data revealed that object classification depended on positional regularities: Objects were classified more accurately when positioned typically, rather than atypically, already at 140 ms, suggesting that relatively early stages of object processing are tuned to typical retinotopic locations. Our results confirm the prediction that long-term experience with objects occurring at specific locations leads to enhanced perceptual processing when these objects appear in their typical locations. This may indicate a neural mechanism for efficient natural scene processing, where a large number of typically positioned objects needs to be processed.",

    "abstract": "While nucleosome positioning on eukaryotic genome play important roles for genetic regulation, molecular mechanisms of nucleosome positioning and sliding along DNA are not well understood. Here we investigated thermally-activated spontaneous nucleosome sliding mechanisms developing and applying a coarse-grained molecular simulation method that incorporates both long-range electrostatic and short-range hydrogen-bond interactions between histone octamer and DNA. The simulations revealed two distinct sliding modes depending on the nucleosomal DNA sequence. A uniform DNA sequence showed frequent sliding with one base pair step in a rotation-coupled manner, akin to screw-like motions. On the contrary, a strong positioning sequence, the so-called 601 sequence, exhibits rare, abrupt transitions of five and ten base pair steps without rotation. Moreover, we evaluated the importance of hydrogen bond interactions on the sliding mode, finding that strong and weak bonds favor respectively the rotation-coupled and -uncoupled sliding movements.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNucleosomes are fundamental units of chromatin folding consisting of double-stranded DNA wrapped [~]1.7 times around a histone octamer. By densely populating the eukaryotic genome, nucleosomes enable efficient genome compaction inside the cellular nucleus. However, the portion of DNA occupied by a nucleosome can hardly be accessed by other DNA-binding proteins, obstructing fundamental cellular processes such as DNA replication and transcription. DNA compaction and access by other proteins can simultaneously be achieved via the dynamical repositioning of nucleosomes, which can slide along the DNA sequence. In this study, we developed and used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the molecular details of nucleosome sliding. We find that the sliding mode is highly dependent on the underlying DNA sequence. Specifically, a sequence with a strong nucleosome positioning signal slides via large jumps by five and ten base pairs, preserving the optimal DNA bending profile. On the other hand, uniform sequences without the positioning signal slide via a screw-like motion of DNA, one base pair at the time. These results show that sequence has a large effect not only on the formation of nucleosomes, but also on the kinetics of repositioning.",

Interphase cells above the transit-amplifying compartment had no DNA-bound MCM2-7, but still expressed MCM2-7 protein, suggesting that licensing is inhibited immediately upon differentiation. Strikingly, we found most proliferative Lgr5(+) stem cells are in an unlicensed state. This suggests that the elongated cell-cycle of intestinal stem-cells is caused by an increased G1 length, characterised by dormant periods with unlicensed origins. Significantly, the unlicensed state is lost In Apc mutant epithelium, which lacks a functional restriction point, causing licensing immediately upon G1 entry.

In the vertebrate spinal cord, FGF, Wnt and Retinoic Acid signaling pathways regulate the progressive caudal-to-rostral maturation of neural progenitors by regulating a poorly understood gene regulatory network of transcription factors. We have mapped out this gene regulatory network in the chicken pre-neural tube, identifying CDX4 as a dual-function core component that simultaneously regulates gradual loss of cell potency and acquisition of differentiation states: in a caudal-to-rostral direction, CDX4 represses the early neural differentiation marker Nkx1.2 and promotes the late neural differentiation marker Pax6. Significantly, CDX4 prevents premature PAX6-dependent neural differentiation by blocking Ngn2 activation. This regulation of CDX4 over Pax6 is restricted to the rostral pre-neural tube by Retinoic Acid signaling. Together, our results show that in the spinal cord, CDX4 is part of the gene regulatory network controlling the sequential and progressive transition of states from high to low potency during neural progenitor maturation. Given CDX well-known involvement in Hox gene regulation, we propose that CDX factors coordinate the maturation and axial specification of neural progenitor cells during spinal cord development.",

    "abstract": "Ocular reflectors enhance eye sensitivity in dim light, but can produce reflected eyeshine when illuminated. Most teleost fish occlude their reflectors during the day. The opposite is observed in cryptic sit-and-wait predators such as scorpionfish and toadfish, where reflectors are occluded at night and exposed during the day. This results in daytime eyeshine, proposed to enhance pupil camouflage by reducing the contrast between the otherwise black pupil and the surrounding tissue. In this study, we test this hypothesis in the scorpionfish Scorpaena porcus and show that eyeshine is the result of two mechanisms: the previously described Stratum Argenteum Reflected (SAR) eyeshine, and Pigment Epithelium Transmitted (PET) eyeshine, a newly described mechanism for this species. We confirm that the ocular reflector is exposed only when the eye is light-adapted, and present field measurements to show that eyeshine reduces pupil contrast against the iris. We then estimate the relative contribution of SAR and PET eyeshine to pupil brightness. Visual models for different light scenarios in the field show that daytime eyeshine enhances pupil camouflage from the perspective of a prey fish. We propose that the reversed occlusion mechanism of some cryptobenthic predators has evolved as a compromise between camouflage and vision.",

In this study, we analyzed 600 million pairs of Illumina sequence reads and identified 28 thousand SB insertions in non-TA sites.

The right side of the consensus sequence is exactly the same as the sequence of SB transposon ends, indicating interaction between the transposon DNA and the target DNA.

    "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated the importance of global changes to the functional organization of brain network following stroke. Resting functional MRI (R-fMRI) is a non-invasive tool that enables the measurement of functional connectivity (FC) across the entire brain while placing minimal demands on the subject. For these reasons, it is a uniquely appealing tool for studying the distant effects of stroke. However, R-fMRI studies rely on a number of premises that cannot be assumed without careful validation in the context of stroke. Here, we describe strategies to identify and mitigate confounds specific to R-fMRI research in cerebrovascular disease. Five main topics are discussed: 1) achieving adequate co-registration of lesioned brains, 2) identifying and removing hemodynamic lags in resting BOLD, 3) identifying other vascular disruptions that affect the resting BOLD signal, 4) selecting an appropriate control cohort, and 5) acquiring sufficient fMRI data to reliably identify FC changes. For each topic, we provide evidence-based guidelines for steps to improve the interpretability and reproducibility of FC-stroke research. We include a table of confounds and approaches to identify and mitigate each. Our recommendations extend to any research using R-fMRI to study diseases that might alter cerebrovascular flow and dynamics or brain anatomy.",

Here we use tDCS to test the role of the motor cortex and cerebellum in sensorimotor learning in speech. During productions of  head,  bed, and  dead, the first formant of the vowel sound was altered in real-time towards the first formant of the vowel sound in  had,  bad, and  dad. Compensatory changes in first and second formant production were used as a measure of motor adaptation. TDCS to either the motor cortex or the cerebellum improved sensorimotor learning in speech compared to sham stimulation. However, in the case of cerebellar tDCS, production changes were restricted to the source of the acoustical error (i.e. the first formant). Motor cortex tDCS drove production changes that offset errors in the first formant, but, unlike cerebellar tDCS, adaptive changes in the second formant also occurred. The results suggest that motor cortex and cerebellar tDCS have both shared and dissociable effects on motor adaptation. The study provides initial causal evidence in speech production that the motor cortex and the cerebellum support different aspects of sensorimotor learning. We propose that motor cortex tDCS drives sensorimotor learning towards previously learned patterns of movement, while cerebellar tDCS focuses sensorimotor learning on error correction.",

Various methods have been applied for handling missing values, but the selection of methods can significantly affect following data analyses and interpretations. According to the definition, there are three types of missing values, missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR).\\n\\nObjectivesThe aim of this study was to comprehensively compare common imputation methods for different types of missing values using two separate metabolomics data sets (977 and 198 serum samples respectively) to propose a strategy to deal with missing values in metabolomics studies.\\n\\nMethodsImputation methods included zero, half minimum (HM), mean, median, random forest (RF), singular value decomposition (SVD), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and quantile regression imputation of left-censored data (QRILC). Normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and NRMSE-based sum of ranks (SOR) were applied to evaluate the imputation accuracy for MCAR/MAR and MNAR correspondingly. Principal component analysis (PCA)/partial least squares (PLS)-Procrustes sum of squared error were used to evaluate the overall sample distribution. Students t-test followed by Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of imputation on univariate statistical analysis.\\n\\nResultsOur findings demonstrated that RF imputation performed the best for MCAR/MAR and QRILC was the favored one for MNAR.\\n\\nConclusionCombining with \\\"modified 80% rule\\\", we proposed a comprehensive strategy and developed a public-accessible web-tool for missing value imputation in metabolomics data.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the Interaction Factor (IF), a measure for quantifying the interaction of molecular clusters in super-resolution microscopy images. The IF is robust in the sense that it is independent of cluster density, and it only depends on the extent of the pair-wise interaction between different types of molecular clusters in the image. The IF for a single or a collection of images is estimated by first using stochastic modelling where the locations of clusters in the images are repeatedly randomized to estimate the distribution of the overlaps between the clusters in the absence of interaction (IF=0). Second, an analytical form of the relationship between IF and the overlap (which has the random overlap as its only parameter) is used to estimate the IF for the experimentally observed overlap. The advantage of IF compared to conventional methods to quantify interaction in microscopy images is that it is insensitive to changing cluster density and is an absolute measure of interaction, making the interpretation of experiments easier. We validate the IF method by using both simulated and experimental data and provide an ImageJ plugin for determining the IF of an image.",

    "abstract": "The non-invasive detection of cancer mutations is a breakthrough in oncology. Here, we applied whole-exome sequencing of matched germline and basal plasma cell-free DNA samples (WES-cfDNA) on a RAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer patient with primary resistance to standard treatment regimens including VEGFR inhibitors. Using WES-cfDNA, we could detect 73% (54/74) of the somatic mutations uncovered by WES-tumor including a variety of mutation types: frameshift (indels), missense, noncoding (splicing), and nonsense mutations. Additionally, WES-cfDNA discovered 14 high-confidence somatic mutations not identified by WES-tumor. Importantly, in the absence of the tumor specimen, WES-cfDNA could identify 68 of the 88 (77.3%) total mutations that could be identified by both techniques. Of tumor biology relevance, we identified the novel KDR/VEGFR2 L840F somatic mutation, which we showed was a clonal mutation event in this tumor. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo functional assays confirmed that L840F causes strong resistance to anti-angiogenic drugs, whereas the KDR/VEGFR2 hot-spot mutant R1032Q confers sensitivity to cabozantinib. Moreover, we found a 1-3% of recurrent KDR somatic mutations across large and non-overlapping cancer sequencing projects, and the majority of these mutations were located in protein residues frequently mutated in other cancer-relevant kinases, such as EGFR, ABL1, and ALK, suggesting a functional role.\\n\\nIn summary, the current study highlights the capability of exomic sequencing of cfDNA from plasma of cancer patients as a powerful platform for somatic landscape analysis and discovery of resistance-associated cancer mutations. Because of its advantage to generate results highly concordant to those of tumor sequencing without the hurdle of conventional tumor biopsies, we anticipate that WES-cfDNA will become frequently used in oncology. Moreover, our study identified for the first-time KDR/VEGFR2 somatic mutations as potential genetic biomarkers of response to anti-angiogenic cancer therapies and will serve as reference for further studies on the topic.",

Generation of and recruitment to viral contigs (> 5kbp, N=66) allowed tracking of infection dynamics over time and space.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe annual life history strategy with diapauses evolved repeatedly in killifish. To understand their and to characterize their variation between species, patterns of desiccation plasticity seem central. Plasticity might have played a role in the origin of these developmental arrests, when annual fish evolved from non-annual ones. The consequences of desiccation on survival and developmental rates of embryos of annual fish are poorly known. Using detailed demographic modelling of embryonal life histories, we investigate plasticity for desiccation in the Argentinian pearlfish Austrolebias bellottii. The treatment protocol contains changing environmental conditions with successive phases of mild desiccation and rewetting.\\n\\nResultsWe observed no clear diapause II and thus no increased incidence caused by mild and prolonged desiccation. Embryos arrest development in the pre-hatching stage (DIII) or in the dispersed cell phase (DI) irrespective of environmental conditions. There are limited effects of desiccation on survival, limited developmental delays and an acceleration of development into the pre-hatching stage. We found significant parental variance components on developmental rates, but hardly any effect of parental age. Hatching probabilities increased with age, when embryos had been in air at 100% RH and increased further when embryos were rewetted a second time after a two month interval.\\n\\nConclusionsMild desiccation and rewetting affect survival, rates of development and hatching probability, but not the fractions of embryos that arrest development in particular stages. We can conclude that the incidences of diapause have become relatively independent of the occurrence of mild desiccation, as if they have become assimilated. In contrast to the responses to mild desiccation observed in the non-annual rivulids, Austrolebias accelerates development into the pre-hatching stage.",

Within the novel genetic loci were variants associated with neurodegenerative disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, brain structure, and BMI. Gene-based analyses found 536 genes significantly associated with general cognitive function; many were highly expressed in the brain, and associated with neurogenesis and dendrite gene sets. Genetic association results predicted up to 4% of general cognitive function variance in independent samples.

    "abstract": "The evolution of complex traits in heterogeneous environments may shape the order of genes within chromosomes. Drosophila pseudoobscura has a rich gene arrangement polymorphism that allows one to test evolutionary genetic hypotheses about how chromosomal inversions are established in populations. D. pseudoobscura has >30 gene arrangements on a single chromosome that were generated through a series of overlapping inversion mutations with > 10 inversions with appreciable frequencies and wide geographic distributions. This study analyzes the genomic sequences of 54 strains of Drosophila pseudoobscura that carry one of six different chromosomal arrangements to test whether (1) genetic drift, (2) hitchhiking with an adaptive allele, (3) direct effects of inversions to create gene disruptions caused by breakpoints, or (4) indirect effects of inversions in limiting the formation of recombinant gametes are responsible for the establishment of new gene arrangements. We found that the inversion events do not disrupt the structure of protein coding genes at the breakpoints. Population genetic analyses of 2,669 protein coding genes identified 277 outlier loci harboring elevated frequencies of arrangement-specific derived alleles. Significant linkage disequilibrium occurs among distant loci interspersed between regions with low levels of association indicating that distant allelic combinations are held together despite shared polymorphism among arrangements. Outlier genes showing evidence of genetic differentiation between arrangements are enriched for sensory perception and detoxification genes. The data presented here support the indirect effect of inversion hypothesis where chromosomal inversions are favored because they maintain linked associations among multi-locus allelic combinations among different arrangements.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenomic regions of autozygosity (ROA) arise when an individual is homozygous for haplotypes inherited identical-by-descent from ancestors shared by both parents. Over the past decade, they have gained importance for understanding evolutionary history and the genetic basis of complex diseases and traits. However, methods to detect ROA in dense genotype data have not evolved in step with advances in genome technology that now enable us to rapidly create large high-resolution genotype datasets, limiting our ability to investigate their constituent ROA patterns.\\n\\nResultsWe report a weighted likelihood approach for identifying ROA in dense genotype data that accounts for autocorrelation among genotyped positions and the possibilities of unobserved mutation and recombination events, and variability in the confidence of individual genotype calls in whole genome sequence (WGS) data. Forward-time genetic simulations under two demographic scenarios that reflect situations where inbreeding and its effect on fitness are of interest suggest this approach is better powered than existing state-of-the-art methods to detect ROA at marker densities consistent with WGS and popular microarray genotyping platforms used in human and non-human studies. Moreover, we present evidence that suggests this approach is able to distinguish ROA arising via consanguinity from ROA arising via endogamy. Using subsets of The 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 data we show that, relative to WGS, intermediate and long ROA are captured robustly with popular microarray platforms, while detection of short ROA is more variable and improves with marker density. Worldwide ROA patterns inferred from WGS data are found to accord well with those previously reported on the basis of microarray genotype data. Finally, we highlight the potential of this approach to detect genomic regions enriched for autozygosity signals in one group relative to another based upon comparisons of per-individual autozygosity likelihoods instead of inferred ROA frequencies.\\n\\nConclusionsThis weighted likelihood ROA detection approach can assist population- and disease-geneticists working with a wide variety of data types and species to explore ROA patterns and to identify genomic regions with differential ROA signals among groups, thereby advancing our understanding of evolutionary history and the role of recessive variation in phenotypic variation and disease.",

    "abstract": "When different sources of sensory information suggest competing behavioral responses, the efficiency of decision-making is impaired. Prior work suggests that at least two mechanisms may play a role in mitigating this interference: using early selective attention to extract the most relevant sensory inputs to avoid conflict or increasing the efficiency of the executive control network to resolve conflict during post-perceptual processing. To test these alternatives, we combined a stimulus-frequency tagging technique with a classic color-word Stroop paradigm, where color-bar targets and letter-string distractors were simultaneously flickered at different frequencies. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we measured the quality of early sensory processing by assessing the amplitude of steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by the targets and distractors. We also measured the engagement of the executive control network by assessing changes in frontal theta (4-7Hz) and posterior alpha oscillations (8-14Hz). Counter to the  early selective sensory modulation account, the amplitude of the SSVEP response was not modulated by manipulations of color/word congruency, while the frontal theta activity increased and the posterior alpha activity decreased in response to conflict. Moreover, target-related SSVEP amplitude was not correlated with response times (RTs) and a higher (not lower) distractor-related SSVEP amplitude predicted faster RTs. On the other hand, the amplitude of the frontal theta and alpha activity was highly correlated with RTs, irrespective of conflict levels. Over all, these results highlight the dominant role of the executive control network in conflict resolution during post-perceptual processing.\\n\\nSignificance StatementConflicting information interferes with decision-making. However, this interference can be mitigated either by extracting the most relevant inputs during early sensory processing or by increasing the efficiency of the executive control processes to resolve conflict. By measuring electroencephalography (EEG) in humans performing a modified color-word Stroop task, we examined early sensory responses evoked by targets and distractors while simultaneously monitoring frontal theta and posterior alpha oscillations to index the activation of the executive control network. We found evidence that the executive control network played a more prominent role in resolving conflict.",

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide a computational framework to model cortical representation and organization for spatial visual processing, but unable to explain how the brain processes temporal information. To overcome this limitation, we extended a CNN by adding recurrent connections to different layers of the CNN to allow spatial representations to be remembered and accumulated over time. The extended model, or the recurrent neural network (RNN), embodied a hierarchical and distributed model of process memory as an integral part of visual processing. Unlike the CNN, the RNN learned spatiotemporal features from videos to enable action recognition. The RNN better predicted cortical responses to natural movie stimuli than the CNN, at all visual areas especially those along the dorsal stream. As a fully-observable model of visual processing, the RNN also revealed a cortical hierarchy of temporal receptive window, dynamics of process memory, and spatiotemporal representations. These results support the hypothesis of process memory, and demonstrate the potential of using the RNN for in-depth computational understanding of dynamic natural vision.",

    "abstract": "Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the complex internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we developed a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of scenes: that is, information about where one can and cannot move within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously trained for scene classification. We found that the CNN was highly predictive of OPA representations, and, importantly, that it accounted for the portion of OPA variance that reflected the navigational affordances of scenes. The CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of in silico experiments on this model to gain insights into its internal computations. These analyses showed that the computation of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal orientations, both of which have previously been identified as low-level stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex. These computations also exhibited a strong preference for information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that provides insights into its visual computations. More broadly, they advance integrative techniques for understanding visual cortex across multiple level of analysis: from the identification of cortical sensory functions to the modeling of their underlying algorithmic implementations.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYHow does visual cortex compute behaviorally relevant properties of the local environment from sensory inputs? For decades, computational models have been able to explain only the earliest stages of biological vision, but recent advances in the engineering of deep neural networks have yielded a breakthrough in the modeling of high-level visual cortex. However, these models are not explicitly designed for testing neurobiological theories, and, like the brain itself, their complex internal operations remain poorly understood. Here we examined a deep neural network for insights into the cortical representation of the navigational affordances of visual scenes. In doing so, we developed a set of high-throughput techniques and statistical tools that are broadly useful for relating the internal operations of neural networks with the information processes of the brain. Our findings demonstrate that a deep neural network with purely feedforward computations can account for the processing of navigational layout in high-level visual cortex. We next performed a series of experiments and visualization analyses on this neural network, which characterized a set of stimulus input features that may be critical for computing navigationally related cortical representations and identified a set of high-level, complex scene features that may serve as a basis set for the cortical coding of navigational layout. These findings suggest a computational mechanism through which high-level visual cortex might encode the spatial structure of the local navigational environment, and they demonstrate an experimental approach for leveraging the power of deep neural networks to understand the visual computations of the brain.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a widely used noninvasive brain stimulation method capable of inducing plastic reorganisation of cortical circuits in humans. Changes in neural activity following TMS are often attributed to synaptic plasticity (e.g long-term potentiation and depression; LTP/LTD). However, the precise way in which synaptic processes such as LTP/LTD modulate the activity of large populations of neurons, as stimulated en masse by TMS, are unclear. The recent development of biophysically-informed models, which capture the physiological properties of TMS-induced plasticity using mathematics, provide an excellent framework for reconciling synaptic and macroscopic plasticity. In this article, we overview the TMS paradigms used to induce plasticity, and their limitations. We then describe the development of biophysically-based numerical models of the mechanisms underlying LTP/LTD on population-level neuronal activity, and the application of these models to TMS plasticity paradigms, including theta burst and paired associative stimulation. Finally, we outline how modeling can complement experiment to improve mechanistic understandings and optimize outcomes of TMS-induced plasticity.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "The APOBEC3 (A3) family of human cytidine deaminases is renowned for providing a first line of defense against many exogenous and endogenous retroviruses. However, the ability of these proteins to deaminate deoxycytidines in ssDNA makes A3s a double-edged sword. When overexpressed, A3s can mutate endogenous genomic DNA resulting in a variety of cancers. Although the sequence context for mutating DNA varies among A3s, the mechanism for substrate sequence specificity is not well understood. To characterize substrate specificity of A3A, a systematic approach was used to quantify the affinity for substrate as a function of sequence context, length, substrate secondary structure, and pH. We identified the A3A ssDNA binding motif as (T/C)TC(A/G), and found that A3A binds RNA in a sequence specific manner. Furthermore, A3A bound tighter to its substrate binding motif when in a loop compared to linear oligonucleotide. Our results suggest that the A3A affinity and preference for substrate is modulated by the structure of DNA, and not just its chemical identity. Analysis of previously published co-crystal structures of A3A bound to ssDNA in light of the above findings directed the proposal of a new model for the molecular mechanism underlying A3A sequence preference. On a broader scale, the results of this work not only provide key insights into the mechanism of A3s beneficial roles in the cell, especially in viral restriction, but also into A3s deleterious activity such as in the development of cancer.",

Here, the hypothesis that the effects of heterozygosity vary with environmental conditions was tested using six populations of marble trout Salmo marmoratus from Western Slovenia as a model system. Specifically, the tested hypotheses were: stronger effects of heterozygosity on survival in populations characterized by low average survival, no effects of heterozygosity on probability of surviving flash floods owing to their largely non-selective effects across traits, and stronger effects of heterozygosity on survival for fish born after floods than fish born before. A significant effect of heterozygosity on survival was found in populations characterized by low average survival. There were no effects of heterozygosity on probability of surviving flash floods, but in one population a positive correlation between heterozygosity and survival for fish born after the extreme events was found, probably because crowding in a small section of the stream caused more intense competition for resources.",

We used as a model system marble trout Salmo marmoratus (native species) and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (non-native) living in the Idrijca River (Slovenia). An impassable waterfall separates the stream in two sectors only a few hundred meters apart: a downstream sector in which marble trout live in sympatry with rainbow trout and a upstream sector in which marble trout live in allopatry. We used an overarching modeling approach that uses tag-recapture and genetic data (> 2,500 unique marble and rainbow trout were sampled and SNP-genotyped) to reconstruct pedigrees, test for synchrony of population dynamics, and model survival and growth while accounting for individual heterogeneity in performance. The population dynamics of the two marble trout populations and of rainbow trout were overall synchronous. We found higher prevalence of younger parents, higher mortality, and lower population density in marble trout living in sympatry with rainbow trout than in marble trout living in allopatry. There were no differences in the average individual growth trajectories between the two marble trout populations. Faster life histories of marble trout living in sympatry with rainbow trout are consistent with predictions of life-history theory.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAssortative mating is a universal feature of human societies, and individuals from ethnically diverse populations are known to mate assortatively based on similarities in genetic ancestry. However, little is currently known regarding the exact phenotypic cues, or their underlying genetic architecture, which inform ancestry-based assortative mating.\\n\\nResultsWe developed a novel approach, using genome-wide analysis of ancestry-specific haplotypes, to evaluate ancestry-based assortative mating on traits whose expression varies among the three continental population groups - African, European, and Native American - that admixed to form modern Latin American populations. Application of this method to genome sequences sampled from Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Puerto Rico revealed widespread ancestry-based assortative mating. We discovered a number of anthropometric traits (body mass, height, facial development and waist-hip ratio) and neurological attributes (educational attainment and schizophrenia) that serve as phenotypic cues for ancestry-based assortative mating. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci show population-specific patterns of both assortative and disassortative mating in Latin America. Ancestry-based assortative mating in the populations analyzed here appears to be driven primarily by African ancestry.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study serves as an example of how population genomic analyses can yield novel insights into human behavior.",

We developed thiol(SH)-linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM-seq), an orthogonal chemistry-based epitranscriptomics-sequencing technology that uncovers 4-thiouridine (s4U)-incorporation in RNA species at single-nucleotide resolution. In combination with well-established metabolic RNA labeling protocols and coupled to standard, low-input, high-throughput RNA sequencing methods, SLAM-seq enables rapid access to RNA polymerase II-dependent gene expression dynamics in the context of total RNA. When applied to mouse embryonic stem cells, SLAM-seq provides global and transcript-specific insights into pluripotency-associated gene expression. We validated the method by showing that the RNA-polymerase II-dependent transcriptional output scales with Oct4/Sox2/Nanog-defined enhancer activity; and we provide quantitative and mechanistic evidence for transcript-specific RNA turnover mediated by post-transcriptional gene regulatory pathways initiated by microRNAs and N6-methyladenosine. SLAM-seq facilitates the dissection of fundamental mechanisms that control gene expression in an accessible, cost-effective, and scalable manner.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryChemical nucleotide-analog derivatization provides global insights into transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous recording of optical and electrophysiological signals from multiple cortical areas may provide crucial information to expand our understanding of cortical function. However, the insertion of multiple electrodes into the brain may compromise optical imaging by both restricting the field of view, and interfering with the approaches used to stabilize the specimen. Existing methods that combine electrophysiological recording and optical imaging in vivo implement either multiple surface electrodes or a single electrode for deeper recordings. To address such limitation, we built a microelectrode array (hyperdrive) compatible with wide-field imaging that allows insertion of up to 12 probes into a large brain area (8 mm diameter). The developed hyperdrive is comprised of a circle of individual microdrives where probes are positioned at an angle leaving a large brain area unobstructed for wide-field imaging. Multiple tetrodes and voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) were used for simultaneous registration of spontaneous and evoked cortical activity. The electrophysiological signals were used to extract local field potential (LFP) traces, multiunit and single-unit spiking activity. To demonstrate our approach, we compared LFP and VSD signals over multiple regions of the cortex and analyzed the relationship between single-unit and global cortical population activities. The study of the interactions between cortical activity at local and global scales, such as the one presented in this work, can help to expand our knowledge of brain function.",

    "abstract": "Synapses plasticity depends on the gliotransmitters concentration in the synaptic channel. And, an abnormal concentration of gliotransmitters is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and Epilepsy. In this paper, a theoretical investigation of the cause of the abnormal concentration of gliotransmitters and how to achieve its control are presented through a Ca2+-signalling-based molecular communications framework. A feed-forward and feedback control technique is used to manipulate IP3 values to stabilise the concentration of Ca2+ inside the astrocytes. The theoretical analysis of the given model aims i) to stabilize the Ca2+ concentration around a particular desired level in order to prevent abnormal gliotransmitters concentration (extremely high or low concentration can result in neurodegeneration), ii) to improve the molecular communication performance that utilises Ca2+ signalling, and maintain gliotransmitters regulation remotely. It shows that the refractory periods from Ca2+ can be maintained to lower the noise propagation resulting in smaller time-slots for bit transmission, which can also improve the delay and gain performances. The proposed approach can potentially lead to novel nanomedicine solutions for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, where a combination of nanotechnology and gene therapy approaches can be used to elicit the regulated Ca2+ signalling in astrocytes, ultimately improving neuronal activity.",

Compartments are formed by nucleosomal interactions, but how TADs and loops are generated is unknown. It has been proposed that cohesin forms these structures by extruding loops until it encounters CTCF, but direct evidence for this hypothesis is missing. Here we show that cohesin suppresses compartments but is essential for TADs and loops, that CTCF defines their boundaries, and that WAPL and its PDS5 binding partners control the length of chromatin loops. In the absence of WAPL and PDS5 proteins, cohesin passes CTCF sites with increased frequency, forms extended chromatin loops, accumulates in axial chromosomal positions (vermicelli) and condenses chromosomes to an extent normally only seen in mitosis. These results show that cohesin has an essential genome-wide function in mediating long-range chromatin interactions and support the hypothesis that cohesin creates these by loop extrusion, until it is delayed by CTCF in a manner dependent on PDS5 proteins, or until it is released from DNA by WAPL.",

Chromatin loops and domains are detected in mouse zygotes by single-nucleus Hi-C (snHi-C) but not bulk Hi-C. We resolve this discrepancy by investigating whether a mechanism of cohesin-dependent loop extrusion generates zygotic chromatin conformations. Using snHi-C of mouse knockout embryos, we demonstrate that the zygotic genome folds into loops and domains that depend on Scc1-cohesin and are regulated in size by Wapl. Remarkably, we discovered distinct effects on maternal and paternal chromatin loop sizes, likely reflecting loop extrusion dynamics and epigenetic reprogramming. Polymer simulations based on snHi-C are consistent with a model where cohesin locally compacts chromatin and thus restricts inter-chromosomal interactions by active loop extrusion, whose processivity is controlled by Wapl. Our simulations and experimental data provide evidence that cohesin-dependent loop extrusion organizes mammalian genomes over multiple scales from the one-cell embryo onwards.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIZygotic genomes are organized into cohesin-dependent chromatin loops and TADs\\nC_LIO_LILoop extrusion leads to different loop strengths in maternal and paternal genomes\\nC_LIO_LICohesin restricts inter-chromosomal interactions by altering chromosome surface area\\nC_LIO_LILoop extrusion organizes chromatin at multiple genomic scales\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Structures built by animals, such as nests, often can be considered extended phenotypes that facilitate the study of animal behaviour. For rodents, nest building is both an important form of behavioural thermoregulation and a critical component of parental care. Changes in nest structure or the prioritization of nesting behaviour are therefore likely to have consequences for survival and reproduction, and both biotic and abiotic environmental factors are likely to influence the adaptive value of such differences. Here we first develop a novel assay to investigate interspecific variation in the nesting behaviour of deer mice (genus Peromyscus). Using this assay, we find that, while there is some variation in the complexity of the nests built by Peromyscus mice, differences in the latency to begin nest construction are more striking. Four of the seven taxa examined here build nests within an hour of being given nesting material, but this latency to nest is not related to ultimate differences in nest structure, suggesting that the ability to nest is relatively conserved within the genus, but species differ in their prioritization of nesting behaviour. We also find that latency to nest is not correlated with body size, climate, or the construction of burrows that create microclimates. However, the four taxa with short nesting latencies all have monogamous mating systems, suggesting that differences in nesting latency may be related to social environment. This detailed characterization of nesting behaviour within the genus provides an important foundation for future studies of the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to the evolution of behaviour.",

Here, we show that Tet3 expression promotes transdifferentiation of embryonic stem cells to trophoblast-like stem cells. By genome-wide analyses we demonstrate that TET3 associates with and co-occupies chromatin with RNA Polymerase II. Tet3 expression induces a global increase of transcription and total RNA levels, and its presence further enhances chromatin accessibility in regions open for transcription. This novel function of TET3 is not specific to the oocyte isoform, independent of its catalytic activity, the CXXC domain, or its interaction with OGT, and is localised in its highly conserved exon 4. We propose a more general role for TET3 promoting open chromatin and enhancing global transcription during changes of cellular identity, separate from its catalytic function.",

    "abstract": "Wnt signaling provides a paradigm for cell-cell signals that regulate embryonic development and stem cell homeostasis and are inappropriately activated in cancers. Our current outline of Wnt signaling focuses around several key players. The tumor suppressors APC and Axin form the core of the multiprotein destruction complex, which targets the Wnt-effector beta-catenin for phosphorylation, ubiquitination and destruction. However, mechanisms underlying destruction complex function and those by which Wnt signaling inactivates it remain much less clear. Based on work in cultured cells, we hypothesize the destruction complex is a supermolecular entity that self-assembles by Axin and APC polymerization, and that regulating complex assembly and dynamics underlie function. We took these insights into the Drosophila embryonic epidermis, a premier model of Wnt signaling. Combining biochemistry, genetic tools to manipulate Axin and APC2 levels, advanced imaging and molecule counting, we defined destruction complex assembly, stoichiometry, and localization in vivo, and its downregulation in response to Wnt signaling. Our findings challenge and revise current models of destruction complex function. Endogenous Axin and APC2 proteins accumulate at roughly similar levels, countering the accepted dogma that Axin accumulates at much lower levels. By expressing Axin:GFP at near endogenous levels we found Axin assembles into large cytoplasmic complexes containing tens to hundreds of Axin proteins. Wnt signals trigger complex recruitment to the membrane, while diffuse cytoplasmic Axin levels increase, suggesting slowed assembly. Manipulating Axin or APC2 levels had no effect on destruction complex activity when Wnt signals were absent, but, surprisingly, had opposite effects on the destruction complex when Wnt signals were present. Elevating Axin made the complex resistant to inactivation, while elevating APC2 levels enhanced inactivation. Our data suggest both absolute levels and the ratio of these two core components affect destruction complex function, supporting models in which competition among Axin partners determines destruction complex activity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCell-cell communication is critical for cells to choose fates during embryonic development and often goes wrong in diseases like cancer. The Wnt cell signaling pathway provides a superb example. Mutations in negative regulators like the proteins APC and Axin take the brakes off cell proliferation and thus contribute to colon cancer. We study how APC, Axin and their protein partners keep cell signaling off, and how cell-to-cell Wnt signals reverse this. We use the fruit fly embryo, combining biochemical, and genetic tools with advanced microscopy. We found that APC2 and Axin proteins are present in cells in similar numbers, challenging the previous dogma. We further find that the ability of Wnt signaling to turn off this negative regulatory machine is influenced both by the levels of Axin and APC2 and by the ratio of their protein levels. We also visualize the active destruction complex in the animal, and count the number of Axin proteins in this complex. Finally, we find that Wnt signals have two effects on the destruction complex--recruiting it to the cells plasma membrane and reducing its ability to assemble. Based on this, we propose a new model for how this important signaling pathway is regulated.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

After entry, a retrovirus must reverse transcribe its genome and access the nucleus. Blocks to infection can arise at many different stages of the cycle; if they occur only in some cell types it can reveal hitherto unknown aspects of viral or cellular biology. A block to infection of a primary isolate of HIV-2 was previously identified in specific cell types. In this study, parameters of route of entry of the envelope protein from this primary isolate, MCR, were investigated. A critical component of the block acts at a pre-reverse transcription stage, as virions pseudotyped with MCR envelope did not undergo fusion and entry rates commensurate with productive infection. Furthermore, expression of p56lck, which regulates CD4 surface expression, partially rescued infection of MCR envelope-pseudotyped virus in restrictive cell types. Based on these findings, we propose that a part of this block results from poor cell-surface expression of CD4.",

Our results reveal considerable variability of dCVR across different brain regions, as well as during different experimental conditions (normal breathing and hypercapnia), suggesting a differential response of cerebral vasculature to spontaneous CO2 fluctuations and larger, externally induced CO2 changes. The clustering results suggest that anatomically distinct brain regions exhibit different dCVR curves that do not exhibit the standard, positive valued curves that have been previously reported using measurements of global cerebral blood flow or using larger ROIs.

Serum alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (nagalase), a marker of inflammation and cancer cell proliferation, was significantly decreased at the end of a three-month observation. These results are consistent with immune modulating properties of certain probiotics based on the fermentation of milk and colostrum. Urinary excretion of non-metal toxicants that accumulate in adipose tissue such as Perchlorate, N-acetyl(2-hydroxypropyl)cysteine (NAHP), 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 3-Phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA), N-acetyl phenyl cysteine (NAP), Phenylglycoxylic acid (PGO), Monoethylphthalate (MEP) and 2-Hydroxyisobutyric Acid (2HIB) was significantly increased. These results are consistent with the weight loss (5 Kg) associated with intermittent fasting and with the known features of probiotics as detoxification tools. Consistent with certain toxicants acting as endocrine disruptors, we observed an increased elimination of toxicants and a 33% decrease of serum Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), suggesting a trend toward normalization of thyroid function.

The infected radial units are surrounded by uninfected cells undergoing apoptosis, suggesting that programmed cell death may limit viral dissemination in the brain and may constrain virus associated injury. Therefore, a critical aspect of ZIKV induced neuropathology may be defined by death of uninfected cells. All ZIKV isolates assayed replicated efficiently in early and mid-gestation cultures, and two isolates examined replicated in late-gestation tissue. Alteration of neocortical cytoarchitecture, such as disruption of the highly-elongated basal processes of the radial glial progenitor cells, and impairment of postmitotic neuronal migration were also observed. These data suggest that all lineages of ZIKV tested are neurotropic, and that ZIKV infection interferes with multiple aspects of neurodevelopment that contribute to the complexity of cZVS.\\n\\nSignificanceZika virus infection has been associated with multiple pathologies of the central nervous system (CNS) including microcephaly, Guillain-Barre syndrome, lissencephaly, the loss of white and grey matter volume and acute myelitis. Using organotypic brain slice cultures, we determined that ZIKV replicates across different embryonic developmental stages, and viral infection can disrupt proper brain development leading to congenital CNS complications. These data illustrate that all lineages of ZIKV tested are neurotropic, and that infection may disrupt neuronal migration during brain development. The results expand our understanding of neuropathologies associated with congenital Zika virus syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus is an economically and clinically important pathogen of small ruminants, and a model system for understanding the mechanisms and evolution of traits such as anthelmintic resistance. Anthelmintic resistance is widespread and is a major threat to the sustainability of livestock agriculture globally; however, little is known about the genome architecture and parameters such as recombination that will ultimately influence the rate at which resistance may evolve and spread. Here we performed a genetic cross between two divergent strains of H. contortus, and subsequently used whole-genome re-sequencing of a female worm and her brood to identify the distribution of genome-wide variation that characterises these strains. Using a novel bioinformatic approach to identify variants that segregate as expected in a pseudo-testcross, we characterised linkage groups and estimated genetic distances between markers to generate a chromosome-scale F1 genetic map composed of 1,618 SNPs. We exploited this map to reveal the recombination landscape, the first for any parasitic helminth species, demonstrating extensive variation in recombination rate within and between chromosomes. Analyses of these data also revealed the extent of polyandry, whereby at least eight males were found to have contributed to the genetic variation of the progeny analysed. Triploid offspring were also identified, which we hypothesise are the result of nondisjunction during female meiosis or polyspermy. These results expand our knowledge of the genetics of parasitic helminths and the unusual life-history of H. contortus, and will enable more precise characterisation of the evolution and inheritance of genetic traits such as anthelmintic resistance. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of whole-genome resequencing data to directly construct a genetic map in a single generation cross from a non-inbred non-model organism with a complex lifecycle.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRecombination is a key genetic process, responsible for the generation of novel genotypes and subsequent phenotypic variation as a result of crossing over between homologous chromosomes. Populations of strongylid nematodes, such as the gastrointestinal parasites that infect livestock and humans, are genetically very diverse, but little is known about patterns of recombination across the genome and how this may contribute to the genetics and evolution of these pathogens. In this study, we performed a genetic cross to quantify recombination in the barbers pole worm, Haemonchus contortus, an important parasite of sheep and goats. The reproductive traits of this worm make standard genetic crosses challenging, but by generating whole-genome sequence data from a female worm and her offspring, we identified genetic variants that act as though they come from a single mating cross, allowing the use of standard statistical approaches to build a genetic map and explore the distribution and rates of recombination throughout the genome. A number of genetic signatures associated with H. contortus life history traits were revealed in this analysis: we extend our understanding of multiple paternity (polyandry) in this species, and provide evidence and explanation for sporadic increases in chromosome complements (polyploidy) among the progeny. The resulting genetic map will aid in population genomic studies in general and enhance ongoing efforts to understand the genetic basis of resistance to the drugs used to control these worms, as well as for related species that infect humans throughout the world.",
