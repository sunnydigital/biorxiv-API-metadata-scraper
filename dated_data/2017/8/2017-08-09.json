    "abstract": "Humans and animals are capable of evaluating actions by considering their long-run future rewards through a process described using model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The mechanisms by which neural circuits perform the computations prescribed by model-based RL remain largely unknown; however, multiple lines of evidence suggest that neural circuits supporting model-based behavior are structurally homologous to and overlapping with those thought to carry out model-free temporal difference (TD) learning. Here, we lay out a family of approaches by which model-based computation may be built upon a core of TD learning. The foundation of this framework is the successor representation, a predictive state representation that, when combined with TD learning of value predictions, can produce a subset of the behaviors associated with model-based learning, while requiring less decision-time computation than dynamic programming. Using simulations, we delineate the precise behavioral capabilities enabled by evaluating actions using this approach, and compare them to those demonstrated by biological organisms. We then introduce two new algorithms that build upon the successor representation while progressively mitigating its limitations. Because this framework can account for the full range of observed putatively model-based behaviors while still utilizing a core TD framework, we suggest that it represents a neurally plausible family of mechanisms for model-based evaluation.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAccording to standard models, when confronted with a choice, animals and humans rely on two separate, distinct processes to come to a decision. One process deliberatively evaluates the consequences of each candidate action and is thought to underlie the ability to flexibly come up with novel plans. The other process gradually increases the propensity to perform behaviors that were previously successful and is thought to underlie automatically executed, habitual reflexes. Although computational principles and animal behavior support this dichotomy, at the neural level, there is little evidence supporting a clean segregation. For instance, although dopamine -- famously implicated in drug addiction and Parkinsons disease -- currently only has a well-defined role in the automatic process, evidence suggests that it also plays a role in the deliberative process. In this work, we present a computational framework for resolving this mismatch. We show that the types of behaviors associated with either process could result from a common learning mechanism applied to different strategies for how populations of neurons could represent candidate actions. In addition to demonstrating that this account can produce the full range of flexible behavior observed in the empirical literature, we suggest experiments that could detect the various approaches within this framework.",

    "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization, every year more than a billion people are infected with vector-borne diseases worldwide. There are no vaccines for most vector-borne diseases. Vector control, therefore, is often the only way to prevent outbreaks. Despite the major impact of vectors on human health, knowledge gaps exist regarding their natural population dynamics. Even the most basic information--such as spatiotemporal abundance-- is not available. Mosquitoes transmit malaria and the viruses causing Yellow Fever, West Nile, Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika in the Americas. The Americas have a long history of mosquito control efforts, including the unsustained but successful Aedes aegypti eradication initiative. In the US, municipalities have independently created agencies for mosquito control and monitoring. We propose that the ensemble of US mosquito control agencies can, and should, be used to develop a national--and potentially international--system for Cross-Scale Vector Monitoring and Control (CSVMaC), in which local level monitoring and control efforts are cross-linked by unified real-time data streaming to build the data capital needed to gain a mechanistic understanding of vector population dynamics. Vectors, and the pathogens they transmit, know no jurisdictions. The vision of CSVMaC is, therefore, to provide data for (i) the general study of mosquito ecology and (ii) to inform vector control during epidemics/outbreaks that impact multiple jurisdictions (i.e., counties, states, etc.). We reveal >1000 mosquito control agencies in the US with enormous troves of data that are hidden among many data silos. For CSVMaC, we propose the creation of a nationally-coordinated open-access database to collate mosquito data. The database would provide scientific and public health communities with highly resolved spatiotemporal data on arboviral disease vectors, empowering new interventions and insights while leveraging pre-existing human efforts, operational infrastructure, and investments already funded by taxpayers.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is one of the main epigenetic modifications in the eukaryotic genome; it has been shown to play a role in cell-type specific regulation of gene expression, and therefore cell-type identity. Bisulfite sequencing is the gold-standard for measuring methylation over the genomes of interest. Here, we review several techniques used for the analysis of high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. We introduce specialized short-read alignment techniques as well as pre/post-alignment quality check methods to ensure data quality. Furthermore, we discuss subsequent analysis steps after alignment. We introduce various differential methylation methods and compare their performance using simulated and real bisulfite sequencing datasets. We also discuss the methods used to segment methylomes in order to pinpoint regulatory regions. We introduce annotation methods that can be used for further classification of regions returned by segmentation and differential methylation methods. Finally, we review software packages that implement strategies to efficiently deal with large bisulfite sequencing datasets locally and we discuss online analysis workflows that do not require any prior programming skills. The analysis strategies described in this review will guide researchers at any level to the best practices of bisulfite sequencing analysis.",

    "abstract": "Divergence time estimation -- the calibration of a phylogeny to geological time -- is a integral first step in modelling the tempo of biological evolution (traits and lineages). However, despite increasingly sophisticated methods to infer divergence times from molecular genetic sequences, the estimated age of many nodes across the tree of life contrast significantly and consistently with timeframes conveyed by the fossil record. This is perhaps best exemplified by crown angiosperms, where molecular clock (Triassic) estimates predate the oldest (Early Cretaceous) undisputed angiosperm fossils by tens of millions of years or more. While the incompleteness of the fossil record is a common concern, issues of data limitation and model inadequacy are viable (if underexplored) alternative explanations. In this vein, Beaulieu et al. (2015) convincingly demonstrated how methods of divergence time inference can be misled by both (i) extreme state-dependent molecular substitution rate heterogeneity and (ii) biased sampling of representative major lineages. While these (essentially model-violation) results are robust (and probably common in empirical data sets), we note a further alternative: that the configuration of the statistical inference problem alone (i.e., the parameters, their relationships, and associated priors) precluded the reconstruction of the paleontological timeframe for the crown age of angiosperms. We demonstrate, through sampling from the joint prior (formed by combining the tree (diversification) prior with the various calibration densities specified for fossil-calibrated nodes), that with no data present at all, an Early Cretaceous crown angiosperms is rejected (i.e., has essentially zero probability). More worrisome, however, is that for the 24 nodes calibrated by fossils, almost all have indistinguishable marginal prior and posterior age distributions, indicating an absence of relevant information in the data. Given that these calibrated nodes are strategically placed in disparate regions of the tree, they essentially anchor the tree scaffold, and so the posterior inference for the tree as a whole is largely determined by the pseudo-data present in the (often arbitrary) calibration densities. We recommend, as for any Bayesian analysis, that marginal prior and posterior distributions be carefully compared, especially for parameters of direct interest. Finally, we note that the results presented here do not refute the biological modelling concerns identified by Beaulieu et al. (2015). Both sets of issues remain apposite to the goals of accurate divergence time estimation, and only by considering them in tandem can we move forward more confidently.

    "abstract": "Translation rate per mRNA molecule correlates positively with mRNA abundance. As a result, protein levels do not scale linearly with mRNA levels, but instead scale with the abundance of mRNA raised to the power of an \\\"amplification exponent\\\". Here we show that to quantitate translational control, the translation rate must be decomposed into two components. One, TRmD, depends on the mRNA level and defines the amplification exponent. The other, TRmIND, is independent of mRNA amount and impacts the correlation coefficient between protein and mRNA levels. We show that in S. cerevisiae TRmD represents [~]20% of the variance in translation and directs an amplification exponent of 1.20 with a 95% confidence interval [1.14, 1.26]. TRmIND constitutes the remaining [~]80% of the variance in translation and explains [~]5% of the variance in protein expression. We also find that TRmD and TRmIND are preferentially determined by different mRNA sequence features: TRmIND by the length of the open reading frame and TRmD both by a [~]60 nucleotide element that spans the initiating AUG and by codon and amino acid frequency. Our work provides more appropriate estimates of translational control and implies that TRmIND is under different evolutionary selective pressures than TRmD.",

    "abstract": "Membrane tethering is a fundamental process essential for compartmental specificity of intracellular membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells. Rab-family small GTPases and specific sets of Rab-interacting effector proteins, including coiled-coil tethering proteins and multisubunit tethering complexes, have been reported to be responsible for membrane tethering. However, whether and how these key components directly and specifically tether subcellular membranes still remains enigmatic. Using chemically defined proteoliposomal systems reconstituted with purified human Rab proteins and synthetic liposomal membranes to study the molecular basis of membrane tethering, we established here that Rab-family GTPases have a highly conserved function to directly mediate membrane tethering, even in the absence of any types of Rab effectors such as the so-called tethering proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that membrane tethering mediated by endosomal Rab11a is drastically and selectively stimulated by its cognate Rab effectors, class V myosins (Myo5A and Myo5B), in a GTP-dependent manner. Of note, Myo5A and Myo5B exclusively recognized and cooperated with the membrane-anchored form of their cognate Rab11a to support membrane tethering mediated by trans-Rab assemblies on apposing membranes. Our findings support the novel concept that Rab-family proteins provide a bona fide membrane tether to physically and specifically link two distinct lipid bilayers of subcellular membranes. They further indicate that Rab-interacting effector proteins, including class V myosins, can regulate these Rab-mediated membrane tethering reactions.",

    "abstract": "From 1980 to 1992, a series of influential papers reported on the discovery, genetics, and evolution of a periodic cycling of the interval between Drosophila male courtship song pulses. The molecular mechanisms underlying this periodicity were never described. To reinitiate investigation of this phenomenon, we performed automated segmentation of songs, but failed to detect the proposed periodicity [Arthur BJ et al. (2013) BMC Biol 11:11; Stern DL (2014) BMC Biol 12:38]. Kyriacou CP et al. [(2017) PNAS 114:1970-1975] report that we failed to detect song rhythms because i) our flies did not sing enough and ii) our segmenter did not identify many of the song pulses. Kyriacou et al. manually annotated a subset of our recordings and reported that two strains displayed rhythms with genotype-specific periodicity, in agreement with their original reports. We cannot replicate this finding and show that the manually-annotated data, the original automatically segmented data, and a new data set provide no evidence for either the existence of song rhythms or song periodicity differences between genotypes. Furthermore, we have re-examined our methods and analysis and find that our automated segmentation method was not biased to prevent detection of putative song periodicity. We conclude that there is currently no evidence for the existence of Drosophila courtship song rhythms.\\n\\nSignificance statementPrevious studies have reported that male vinegar flies sing courtship songs with a periodic rhythm of approximately 55 seconds. Several years ago, we showed that we could not replicate this observation. Recently, the original authors have claimed that we failed to find rhythms because 1) our flies did not sing enough and 2) our software for detecting song did not detect all song events. They claimed that they could detect rhythms in song annotated by hand. We report here that we cannot replicate their observation of rhythms in the hand-annotated data or in any dataset and that our original methods were not biased against detecting rhythms. We conclude that song rhythms cannot be detected.",

We construct a model from this theory and find that it predicts set size effects. Notably, these effects are mediated by probing probability, which aligns with previous empirical findings. The model accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability on encoding precision in nine delayed-estimation experiments. Moreover, we find support for the prediction that the total amount of invested resource can vary non-monotonically with set size. Finally, we show that it is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset or even none of the relevant items in a task.

    "abstract": "Working memory is the function by which we temporarily maintain information to achieve current task goals. Models of working memory typically debate where this information is stored, rather than how it is stored. Here we ask instead what neural mechanisms are involved in storage, and how these mechanisms change as a function of task goals. Participants either had to reproduce the orientation of a memorized bar (continuous recall task), or identify the memorized bar in a search array (visual search task). The sensory input and retention interval were identical in both tasks. Next, we used decoding and forward modeling on multivariate electroencephalogram (EEG) and time-frequency decomposed EEG to investigate which neural signals carry more informational content during the retention interval. In the continuous recall task, working memory content was preferentially carried by induced oscillatory alpha-band power, while in the visual search task it was more strongly carried by the distribution of evoked (consistently elevated and non-oscillatory) EEG activity. To show the independence of these two signals, we were able to remove informational content from one signal without affecting informational content in the other. Finally, we show that the tuning characteristics of both signals change in opposite directions depending on the current task goal. We propose that these signals reflect oscillatory and elevated firing-rate mechanisms that respectively support location-based and object-based maintenance. Together, these data challenge current models of working memory that place storage in particular regions, but rather emphasize the importance of different distributed maintenance signals depending on task goals.\\n\\nSignificance statement (120 words)Without realizing, we are constantly moving things in and out of our minds eye, an ability also referred to as  working memory. Where did I put my screwdriver? Do we still have milk in the fridge? A central question in working memory research is how the brain maintains this information temporarily. Here we show that different neural mechanisms are involved in working memory depending on what the memory is used for. For example, remembering what a bottle of milk looks like invokes a different neural mechanism from remembering how much milk it contains: the first one primarily involved in being able to find the object, and the other one involving spatial position, such as the milk level in the bottle.",

We compared mortality hazards for the hotspot regions to the rest of the country by sex and residence at age 71.\\n\\nResultsWe found a birth hotspot of 222 centenarians, 1.37 times more than the expected number, centered on a group of fairly remote rural islands.

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing requires sufficient DNA to be available. If limited, whole-genome amplification is applied to generate additional amounts of DNA. Such amplification often results in many chimeric DNA fragments, in particular artificial palindromic sequences, which limit the usefulness of long reads from technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore. Here, we present Pacasus, a tool for correcting such errors in long reads. We demonstrate on two real-world datasets that it markedly improves subsequent read mapping and de novo assembly, yielding results similar to these that would be obtained with non-amplified DNA. With Pacasus long-read technologies become readily available for sequencing targets with very small amounts of DNA, such as single cells or even single chromosomes.",

Here we demonstrate that by focusing on simplified feature-based nuclear segmentation and probabilistic cytoplasmic detection we can create a tool that is able to extract geometry based information from diverse mammalian tissue images. Our open-source image analysis platform, called  SilentMark can cope with noisy images and with crowded fields of cells to quantify signal intensity in different cellular compartments. Additionally, it provides tissue geometry related information, which allows one to quantify protein distribution with respect to marked regions of interest. The lightweight SilentMark algorithms have the advantage of not requiring multiple processors and graphics cards and can be run even with just several hundred MB of memory. This makes it possible to use the method as a web application, effectively eliminating setup hurdles and compatibility issues with operating systems. We test this platform on mouse pre-implantation embryos, embryonic stem cell derived embryoid bodies and mouse embryonic heart and relate protein localisation to tissue geometry.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal synaptic connections are electrical or chemical and together are essential to dynamically defining neural circuit function. While chemical synapses are well known for their biochemical complexity, electrical synapses are often viewed as comprised solely of neuronal gap junction channels that allow direct ionic and metabolic communication. However, associated with the gap junction channels are structures observed by electron microscopy called the Electrical Synapse Density (ESD). The ESD has been suggested to be critical for the formation and function of the electrical synapse, yet the biochemical makeup of these structures is poorly understood. Here we find that electrical synapse formation in vivo requires an intracellular scaffold called Tight Junction Protein 1b (Tjp1b). Tjp1b is localized to electrical synapses where it is required for the stabilization of the gap junction channels and for electrical synapse function. Strikingly, we find that Tjp1b protein localizes and functions asymmetrically, exclusively on the postsynaptic side of the synapse. Our findings support a novel model in which there is molecular asymmetry at the level of the intracellular scaffold that is required for building the electrical synapse. ESD molecular asymmetries may be a fundamental motif of all nervous systems and could support functional asymmetry at the electrical synapse.",

Samples were collected at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 24 and 48h after IP and OR, respectively. Results showed that the hyperglycemia lasted 5 hours and 21 hours in OR and IP group, respectively. The serum insulin concentration significantly decreased (1.58{+/-}0.21mIU/L) at 3h after IP glucose. However, it significantly increased at 3h (3.37{+/-}0.34mIU/L) after OR glucose. The gene expressions of prosomatostatin, neuropeptide Y, cholecystokinin precursor and orexin precursor in the brain showed different profiles between the OR and IP group. The OR not IP administration of glucose had significant effects on the gene expressions of preprovasoactive intestinal peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide and gastrin in the intestine. When the blood glucose concentration peaked in both IP and OR group, the glucokinase expression in liver was stimulated, but the expression of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was depressed. In conclusion, brain-gut peptides were confirmed in the present study. And the serum insulin and the brain-gut peptides have different responses between the IP and OR administration of glucose. A negative feedback mechanism in the insulin-regulated glucose homeostasis was suggested in Japanese flounder. Furthermore, this regulation could be conducted by activating PI3k-Akt, and then lead to the pathway downstream changes in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHigh-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies are increasingly applied to analyse complex microbial ecosystems by mRNA sequencing of whole communities, also known as metatranscriptome sequencing. This approach is at the moment largely limited to prokaryotic communities and communities of few eukaryotic species with sequenced genomes. For eukaryotes the analysis is hindered mainly by a low and fragmented coverage of the reference databases to infer the community composition, but also by lack of automated workflows for the task.\\n\\nResultsFrom the databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information and Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project, 142 references were selected in such a way that the taxa represent the main lineages within each of the seven supergroups of eukaryotes and possess predominantly complete transcriptomes or genomes. From these references, we created an annotated microeukaryotic reference database. We developed a tool called TaxMapper for a reliably mapping of sequencing reads against this database and filtering of unreliable assignments. For filtering, a classifier was trained and tested on sequences in the database, sequences of related taxa to those in the database and randomly generated sequences. Additionally, TaxMapper is part of a metatranscriptomic Snakemake workflow developed to perform quality assessment, functional and taxonomic annotation and (multivariate) statistical analysis including environmental data. The workflow is provided and described in detail to empower researchers to easily apply it for metatranscriptome analysis of any environmental sample.\\n\\nConclusionsTaxMapper shows superior performance compared to standard approaches, resulting in a higher number of true positive taxonomic assignments.

    "abstract": "A gene regulatory network (GRN) is a collection of regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes. GRNs control different biological processes and have been instrumental to understand the organization and complexity of gene regulation. Although various experimental methods have been used to map GRNs in Arabidopsis thaliana, their limited throughput combined with the large number of TFs makes that for many genes our knowledge about regulating TFs is incomplete. We introduce TF2Network, a tool that exploits the vast amount of TF binding site information and enables the delineation of GRNs by detecting potential regulators for a set of co-expressed or functionally related genes. Validation using two experimental benchmarks reveals that TF2Network predicts the correct regulator in 75-92% of the test sets. Furthermore, our tool is robust to noise in the input gene sets, has a low false discovery rate, and shows a better performance to recover correct regulators compared to other plant tools. TF2Network is accessible through a web interface where GRNs are interactively visualized and annotated with various types of experimental functional information. TF2Network was used to perform systematic functional and regulatory gene annotations, identifying new TFs involved in circadian rhythm and stress response.",

    "abstract": "Perturbations of the coding genome and their role in cancer development have been studied extensively. However, the non-coding genomes contribution in cancer is poorly understood (1), not only because it is difficult to define the non-coding regulatory regions and the genes they regulate, but also because there is limited power owing to the regulatory regions small size. In this study, we try to resolve this issue by defining modules of coordinated non-coding regulatory regions of genes (Cis Regulatory Domains or CRDs). To do so, we use the correlation between histone modifications, assayed by ChIP-seq, in population samples of immortalized B-cells and skin fibroblasts. We screen for CRDs that accumulate an excess of somatic mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and skin cancer, which affect these cell types, after accounting for somatic mutational patterns and biases. At 5% FDR, we find 90 CRDs with significant excess somatic of mutations in CLL, 60 of which regulate 126 genes, and in skin cancer 59 significant CRDs, 25 of which regulate 37 genes. The genes these CRDs regulate include ones already implicated in tumorigenesis, and are enriched in pathways already implicated in the respective cancers, like the B-cell receptor signalling pathway in CLL and the TGF{beta} signalling pathway in skin cancer. We discover that the somatic mutations in the significant CRDs of CLL are hitting bases more likely to be functional than the mutations in non-significant CRDs. Moreover, in both cancers, mutational signatures observed in the regulatory regions of significant CRDs deviate significantly from their null sequences. Both results indicate selection acting on CRDs during tumorigenesis. Finally, we find that the transcription factor biding sites that are disturbed by the somatic mutations in significant CRDs are enriched for factors known to be involved in cancer development. We are describing a new powerful approach to discover non-coding regions involved in tumorigenesis in CLL and skin cancer and this approach could be generalized to other cancers.",

We analysed the outcomes by live and fixed-cell microscopy methods, including 3D correlative light and serial block face scanning electron microscopy. Following rapid depletion of condensin, chromosomal defects were obvious. The chromatin was compacted normally, but formed a single mass of mitotic chromosomes clustered at one side of a bent mitotic spindle. Cultures arrest at prometaphase, eventually exiting mitosis without segregating chromosomes. Experiments titrating the auxin concentration suggest a previously unsuspected dual role of condensin, as different condensin levels are required for anaphase chromosome segregation and formation of a normal chromosome architecture.",

Investigating the maintenance of Drosophila muscle progenitors (MPs) we demonstrate that it involves a switch in zfh1/ZEB1 RNA-isoforms. Differentiation into functional muscles is accompanied by expression of miR-8/miR-200, which targets the major zfh1-long RNA isoform and decreases Zfh1 protein. Through activity of the Notch pathway, a subset of MPs produce an alternate zfh1-short isoform, which lacks the miR-8 seed site. Zfh1 protein is thus maintained in these cells, enabling them to escape differentiation and persist as MPs in the adult. There, like mammalian satellite cells, they contribute to muscle homeostasis. Such preferential regulation of a specific RNA isoform, with differential sensitivity to miRs, is a powerful mechanism for maintaining a population of poised progenitors and may be of widespread significance.",

Demogenetic simulations can couple population demography and niche modeling to produce spatially-explicit genetic and demographic information for all simulated individuals and provide insight into the effects of climate change at demographic and population genetic levels. We used CDMETAPOP to simulate a population of island night lizards (Xantusia riversiana) on Santa Barbara Island to evaluate its sensitivity to climate change to the year 2100 across 8 scenarios based on 2 climate models, 2 emissions pathways, and 2 connectivity models. We found that 1) X. riversiana is sensitive to climate change with SDMs predicting a loss of suitable habitat of 93%-98% by 2038, 2) population genetic structure is expected to increase drastically to 0.209-0.673 from approximately 0.0346, and 3) estimated minimum abundance is expected to declined sharply over the 2007 to 2038 period and reached values of 0-1% of the 2007 population size in all scenarios by 2100. Climate change is expected to decrease census population size and result in extant habitat patches that are isolated from one another with very high levels of genetic divergence over short periods of time. These patterns may drive the Santa Barbara Island population to extinction under certain scenarios. Management plans should address methods to improve connectivity on the island and attempt to create refugial patches. Contingency plans, such as translocation, may be required to prevent population extirpation. This study highlights the utility of demogenetic simulations in evaluating population demographic and genetic patterns under climate change with suggestions on workflows for running simulations in a high-throughput manner.",

    "abstract": "Aedes albopictus is a highly invasive disease vector with an expanding worldwide distribution. Genetic assays using low to medium resolution markers have found little evidence of spatial genetic structure even at broad geographic scales, suggesting frequent passive movement along human transportation networks. Here we analysed genetic structure of Ae. albopictus collected from 12 sample sites in Guangzhou, China, using thousands of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We found evidence for passive gene flow, with distance from shipping terminals being the strongest predictor of genetic distance among mosquitoes. As further evidence of passive dispersal, we found multiple pairs of full-siblings distributed between two sample sites 3.7 km apart. After accounting for geographical variability, we also found evidence for isolation by distance, previously undetectable in Ae. albopictus. These findings demonstrate how large SNP datasets and spatially-explicit hypothesis testing can be used to decipher processes at finer geographic scales than formerly possible. Our approach can be used to help predict new invasion pathways of Ae. albopictus and to refine strategies for vector control that involve the transformation or suppression of mosquito populations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAedes albopictus, the Asian Tiger Mosquito, is a highly invasive disease vector with a growing global distribution. Designing strategies to prevent invasion and to control Ae. albopictus populations in invaded regions requires knowledge of how Ae. albopictus disperses. Studies comparing Ae. albopictus populations have found little evidence of genetic structure even between distant populations, suggesting that dispersal along human transportation networks is common. However, a more specific understanding of dispersal processes has been unavailable due to an absence of studies using high-resolution genetic markers. Here we present a study using high-resolution markers, which investigates genetic structure among 152 Ae. albopictus from Guangzhou, China. We found that human transportation networks, particularly shipping terminals, had an influence on genetic structure. We also found genetic distance was correlated with geographical distance, the first such observation in this species. This study demonstrates how high-resolution markers can be used to investigate ecological processes that may otherwise escape detection. We conclude that strategies for controlling Ae. albopictus will have to consider both passive reinvasion along human transportation networks and active reinvasion from neighbouring regions.",

    "abstract": "Non-model rodents are widely used as subjects for both basic and applied biological research, but the genetic diversity of the study individuals is rarely quantified. University-housed colonies tend to be small and subject to founder effects and genetic drift and so may be highly inbred or show substantial genetic divergence from other colonies, even those derived from the same source. Disregard for the levels of genetic diversity in an animal colony may result in a failure to replicate results if a different colony is used to repeat an experiment, as different colonies may have fixed alternative variants. Here we use high throughput sequencing to demonstrate genetic divergence in three isolated colonies of Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) even though they were all established recently from the same source. We also show that genetic diversity in allegedly  outbred colonies of non-model rodents (gerbils, hamsters, house mice, and deer mice) varies considerably from nearly no segregating diversity, to very high levels of polymorphism. We conclude that genetic divergence in isolated colonies may play an important role in the  replication crisis. In a more positive light, divergent rodent colonies represent an opportunity to leverage genetically distinct individuals in genetic crossing experiments. In sum, awareness of the genetic diversity of an animal colony is paramount as it allows researchers to properly replicate experiments and also to capitalize on other, genetically distinct individuals to explore the genetic basis of a trait.",

    "abstract": "Although the Factor V Leiden (FVL) gene variant is the most prevalent genetic risk factor for venous thrombosis, only 10% of FVL carriers will experience such an event in their lifetime. To identify potential FVL modifier genes contributing to this incomplete penetrance, we took advantage of a perinatal synthetic lethal thrombosis phenotype in mice homozygous for FVL (F5L/L) and haploinsufficient for tissue factor pathway inhibitor (Tfpi+/-) to perform a sensitized dominant ENU mutagenesis screen. Linkage analysis conducted in the 3 largest pedigrees generated from the surviving F5L/L Tfpi+/- mice ( rescues) using ENU-induced coding variants as genetic markers was unsuccessful in identifying major suppressor loci. Whole exome sequencing was applied to DNA from 107 rescue mice to identify candidate genes enriched for ENU mutations. A total of 3,481 potentially deleterious candidate ENU variants were identified in 2,984 genes. After correcting for gene size and multiple testing, Arl6ip5 was identified as the most enriched gene, though not reaching genome-wide significance. Evaluation of CRISPR/Cas9 induced loss of function in the top 6 genes failed to demonstrate a clear rescue phenotype. However, a maternally inherited (not ENU-induced) de novo mutation (Plcb4R335Q) exhibited significant co-segregation with the rescue phenotype (p=0.003) in the corresponding pedigree. Thrombosis suppression by heterozygous Plcb4 loss of function was confirmed through analysis of an independent, CRISPR/Cas9-induced Plcb4 mutation (p=0.01).\\n\\nAuthor summaryAbnormal blood clotting in veins (venous thrombosis) or arteries (arterial thrombosis) are major health problems, with venous thrombosis affecting approximately 1 in every thousand individuals annually in the United States. Susceptibility to venous thrombosis is governed by both genes and environment, with approximately 60% of the risk attributed to genetic influences. Though several genetic risk factors are known, >50% of genetic risk remains unexplained. Approximately 5% of people carry the most common known risk factor, Factor V Leiden. However, only 10% of these individuals will develop a blood clot in their lifetime. Mice carrying two copies of the Factor V Leiden mutation together with a mutation in a second gene called tissue factor pathway inhibitor develop fatal thrombosis shortly after birth. To identify genes that prevent this fatal thrombosis, we studied a large panel of mice carrying inactivating gene changes randomly distributed throughout the genome. We identified several genes as potential candidates to alter blood clotting balance in mice and humans with predisposition to thrombosis, and confirmed this protective function for DNA changes in one of these genes (Plcb4).",

    "abstract": "Microbial biofilms are tightly packed, heterogeneous structures that serve as arenas for social interactions. Studies on Gram negative models reveal that during evolution in structured environments like biofilms, isogenic populations commonly diversify into phenotypically and genetically distinct variants. These variants can settle in alternative biofilm niches and develop new types of interactions that greatly influence population productivity. Here, we explore the evolutionary diversification of pellicle biofilms of the Gram positive, spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We discover that - similarly to other species - B. subtilis diversifies into distinct colony variants. These variants dramatically differ in biofilm formation abilities and expression of biofilm-related genes. In addition, using a quantitative approach, we reveal striking differences in surface complexity and hydrophobicity of the evolved colony types. Interestingly, one of the morphotypes completely lost the ability of independent biofilm formation and evolved to hitchhike with other morphotypes with improved biofilm forming abilities. Genome comparison suggests that major phenotypic transformations between the morphotypes can be triggered by subtle genetic differences. Our work demonstrates how positive complementarity effects and exploitative interactions intertwine during evolutionary diversification in biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV, or GI.1), is a calicivirus in the genus Lagovirus that has been widely utilised in Australia as a biological control agent for the management of overabundant wild European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations since 1996. Recently, two exotic incursions of pathogenic lagoviruses have been reported in Australia; GI.1a-Aus, previously called RHDVa-Aus, is a GI.1a virus detected in January 2014, and the novel lagovirus GI.2 (previously known as RHDV2). Furthermore, an additional GI.1a strain, GI.1a-K5 (also known as 08Q712), was released nationwide in March 2017 as a supplementary tool for wild rabbit management. To discriminate between these lagoviruses, a highly sensitive strain-specific multiplex RT-PCR assay was developed, which allows fast, cost-effective, and sensitive detection of the four pathogenic lagoviruses currently known to be circulating in Australia. In addition, we developed a universal qRT-PCR assay to be used in conjunction with the multiplex assay that broadly detects all four viruses and facilitates quantification of viral RNA load in samples. These assays enable rapid detection, identification, and quantification of pathogenic lagoviruses in the Australian context. Using these assays, a novel recombinant lagovirus was detected in rabbit tissues samples, which contained the non-structural genes of GI.1a-Aus and the structural genes of GI.2. This variant was also recovered from the liver of a European brown hare (Lepus europaeus). The impact of this novel recombinant on Australian wild lagomorph populations and its competitiveness in relation to circulating field strains, particularly GI.2, requires further studies.",

One example of this is the power law of forgetting: The decline in memory performance with time or intervening events is well fit by a power function. This simple functional relationship accounts for a great deal of accumulated data. In this note, we consider a simple yet general memory model in which all items decay monotonically in strength, but at different rates. To translate between continuous changes in strength and actual memory for events we assume a simple strength threshold for remembering. We prove a limit theorem for this model: as time grows large and memories decay, the empirical forgetting function approaches a power function under very general conditions. Power forgetting emerges for almost any monotonically decreasing strength function (including linear and exponential cases). We also illustrate by way of simulations that the power function provides an excellent fit to the entire time-course of the forgetting function, not just its limiting behavior.",

    "abstract": "Athletes regularly endure large increases in ventilation, and accompanying perceptions of breathlessness. While breathing perceptions often correlate poorly with objective measures of lung function in both health and clinical populations, we have previously demonstrated closer matching between subjective breathlessness and changes in ventilation in endurance athletes, suggesting that athletes may be more accurate during respiratory interoception. To better understand the link between exercise and breathlessness, we sought to identify the mechanisms by which the brain processing of respiratory perception might be optimised in athletes. Twenty endurance athletes and 20 sedentary controls underwent 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging. Inspiratory resistive loading induced conscious breathing perceptions (breathlessness), and a delay-conditioning paradigm was employed to evoke preceding periods of anticipation. Athletes demonstrated anticipatory brain activity that positively correlated with resulting breathing perceptions within key interoceptive areas, such as the thalamus, insula and primary sensorimotor cortices, which was negatively correlated in sedentary controls. Athletes also exhibited greater connectivity between interoceptive attention networks and primary sensorimotor cortex. These functional differences in athletic brains suggest that exercise may optimise processing of respiratory sensations. Future work may probe whether these brain mechanisms are harnessed when exercise is employed to treat breathlessness within chronic respiratory disease.",

    "abstract": "The amygdala plays a critical role in detecting potential danger through sensory input [1, 2]. In the primate visual system, a subcortical pathway through the superior colliculus and the pulvinar is thought to provide the amygdala with rapid and coarse visual information about facial emotions [3-6]. A recent electrophysiological study in human patients supported this hypothesis by showing that intracranial event-related potentials discriminated fearful faces from other faces very quickly (within [~]74 ms) [7]. However, several aspects of the hypothesis remain debatable [8]. Critically, evidence for short-latency, emotion-selective responses from individual amygdala neurons is lacking [9-12], and even if this type of response existed, how it might contribute to stimulus detection is unclear. Here, we addressed these issues in the monkey amygdala and found that ensemble responses of single neurons carry robust information about emotional faces-- especially threatening ones--within [~]50 ms after stimulus onset. Similar rapid response was not found in the temporal cortex from which the amygdala receives cortical inputs [13], suggesting a subcortical origin. Additionally, we found that the rapid amygdala response contained excitatory and suppressive components. The early excitatory component might be useful for quickly sending signals to downstream areas. In contrast, the rapid suppressive component sharpened the rising phase of later, sustained excitatory input (presumably from the temporal cortex) and might therefore improve processing of emotional faces over time. We thus propose that these two amygdala responses that originate from the subcortical pathway play dual roles in threat detection.",

    "abstract": "Indole-3-acetic acid is a ubiquitous small molecule found in all domains of life. It is the predominant and most active auxin in seed plants, where it coordinates a variety of complex growth and development processes. The potential origin of auxin signaling in algae remains a matter of some controversy. In order to clarify the evolutionary context of algal auxin signaling, we undertook a genomic survey to assess whether auxin acts as a signaling molecule in the emerging model chlorophyte Chlorella sorokiniana UTEX 1230. C. sorokiniana produces the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which was present in both the cell pellet and in the supernatant at a concentration of ~ 1 nM, and its genome encodes orthologs of genes related to auxin synthesis, transport, and signaling in higher plants. Candidate orthologs for the canonical AUX/IAA signaling pathway were not found; however, auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1), an alternate auxin receptor, is present and highly conserved at essential auxin binding and zinc coordinating residues. Additionally, candidate orthologs for PIN proteins, responsible for intercellular, vectorial auxin transport in higher plants, were not found, but PILs (PIN-Like) proteins, a recently discovered family that mediates intracellular auxin transport, were identified. The distribution of auxin related gene in this unicellular chlorophyte demonstrates that a core suite of auxin signaling components was present early in the evolution of plants. Understanding the simplified auxin signaling pathways in chlorophytes will aid in understanding phytohormone signaling and crosstalk in seed plants, and in understanding the diversification and integration of developmental signals during the evolution of multicellular plants.",

    "abstract": "Cells process extra-cellular signals with multiple layers of complex biological networks. Due to the stochastic nature of the networks, the signals become significantly noisy within the cells and in addition, due to the nonlinear nature of the networks, the signals become distorted, shifted, and (de-)amplified. Such nonlinear signal processing can lead to non-trivial cellular phenotypes such as cell cycles, differentiation, cell-to-cell communication, and homeostasis. These nonlinear pheno-types, when observed at the cell population levels, can be quite different from the single-cell level observation. As one of the underlying mechanisms behind this difference, we report the interplay between nonlinearity and stochasticity in genetic regulation. Here we show that nonlinear genetic regulation, characterized at the cellular population level, can be affected by cell-to-cell variability in the regulatory factor concentrations. The observed genetic regulation at the cell population is shown to be significantly dependent on the upstream DNA sequences of the regulator, in particular, 5 untranslated region. This indicates that genetic regulation observed at the cell population level can be significantly dependent on its genetic context, and that its characterization needs a careful attention on noise propagation.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryGenetic regulation observed at the cell population level can be significantly affected by cell-to-cell variability in the regulatory factor copy numbers, indicating that the observed regulation is dependent on 5 UTR of the regulator coding gene.",

Here, we use the malachite green aptamer (MGA), an RNA aptamer that can specifically bind to malachite green (MG) dye and induces it to emit far-red fluorescence signals. Previous studies on MGA showed a potential for the use of MGA for genetically tagging other RNA molecules in live cells. However, these studies also exhibited low fluorescence signals and high background noise. Here we constructed and tested RNA scaffolds containing multiple tandem repeats of MGA as a strategy to increase the brightness of the MGA aptamer-fluorogen system as well as to make the system fluoresce when tagging various RNA molecules, in live cells. We demonstrate that our MGA scaffolds can induce fluorescence signals by up to ~20 fold compared to the basal level as a genetic tag for other RNA molecules. We also show that our scaffolds function reliably as genetically-encoded fluorescent tags for mRNAs of fluorescent proteins and other RNA aptamers.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of size and growth is a fundamental problem in biology. A prominent example is the formation of the mitotic spindle, where protein concentration gradients around chromosomes are thought to regulate spindle growth by controlling microtubule nucleation (1, 2). Previous evidence suggests that microtubules nucleate throughout the spindle structure (3-5). However, the mechanisms underlying microtubule nucleation and its spatial regulation are still unclear. Here, we developed an assay based on laser ablation to directly probe microtubule nucleation events in Xenopus laevis egg extracts. Combining this method with theory and quantitative microscopy, we show that the size of a spindle is controlled by autocatalytic growth of microtubules, driven by microtubule-stimulated microtubule nucleation. The autocatalytic activity of this nucleation system is spatially regulated by the limiting amounts of active microtubule nucleators, which decrease with distance from the chromosomes. Thus, the size of spindles is determined by the distance where one microtubule nucleates on average less than one new microtubule. This mechanism provides an upper limit to spindle size even when resources are not limiting and may have implications for spindle scaling during development (6, 7).",

    "abstract": "Individuals struggle when making financial decisions, sometimes preferring to avoid difficult decisions and receive lower future rewards over actively deliberating between options of similar value. Here, we examine how conflict deriving from objective and subjective value characteristics of stocks, as well as the behavioural and phenomenological correlates of decision conflict, are accompanied by variation in a thus far understudied ERP component, the conflict negativity (CN). In a novel EEG paradigm (N = 53), we simulated a financial decision situation in which participants made incentivized choices between different, sometimes conflicting, stock options. Our results indicate that participants become slower, more undecided, and less pleased, when choosing between similar options compared to choices in which one option clearly outweighs the other. This effect even held when participants chose between two objectively good alternatives. We further provide preliminary evidence that the CN, a negative-going ERP recorded over the medial prefrontal cortex, is not only sensitive to decision conflict, but also predicts behavioural indecision. What is more, subjective value characteristics of stocks, impressions based on brand perception of the stock options, modestly influenced affective and behavioural reactions over and above objective stock characteristics. While our results are at odds with assumptions made by classic economic theory, they may serve as one out of several indicators as to why private investors seem to avoid financial decisions.",

    "abstract": "Reverse genetics uses loss-of-function alleles to interrogate gene function. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing now allows to generate knock-out alleles for any gene and entire gene families. Even in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, gene editing is welcomed as T-DNA insertion lines do not always generate null alleles. Here, we show efficient generation of heritable mutations in Arabidopsis using CRISPR/Cas9 with a workload similar to generating overexpression lines. We obtain Cas9 null-segregants with bi-allelic mutations in the T2 generation. Out of seven new mutant alleles we report here, one allele for GRXS17, the ortholog of human GRX3/PICOT, did not phenocopy previously characterized nulls. Notwithstanding, the mutation caused a frameshift and triggered nonsense-mediated decay. We demonstrate that our workflow is also compatible with a dual sgRNA approach in which a gene is targeted by two sgRNAs simultaneously. This paired nuclease method can result in a more reliable loss-of-function alleles that lack a large essential part of the gene. The ease in the CRISPR/Cas9 workflow should help in the eventual generation of true null alleles of every gene in the Arabidopsis genome, which will advance both basic and applied plant research.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryWe present a dual sgRNA approach to delete Arabidopsis gene 34 fragments in order to obtain reliable functional knock-outs.",

Our paper aims to show that (1) respiration exerts significant and unexpected bottom-up influence on cognitive processes, and (2) it does so by modulating neural synchronization that underlies specific cognitive processes. Then, (3) we suggest that the particular example of respiration may function as a model for a general mechanism through which the body influences cognitive functioning. Finally, (4) we work out the implications for embodied cognition, draw a parallel to the role of gesture, and argue that respiration sometimes plays a double, pragmatic and epistemic, role, which reduces the cognitive load. In such cases, consistent with EC, the overall cognitive activity includes a loop-like interaction between neural and non-neural elements. (141 words)",

Genetic inactivation of NOS and LOX signalling components mirrors the anti-tumorigenic effect of the hit compounds.

    "abstract": "RNA regulation plays a critical role in mitosis, yet the mechanisms remain unclear. Our lab recently identified that the conserved RNA-Binding Protein (RBP), ATX-2, regulates cytokinesis by regulating the targeting of ZEN-4 to the spindle midzone through a conserved translation regulator, PAR-5/14-3-3sigma (Gnazzo et al., 2016). While co-depletion of ATX-2 and PAR-5 restored ZEN-4 targeting to the spindle midzone, it did not rescue cell division. To identify factors that may work in concert with ATX-2 to regulate cell division, we conducted a two-part, candidate RNAi suppressor and visual screen to identify factors that are important for cell division and also mediate the targeting of ATX-2 to the centrosomes and the spindle midzone. Using this approach, we identified ten genes that suppress the embryonic lethality defect observed in atx-2 mutant embryos. These ten genes, including act-2, cgh-1, cki-1, hum-6, par-2, rnp-4, vab-3, vhl-1, vps-24, and wve-1, all have some role regulating RNA or the cell cycle. Five of these genes (cgh-1, cki-1, vab-3, vhl-1, vps-24) fail to target ATX-2 to the centrosomes and midzone when depleted. The strongest suppressor of the atx-2 phenotype is the DEAD-box RNA helicase CGH-1/DDX6, which has been implicated in cell division, RNA processing and translation, and neuronal function. Loss of CGH-1 rescued the cytokinesis defect and also restored ZEN-4 localization to the spindle midzone. ATX-2 and CGH-1 are mutually required for their localization to centrosomes and the spindle midzone. Our findings provide the first functional evidence that CGH-1/DDX6 regulates ATX-2 function during mitosis to target ZEN-4 to the spindle midzone via PAR-5/14-3-3sigma. We suggest that RNA machinery is necessary for the completion of cytokinesis.",

    "abstract": "Within infected host cells, mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) forms viral factories (VFs) which are sites of viral transcription, translation, assembly, and replication. MRV non-structural protein, NS, comprises the structural matrix of VFs and is involved in recruiting other viral proteins to VF structures. Previous attempts have been made to visualize VF dynamics in live cells but due to current limitations in recovery of replicating reoviruses carrying large fluorescent protein tags, researchers have been unable to directly assess VF dynamics from virus-produced NS. We set out to develop a method to overcome this obstacle by utilizing the 6 amino-acid (CCPGCC) tetracysteine (TC)-tag and FlAsH-EDT2 reagent. The TC-tag was introduced into eight sites throughout NS, and the capacity of the TC-NS fusion proteins to form virus factory-like (VFL) structures and colocalize with virus proteins was characterized. Insertion of the TC-tag interfered with recombinant virus rescue in six of the eight mutants, likely as a result of loss of VF formation or important virus protein interactions. However, two recombinant (r)TC-NS viruses were rescued and VF formation, colocalization with associating virus proteins, and characterization of virus replication were subsequently examined. Furthermore the rTC-NS viruses were utilized to infect cells and examine VF dynamics using live cell microscopy. These experiments demonstrate active VF movement with fusion events as well as transient interactions between individual VFs, and demonstrate the importance of microtubule stability for VF fusion during MRV infection. This work provides important groundwork for future in depth studies of VF dynamics and host cell interactions.\\n\\nImportanceMRV has historically been used as a model to study the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) Reoviridae family, which infect and cause disease in humans, animals, and plants. During infection, MRV forms VFs that play a critical role in virus infection, but remain to be fully characterized. To study VFs, researchers have focused on visualizing the non-structural protein NS which forms the VF matrix. This work provides the first evidence of recovery of replicating reoviruses in which VFs can be labeled in live cells via introduction of a TC-tag into the NS open reading frame. Characterization of each recombinant reovirus sheds light on NS interactions with viral proteins. Moreover, utilizing the TC labeling FlAsH-EDT2 biarsenical reagent to visualize VFs, evidence is provided of dynamic VF movement and interactions at least partially dependent on intact microtubules.",

We propose to use an approach that yields a simple numerical measure of veracity, the R-factor, by summarizing the outcomes of already published studies that have attempted to test a claim. The R-factor of an investigator, a journal, or an institution would be the average of the R-factors of the claims they reported. We illustrate this approach using three studies recently tested by a replication initiative, compare the results, and discuss how using the R-factor can help improve the veracity of scientific research.",

How in this process endothelial cells arise in adequate numbers and arrange suitably to shape a functional vascular network is poorly understood. Here we show that YAP and TAZ promote stretch-induced proliferation and rearrangements of endothelial cells whilst preventing bleeding in developing vessels. Mechanistically, YAP and TAZ increase VE-cadherin turnover at junctions and suppress endothelial Notch and BMP signaling, two key pathways that limit sprouting and endothelial dynamics. Consequently, the loss of YAP and TAZ leads to stunted sprouting with local aggregation as well as scarcity of endothelial cells, branching irregularities and junction defects. Forced nuclear activity of TAZ instead drives hypersprouting and vascular hyperplasia. We propose a new model in which YAP and TAZ integrate mechanical signals with Notch and BMP signaling to balance endothelial cell distribution in angiogenic vessels.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) is the rotary motor which powers the swimming and swarming of many motile bacteria. The torque is provided by stator units, ion motive force powered ion channels known to assemble and disassemble dynamically in the BFM. This turnover is mechano-sensitive, with the number of engaged units dependent upon the viscous load experienced by the motor through the flagellum. However, the molecular mechanism driving BFM mechano-sensitivity is unknown. Here we directly measure the kinetics of arrival and departure of the stator units in individual wild-type motors via analysis of high-resolution recordings of motor speed, while dynamically varying the load on the motor via external magnetic torque. Obtaining the real-time stator stoichiometry before and after periods of forced motor stall, we measure both the number of active stator units at steady-state as a function of the load and the kinetic association and dissociation rates, by fitting the data to a reversible random sequential adsorption model. Our measurements indicate that BFM mechano-sensing relies on the dissociation rate of the stator units, which decreases with increasing load, while their association rate remains constant. This implies that the lifetime of an active stator unit assembled within the BFM increases when a higher force is applied to its anchoring point in the cell wall, providing strong evidence that a catch-bond mechanism can explain the mechano-sensitivity of the BFM.",

Three copy-number signatures predicted longer overall survival, while the others predicted poorer outcome. We found evidence for the mutational processes giving rise to copy-number change for six of the eight signatures via correlations with other genomic features. Our results provide insights into the pathogenesis of HGSOC by uncovering multiple mutational processes that shape genomes following TP53 mutation. Importantly, our work shows that most HGSOC have a mixture of mutational processes suggesting that targeting a single mutator phenotype may be therapeutically suboptimal.",

Little is known about the short-term evolution of Wolbachia or its interaction with its host. Wolbachia is maternally inherited, resulting in co-inheritance of mitochondrial organelles such as mtDNA. Here I explore the short-term evolution of Wolbachia, and the relationship between Wolbachia and mtDNA, using a large inbred panel of Drosophila simulans infected with the Wolbachia strain wRi. I find reduced diversity relative to expectation in both Wolbachia and mtDNA, but only mtDNA shows evidence of a recent selective sweep or population bottleneck. I estimate Wolbachia and mtDNA titre in each genotype, and I find considerable variation in both phenotypes, despite low genetic diversity in Wolbachia and mtDNA. A phylogeny of Wolbachia and of mtDNA show that both trees are largely unresolved, suggesting a recent origin of the infection and a single origin. Using Wolbachia and mtDNA titre as a phenotype, we perform an association analysis with the nuclear genome and find several regions implicated in the phenotype, including one which contains four CAAX-box protein processing genes. CAAX-box protein processing can be an important part of host-pathogen interactions in other systems, suggesting interesting directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeTo evaluate the accuracy of non-neural and neural network models to classify five categories (classes) of acute and communicable findings on unstructured head computed tomography (CT) reports.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsThree radiologists annotated 1,400 head CT reports for language indicating the presence or absence of acute communicable findings (hemorrhage, stroke, hydrocephalus, and mass effect). This set was used to train, develop, and evaluate a non-neural classifier, support vector machine (SVM), in comparisons to two neural network models using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and neural attention model (NAM) Inter-rater agreement was computed using kappa statistics. Accuracy, receiver operated curves, and area under the curve were calculated and tabulated. P-values < 0.05 was significant and 95% confidence intervals were computed.\\n\\nResultsRadiologist agreement was 86-94% and Cohens kappa was 0.667-0.762 (substantial agreement). Accuracies of the CNN and NAM (range 0.90-0.94) were higher than SVM (range 0.88-0.92). NAM showed relatively equal accuracy with CNN for three classes, severity, mass effect, and hydrocephalus, higher accuracy for the acute bleed class, and lower accuracy for the acute stroke class. AUCs of all methods for all classes were above 0.92.\\n\\nConclusionsO_LINeural network models (CNN & NAM) generally had higher accuracies compared to the non-neural models (SVM) and have a range of accuracies that comparable to the inter-annotator agreement of three neuroradiologists.\\nC_LIO_LIThe NAM method adds ability to hold the algorithm accountable for its classification via heat map generation, thereby adding an auditing feature to this neural network.\\nC_LI\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Recently, microcephaly cases have increased in Americas and have been matter of concern due to Zika virus (ZIKV) recent outbreak. Previous studies have shown that ZIKV-infected progenitor neuronal cells present morphological abnormalities and increased rates of cell death, which may be indicators of microcephaly causes. As recent studies indicate Zika virus tropism for brain cells, how would a glioblastoma (GBM) lineage behave under ZIKV infection, considering GBM the most common and malignant brain tumor in adults, presenting extreme chemoresistance and high morbidity and mortality rates? The current trend of using genetically engineered oncolytic pathogens as a safe way to eliminate tumors is under development, with trials already in course. Therefore, the present study evaluated the possible oncolytic effects and metabolomic alterations of Zika virus infection at human malignant M059J glioblastoma cells. Microscopic evaluation was performed using optical microscopy, which showed cytopathic effects induced by ZIKV at GBM cells. For the metabolomics study, both control and infected cell cultures were submitted to MALDI-MSI analysis. Mass spectrometry data were submitted to PLS-DA statistical analysis, and distinct biomarkers were elected for each infected groups. This study brings light to unexpectedly induced metabolic changes, as endogenous Digoxin as important biomarker for ZIKV-GBM group, associated with cytopathic effects induced by viral infection. These results evidences that genetically engineered ZIKV might be a potential new strategy for neural cancer management through the induction of endogenous digoxin synthesis in glioblastoma cells.",

    "abstract": "Sampling regulates stimulus intensity and temporal dynamics at the sense organ. Despite variations in sampling behavior, animals must make veridical perceptual judgments about external stimuli. In olfaction, odor sampling varies with respiration, which influences neural responses at the olfactory periphery. Nevertheless, rats were able to perform fine odor intensity judgments despite variations in sniff kinetics. To identify the features of neural activity supporting stable intensity perception, in awake mice we measured responses of Mitral/Tufted (MT) cells to different odors and concentrations across a range of sniff frequencies. Amplitude and latency of the MT cells responses vary with sniff duration. A fluid dynamics (FD) model based on odor concentration kinetics in the intranasal cavity can account for this variability. Eliminating sniff waveform dependence of MT cell responses using the FD model significantly improves concentration decoding. This suggests potential schemes for sniff waveform invariant odor concentration coding.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIOdor concentration discrimination does not depend on sniff frequency\\nC_LIO_LIAmplitude and latency of MT cell responses vary with sniff frequency\\nC_LIO_LIA fluid dynamic based model accounts for sniff dependent variability in the responses\\nC_LIO_LITransforming MT cell responses with this model achieves sniff invariant coding\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The response of cancer cells to drugs is determined by various factors, including the cells mutations and gene expression levels. These factors can be assessed using next-generation sequencing. Their integration with vast prior knowledge on signaling pathways is, however, limited by the availability of mathematical models and scalable computational methods. Here, we present a computational framework for the parameterization of large-scale mechanistic models and its application to the prediction of drug response of cancer cell lines from exome and transcriptome sequencing data. With this framework, we parameterized a mechanistic model describing major cancer-associated signaling pathways (>1200 species and >2600 reactions) using drug response data. For the parameterized mechanistic model, we found a prediction accuracy, which exceeds that of the considered statistical approaches. Our results demonstrate for the first time the massive integration of heterogeneous datasets using large-scale mechanistic models, and how these models facilitate individualized predictions of drug response. We anticipate our parameterized model to be a starting point for the development of more comprehensive, curated models of signaling pathways, accounting for additional pathways and drugs.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the problem of estimating a species tree from multilocus data in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting and migration. We develop a mathematical model similar to IMa2 (Hey 2010) for the relevant evolutionary processes which allows both the the population size parameters and the migration rates between pairs of species tree branches to be integrated out. We then describe a BEAST2 package DENIM which based on this model, and which uses an approximation to sample from the posterior. The approximation is based on the assumption that migrations are rare, and it only samples from certain regions of the posterior which seem likely given this assumption. The method breaks down if there is a lot of migration. Using simulations, Leache et al 2014 showed migration causes problems for species tree inference using the multispecies coalescent when migration is present but ignored. We re-analyze this simulated data to explore DENIMs performance, and demonstrate substantial improvements over *BEAST. We also re-analyze an empirical data set.
