    "abstract": "Multiple methods have been introduced over the past 30 years to identify the genomic insertion sites of transposable elements and other DNA elements that integrate into genomes. However, each of these methods suffer from limitations that can frustrate attempts to map multiple insertions in a single genome and to map insertions in genomes of high complexity that contain extensive repetitive DNA. I introduce a new method for transposon mapping that is simple to perform, can accurately map multiple insertions per genome, and generates long sequence \\\"reads\\\" that facilitate mapping to complex genomes. The method, called TagMap, for Tagmentation-based Mapping, relies on a modified Tn5 tagmentation protocol with a single tagmentation adaptor followed by PCR using primers specific to the tranposable element and the adaptor sequence. Several minor modifications to normal tagmentation reagents and protocols allow easy and rapid preparation of TagMap libraries. Short read sequencing starting from the adaptor sequence generates oriented reads that flank and are oriented toward the transposable element insertion site. The convergent orientation of adjacent reads at the insertion site allows straightforward prediction of the precise insertion site(s). A Linux shell script is provided to identify insertion sites from fastq files.",

    "abstract": "Habits form a crucial component of behavior. In recent years, key computational models have conceptualized habits as arising from model-free reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms, which typically select between available actions based on the future value expected to result from each. Traditionally, however, habits have been understood as behaviors that can be triggered directly by a stimulus, without requiring the animal to evaluate expected outcomes. Here, we develop a computational model instantiating this traditional view, in which habits develop through the direct strengthening of recently taken actions rather than through the encoding of outcomes. We demonstrate that this model accounts for key behavioral manifestations of habits, including insensitivity to outcome devaluation and contingency degradation, as well as the effects of reinforcement schedule on the rate of habit formation. The model also explains the prevalent observation of perseveration in repeated-choice tasks as an additional behavioral manifestation of the habit system. We suggest that mapping habitual behaviors onto value-free mechanisms provides a parsimonious account of existing behavioral and neural data. This mapping may provide a new foundation for building robust and comprehensive models of the interaction of habits with other, more goal-directed types of behaviors and help to better guide research into the neural mechanisms underlying control of instrumental behavior more generally.",

    "abstract": "Neurons are inherently plastic, adjusting their structure, connectivity and excitability in response to changes in activity. How neurons sense changes in their activity level and then transduce these to structural changes remains to be fully elucidated. Working with the Drosophila larval locomotor network, we show that neurons use reactive oxygen species (ROS), metabolic byproducts, to monitor their activity. ROS signals are both necessary and sufficient for activity-dependent structural adjustments of both pre- and postsynaptic terminals and for network output, as measured by larval crawling behavior. We find the highly conserved Parkinsons disease-linked protein DJ-1{beta} acts as a redox sensor in neurons where it regulates pre- and postsynaptic structural plasticity, in part via modulation of the PTEN-PI3Kinase pathway. Neuronal ROS thus play an important physiological role as second messengers required for neuronal and network tuning, whose dysregulation in the ageing brain and under neurodegenerative conditions may contribute to synaptic dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine underlies important aspects of cognition, and has been suggested to boost cognitive performance. However, how dopamine modulates the large-scale cortical dynamics during cognitive performance has remained elusive. Using functional MRI during a working memory task in healthy young human listeners (N=22), we investigated the effect of levodopa (L-dopa) on two aspects of cortical dynamics, blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability and the functional connectome of large-scale cortical networks. We here show that enhanced dopaminergic signaling modulates the two potentially interrelated aspects of large-scale cortical dynamics during cognitive performance, and the degree of these modulations is able to explain inter-individual differences in L-dopa-induced behavioral benefits. Relative to placebo, L-dopa increased BOLD signal variability in task-relevant temporal, inferior frontal, parietal and cingulate regions. On the connectome level, however, L-dopa diminished functional integration across temporal and cingulo-opercular regions. This hypo-integration was expressed as a reduction in network efficiency and modularity in more than two thirds of the participants and to different degrees. Hypo-integration co-occurred with relative hyper-connectivity in paracentral lobule and precuneus, as well as posterior putamen. Both, L-dopa-induced BOLD signal variability modulation and functional connectome modulations proved predictive of an individuals L-dopa-induced gain in behavioral performance, namely response speed and perceptual sensitivity. Lastly, L-dopa-induced modulations of BOLD signal variability were correlated with L-dopa-induced modulation of nodal connectivity and network efficiency. Our findings underline the role of dopamine in maintaining the dynamic range of, and communication between, cortical systems, and their explanatory power for inter-individual differences in benefits from dopamine during cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundQuantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in genetic data often involves analysis of correlated observations, which need to be accounted for to avoid false association signals. This is commonly performed by modeling such correlations as random effects in linear mixed models (LMMs). The R package lme4 is a well-established tool that implements major LMM features using sparse matrix methods; however, it is not fully adapted for QTL mapping association and linkage studies. In particular, two LMM features are lacking in the base version of lme4: the definition of random effects by custom covariance matrices; and parameter constraints, which are essential in advanced QTL models. Apart from applications in linkage studies of related individuals, such functionalities are of high interest for association studies in situations where multiple covariance matrices need to be modeled, a scenario not covered by many genome-wide association study (GWAS) software.\\n\\nResultsTo address the aforementioned limitations, we developed a new R package lme4qtl as an extension of lme4. First, lme4qtl contributes new models for genetic studies within a single tool integrated with lme4 and its companion packages. Second, lme4qtl offers a flexible framework for scenarios with multiple levels of relatedness and becomes efficient when covariance matrices are sparse. We showed the value of our package using real family-based data in the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia 2 (GAIT2) project.\\n\\nConclusionsOur software lme4qtl enables QTL mapping models with a versatile structure of random effects and efficient computation for sparse covariances. lme4qtl is available at https://github.com/variani/lme4qtl.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is caused by the collapse of substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the midbrain (MB), while other DA populations remain relatively intact. Common variation influencing susceptibility to sporadic PD has been primarily identified through genome wide association studies (GWAS). However, like many other common genetic diseases, the genes impacted by common PD-associated variation remain to be elucidated. Here, we used single-cell RNA-seq to characterize DA neuron populations in the mouse brain at embryonic and early postnatal timepoints. These data allow for the unbiased identification of DA neuron subpopulations, including a novel postnatal neuroblast population and SN DA neurons. Comparison of SN DA neurons with other DA neurons populations in the brain reveals a unique transcriptional profile, novel marker genes, and specific gene regulatory networks. By integrating these cell population specific data with published GWAS, we develop a scoring system for prioritizing candidate genes in PD-associated loci. With this, we prioritize candidate genes in all 32 GWAS intervals implicated in sporadic PD risk, the first such systematically generated list. From this we confirm that the prioritized candidate gene CPLX1 disrupts the nigrostriatal pathway when knocked out in mice. Ultimately, this systematic rationale leads to the identification of biologically pertinent candidates and testable hypotheses for sporadic PD that will inform a new era of PD genetic research.",

The identification of microbial hybrids is made even more complicated, as most environmental microbes are resistant to culturing and must be studied in their native mixed communities. We have previously adapted the chromosome conformation capture method Hi-C to the assembly of genomes from mixed populations. Here, we show the methods application in assembling genomes directly from an uncultured, mixed population from a spontaneously inoculated beer sample. Our assembly method has enabled us to de-convolute 4 bacterial and 4 yeast genomes from this sample, including a putative yeast hybrid. Downstream isolation and analysis of this hybrid confirmed its genome to consist of Pichia membranifaciens and that of another related, but undescribed yeast. Our work shows that Hi-C-based metagenomic methods can overcome the limitation of traditional sequencing methods in studying complex mixtures of genomes.",

The key issue is that since parental lines were not available, might the reported variants have been inherited? To expand upon the limited available whole genome data on whether CRISPR-edited mice show more genetic variation, whole-genome sequencing was performed on two other mouse lines that had undergone a CRISPR-editing procedure. Again, parents were not available for either the Capn5 nor Fblim1 CRISPR-edited mouse lines, so strain controls were examined. Additionally, we also include verification of variants detected in the initial mouse line. Taken together, these whole-genome-sequencing-level results support the idea that in specific cases, CRISPR-Cas9 editing can precisely edit the genome at the organismal level and may not introduce numerous, unintended, off-target mutations.",

    "abstract": "Two datasets, the geologic record and the genetic content of extant organisms, provide complementary insights into the history of how key molecular components have shaped or driven global environmental and macroevolutionary trends. Changes in global physicochemical modes over time are thought to be a consistent feature of this relationship between Earth and life, as life is thought to have been optimizing protein functions for the entirety of its [~]3.8 billion years of history on Earth. Organismal survival depends on how well critical genetic and metabolic components can adapt to their environments, reflecting an ability to optimize efficiently to changing conditions. The geologic record provides an array of biologically independent indicators of macroscale atmospheric and oceanic composition, but provides little in the way of the exact behavior of the molecular components that influenced the compositions of these reservoirs. By reconstructing sequences of proteins that might have been present in ancient organisms, we can identify a subset of possible sequences that may have been optimized to these ancient environmental conditions. How can extant life be used to reconstruct ancestral phenotypes? Configurations of ancient sequences can be inferred from the diversity of extant sequences, and then resurrected in the lab to ascertain their biochemical attributes. One way to augment sequence-based, single-gene methods to obtain a richer and more reliable picture of the deep past, is to resurrect inferred ancestral protein sequences in living organisms, where their phenotypes can be exposed in a complex molecular-systems context, and to then link consequences of those phenotypes to biosignatures that were preserved in the independent historical repository of the geological record. As a first-step beyond single molecule reconstruction to the study of functional molecular systems, we present here the ancestral sequence reconstruction of the beta-carbonic anhydrase protein. We assess how carbonic anhydrase proteins meet our selection criteria for reconstructing ancient biosignatures in the lab, which we term paleophenotype reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "There is an overwhelming archeological and genetic evidence that modern speech apparatus was acquired by hominins by 600,000 years ago1. On the other hand, artifacts signifying modern imagination, such as (1) composite figurative arts, (2) bone needles with an eye, (3) construction of dwellings, and (4) elaborate burials arose not earlier than 70,000 years ago2. It remains unclear (1) why there was a long gap between acquisition of modern speech apparatus and modern imagination, (2) what triggered the acquisition of modern imagination 70,000 years ago, and (3) what role language might have played in this process. Our research into evolutionary origin of modern imagination has been driven by the observation of a temporal limit for the development of a particular component of imagination. Modern children not exposed to recursive language in early childhood never acquire the type of active constructive imagination called Prefrontal Synthesis (PFS). Unlike vocabulary and grammar acquisition, which can be learned throughout ones lifetime, there is a strong critical period for the development of PFS and individuals not exposed to recursive language in early childhood can never acquire PFS as adults. Their language will always lack understanding of spatial prepositions and recursion that depend on the PFS ability. In a similar manner, early hominins would not have been able to learn recursive language as adults and, therefore, would not be able to teach recursive language to their children. Thus, the existence of a strong critical period for PFS acquisition creates an evolutionary barrier for behavioral modernity. An evolutionary mathematical model suggests that a synergistic confluence of three events (1) a genetic mutation that extended the critical period by slowing down the prefrontal cortex development simultaneously in two or more children, (2) invention of recursive elements of language, such as spatial prepositions, by these children and (3) their dialogic communications using these recursive elements, resulted in concurrent conversion of a non-recursive communication system of their parents to recursive language and acquisition of PFS around 70,000 years ago.",

They have been identified in all three superkingdoms but are not ubiquitous, although fungi that secrete acids as part of their lifestyle can have up to six paralogs. Both tripeptidyl peptidase (TPP) and endopeptidase activity have been identified and it has been suggested that these correspond to separate subfamilies.\\n\\nWe studied eukaryotic sedolisins by computational analysis. A maximum likelihood tree shows three major clades of which two contain only fungal sequences. One fungal clade contains all known TPPs whereas the other contains the endosedolisins. We identified four cluster specific inserts (CSIs) in endosedolisins, of which CSIs 1, 3 and 4 appear as solvent exposed according to structure modeling. Part of CSI2 is exposed but a short stretch forms a novel and partially buried -helix that induces a conformational change near the binding pocket. We also identified a total of 12 specificity determining positions (SDPs) divided over three SDP sub-networks. The major SDP network contains eight directly connected SDPs and modeling of virtual mutants suggests a key role for the W307A or F307A substitution. This substitution is accompanied by a group of four SDPs that physically interact at the interface of the catalytic domain and the enzymes prosegment. Modeling of virtual mutants suggests these SDPs are indeed required to compensate the conformational change induced by CSI2 and the A307. The additional major network SDPs as well as the two small SDP networks appear to be linked to this major substitution, all together explaining the hypothesized functional diversification of fungal sedolisins.\\n\\nHighlightsThere are two sedolisin subfamilies in fungi: tripeptidyl peptidases and endopeptidases\\nFunctional Diversification of fungal sedolisins led to a conformational change in the pocket\\nFunctional Diversification centers around buried SDP307\\nSDP307 is aromatic in TPPs and Alanine in endosedolisins\\nAdditional SDPs affect the interaction between core and chaperone-like prosegment",

    "abstract": "Older adults often experience difficulties in understanding speech, partly because of age-related hearing loss. In young adults, activity of the left articulatory motor cortex is enhanced and it interacts with the auditory cortex via the left-hemispheric dorsal stream during speech processing. Little is known about the effect of ageing and age-related hearing loss on this auditory-motor interaction and speech processing in the articulatory motor cortex. It has been proposed that up-regulation of the motor system during speech processing could compensate for hearing loss and auditory processing deficits in older adults. Alternatively, age-related auditory deficits could reduce and distort the input from the auditory cortex to the articulatory motor cortex, suppressing recruitment of the motor system during listening to speech. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ageing and age-related hearing loss on the excitability of the tongue motor cortex during listening to spoken sentences using transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography. Our results show that the excitability of the tongue motor cortex was facilitated during listening to speech in young and older adults with normal hearing. This facilitation was significantly reduced in older adults with hearing loss. These findings suggest a decline of auditory-motor processing of speech in adults with age-related hearing loss.",

These results are consistent with immune modulating properties of certain probiotics based on the fermentation of milk and colostrum. Urinary excretion of non-metal toxicants that accumulate in adipose tissue such as Perchlorate, N-acetyl(2-hydroxypropyl)cysteine (NAHP), 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 3-Phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA), N-acetyl phenyl cysteine (NAP), Phenylglycoxylic acid (PGO), Monoethylphthalate (MEP) and 2-Hydroxyisobutyric Acid (2HIB) was significantly increased. These results are consistent with the weight loss (5 Kg) associated with intermittent fasting and with the known features of probiotics as detoxification tools. Consistent with certain toxicants acting as endocrine disruptors, we observed an increased elimination of toxicants and a 33% decrease of serum Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), suggesting a trend toward normalization of thyroid function. These results support the hypothesis that a combination of intermittent fasting with the consumption of specific probiotic yogurts may lead to immune modulation, detoxification and other improvements.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

This method produces a large amount of raw data that requires downstream processing to align signals of interest (peaks) across multiple samples and match peak characteristics to reference standard libraries prior to downstream statistical analysis.

    "abstract": "A fundamental issue in evolutionary systems biology is understanding the relationship between the topological architecture of a biological network, such as a metabolic network, and the evolution of the network. The rate at which an element in a metabolic network accumulates genetic variation via new mutations depends on both the size of the mutational target it presents and its robustness to mutational perturbation. Quantifying the relationship between topological properties of network elements and the mutability of those elements will facilitate understanding the variation in and evolution of networks at the level of populations and higher taxa.\\n\\nWe report an investigation into the relationship between two topological properties of 29 metabolites in the C. elegans metabolic network and the sensitivity of those metabolites to the cumulative effects of spontaneous mutation. The relationship between several measures of network centrality and sensitivity to mutation is weak, but point estimates of the correlation between network centrality and mutational variance are positive, with only one exception. There is a marginally significant correlation between core number and mutational heritability. There is a small but significant negative correlation between the shortest path length between a pair of metabolites and the mutational correlation between those metabolites.\\n\\nPositive association between the centrality of a metabolite and its mutational heritability is consistent with centrally-positioned metabolites presenting a larger mutational target than peripheral ones, and is inconsistent with centrality conferring mutational robustness, at least in toto. The weakness of the correlation between shortest path length and the mutational correlation between pairs of metabolites suggests that network locality is an important but not overwhelming factor governing mutational pleiotropy. These findings provide necessary background against which the effects of other evolutionary forces, most importantly natural selection, can be interpreted.",

Understanding the methylation differences between epithelial and mesenchymal states may assist in the identification of optimal DNA methylation biomarkers for the blood-based monitoring of cancer. Methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) was used to examine the promoter methylation status of a panel of established and novel markers in a range of breast cancer cell lines spanning the epithelial-mesenchymal spectrum. Pyrosequencing was used to validate the MSHRM results. The results indicate an overall distinction in methylation between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. The mesenchymal expression markers VIM, DKK3 and CRABP1 were methylated in the majority of epithelial breast cancer cell lines while methylation of the epithelial expression markers GRHL2, MIR200C and CDH1 was restricted to mesenchymal cell lines. We also examined EMP association of several methylation markers that have been used to assess minimal residual disease. Markers such as AKR1B1 and APC methylation proved to be selective for epithelial breast cell lines, however RASSF1A, RAR{beta}, TWIST1 and SFRP2 methylation was seen in both epithelial and mesenchymal cell lines, supporting their suitability for a multi-marker panel.",

    "abstract": "Inactivation of the minor spliceosome has been linked to microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type 1 (MOPD1). To interrogate how minor intron splicing regulates cortical development, we employed Emx1-Cre to ablate Rnu11, which encodes the minor spliceosome-specific U11 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), in the developing cortex (pallium). Rnu11 cKO mice were born with microcephaly, caused by death of self-amplifying radial glial cells (RGCs). However, both intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) and neurons were produced in the U11-null pallium. RNAseq of the pallium revealed elevated minor intron retention in the mutant, particularly in genes regulating cell cycle. Moreover, the only downregulated minor intron-containing gene (MIG) was Spc24, which regulates kinetochore assembly. These findings were consistent with the observation of fewer RGCs entering cytokinesis prior to RGC loss, underscoring the requirement of minor splicing for cell cycle progression in RGCs. Overall, we provide a potential explanation of how disruption of minor splicing might cause microcephaly in MOPD1.\\n\\nSummary StatementHere we report the first mammalian model to investigate the role of the minor spliceosome in cortical development and microcephaly.\\n\\nList of abbreviations usedMOPD1=microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type 1; snRNA=small nuclear RNA; cKO=conditional knockout; NPC=neural progenitor cell; RGC=radial glial cell; IPC=intermediate progenitor cell; MIG=minor intron-containing gene",

By using site-specific recombination to fuse two DNA barcodes, each representing a specific gene deletion, BFG-GI enables multiplexed quantitative tracking of double mutants via next-generation sequencing. We applied BFG-GI to a matrix of DNA repair genes under nine different conditions, including methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO), bleomycin, zeocin, and three other DNA-damaging environments. BFG-GI recapitulated known genetic interactions and yielded new condition-dependent genetic interactions.

Live imaging studies in vertebrate brains strongly suggest that nascent synapses are critical for branch growth during the development of axonal and dendritic arborisations. The molecular mechanisms underlying such  synaptotropic events are largely unknown.\\n\\nHere we present a novel system in Drosophila for studying the development of complex axonal arborisations live, in vivo during metamorphosis. In these growing axonal arborisations we see a relationship between the punctate localisations of presynaptic components and branch dynamics that is very similar to synaptotropic growth described in fish and frogs. These presynaptic components however do not appear to represent functional presynaptic release sites and are not paired with clusters of neurotransmitter receptors. Pharmacological and genetic knockdowns of evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission do not impact the outgrowth of these neurons. Instead, we find that axonal branch growth is regulated by the dynamic focal localisations of synaptic adhesion proteins Neurexin and Neuroligin. These adhesion complexes provide selective stability for filopodia by a  stick and grow-based mechanism wholly independent of synaptic activity.",

    "abstract": "A key player in the intracellular trafficking network is cytoplasmic dynein, a protein complex that transports molecular cargo along microtubule tracks. It has been shown that vertebrate dyneins movement becomes strikingly enhanced upon interacting with a cofactor named dynactin and one of several cargo-adapters, such as BicaudalD2. However, the mechanisms responsible for this increase in transport efficiency are not well understood, largely due to a lack of structural information. We used cryo-electron tomography to visualize the first 3-dimensional structure of the intact dynein-dynactin complex bound to microtubules. Our structure reveals that the dynactin-cargo-adapter complex recruits and binds to two dimeric cytoplasmic dyneins. Interestingly, the dynein motor organization closely resembles that of axonemal dynein, suggesting that cytoplasmic dynein and axonemal dyneins may utilize similar mechanisms to coordinate multiple motors. We propose that grouping dyneins onto a single dynactin scaffold promotes collective force production as well as unidirectional processive motility. These findings provide a structural platform that facilitates a deeper biochemical and biophysical understanding of dynein regulation and cellular transport.",

    "abstract": "Models for regulation of the eukaryotic heat shock response typically invoke a negative feedback loop consisting of the transcriptional activator Hsf1 and a molecular chaperone encoded by an Hsf1 target gene. Previously, we identified Hsp70 as the chaperone responsible for Hsf1 repression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and constructed a mathematical model based on Hsp70-mediated negative feedback that recapitulated the dynamic activity of Hsf1 during heat shock. The model was based on two assumptions: dissociation of Hsp70 activates Hsf1, and transcriptional induction of Hsp70 deactivates Hsf1. Here we validated these assumptions. First, we severed the feedback loop by uncoupling Hsp70 expression from Hsf1 regulation. As predicted by the model, Hsf1 was unable to efficiently deactivate in the absence of Hsp70 transcriptional induction. Next we mapped a discrete Hsp70 binding site on Hsf1 to a motif in the C-terminal activation domain known as conserved element 2 (CE2). Removal of CE2 resulted in increased Hsf1 activity under non-heat shock conditions and delayed deactivation kinetics. In addition, we uncovered a role for the N-terminal domain of Hsf1 in negatively regulating DNA binding. These results reveal the quantitative control mechanisms underlying the feedback loop charged with maintaining cytosolic proteostasis.",

Using Hi-C analysis of long-range chromosome interactions and ChIP-Seq analysis of regulatory histone marks we studied the epigenomic effects of the prominent large deletion CNV on chromosome 22q11.2 and also replicated a subset of the findings for the large deletion CNV on chromosome 1q21.1.\\n\\nResultsWe found that, in addition to local and global gene expression changes, there are pronounced and multilayered effects on chromatin states, chromosome folding and topological domains of the chromatin, that emanate from the large CNV locus. Regulatory histone marks are altered in the deletion proximal regions, and in opposing directions for activating and repressing marks. There are also significant changes of histone marks elsewhere along chromosome 22q and genome wide. Chromosome interaction patterns are weakened within the deletion boundaries and strengthened between the deletion proximal regions. We detected a change in the manner in which chromosome 22q folds onto itself, namely by increasing the long-range contacts between the telomeric end and the deletion proximal region. Further, the large CNV affects the topological domain that is spanning its genomic region. Finally, there is a widespread and complex effect on chromosome interactions genome-wide, i.e. involving all other autosomes, with some of the effect directly tied to the deletion region on 22q11.2.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings suggest novel principles of how such large genomic deletions can alter nuclear organization and affect genomic molecular activity.",

    "abstract": "Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogen that causes infections ranging from mild to fulminant and life-threatening. Biofilms have been implicated in acute GAS soft-tissue infections such as necrotizing fasciitis (NF). However, most in vitro models used to study GAS biofilms have been designed to mimic chronic infections and insufficiently recapitulate in vivo conditions and the host-pathogen interactions that might influence biofilm formation. Here we establish and characterize an in vitro model of GAS biofilm development on mammalian cells that simulates microcolony formation observed in a murine model of human NF. We show that on mammalian cells, GAS forms dense aggregates that display hallmark biofilm characteristics including a three-dimensional architecture and enhanced tolerance to antibiotics. In contrast to abiotic-grown biofilms, host-associated biofilms require the expression of secreted GAS streptolysins O and S (SLO, SLS) resulting in the release of a host-associated biofilm promoting-factor(s). Supernatants from GAS-infected mammalian cells or from cells treated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressors restore biofilm formation to an SLO and SLS null mutant that is otherwise attenuated in biofilm formation on cells, together suggesting a role for streptolysin-induced ER stress in this process. In an in vivo mouse model, the streptolysin-null mutant is attenuated in both microcolony formation and bacterial spread, but pre-treatment of softtissue with an ER-stressor restores the ability of the mutant to form wild type like microcolonies that disseminate throughout the soft tissue. Taken together, we have identified a new role of streptolysin-driven ER stress in GAS biofilm formation and NF disease progression.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAlthough it is well-accepted that bacterial biofilms are associated with many chronic infections, little is known about the mechanisms by which group A Streptococcus (GAS) biofilms contribute to acute soft tissue-invasive diseases like necrotizing fasciitis (NF). In this study, we establish a physiologically relevant in vitro model to study GAS biofilm formation on mammalian cells and validate our findings in a mouse model that mimics human NF. This study demonstrates a novel role of GAS streptolysin-mediated ER stress in the development and spread of GAS biofilms in acute softtissue infections. We also show that biofilm formation depends on the release of a host-associated factor that promotes microcolony formation and GAS dissemination in vivo.",

    "abstract": "About 50% of the worlds arable land is strongly acidic (soil pH < 5). The low pH of these soils solubilizes root-toxic ionic aluminium (Al3+) species from clay minerals, driving the evolution of various counteractive adaptations in cultivated crops. The food crop Sorghum bicolor, for example, upregulates the membrane-embedded transporter protein SbMATE in its roots. SbMATE mediates efflux of the anionic form of the organic acid, citrate, into the soil rhizosphere, chelating Al3+ ions and thereby imparting Al-resistance based on excluding Al+3 from the growing root tip. Here, we use electrophysiological, radiolabeled, and fluorescence-based transport assays in two heterologous expression systems to establish a broad substrate recognition profile of SbMATE, showing the transport of 14C- citrate anion, as well as the organic monovalent cation, ethidium, but not the divalent ethidium-derivative, propidium. The transport cycle is proton and/or sodium-driven, and shares certain molecular mechanisms with bacterial MATE-family transporters. We further complement our transport assays by directly measuring substrate binding to detergent-purified SbMATE protein. Finally, we use the functionally-folded, purified membrane protein as an antigen to discover high-affinity, native conformation-binding and transport function-altering nanobodies using an animal-free, mRNA/cDNA display technology. Our results demonstrate the utility of using Pichia pastoris as an efficient eukaryotic host to express large quantities of functional plant transporter proteins for in vitro characterization. The nanobody discovery approach is applicable to other low immunogenic plant proteins.",

    "abstract": "Coarse-grained molecular simulation models have provided immense, often general, insight into the complex behavior of condensed-phase systems, but suffer from a lost connection to the true dynamical properties of the underlying system. In general, the physics that is built into a model shapes the free-energy landscape, restricting the attainable static and kinetic properties. In this work, we perform a detailed investigation into the property interrelationships resulting from these restrictions, for a representative system of the helix-coil transition. Inspired by high-throughput studies, we systematically vary force-field parameters and monitor their structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties. The focus of our investigation is a simple coarse-grained model, which accurately represents the underlying structural ensemble, i.e., effectively avoids sterically-forbidden configurations. As a result of this built-in physics, we observe a rather large restriction in the topology of the networks characterizing the simulation kinetics. When screening across force-field parameters, we find that structurally-accurate models also best reproduce the kinetics, suggesting structural-kinetic relationships for these models. Additionally, an investigation into thermodynamic properties reveals a link between the cooperativity of the transition and the network topology at a single reference temperature.",

One of the numerous sources of cell-to-cell variation in gene expression is the heterogeneity in cell proliferation state. How cell cycle and cell size influences gene expression variability at single-cell level is not yet clearly understood. To deconvolute such influences, most of the single-cell studies used dedicated methods that could include some bias. Here, we provide a universal and automatic toxic-free label method, compatible with single-cell high-throughput RT-qPCR. This led to an unbiased gene expression analysis and could be also used for improving single-cell tracking and imaging when combined with cell isolation. As an application for this technique, we showed that cell-to-cell variability in chicken erythroid progenitors was negligibly influenced by cell size nor cell cycle.",

To realize this, we combined optogenetics and Brainbow technologies. Using these technologies, we established a C. elegans library where opsin is labeled in a randomized pattern. Behavioral analysis on this library under light illumination enabled high-throughput annotation of neurons affecting target behaviors. We applied this approach to the egg-laying behavior of C. elegans and succeeded in high-throughput confirmation that hermaphrodite-specific neurons play an important role in the egg-laying behavior. This cellomics approach will lead to the accumulation of neurophysiological and behavioral data of the C. elegans neural network, which is necessary for constructing neuroanatomically grounded models of behavior.",

    "abstract": "Geometric reasoning has an inherent dissonance: its abstract axioms and propositions refer to infinitesimal points and infinite straight lines while our perception of the physical world deals with fuzzy dots and curved stripes. How we use these disparate mechanisms to make geometric judgments remains unresolved. Here, we deploy a classically used cognitive geometric task - planar triangle completion - to study the statistics of errors in the location of the missing vertex. Our results show that the mean location has an error proportional to the side of the triangle, the standard deviation is sub-linearly dependent on the side length, and has a negative skewness. These scale-dependent responses directly contradict the conclusions of recent cognitive studies that innate Euclidean rules drive our geometric judgments. To explain our observations, we turn to a perceptual basis for geometric reasoning that balances the competing effects of local smoothness and global orientation of extrapolated trajectories. The resulting mathematical framework captures our observations and further predicts the statistics of the missing angle in a second triangle completion task. To go beyond purely perceptual geometric tasks, we carry out a categorical version of triangle completion that asks about the change in the missing angle after a change in triangle shape. The observed responses show a systematic scale-dependent discrepancy at odds with rule-based Euclidean reasoning, but one that is completely consistent with our framework. All together, our findings point to the use of statistical dynamic models of the noisy perceived physical world, rather than on the abstract rules of Euclid in determining how we reason geometrically.",

    "abstract": "Identification of intron boundaries, called splice junctions, is an important part of delineating gene structure and functions. This also provides valuable in-sights into the role of alternative splicing in increasing functional diversity of genes. Identification of splice junctions through RNA-seq is by mapping short reads to the reference genome which is prone to errors due to random sequence matches. This encourages identification of splicing junctions through computa-tional methods based on machine learning. Existing models are dependent on feature extraction and selection for capturing splicing signals lying in vicinity of splice junctions. But such manually extracted features are not exhaustive. We introduce distributed feature representation, SpliceVec, to avoid explicit and biased feature extraction generally adopted for such tasks. SpliceVec is based on two widely used distributed representation models in natural language processing. Learned feature representation in form of SpliceVec is fed to multi-layer perceptron for splice junction classification task. An intrinsic evaluation of SpliceVec indicates that it is able to group true and false sites distinctly. Our study on optimal context to be considered for feature extraction indicates inclusion of entire intronic sequence to be better than flanking upstream and downstream region around splice junctions. Further, SpliceVec is invariant to canonical and non-canonical splice junction detection. The proposed model is consistent in its performance even with reduced dataset and class-imbalanced dataset. SpliceVec is computationally efficient and can be trained with user defined data as well.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are important contributors to gene regulation. They specifically bind to short DNA stretches known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), which are contained in regulatory regions (e.g. promoters), and thereby influence a target genes expression level. Computational biology has contributed substantially to understanding regulatory regions by developing numerous tools, including for discovering de novo motif. While those tools primarily focus on determining and studying TFBSs, the surrounding sequence context is often given less attention. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by adopting a so-called convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine (cRBM) that captures redundant features from the DNA sequences. The model uses an unsupervised learning approach to derive a rich, yet interpretable, description of the entire sequence context. We evaluated the cRBM on a range of publicly available ChIP-seq peak regions and investigated its capability to summarize heterogeneous sets of regulatory sequences in comparison with MEME-Chip, a popular motif discovery tool. In summary, our method yields a considerably more accurate description of the sequence composition than MEME-Chip, providing both a summary of strong TF motifs as well as subtle low-complexity features.",

    "abstract": "The dependence of life scientists on software has steadily grown in recent years. For many tasks, researchers have to decide which of the available bioinformatics software are more suitable for their specific needs. Additionally researchers should be able to objectively select the software that provides the highest accuracy, the best efficiency and the highest level of reproducibility when integrated in their research projects.\\n\\nCritical benchmarking of bioinformatics methods, tools and web services is therefore an essential community service, as well as a critical component of reproducibility efforts. Unbiased and objective evaluations are challenging to set up and can only be effective when built and implemented around community driven efforts, as demonstrated by the many ongoing community challenges in bioinformatics that followed the success of CASP. Community challenges bring the combined benefits of intense collaboration, transparency and standard harmonization. Only open systems for the continuous evaluation of methods offer a perfect complement to community challenges, offering to larger communities of users that could extend far beyond the community of developers, a window to the developments status that they can use for their specific projects. We understand by continuous evaluation systems as those services which are always available and periodically update their data and/or metrics according to a predefined schedule keeping in mind that the performance has to be always seen in terms of each research domain.\\n\\nWe argue here that technology is now mature to bring community driven benchmarking efforts to a higher level that should allow effective interoperability of benchmarks across related methods. New technological developments allow overcoming the limitations of the first experiences on online benchmarking e.g. EVA. We therefore describe OpenEBench, a novel infra-structure designed to establish a continuous automated benchmarking system for bioinformatics methods, tools and web services.\\n\\nOpenEBench is being developed so as to cater for the needs of the bioinformatics community, especially software developers who need an objective and quantitative way to inform their decisions as well as the larger community of end-users, in their search for unbiased and up-to-date evaluation of bioinformatics methods.

    "abstract": "Inference of demographic history from genetic data is a primary goal of population genetics of model and non-model organisms. Whole genome-based approaches such as the Pairwise/Multiple Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC/MSMC) methods use genomic data from one to four individuals to infer the demographic history of an entire population, while site frequency spectrum (SFS)-based methods use the distribution of allele frequencies in a sample to reconstruct the same historical events. Although both methods are extensively used in empirical studies and perform well on data simulated under simple models, there have been only limited comparisons of them in more complex and realistic settings. Here we use published demographic models based on data from three human populations (Yoruba (YRI), descendants of northwest-Europeans (CEU), and Han Chinese (CHB)) as an empirical test case to study the behavior of both inference procedures. We find that several of the demographic histories inferred by the whole genome-based methods do not predict the genome-wide distribution of heterozygosity nor do they predict the empirical SFS. However, using simulated data, we also find that the whole genome methods can reconstruct the complex demographic models inferred by SFS-based methods, suggesting that the discordant patterns of genetic variation are not attributable to a lack of statistical power, but may reflect unmodeled complexities in the underlying demography. More generally, our findings indicate that demographic inference from a small number of genomes, routine in genomic studies of nonmodel organisms, should be interpreted cautiously, as these models cannot recapitulate other summaries of the data.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. A challenge for diagnosing and assessing the severity of TBI, however, is that quantitative biomarkers are lacking. We explored potential functional indicators for TBI by noninvasively monitoring sensory-evoked electrical and hemodynamic activity using a novel hybrid optical and electrophysiological measurement approach. By combining diffuse correlation spectroscopy with co-localized electrophysiological measurements in a mouse model of TBI, we observed concomitant alterations in somatosensory-evoked cerebral blood flow and electrical potentials following controlled cortical impact. Injury acutely reduced the amplitude of stimulus-evoked responses, which mostly recovered to baseline values within 30 min; intertrial variability for these parameters was also acutely altered. The kinetics of recovery, however, varied among specific components of the evoked waveforms, and we observed strong correlations between the two measurement modalities for only a select subset of waveform parameters. Overall, our results identify a novel set of potential biomarkers for TBI and demonstrate the utility of combined, noninvasive optical and electrophysiological measurements for detecting injury-induced abnormalities in neurovascular reactivity.",

    "abstract": "Reference frame Transformations (RFTs) are crucial components of sensorimotor transformations in the brain. Stochasticity in RFTs has been suggested to add noise to the transformed signal due to variability in transformation parameter estimates (e.g. angle) as well as the stochastic nature of computations in spiking networks of neurons. Here, we varied the RFT angle together with the associated variability and evaluated the behavioral impact in a reaching task that required variability-dependent visual-proprioceptive multi-sensory integration. Crucially, reaches were performed with the head either straight or rolled 30deg to either shoulder and we also applied neck loads of 0 or 1.8kg (left or right) in a 3x3 design, resulting in different combinations of estimated head roll angle magnitude and variance required in RFTs. A novel 3D stochastic model of multi-sensory integration across reference frames was fitted to the data and captured our main behavioral findings: (1) neck load biased head angle estimation across all head roll orientations resulting in systematic shifts in reach errors; (2) Increased neck muscle tone led to increased reach variability, due to signal-dependent noise; (3) both head roll and neck load created larger angular errors in reaches to visual targets away from the body compared to reaches toward the body. These results show that noise in muscle spindles and stochasticity in general have a tangible effect on RFTs underlying reach planning. Since RFTs are omnipresent in the brain, our results could have implication for processes as diverse as motor control, decision making, posture / balance control, and perception.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyWe show that increasing neck muscle tone systematically biases reach movements. A novel 3D multisensory integration across reference frames model captures the data well and provides evidence that the brain must have online knowledge of full body geometry together with the associated variability to accurately plan reach movements.",

    "abstract": "PurposeSedentary behavior has become a public health pandemic and has been associated with a variety of comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. Previous studies have also shown that excessive amount of sedentary behavior is associated with all-cause mortality. However, no studies investigated whether patterns of sedentary and active time accumulation are associated with mortality independently of total sedentary and total active times. This study addresses this question by i) comparing several analytical ways to quantify patterns of both sedentary and active time accumulation through metrics of fragmentation of objectively-measured physical activity and ii) exploring the association of these metrics with all-cause mortality in a nationally representative US sample of elderly adults.\\n\\nMethodsThe accelerometry data of 3400 participants aged 50 to 84 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006 cohorts were analyzed. Ten fragmentation metrics were calculated to quantify the duration of sedentary and active bouts: average bout duration, Gini index, average hazard, between-state transition probability, and the parameter of power law distribution. The association of these fragmentation metrics with all-cause mortality followed through December 31, 2011 was assessed with survey-weighted Cox proportional hazard models.\\n\\nResultsIn models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, common comorbidities, and total sedentary/active time, four fragmentation metrics were associated with lower mortality risk: average active bout duration (HR=0.72 for 1SD increase, 95% CI = 0.590.88), Gini index for active bouts (HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.64-0.86), the parameter of power law distribution for sedentary bouts (HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.63-0.90), and sedentary-to-active transition probability (HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.61-0.96), and four fragmentation metrics were associated with higher mortality risk: the active-to-sedentary transition probability (HR = 1.40, 95% CI=1.23-1.58), the parameter of power law distribution for active bouts (HR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.16-1.52), average hazard for durations of active bouts (HR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.18-1.48), and average sedentary bout duration (HR =1.07, 95% CI = 1.01-1.13). After sensitivity analysis, average sedentary bout duration and sedentary-to-active transition probability became insignificant.\\n\\nConclusionLonger average duration of active bouts, a lower probability of transitioning from active to sedentary behavior, and a higher normalized variability of active bout durations were strongly negatively associated with all-cause mortality independently of total active time. A larger proportion of longer sedentary bouts were positively associated with all-cause mortality independently of total sedentary time. The results also suggested a nonlinear association of average active bout duration with mortality that corresponded to the largest risk increase in subjects with average active bout duration less than 3 minutes.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) were recently discovered as a class of widely expressed noncoding RNA and have been implicated in regulation of gene expression. However, the function of the majority of circRNAs remains unknown. Studies of circRNAs have been hampered by a lack of essential approaches for detection, quantification and visualization. We therefore developed a target-enrichment sequencing method suitable for high-throughput screening of circRNAs and their linear counterparts. We also applied padlock probes and in situ sequencing to visualize and determine circRNAs localization in human brain tissue at subcellular levels. We measured circRNA abundance across different human samples and tissues. Our results demonstrate the potential of this RNA class to act as a specific diagnostic marker in blood and serum, by detection of circRNAs from genes exclusively expressed in the brain. The powerful and scalable tools we present will enable studies of circRNA function and facilitate screening of circRNA as diagnostic biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Human immunity influences the evolution and impact of novel influenza strains. Because individuals are infected with multiple influenza strains during their lifetime and each virus can generate a cross-reactive antibody response, it is challenging to quantify the processes that shape observed immune responses, or to reliably detect recent infection from serological samples. Using a Bayesian model of antibody dynamics at multiple timescales, we explain complex cross-reactive antibody landscapes by inferring participants histories of infection with serological data from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of influenza A/H3N2 in southern China and Vietnam. We show an individuals influenza antibody profile can be explained by a short-lived, broadly cross-reactive response that decays within a year to leave a smaller long-term response acting against a narrower range of strains. We also demonstrate that accounting for dynamic immune responses can provide a more accurate alternative to traditional definitions seroconversion for the estimation of infection attack rates. Our work provides a general model for explaining mechanisms of influenza immunity acting at multiple timescales based on contemporary serological data, and suggests a two-armed immune response to influenza infection consistent with competitive dynamics between B cell populations. This approach to analysing multiple timescales for antigenic responses could also be applied to other multi-strain pathogens such as dengue and related flaviviruses.",

Whole cord blood DNA reflects all nucleated blood cell types, while centrifuging whole blood separates red blood cells by generating a white blood cell buffy coat. Both sample types are used in DNA methylation studies. Cell types have unique methylation patterns and processing can impact cell distributions, which may influence comparability.\\n\\nObjectivesTo evaluate differences in cell composition and DNA methylation between buffy coat and whole cord blood samples.\\n\\nMethodsCord blood DNA methylation was measured with the Infinium EPIC BeadChip (Illumina) in 8 individuals, each contributing buffy coat and whole blood samples. We analyzed principal components (PC) of methylation, performed hierarchical clustering, and computed correlations of mean-centered methylation between pairs. We conducted moderated t-tests on single sites and estimated cell composition.\\n\\nResultsDNA methylation PCs were associated with individual (PPC1=1.4x10-9; PPC2=2.9x10-5; PPC3=3.8x10-5; PPC4=4.2x10-6; PPC5=9.9x10-13), and not with sample type (PPC1-5>0.7). Samples hierarchically clustered by individual. Pearson correlations of mean-centered methylation between paired individual samples ranged from r=0.66 to r=0.87. No individual site significantly differed between buffy coat and whole cord blood when adjusting for multiple comparisons (5 sites had unadjusted P<10-5). Estimated cell type proportions did not differ by sample type (P=0.86), and estimated cell counts were highly correlated between paired samples (r=0.99).\\n\\nConclusionsDifferences in methylation and cell composition between buffy coat and whole cord blood are much lower than inter-individual variation, demonstrating that both sample preparation types can be analytically combined and compared.",

Different adaptors link dynein/dynactin to distinct cargos. Here we use electron microscopy (EM) and single molecule studies to show that adaptors can recruit a second dynein to dynactin. Whereas BICD2 is biased toward recruiting a single dynein, the adaptors BICDR1 and HOOK3 predominantly recruit two. We find that the shift toward a double dynein complex increases both force and speed. A 3.5 [A] cryo-EM reconstruction of a dynein tail/dynactin/BICDR1 complex reveals how dynactin can act as a scaffold to coordinate two dyneins side by side. Our work provides a structural basis for how diverse adaptors recruit different numbers of dyneins and regulate the motile properties of the dynein/dynactin transport machine.",

We aim to elucidate the impact of blood flow on the arrest and the extravasation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in vivo. Using the zebrafish embryo, we show that arrest of CTCs occurs in vessels with favorable flow profiles where flow forces control the adhesion efficacy of CTCs to the endothelium. We biophysically identified the threshold values of flow and adhesion forces allowing successful arrest of CTCs. In addition, flow forces fine-tune tumor cell extravasation by impairing the remodeling properties of the endothelium. Importantly, we also observe endothelial remodeling at arrest sites of CTCs in mouse brain capillaries. Finally, we observed that human supratentorial brain metastases preferably develop in areas with low perfusion. Altogether, these results demonstrate that hemodynamic profiles at metastatic sites regulate key steps of extravasation preceding metastatic outgrowth.",

Interphase nuclei are positioned near the basal surface of the intestinal epithelium, but during mitosis, chromosomes are located apically. The molecular basis for apical-basal DNA positioning and its consequences for tissue homeostasis are poorly understood. Here, we image and pharmacologically perturb these behaviors in live murine intestinal organoids. We find that apical and basal DNA movements occur as a result of mitosis-coupled actin rearrangements that alter the basolateral shape of dividing cells, while the apical cell surface remains confined by cell-cell contacts that persist throughout mitosis. Strikingly, these polarized shape changes allow neighboring cells to insert between nascent daughters, intermingling cells of different lineages. In summary, polarized rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton govern the mitotic behavior of intestinal epithelial cells and lead to interspersion of cell lineages.",

However, AAV serotype specificity data is lacking in cardiac models relevant to optogenetics. We aimed to identify the optimal AAV serotype (1, 6, or 9) in pursuit of scalable rodent and human models for cardiac optogenetics and elucidate the mechanism of virus uptake.\\n\\nMethodsIn vitro syncytia of primary neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs) and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were infected with AAVs 1, 6, and 9 containing the transgene for eGFP or channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) fused to mCherry. In vivo adult rats were intravenously injected with AAV1 and 9 containing ChR2-mCherry.\\n\\nResultsTransgene expression profiles of rat and human cells in vitro revealed that AAV1 and 6 significantly outperformed AAV9. In contrast, systemic delivery of AAV9 in adult rat hearts yielded significantly higher levels of ChR2-mCherry expression and optogenetic responsiveness. We tracked the mechanism of virus uptake to purported receptor-mediators for AAV 1/6 (cell surface sialic acid) and AAV9(37/67kDa laminin receptor, LamR). In vitro desialylation of NRVMs and hiPSC-CMs with neuraminidase significantly decreased AAV1,6-mediated gene expression, but interestingly, desialylation of hiPSC-CMs increased AAV9-mediated expression. In fact, only very high viral doses of AAV9-ChR2-mCherry, combined with neuraminidase treatment yielded consistent optogenetic responsiveness in hiPSC-CMs. Differences between the in vitro and in vivo performance of AAV9 could be correlated to robust LamR expression in the adult and neonatal rat hearts, but no expression in vitro in cultured cells. The dynamic nature of LamR expression and its dependence on environmental factors was further corroborated in intact adult human ventricular tissue slices.\\n\\nConclusionThe combined transgene expression and cell surface receptor data may explain the preferential efficiency of AAV1/6 in vitro and AAV9 in vivo for cardiac delivery and mechanistic knowledge of their action can help guide cardiac optogenetic efforts.",

    "abstract": "With recent advances in sequencing technology, it is now feasible to measure DNA methylation at tens of millions of sites across the entire genome. In most applications, biologists are interested in detecting differentially methylated regions, composed of multiple sites with differing methylation levels among populations. However, current computational approaches for detecting such regions do not provide accurate statistical inference. A major challenge in reporting uncertainty is that a genome-wide scan is involved in detecting these regions, which needs to be accounted for. A further challenge is that sample sizes are limited due to the costs associated with the technology. We have developed a new approach that overcomes these challenges and assesses uncertainty for differentially methylated regions in a rigorous manner. Region-level statistics are obtained by fitting a generalized least squares (GLS) regression model with a nested autoregressive correlated error structure for the effect of interest on transformed methylation proportions. We develop an inferential approach, based on a pooled null distribution, that can be implemented even when as few as two samples per population are available. Here we demonstrate the advantages of our method using both experimental data and Monte Carlo simulation. We find that the new method improves the specificity and sensitivity of list of regions and accurately controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR).",

    "abstract": "Prior RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies have identified complete transcriptomes for most renal epithelial cell types. The exceptions are the cell types that make up the renal collecting duct, namely intercalated cells (ICs) and principal cells (PCs), which account for only a small fraction of the kidney mass, but play critical physiological roles in the regulation of blood pressure, extracellular fluid volume and extracellular fluid composition. To enrich these cell types, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) that employed well established lectin cell surface markers for PCs and type B ICs, as well as a newly identified cell surface marker for type A ICs, viz. c-Kit. Single-cell RNA-Seq using the 1C- and PC-enriched populations as input enabled identification of complete transcriptomes of A-ICs, B-ICs and PCs. The data were used to create a freely-accessible online gene-expression database for collecting duct cells. This database allowed identification of genes that are selectively expressed in each cell type including cell-surface receptors, transcription factors, transporters and secreted proteins. The analysis also identified a small fraction of hybrid cells expressing both aquapor{inverted exclamation}n-2 and either anion exchanger 1 or pendrin transcripts. In many cases, mRNAs for receptors and their ligands were identified in different cells (e.g. Notch2 chiefly in PCs vs Jag1 chiefly in ICs) suggesting signaling crosstalk among the three cell types. The identified patterns of gene expression among the three types of collecting duct cells provide a foundation for understanding physiological regulation and pathophysiology in the renal collecting duct.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTA long-term goal in mammalian biology is to identify the genes expressed in every cell type of the body. In kidney, the expressed genes (\\\"transcriptome\\\") of all epithelial cell types have already been identified with the exception of the cells that make up the renal collecting duct, responsible for regulation of blood pressure and body fluid composition. Here, a technique called \\\"single-cell RNA-Seq\\\" was used in mouse to identify transcriptomes for the major collecting-duct cell types: type A intercalated cells, type B intercalated cells and principal cells. The information was used to create a publicly-accessible online resource. The data allowed identification of genes that are selectively expressed in each cell type, informative for cell-level understanding of physiology and pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "A structural-bioinformatics-based computational methodology and framework have been developed for the design of antibodies to targets of interest. RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD) samples the diverse sequence, structure, and binding space of an antibody to an antigen in highly customizable protocols for the design of antibodies in a broad range of applications. The program samples antibody sequences and structures by grafting structures from a widely accepted set of the canonical clusters of CDRs (North et al., J. Mol. Biol., 406:228-256, 2011). It then performs sequence design according to amino acid sequence profiles of each cluster, and samples CDR backbones using a flexible-backbone design protocol incorporating cluster-based CDR constraints. Starting from an existing experimental or computationally modeled antigen-antibody structure, RAbD can be used to redesign a single CDR or multiple CDRs with loops of different length, conformation, and sequence. We rigorously benchmarked RAbD on a set of 60 diverse antibody-antigen complexes, using two design strategies - optimizing total Rosetta energy and optimizing interface energy alone. We utilized two novel metrics for measuring success in computational protein design. The design risk ratio (DRR) is equal to the frequency of recovery of native CDR lengths and clusters divided by the frequency of sampling of those features during the Monte Carlo design procedure. Ratios greater than 1.0 indicate that the design process is picking out the native more frequently than expected from their sampled rate. We achieved DRRs for the non-H3 CDRs of between 2.4 and 4.0. The antigen risk ratio (ARR) is the ratio of frequencies of the native amino acid types, CDR lengths, and clusters in the output decoys for simulations performed in the presence and absence of the antigen. For CDRs, we achieved cluster ARRs as high as 2.5 for L1 and 1.5 for H2. For sequence design simulations without CDR grafting, the overall recovery for the native amino acid types for residues that contact the antigen in the native structures was 72% in simulations performed in the presence of the antigen and 48% in simulations performed without the antigen, for an ARR of 1.5. For the non-contacting residues, the ARR was 1.08. This shows that the sequence profiles are able to maintain the amino acid types of these conserved, buried sites, while recovery of the exposed, contacting residues requires the presence of the antigen-antibody interface. We tested RAbD experimentally on both a lambda and kappa antibody-antigen complex, successfully improving their affinities 10 to 50 fold by replacing individual CDRs of the native antibody with new CDR lengths and clusters.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAntibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to attack infections and cancer and are also used as drugs to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. The mechanism that has evolved to produce them is able to make 10s of millions of different antibodies, each with a different surface used to bind the foreign or mutated molecule. We have developed a method to design antibodies computationally, based on the 1000s of experimentally determined three-dimensional structures of antibodies available. The method works by treating pieces of these structures as a collection of parts that can be combined in new ways to make better antibodies. Our method has been implemented in the protein modeling program Rosetta, and is called RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD). We tested RAbD both computationally and experimentally. The experimental test shows that we can improve existing antibodies by 10 to 50 fold, paving the way for design of entirely new antibodies in the future.",

    "abstract": "While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered thousands of risk loci for heritable disorders, so far even very large meta-analyses have recovered only a fraction of the heritability of most complex traits. Recent work utilizing variance components models has demonstrated that a larger fraction of the heritability of complex phenotypes is captured by the additive effects of SNPs than is evident only in loci surpassing genome-wide significance thresholds, typically set at a Bonferroni-inspired p [&le;] 5 x 10-8. Procedures that control false discovery rate can be more powerful, yet these are still under-powered to detect the majority of non-null effects from GWAS. The current work proposes a novel Bayesian semi-parametric two-group mixture model and develops a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for a covariate-modulated local false discovery rate (cmfdr). The probability of being non-null depends on a set of covariates via a logistic function, and the non-null distribution is approximated as a linear combination of B-spline densities, where the weight of each B-spline density depends on a multinomial function of the covariates. The proposed methods were motivated by work on a large meta-analysis of schizophrenia GWAS performed by the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC). We show that the new cmfdr model fits the PGC schizophrenia GWAS test statistics well, performing better than our previously proposed parametric gamma model for estimating the non-null density and substantially improving power over usual fdr. Using loci declared significant at cmfdr [&le;] 0.20, we perform follow-up pathway analyses using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) homo sapiens pathways database. We demonstrate that the increased yield from the cmfdr model results in an improved ability to test for pathways associated with schizophrenia compared to using those SNPs selected according to usual fdr.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMetagenomic approaches became increasingly popular in the past decades due to decreasing costs of DNA sequencing and bioinformatics development. So far, however, the recovery of long genes coding for secondary metabolism still represents a big challenge. Often, the quality of metagenome assemblies is poor, especially in environments with a high microbial diversity where sequence coverage is low and complexity of natural communities high. Recently, new and improved algorithms for binning environmental reads and contigs have been developed to overcome such limitations. Some of these algorithms use a similarity detection approach to classify the obtained reads into taxonomical units and to assemble draft genomes. This approach, however, is quite limited since it can classify exclusively sequences similar to those available (and well classified) in the databases.\\n\\nIn this work, we used draft genomes from Lake Stechlin, north-eastern Germany, recovered by MetaBat, an efficient binning tool that integrates empirical probabilistic distances of genome abundance, and tetranucleotide frequency for accurate metagenome binning. These genomes were screened for secondary metabolism genes, such as polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS), using the Anti-SMASH and NAPDOS workflows.\\n\\nResultsWith this approach we were able to identify 243 secondary metabolite clusters from 121 genomes recovered from the lake samples. A total of 18 NRPS, 19 PKS and 3 hybrid PKS/NRPS clusters were found. In addition, it was possible to predict the partial structure of several secondary metabolite clusters allowing for taxonomical classifications and phylogenetic inferences.\\n\\nConclusionsOur approach revealed a great potential to recover and study secondary metabolites genes from any aquatic ecosystem.",

Traditional methods of protein depletion are often slow-acting, which can be problematic when characterizing a cellular process that occurs within a short period of time. Furthermore, these methods are usually not reversible. Recent advances to achieve protein depletion function by inducibly trafficking proteins of interest to an endogenous E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to promote ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. One of these systems, the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system, has been shown to permit rapid and inducible degradation of AID-tagged target proteins in mammalian cells. The AID system can control the abundance of a diverse set of cellular proteins, including those contained within protein complexes, and is active in all phases of the cell cycle. Here we discuss considerations for the successful implementation of the AID system and describe a protocol using CRISPR/Cas9 to achieve bi-allelic insertion of an AID degron in human cells. This method can also be adapted to insert other tags, such as fluorescent proteins, at defined genomic locations.",

Of the several approaches that are used to analyze trait-environment relationships, one of the most popular is community-weighted means (CWM), in which species trait values are averaged at the site level. Other approaches that do not require averaging are being developed, including multilevel models (MLM, also called generalized linear mixed models). However, relative strengths and weaknesses of these methods have not been extensively compared.\\nC_LIO_LIWe investigated three statistical models for trait-environment associations: CWM, a MLM in which traits were not included as fixed effects (MLM1), and a MLM with traits as fixed effects (MLM2). We analyzed a real plant community dataset to investigate associations between two traits and one environmental variable. We then analyzed permutations of the dataset to investigate sources of type I errors, and performed a simulation study to compare the statistical power of the methods.\\nC_LIO_LIIn the analysis of real data, CWM gave highly significant associations for both traits, while MLM1 and MLM2 did not. Using P-values derived by simulating the data using the fitted MLM2, none of the models gave significant associations, showing that CWM had inflated type I errors (false positives). In the permutation tests, MLM2 performed the best of the three approaches. MLM2 still had inflated type I error rates in some situations, but this could be corrected using bootstrapping. The simulation study showed that MLM2 always had as good or better power than CWM. These simulations also confirmed the causes of type I errors from the permutation study.\\nC_LIO_LIThe MLM that includes main effects of traits (MLM2) is the best method for identifying trait-environmental association in community assembly, with better type I error control and greater power. Analyses that regress CWMs on continuous environmental variables are not reliable because they are likely to produce type I errors.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A common experimental approach for studying signal transduction networks (STNs) is to measure the steady state concentrations of their components following perturbations to individual components. Such data is frequently used to reconstruct topological models of STNs, but, are rarely used for calibrating kinetic models of these networks. This is because, existing calibration algorithms operate by assigning different sets of values to the parameters of the kinetic models, and for each set of values simulating all perturbations performed in the biochemical experiments. This process is highly computation intensive and may be infeasible when molecular level information of the perturbation experiments is unavailable. Here, I propose an algorithm which can calibrate ordinary differential equation (ODE) based kinetic models of STNs using steady-state perturbation responses (SSPRs) without simulating perturbation experiments. The proposed algorithm uses modular response analysis (MRA) to calculate the scaled Jacobian matrix of the ODE model of an STN using SSPR data. The model parameters are then calibrated to fit the scaled Jacobian matrix calculated in the above step. This procedure does not require simulating the perturbation experiments. Therefore, it is significantly less computation intensive than existing algorithms and can be implemented without molecular level knowledge of the mechanism of perturbations. It is also parallelizable, i.e. can explore multiple sets of parameter values simultaneously, and therefore is scalable. The capabilities and shortcomings of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated using both simulated and real perturbation responses of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) STN.\\n\\nAvailabilityAll source codes and data needed to replicate the results in this manuscript are available from https://github.com/SBIUCD/MRA_SMC_ABC1",

Commitment of a certain mass fraction of the proteome to a specific cellular function, typically reduces the proteome available for other cellular functions. Here, we develop a minimal semi-quantitative kinetic model of cyanobacterial phototrophic growth to describe such trade-offs of cellular protein allocation. The model is based on coarse-grained descriptions of key cellular processes, in particular carbon uptake, metabolism, photosynthesis, and protein translation. The model is parametrized using literature data and experimentally obtained growth curves. Of particular interest are the resulting cyanobacterial growth laws as fundamental characteristics of cellular growth. We show that the model gives rise to similar growth laws as observed for heterotrophic organisms, with several important differences due to the distinction between light energy and carbon uptake. We discuss recent experimental data supporting the model results and show that minimal growth models have implications for our understanding of the limits of phototrophic growth and bridge a gap between molecular physiology and ecology.",

    "abstract": "Regulations designed to guide development practices inadequately reflect ecological understanding and fall short of preserving viable habitats. Environmental consultants use rapid assessments and monitoring on individual ponds to rank pond habitat quality, relying on coarse proxies, including vegetative indicators, soil characteristics, hydroperiod, and breeding evidence in obligate species. Planners incorporate these rankings to inform the layout of neighborhoods, roadways, infrastructure and housing. However, important drivers of amphibian survival and fecundity--including metapopulation dynamics, habitat connectivity, watershed health, terrestrial density dependence, and environmental gradients--are often poorly measured and regulated. Given that development proceeds regardless, what options exists improve land development practices?\\n\\nIntegrating experimentation into the planning process can inform land development and improve amphibian conservation. Working as part of the design team we employed an adaptive approach called designed experiment to inform development practices. We manipulated Ambystoma opacum larvae within enclosures to test the effects of inter-pond conditions (versus intra-pond density dependence) on the survival and fecundity of conspecifics, Rana sylvatica and Ambystoma maculatum. While the A. maculatum populations were decimated with only 1.5 % survival. For A. opacum and R. sylvatica results indicate habitat variation between ponds accounted for 63.7% and 50.3% of the variance in survival rates of larvae, respectively, and are not predicted by the presence and abundance of egg masses, while density effects accounted for 3.5% and 2.8% of the variation in survival. The results suggest that ponds ranked as high value based on egg mass counts may actually function as habitat sinks. This study illustrates the potential value of assessment approaches that emphasize habitat quality across pond clusters to guide mitigation, conservation, regulations, and to establish sites and funding for ecological research.",

    "abstract": "Human T cells are central to physiological immune homeostasis, which protects us from pathogens without collateral autoimmune inflammation. They are also the main effectors in most current cancer immunotherapy strategies1. Several decades of work have aimed to genetically reprogram T cells for therapeutic purposes2-5, but as human T cells are resistant to most standard methods of large DNA insertion these approaches have relied on recombinant viral vectors, which do not target transgenes to specific genomic sites6, 7. In addition, the need for viral vectors has slowed down research and clinical use as their manufacturing and testing is lengthy and expensive. Genome editing brought the promise of specific and efficient insertion of large transgenes into target cells through homology-directed repair (HDR), but to date in human T cells this still requires viral transduction8, 9. Here, we developed a non-viral, CRISPR-Cas9 genome targeting system that permits the rapid and efficient insertion of individual or multiplexed large (>1 kilobase) DNA sequences at specific sites in the genomes of primary human T cells while preserving cell viability and function. We successfully tested the potential therapeutic use of this approach in two settings. First, we corrected a pathogenic IL2RA mutation in primary T cells from multiple family members with monogenic autoimmune disease and demonstrated enhanced signalling function. Second, we replaced the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) locus with a new TCR redirecting T cells to a cancer antigen. The resulting TCR-engineered T cells specifically recognized the tumour antigen, with concomitant cytokine release and tumour cell killing. Taken together, these studies provide preclinical evidence that non-viral genome targeting will enable rapid and flexible experimental manipulation and therapeutic engineering of primary human immune cells.",

The molecular underpinnings of poor recovery of aging muscle following disuse remain largely unknown. However, recent evidence suggests that mitochondrial energetics may play an important role. Here, we report that 22-24 month old mice with low muscle mass and insulin resistance display poor early recovery of muscle mass following 10 days of hind limb unloading. We took an unbiased approach to identify changes in energy metabolism gene expression and metabolite pools and show for the first time that persistent mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated fatty acid {beta}-oxidation and elevated H2O2 emission underlie poor early recovery of muscle mass following a period of disuse in old mice. Importantly, this is linked to more severe whole-body insulin resistance. The findings suggest that muscle fuel metabolism and mitochondrial energetics should be a focus for mining therapeutic targets to improve recovery of muscle mass following periods of disuse in older animals.",
