    "abstract": "Sequence logos are frequently used for presenting consensus sequences and motifs of nucleic acids and proteins. WebLogo of UC Berkeley is the most popular tool for creating sequence logos, whereas, it is often restricted by the internet speed in some developing countries and no graphic interface for its stand-alone version. Here, the author generated an application, DNAlogo, using VB.net, which runs in Windows system. DNAlogo is small and convenient. It creates both bitmap and vector map. Beside the classic sequence logo function, DNAlogo introduced compensated logo to generate consensus sequences considering different GC contents of different genomes. DNAlogo provides a simple way for researchers without programming knowledge to create DNA sequence logos.",

    "abstract": "Advances in tissue clearing and molecular labelling methods are enabling unprecedented optical access to large intact biological systems. These advances fuel the need for high-speed microscopy approaches to image large samples quantitatively and at high resolution. While Light Sheet Microscopy (LSM), with its high planar imaging speed and low photo-bleaching, can be effective, scaling up to larger imaging volumes has been hindered by the use of orthogonal light-sheet illumination. To address this fundamental limitation, we have developed Light Sheet Theta Microscopy (LSTM), which uniformly illuminates samples from same side as the detection objective, thereby eliminating limits on lateral dimensions without sacrificing imaging resolution, depth and speed. We present detailed characterization of LSTM, and show that this approach achieves rapid high-resolution imaging of large intact samples with superior uniform high-resolution than LSM. LSTM is a significant step in high-resolution quantitative mapping of structure and function of large intact biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Cancer evolution and progression are shaped by cellular interactions and Darwinian selection. Evolutionary game theory incorporates both of these principles, and has been proposed as a framework to understand tumor cell population dynamics. A cornerstone of evolutionary dynamics is the replicator equation, which describes changes in the relative abundance of different cell types, and is able to predict evolutionary equilibria. Typically, the replicator equation focuses on differences in relative fitness. We here show that this framework might not be sufficient under all circumstances, as it neglects important aspects of population growth. Standard replicator dynamics might miss critical differences in the time it takes to reach an equilibrium, as this time also depends on cellular turnover in growing but bounded populations. As the system reaches a stable manifold, the time to reach equilibrium depends on cellular death and birth rates. These rates shape the timescales, in particular in co-evolutionary dynamics of growth factor producers and free-riders. Replicator dynamics might be an appropriate framework only when birth and death rates are of similar magnitude. Otherwise, population growth effects cannot be neglected when predicting the time to reach an equilibrium, and cell type specific rates have to be accounted for explicitly.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed an exponential growth in the number of identified interactions between biological molecules. These interactions are usually represented as large and complex networks, calling for the development of appropriated tools to exploit the functional information they contain. Random walk with restart is the state-of-the-art guilt-by-association approach. It explores the network vicinity of gene/protein seeds to study their functions, based on the premise that nodes related to similar functions tend to lie close to each others in the networks.\\n\\nIn the present study, we extended the random walk with restart algorithm to multiplex and heterogeneous networks. The walk can now explore different layers of physical and functional interactions between genes and proteins, such as protein-protein interactions and co-expression associations. In addition, the walk can also jump to a network containing different sets of edges and nodes, such as phenotype similarities between diseases.\\n\\nWe devised a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy to evaluate the algorithms abilities to predict disease-associated genes. We demonstrate the increased performances of the multiplex-heterogeneous random walk with restart as compared to several random walks on monoplex or heterogeneous networks. Overall, our framework is able to leverage the different interaction sources to outperform current approaches.\\n\\nFinally, we applied the algorithm to predict genes candidate for being involved in the Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome, and to explore the network vicinity of the SHORT syndrome.\\n\\nThe source code and the software are freely available at: https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/RWR-MH.",

Here we report an experimental system that allows for stable patch-clamp recording in the presence of US at 43 MHz, a frequency known to stimulate neural activity. We describe the effects of US on two ion channels proposed to be involved in the response of excitable cells to US: the mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel and the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2. Our patch-clamp recordings, together with finite-element simulations of acoustic field parameters indicate that Piezo1 channels are activated by continuous wave US at 43 MHz and 50 or 90 W/cm2 through cell membrane stress caused by acoustic streaming. NaV1.2 channels were not affected through this mechanism at these intensities, but their kinetics could be accelerated by US-induced heating.",

    "abstract": "Measures of general deleteriousness, like CADD or PolyPhen, have become indispensable tools in the interpretation of genetic variants. However, these measures say little about where in the organism these deleterious effects will be most apparent. An additional, complementary measure is needed to link deleterious variants (as determined by e.g., CADD) to tissues in which their effect will be most meaningful. Here, we introduce TiSAn (Tissue Specific Annotation), a tool that predicts how related a genomic position is to a given tissue (http://github.com/kevinVervier/TiSAn). TiSAn uses machine learning on genome-scale, tissue-specific data to discriminate variants relevant to a tissue from those having no bearing on the development or function of that tissue. Predictions are then made genome-wide, and these scores can then be used to contextualize and filter variants of interest in whole genome sequencing or genome wide association studies (GWAS). We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of TiSAn by introducing predictive models for human heart and human brain, and detecting tissue-relevant variations in large cohorts for autism spectrum disorder (TiSAn-brain) and coronary artery disease (TiSAn-heart). We find that TiSAn is better able to prioritize genetic variants according to their tissue-specific action than the current state of the art method, GenoSkyLine.",

    "abstract": "Many non-coding regulatory elements conserved in vertebrates regulate the expression of genes involved in development and play an important role in the evolution of morphology through the rewiring of developmental gene networks. Available biological datasets allow the identification of non-coding regulatory elements with high confidence; furthermore, chromatin conformation data can be used to confirm enhancer-promoter interactions in specific tissue types and developmental stages. We have devised an analysis pipeline that integrates datasets about gene expression, enhancer activity, chromatin accessibility, epigenetic marks, and Hi-C contact frequencies in various brain tissues and developmental stages, leading to the identification of eight non-coding elements that might regulate the expression of three genes with important roles in brain development in vertebrates. We have then performed comparative sequence and microsynteny analyses in order to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the regulatory landscape around these genes; we observe a general pattern of ancient regulatory elements conserved across most vertebrate lineages, together with younger elements that appear to be mammal and primate innovations.

    "abstract": "The inter-areal wiring pattern of mouse cerebral cortex was analyzed in relation to an accurate parcellation of cortical areas. Twenty-seven retrograde tracer injections were made in 19 areas of a 41 area (plus 7 sub-area) parcellation of the mouse neo-, parahippocampal and perirhinal cortex. Flat mounts of the cortex and multiple histological markers enabled detailed counts of labeled neurons in individual areas. A weight index was determined for each area-to-area pathway based on the Fraction of Extrinsically Labeled Neurons (FLNe). Data analysis allowed cross species comparison with the macaque. Estimation of FLNe statistical variability based on repeat injections revealed high consistency across individuals and justifies using a single injection per area to characterize connectivity. The observed lognormal distribution of connections to each cortical area spanned 5 orders of magnitude and revealed a distinct connectivity profile for each area, analogous to that observed in macaque. The resulting graph has a density of 97% (i.e. 97% of connections that can exist do exist), considerably higher than the 66% density reported for the macaque. Our results provide more sharply defined connectivity profiles and a markedly higher graph density than shown in a recent probabilistic mouse connectome.",

Here, we use whole-genome sequencing of 2,778 tumour samples from 2,658 donors to reconstruct the life history, evolution of mutational processes, and driver mutation sequences of 39 cancer types. The early phases of oncogenesis are driven by point mutations in a small set of driver genes, often including biallelic inactivation of tumour suppressors. Early oncogenesis is also characterised by specific copy number gains, such as trisomy 7 in glioblastoma or isochromosome 17q in medulloblastoma. By contrast, increased genomic instability, a nearly four-fold diversification of driver genes, and an acceleration of point mutation processes are features of later stages. Copy-number alterations often occur in mitotic crises leading to simultaneous gains of multiple chromosomal segments. Timing analysis suggests that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many years, and in some cases decades, providing a window of opportunity for early cancer detection.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are sentinel cells essential for tissue homeostasis and host defence. Owing to their plasticity, macrophages acquire a range of functional phenotypes in response to microenvironmental stimuli, of which M(IFN-{gamma}) and M(IL-4/IL-13) are well-known for their opposing pro- and anti-inflammatory roles. Enhancers have emerged as regulatory DNA elements crucial for transcriptional activation of gene expression. Using cap analysis of gene expression and epigenetic data, we identify on large-scale transcribed enhancers in mouse macrophages, their time kinetics and target protein-coding genes. We observe an increase in target gene expression, concomitant with increasing numbers of associated enhancers and find that genes associated to many enhancers show a shift towards stronger enrichment for macrophage-specific biological processes. We infer enhancers that drive transcriptional responses of genes upon M(IFN-{gamma}) and M(IL-4/IL-13) macrophage activation and demonstrate stimuli-specificity of regulatory associations. Finally, we show that enhancer regions are enriched for binding sites of inflammation-related transcription factors, suggesting a link between stimuli response and enhancer transcriptional control. Our study provides new insights into genome-wide enhancer-mediated transcriptional control of macrophage genes, including those implicated in macrophage activation, and offers a detailed genome-wide catalogue to further elucidate enhancer regulation in macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Fear extinction involves the formation of a new memory trace that attenuates fear responses to a conditioned aversive memory, and extinction impairments are implicated in trauma- and stress-related disorders. Previous studies in rodents have found that the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IL) and its glutamatergic projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and basomedial amygdala (BMA) instruct the formation of fear extinction memories. However, it is unclear whether these pathways are exclusively involved in extinction, or whether other major targets of the IL, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) also play a role. To address this outstanding issue, the current study employed a combination of electrophysiological and chemogenetic approaches in mice to interrogate the role of IL-BLA and IL-NAc pathways in extinction. Specifically, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology coupled with retrograde tracing to examine changes in neuronal activity of the IL and prelimbic cortex (PL) projections to both the BLA and NAc following fear extinction. We found that extinction produced a significant increase in the intrinsic excitability of IL-BLA projection neurons, while extinction appeared to reverse fear induced changes in IL-NAc projection neurons. To establish a causal counterpart to these observations, we then used a pathway-specific Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) strategy to selectively inhibit PFC-BLA projection neurons during extinction acquisition. Using this approach, we found that DREADD-mediated inhibition of PFC-BLA neurons during extinction acquisition impaired subsequent extinction retrieval. Taken together, our findings provide further evidence for a critical contribution of the IL-BLA neural circuit to fear extinction.",

Here, we devised a highthroughput assay to quantify the activity of [~]15,000 fully designed core promoters that we integrated and expressed from a fixed location within the human genome. We find that core promoters drive transcription unidirectionally, and that sequences originating from promoters exhibit stronger activity than sequences originating from enhancers. Testing multiple combinations and distances of core promoter elements, we observe a positive effect of TATA and Initiator, a negative effect of BREu and BREd, and a 10bp periodicity in the optimal distance between the TATA and the Initiator. By comprehensively screening TF binding-sites, we show that site orientation has little effect, that the effect of binding site number on expression is factor-specific, and that there is a striking agreement between the effect of binding site multiplicity in our assay and the tendency of the TF to appear in homotypic clusters throughout the genome. Overall, our results systematically assay the elements that drive expression in core- and proximal-promoter regions and shed light on organization principles of regulatory regions in the human genome.",

Its key input is the fundamental diagram for bi-directional flows, i.e. the relation between the pedestrian fluxes and densities. We design and run a laboratory experiments involving a total of 119 participants walking in opposite directions in a circular corridor and show that the model is able to accurately capture the experimental data in a typical crowd forecasting situation. Finally, we propose a simple segregation strategy for enhancing the traffic efficiency, and use the BM model to determine the conditions under which this strategy would be beneficial. The BM model, therefore, could serve as a building block to develop on the fly prediction of crowd movements and help deploying real-time crowd optimization strategies.",

We do not fully understand what types of complex mutation occur, and we cannot routinely characterize arbitrarily-complex mutations in a high-throughput, genome-wide manner. Long-read DNA sequencing methods (e.g. PacBio, nanopore) are promising for this task, because one read may encompass a whole complex mutation. We describe an analysis pipeline to characterize arbitrarily-complex \\\"local\\\" mutations, i.e. intrachromosomal mutations encompassed by one DNA read. We apply it to nanopore and PacBio reads from one human cell line (NA12878), and survey sequence rearrangements, both real and artifactual. Almost all the real rearrangements belong to recurring patterns or motifs: the most common is tandem multiplication (e.g. heptuplication), but there are also complex patterns such as localized shattering, which resembles DNA damage by radiation. Gene conversions are identified, including one between hemoglobin gamma genes. This study demonstrates a way to find intricate rearrangements with any number of duplications, deletions, and repositionings. It demonstrates a probability-based method to resolve ambiguous rearrangements involving highly similar sequences, as occurs in gene conversion. We present a catalog of local rearrangements in one human cell line, and show which rearrangement patterns occur.",

The melt curve data derived from amplicons of genome-edited or unmodified target sites were processed to remove the background fluorescent signal emanating from free fluorophore and then corrected for temperature-dependent quenching of fluorescence of double-stranded DNA-bound fluorophore. Corrected data were normalized and numerically differentiated to obtain the first derivatives of the melt curves. These were then mathematically modeled as a sum or superposition of minimal number of Gaussian components. Using Gaussian parameters determined by modeling of melt curve derivatives of unedited samples, we were able to model melt curve derivatives from genetically altered target sites where the mutant population could be accommodated using an additional Gaussian component. From this, the proportion contributed by the mutant component in the target region amplicon could be accurately determined. Mutant component computations compared well with the mutant frequency determination from next generation sequencing data. The results were also consistent with our earlier studies that used difference curve areas from high-resolution melt curves for determining the efficiency of genome-editing reagents. The advantage of the described method is that it does not require calibration curves to estimate proportion of mutants in amplicons of genome-edited target sites.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGenome editing has been revolutionized by the engineering of molecular scissors that cut DNA at a predetermined location on the chromosome. When these molecular scissors are expressed within cells, these scissors cut the genomic DNA at the designated target site, and the cells respond by repairing the cut sites. This repair process frequently introduces mutations at the target cut site. The more efficient the molecular scissors, the more number of cells in a treated culture dish exhibit these mutations at the cut site. Investigators therefore design several molecular scissors targeting the same region on the chromosome to identify the best ones. We describe a new recipe to measure scissors efficiency in target site cutting.",

    "abstract": "The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (syn. Pyricularia oryzae) is both a threat to global food security and a model for plant pathology. Molecular pathologists need an accurate understanding of the origins and line of descent of M. oryzae populations, to identify the genetic and functional bases of pathogen adaptation, and to guide the development of more effective control strategies. We used a whole-genome sequence analysis of samples from different times and places to infer details about the genetic makeup of M. oryzae from a global collection of isolates. Analyses of population structure identified six lineages within M. oryzae, including two pandemic on japonica and indica rice, respectively, and four lineages with more restricted distributions. Tip-dating calibration indicated that M. oryzae lineages separated about a millenium ago, long after the initial domestication of rice. The major lineage endemic to continental Southeast Asia displayed signatures of sexual recombination and evidence of DNA acquisition from multiple lineages. Tests for weak natural selection revealed that the pandemic spread of clonal lineages entailed an evolutionary  cost, in terms of the accumulation of deleterious mutations. Our findings reveal the coexistence of multiple endemic and pandemic lineages with contrasting population and genetic characteristics within a widely distributed pathogen.\\n\\nImportanceThe rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (syn. Pyricularia oryzae) is a textbook example of a rapidly adapting pathogen, and is responsible for one of the most damaging diseases of rice. Improvements in our understanding of Magnaporthe oryzae diversity and evolution are required, to guide the development of more effective control strategies. We used genome sequencing data for samples from around the world to infer the evolutionary history of M. oryzae. We found that M. oryzae diversified about a thousand years ago ago, separating into six main lineages: two pandemic on japonica and indica rice, respectively, and four with more restricted distributions. We also found that a lineage endemic to continental Southeast Asia displayed signatures of sexual recombination and the acquisition of genetic material from multiple lineages. This work provides a population-level genomic framework for defining molecular markers for the control of rice blast and investigations of the molecular basis of differences in pathogenicity between M. oryzae lineages.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerve damage initiates a complex series of cellular and structural processes that culminate in chronic neuropathic pain. Our study defines local angiotensin signaling via activation of the Angiotensin II (Ang II) type-2 receptor (AT2R) on macrophages as the critical trigger of neuropathic pain. An AT2R-selective antagonist attenuates neuropathic, but not inflammatory pain hypersensitivity in mice, and requires the cell damage-sensing ion channel transient receptor potential family-A member-1 (TRPA1). Mechanical and cold pain hypersensitivity that are characteristic of neuropathic conditions can be attenuated by chemogenetic depletion of peripheral macrophages and AT2R-null hematopoietic cell transplantation. Our findings show no AT2R expression in mouse or human sensory neurons, rather AT2R expression and activation in macrophages triggers production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which trans-activate TRPA1 on sensory neurons. Our study defines the precise neuro-immune crosstalk underlying nociceptor sensitization at the site of nerve injury. This form of cell-to-cell signaling represents a critical peripheral mechanism for chronic neuropathic pain, and therefore identifies multiple analgesic targets.",

    "abstract": "Foliar uptake of water from the surface of leaves is common when rainfall is scarce and non-meteoric water such as dew or fog is more abundant. However, many species in more mesic environments have hydrophobic leaves that do not allow the plant to uptake water. Unlike foliar uptake, all species can benefit from dew- or fog-induced transpiration suppression, but despite its ubiquity, transpiration suppression has so far never been quantified. Here, we investigate the effect of dew-induced transpiration suppression on the water balance and the isotope composition of leaves via a series of experiments. Characteristically hydrophobic leaves of a tropical plant, Colocasia esculenta, are misted with isotopically enriched water to reproduce dew deposition. This species does not uptake water from the surface of its leaves. We measure leaf water isotopes and water potential and find that misted leaves exhibit a higher water potential (p < 0.05) and a more depleted water isotope composition than dry leaves (p < 0.001), suggesting a ~30% decrease in transpiration rate (p < 0.001) compared to control leaves. We propose three possible mechanisms governing the interaction of water droplets with leaf energy balance: increase in albedo from the presence of dew droplets, decrease in leaf temperature from the evaporation of dew, and local decrease in vapor pressure deficit. Comparing previous studies on foliar uptake to our results, we conclude that transpiration suppression has an effect of similar amplitude, yet opposite sign to foliar uptake on leaf water isotopes.",

These data provide a principled means of assigning molecular functions to autoimmune and cardiovascular disease risk variants, linking hundreds of noncoding variants to putative gene targets.

    "abstract": "Many models of cognition and of neural computations posit the use and estimation of prior stimulus statistics1-4: it has long been known that working memory and perception are strongly impacted by previous sensory experience, even when that sensory history is irrelevant for the current task at hand. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms and brain regions necessary for computing and using such priors are unknown. Here we report that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a critical locus for the representation and use of prior stimulus information. We trained rats in an auditory Parametric Working Memory (PWM) task, and found that rats displayed substantial and readily quantifiable behavioral effects of sensory stimulus history, similar to those observed in humans5,6 and monkeys7. Earlier proposals that PPC supports working memory8,9 predict that optogenetic silencing of this region would impair behavior in our working memory task. Contrary to this prediction, silencing PPC significantly improved performance. Quantitative analyses of behavior revealed that this improvement was due to the selective reduction of the effects of prior sensory stimuli. Electrophysiological recordings showed that PPC neurons carried far more information about sensory stimuli of previous trials than about stimuli of the current trial. Furthermore, the more information about previous trial sensory history in the neural firing rates of a given rats PPC, the greater the behavioral effect of sensory history in that rat, suggesting a tight link between behavior and PPC representations of stimulus history. Our results indicate that the PPC is a central component in the processing of sensory stimulus history, and open a window for neurobiological investigation of long-standing questions regarding how perception and working memory are affected by prior sensory information.",

    "abstract": "Biological systems reach organizational complexity that far exceeds the complexity of any known inanimate objects. Biological entities undoubtedly obey the laws of quantum physics and statistical mechanics. However, is modern physics sufficient to adequately describe, model and explain the evolution of biological complexity? Detailed parallels have been drawn between statistical thermodynamics and the population-genetic theory of biological evolution. Based on these parallels, we outline new perspectives on biological innovation and major transitions in evolution, and introduce a biological equivalent of thermodynamic potential that reflects the innovation propensity of an evolving population. Deep analogies have been suggested to also exist between the properties of biological entities and processes, and those of frustrated states in physics, such as glasses. Such systems are characterized by frustration whereby local state with minimal free energy conflict with the global minimum, resulting in \\\"emergent phenomena\\\". We extend such analogies by examining frustration-type phenomena, such as conflicts between different levels of selection, in biological evolution. These frustration effects appear to drive the evolution of biological complexity. We further address evolution in multidimensional fitness landscapes from the point of view of percolation theory and suggest that percolation at level above the critical threshold dictates the tree-like evolution of complex organisms. Taken together, these multiple connections between fundamental processes in physics and biology imply that construction of a meaningful physical theory of biological evolution might not be a futile effort. However, it is unrealistic to expect that such a theory can be created in one scoop; if it ever comes to being, this can only happen through integration of multiple physical models of evolutionary processes. Furthermore, the existing framework of theoretical physics is unlikely to suffice for adequate modeling of the biological level of complexity, and new developments within physics itself are likely to be required.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in quantitative ChIP-seq is the normalisation of data in the presence of genome-wide changes in occupancy. Analysis-based normalisation methods were developed for transcriptomic data and these are dependent on the underlying assumption that total transcription does not change between conditions. For genome-wide changes in transcription factor binding, these assumptions do not hold true. The challenges in normalisation are confounded by experimental variability during sample preparation, processing, and recovery.\\n\\nWe present a novel normalisation strategy utilising an internal standard of unchanged peaks for reference. Our method can be readily applied to monitor genome-wide changes by ChIP-seq that are otherwise lost or misrepresented through analytical normalisation. We compare our approach to normalisation by total read depth and two alternative methods that utilise external experimental controls to study transcription factor binding. We successfully resolve the key challenges in quantitative ChIP-seq analysis and demonstrate its application by monitoring the loss of Estrogen Receptor-alpha (ER) binding upon fulvestrant treatment, ER binding in response to estrodiol, ER mediated change in H4K12 acetylation and profiling ER binding in Patient-Derived Xenographs. This is supported by an adaptable pipeline to normalise and quantify differential transcription factor binding genome-wide and generate metrics for differential binding at individual sites.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=151 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/182261_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (46K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@177285borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fa7d79org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@43d17forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6eff8d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGRAPHICAL ABSTRACTC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "As the time and cost of sequencing decrease, the number of available genomes and transcriptomes rapidly increases. Yet the quality of the assemblies and the gene annotations varies considerably and often remains poor, affecting downstream analyses. This is particularly true when fragments of the same gene are annotated as distinct genes and consequently wrongly appear as paralogs. In this study, we introduce two novel phylogenetic tests to infer non-overlapping or partially overlapping genes that are in fact parts of the same gene. One approach collapses branches with low bootstrap support and the other computes a likelihood ratio test. We extensively validated these methods by 1) introducing and recovering fragmentation on the bread wheat, Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring, chromosome 3B; 2) by applying the methods to the low-quality 3B assembly and validating predictions against the high-quality 3B assembly; and 3) by comparing the performance of the proposed methods to the performance of existing methods, namely Ensembl Compara and ESPRIT. Application of this combination to a draft shotgun assembly of the entire bread wheat genome revealed 1221 pairs of genes which are highly likely to be fragments of the same gene. Our approach demonstrates the power of fine-grained evolutionary inferences across multiple species to improving genome assemblies and annotations.

Plant pathogens deliver effectors both into the apoplast and inside host cells, but no computational method currently exists to discriminate between these localizations.

ApoplastP uncovers features for apoplastic localization common to both effectors and plant proteins, namely an enrichment in small amino acids and cysteines as well as depletion in glutamic acid. ApoplastP predicts apoplastic localization in effectors with sensitivity of 75% and false positive rate of 5%, improving accuracy of cysteine-rich classifiers by over 13%. ApoplastP does not depend on the presence of a signal peptide and correctly predicts the localization of unconventionally secreted plant and effector proteins. The secretomes of fungal saprophytes, necrotrophic pathogens and extracellular pathogens are enriched for predicted apoplastic proteins. Rust pathogen secretomes have the lowest percentage of apoplastic proteins, but these are highly enriched for predicted effectors. ApoplastP pioneers apoplastic localization prediction using machine learning. It will facilitate functional studies and will be valuable for predicting if an effector localizes to the apoplast or if it enters plant cells. ApoplastP is available at http://apoplastp.csiro.au.",

    "abstract": "Centrosomes are major microtubule-nucleating organelles that facilitate chromosome segregation and cell division in metazoans. Centrosomes comprise centrioles that organize a micron-scale mass of protein called pericentriolar material (PCM) from which microtubules nucleate. During each cell cycle, PCM accumulates around centrioles through phosphorylation-mediated assembly of PCM scaffold proteins. During mitotic exit, PCM swiftly disassembles by an unknown mechanism. Here, we used Caenorhabditis elegans embryos to determine the mechanism and importance of PCM disassembly in dividing cells. We found that the phosphatase PP2A and its regulatory subunit SUR-6 (PP2ASUR-6), together with cortically directed microtubule pulling forces, actively disassemble PCM. In embryos depleted of these activities, [~]25% of PCM persisted from one cell cycle into the next, resulting in cytokinetic furrow ingression errors, excessive centrosome accumulation, and embryonic death. Purified PP2ASUR-6 could dephosphorylate the major PCM scaffold protein SPD-5 in vitro. Our data suggest that PCM disassembly occurs through a combination of dephosphorylation of PCM components and catastrophic rupture of the PCM scaffold.",

This must be carefully regulated to maintain the organisation of the membrane system and prevent mistargeted degradation. Here, we dissect the autophagosomal SNARE complex pathway and its regulation using FLIM-FRET as a readout of protein interaction in situ. We show that within the spatio-temporal framework of the cell, autophagosomal Stx17 preferentially heterodimerises with SNAP29, subsequently associating with VAMP7, not VAMP8 as currently believed. Additionally, we identify for the first time multi-modal regulation of SNARE assembly by the SM protein VPS33A, finding parallels and differences with other syntaxin-SM interactions and suggesting a unifying model of SM regulation. Contrary to current theory, the Stx17 N-peptide interacts in a positionally conserved, but mechanistically divergent manner with VPS33A, providing a late  go, no-go step for autophagic fusion via a phosphoserine master-switch.",

Recent work in vertebrate embryos has identified neuromesodermal progenitors as a bipotent cell population that contributes to paraxial mesoderm and spinal cord. However, precise protocols for in vitro differentiation of human neuromesodermal progenitors are lacking. Informed by signalling activities during spinal cord generation in amniote embryos, we show here that transient dual-SMAD inhibition, together with retinoic acid (dSMADi-RA), provides rapid and reproducible induction of human spinal cord progenitors from neuromesodermal progenitors. We use CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer a GFP-reporter for a neuromesodermal progenitor-associated transcription factor Nkx1.2 in human embryonic stem cells, to facilitate selection of this cell population. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) was then used to identify human and conserved neuromesodermal progenitor transcriptional signatures, validate this differentiation protocol and implicate new pathways and processes in human neural differentiation. This optimised protocol, novel reporter line and transcriptomic data are useful resources with which to dissect cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the generation of human spinal cord, allow scale-up of distinct cell populations for global analyses, including proteomic, biochemical and chromatin interrogation and open up translational opportunities.",

    "abstract": "The potential for genome-wide modeling of epistasis has recently surfaced given the possibility of sequencing densely sampled populations and the emerging families of statistical interaction models. Direct coupling analysis (DCA) has earlier been shown to yield valuable predictions for single protein structures, and has recently been extended to genome-wide analysis of bacteria, identifying novel interactions in the co-evolution between resistance, virulence and core genome elements. However, earlier computational DCA methods have not been scalable to enable model fitting simultaneously to 104-105 polymorphisms, representing the amount of core genomic variation observed in analyses of many bacterial species. Here we introduce a novel inference method (SuperDCA) which employs a new scoring principle, efficient parallelization, optimization and filtering on phylogenetic information to achieve scalability for up to 105 polymorphisms. Using two large population samples of Streptococcus pneumoniae, we demonstrate the ability of SuperDCA to make additional significant biological findings about this major human pathogen. We also show that our method can uncover signals of selection that are not detectable by genome-wide association analysis, even though our analysis does not require phenotypic measurements. SuperDCA thus holds considerable potential in building understanding about numerous organisms at a systems biological level.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRecent work has demonstrated the emerging potential in statistical genome-wide modeling to uncover co-selection and epistatic interactions between polymorphisms in bacterial chromosomes from densely sampled population data. Here we develop the Potts model based approach further into a fully mature computational method which can be applied to most existing bacterial population genomic data sets in a straightforward manner. Our advances are relying on more efficient parameter scoring, highly optimized and parallelized open source C++ code, which does not rely on the computation-intensive polymorphism subsampling approximations used earlier. By analyzing the two largest available population samples of Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus), we highlight several biological discoveries related to the survival of the pneumococcus and co-evolution of penicillin-binding loci, which were not uncovered by the earlier analyses. Our method holds considerable potential for building understanding about numerous organisms at a systems biological level.",

The concepts of quorum sensing inhibitors (QSI) and quorum quenching enzymes (QQ) have been investigated separately. In this study however, we simulated the synergistic effect of QQ and QSI in blocking bacterial QS. This effect was validated by experiments using AiiA and G1 as QQ and QSI respectively on Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasR/I and RhlR/I QS circuits. The combination of a QQ and a QSI almost completely blocked the P. aeruginosa QS las and rhl system. Our findings provided a potential application strategy for bacterial QS disruption.",

As controls, representative key glycans including O-GlcNAc, lactosaminyl glycans and hyaluronan were also imaged. HS staining revealed novel architectural features of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of HUVEC cells. Results from T/Tn antigen staining suggest that O-GalNAcylation is a rate-limiting step for O-glycan synthesis.

To this aim, we implemented an original protocol that allows mimicking substrate transport in silico. We show that the conformational changes occurring in AcrB enable the formation of a layer of structured waters on the surface of the substrate transport channel. This, in turn, allows for a fairly constant hydration of the substrate that facilitates its diffusion. Our findings reveal a new molecular mechanism of transport in polyspecific systems, whereby waters contribute by screening potentially strong substrate-protein interactions. The mechanistic understanding of a fundamental process related to multi-drug transport provided here could help rationalizing the behavior of other polyspecific systems.",

Pyrosequencing was used to validate the MSHRM results. The results indicate an overall distinction in methylation between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. The mesenchymal expression markers VIM, DKK3 and CRABP1 were methylated in the majority of epithelial breast cancer cell lines while methylation of the epithelial expression markers GRHL2, MIR200C and CDH1 was restricted to mesenchymal cell lines. We also examined EMP association of several methylation markers that have been used to assess minimal residual disease.

Using live cell imaging of cultured brains, laser ablation and genetics we reveal that these cells use the position of their last-born daughter cell as a polarizing cue. Remarkably, this daughter cell derived signal received at one pole of the stem cell has an effect on the opposite pole influencing where apical will be in the next mitosis, thereby directing the orientation of division. Therefore, in addition to known intrinsic cues, stem cells in the developing fly brain are polarized by an extrinsic signal that acts upstream of apico-basal polarity establishment.",

Here, by using gain and loss of function experiments, we demonstrate that both endogenous and exogenous opioids prevent tissue regeneration in adults, by inhibiting the early reactive oxygen species (ROS) production occurring after lesion and required for regeneration. These effects can be overcome and regeneration induced by the use of an opioid antagonist. These results, obtained in both gold-standard adult zebrafish and a newly-developed model of regeneration in adult mammals, demonstrate that this mechanism can be considered as a general paradigm in vertebrates.

Counting pollen and ovules in flowers is essential to understand how much is invested in each gender. Classical methods to count very numerous pollen grains and ovules are inefficient when pollen grains are tightly aggregated, and when fertilization rates of ovules are unknown. We thus established novel, Computed-Tomography-based counting techniques. In order to display the potential of our methods in very difficult cases, we counted pollen and ovules across inflorescences of deceptive and rewarding species of European orchids, which possess both very large numbers of pollen grains (tightly aggregated) and ovules. Pollen counts did not significantly vary across inflorescences and pollination strategies, whereas deceptive flowers had significantly more ovules than rewarding flowers. The within inflorescence variance of pollen to ovule ratios in rewarding flowers was four times higher than in deceptive flowers, possibly demonstrating differences in the constraints acting on both pollination strategies. We demonstrate the inaccuracies and limitations of previously established methods, and the broad applicability of our new techniques: they allow measurement of reproductive investment without restriction on object number or aggregation, and without specimen destruction.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoinositides are signaling lipids that constitute a complex network regulating many cellular processes. We propose a computational model that accounts for all known species of phosphoinositides in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. The model replicates the steady-state of the phosphoinositide pathway and most known dynamic phenomena. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis demonstrates model robustness to moderate alterations in any of the parameters. Model analysis suggest that the greatest contributor to PI(4,5)P2 production is a flux representing the direct transformation of PI into PI(4,5)P2 and is also responsible for the maintenance of this pool when PI(4)P is decreased. PI(5)P is also shown to be a significant source for PI(4,5)P2 production. The model was validated with data from siRNA screens that knocked down the expression of several enzymes in the pathway. The screen monitored the activity of the epithelium sodium channel, ENaC, which is activated by PI(4,5)P2. Moderating ENaC activity can have a therapeutic effect in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. Our model suggests control strategies where the activities of the enzyme PIP5KI or the PI4K+PIP5KI+DVL protein complex are decreased and cause an efficacious reduction in PI(4,5)P2 levels while avoiding undesirable alterations in other phosphoinositide pools.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCystic fibrosis is a disabling genetic disease with an increased prevalence in populations with European heritage. Currently, the most used technique for collection of cystic fibrosis samples and diagnosis is provided through uncomfortable tests, with uncertain results, mostly based on chloride concentration in sweat. Since cystic fibrosis mutation induces many metabolic changes in patients, exploring these alterations might be an alternative to visualize potential biomarkers that could be used as interesting tools for further diagnostic upgrade, prioritizing simplicity, low cost and quickness.\\n\\nMethodsThis contribution describes an accurate strategy to provide potential biomarkers related to cystic fibrosis, which may be understood as a potential tool for new diagnostic approaches and/or for monitoring disease evolution. Therefore, the present proposal consists of using skin imprints on silica plates as a way of sample collection, followed by direct-infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry and multivariate data analysis, intending to identify metabolic changes in skin composition of cystic fibrosis patients.\\n\\nResultsMetabolomics analysis allowed identifying chemical markers that can be traced back to cystic fibrosis in patients skin imprints, differently from control subjects. Seven chemical markers from several molecular classes were elected, represented by bile acids, a glutaric acid derivative, thyrotropin releasing hormone, an inflammatory mediator, a phosphatidic acid, and diacylglycerol isomers, all reflecting metabolic disturbances that occur due to of cystic fibrosis.\\n\\nConclusionThe comfortable method of sample collection combined with the identified set of biomarkers represent potential tools that open the range of possibilities to manage cystic fibrosis and follow the disease evolution. This exploratory approach points to new perspectives about cystic fibrosis management and maybe to further development of a new diagnostic assay based on them.",

    "abstract": "There has been slow progress in the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating brain tumours, partly because assessment of treatment response is difficult and largely reliant on simple bi-dimensional measurements of MRI contrast-enhancing regions. Hence, there is a clinical need to develop improved imaging techniques for monitoring treatment response. In this study, we evaluate VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumors) MRI in mouse glioblastomas for the quantification of tumour microstructure and assessment of response to Temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, and, we investigate the feasibility of applying VERDICT MRI in a range of human gliomas. VERDICT MRI detected response to TMZ earlier than structural and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements. A significant reduction in the cell radius parameter was detected three days earlier than ADC and six days earlier than structural MRI. Histological analysis showed the same trend as VERDICT of decreased intracellular volume fraction in the TMZ-treated mice. Vascular volume fraction was not altered by TMZ, which was consistent with optical projection tomography measurements. In patients, glioblastoma compartmental volume fractions showed good agreement with mouse glioblastoma parameters. The VERDICT parameters varied across the human gliomas, with raised intracellular volume fraction in the oligodendrogliomas and elevated cell radius in both low-grade tumours subtypes. In conclusion, our results suggest that VERDICT MRI is more sensitive at detecting TMZ response than structural or ADC measurements. In patients, VERDICT is feasible within clinical scan times, and performed best at characterising glioblastoma. Further optimisation should improve assessment of different glioma subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Cancer develops by accumulation of somatic driver mutations, which impact cellular function. Non-coding mutations in non-coding regulatory regions can now be studied genome-wide and further characterized by correlation with gene expression and clinical outcome to identify driver candidates. Using a new two-stage procedure, called ncDriver, we first screened 507 ICGC whole-genomes from ten cancer types for non-coding elements, in which mutations are both recurrent and have elevated conservation or cancer specificity. This identified 160 significant non-coding elements, including the TERT promoter, a well-known non-coding driver element, as well as elements associated with known cancer genes and regulatory genes (e.g., PAX5, TOX3, PCF11, MAPRE3). However, in some significant elements, mutations appear to stem from localized mutational processes rather than recurrent positive selection in some cases. To further characterize the driver potential of the identified elements and shortlist candidates, we identified elements where presence of mutations correlated significantly with expression levels (e.g. TERT and CDH10) and survival (e.g. CDH9 and CDH10) in an independent set of 505 TCGA whole-genome samples. In a larger pan-cancer set of 4,128 TCGA exomes with expression profiling, we identified mutational correlation with expression for additional elements (e.g., near GATA3, CDC6, ZNF217 and CTCF transcription factor binding sites). Survival analysis further pointed to MIR122, a known marker of poor prognosis in liver cancer. This screen for significant mutation patterns followed by correlative mutational analysis identified new individual driver candidates and suggest that some non-coding mutations recurrently affect expression and play a role in cancer development.",

These alterations relate with each other in patterns of mutual exclusion and co-occurrence that affect prognosis and treatment response and highlight the need for multitargeted therapy. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no systematic reports in the literature of co-dependent and mutually exclusive mutations across all types of cancer. In addition, the studies reported so far generally deal with whole genes instead of specific mutations, ignoring the fact that different alterations in the same gene can have widely different effects.\\n\\nResultsHere we present a systematic analysis of co-dependencies of somatic mutations across all cancer types. Combining multi testing with conditional and expected mutational probabilities, we have found pairs and networks of co-mutations and exclusions, some of them in particular types of cancer and others widespread. We have also determined that driver loci are present in more types of cancer than non driver loci, that they tend to pair within a single gene and that those pairs are more often exclusions than co-mutations.\\n\\nConclusionsBased on this properties, we propose new drivers that warrant experimental validation.

In the saw-toothed grain beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis, we demonstrate that the symbionts affect cuticle thickness, melanization and hydrocarbon profile, enhancing desiccation resistance and thereby strongly improving fitness under dry conditions. Together with earlier observations on symbiont contributions to cuticle biosynthesis in weevils, our findings indicate that convergent acquisitions of bacterial mutualists represented key adaptations enabling diverse pest beetle groups to survive and proliferate under the low ambient humidities that characterize dry grain storage facilities.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary dynamics driven out of equilibrium by growth, expansion or adaptation often generate a characteristically skewed distribution of descendant numbers: The earliest, the most advanced or the fittest ancestors have exceptionally large number of descendants, which Luria and Delbruck called \\\"jackpot\\\" events. Here, we show that recurrent jackpot events generate a deterministic bias favoring majority alleles, which is equivalent to an effective frequency-dependent selection (proportional to the log ratio of the frequencies of mutant and wild-type alleles). This \\\"fictitious\\\" selection force results from the fact that majority alleles tend to sample deeper into the tail of the descendant distribution. The flipside of this sampling effect is the rare occurrence of large frequency hikes in favor of minority alleles, which ensures that the allele frequency dynamics remains neutral overall unless genuine selection is present. The limiting allele frequency process is dual to the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent and has a particularly simple representation in terms of the logarithm of the mutant frequency. The resulting picture of a selection-like bias compensated by rare big jumps allows for an intuitive understanding of allele frequency trajectories and enables the exact calculation of transition densities for a range of important scenarios, including population size changes and different forms of selection. The fixation of unconditionally beneficial mutations is shown to be exponentially suppressed and balancing selection can maintain diversity only if the population size is large enough. We briefly discuss analogous effects in disordered complex systems, where sampling-induced biases can be viewed as ergodicity breaking driving forces.\\n\\nOne of the virtues of mathematizing Darwins theory of evolution is that one obtains quantitative predictions about the dynamics of allele frequencies that can be tested with increasing rigor as experimental techniques, sequencing methods and computational power advance. The Wright-Fisher model is arguably the simplest null model of how allele frequencies change across time [17]. Although, for modeling neutral genetic diversity, it is often replaced by equivalent backward-in-time models of the ensuing tree structures [23], forward-in-time approaches are still unrivaled in their ability to include the effects of natural selection. As such, the Wright-Fisher model has been instrumental for shaping the intuition of generations of population genetics about the basic dynamics of neutral and selected variants. But transition densities derived from the Wright-Fisher model also find tangible application in scans for selection in time series data [4, 9, 22].\\n\\nThe Wright-Fisher model is remarkably versatile as it can be adjusted to many scenarios by the use of effective model parameters: An effective population size, an effective mutation rate and effective selection coefficients. But, crucially, these re-parameterizations cannot account for extremely skewed family size distributions. While remarkably skewed family distributions occur in some natural populations [15], they routinely arise in microbial populations that combine exponential growth with recurrent mutations. This was first highlighted by Luria and Delbruck [26], who noticed that mutations that occur early in an exponential growth process will produce an exceptionally large number of descendants. The distribution of such mutational \\\"jackpot\\\" events has a particular power law tail in well-mixed population, as is briefly explained in Fig. 1A. Simplest models of continual evolution [28] and related models of traveling waves [36] can be viewed, on a coarse-grained level, as repeatedly sampling from this jackpot distribution. (The number of draws and the characteristic resampling time scale varies with the model.) It is by now well-established that the ensuing genealogies are described by a particular multiple-merger coalescent [7, 8, 13, 29, 33-35] first identified by Bolthausen and Sznitman [5].\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=116 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/182519_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (16K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d391e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ff4eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@198495aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f7b58e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFIG. 1:C_FLOATNO A) Illustration of mutational jackpot events, first studied by Luria and Delbriick. Consider the growth of a well-mixed population of microbes starting from a single cell (ignore death). A mutation that occurs in the jth cell division will have a final frequency of about {approx} 1/j (j = 4 in the illustration) and thus a \\\"family size\\\" of u = N/j. Hence, the probability Pr[U > u] to reach an even larger family size U is equal to the probability {approx} j/N = 1/u that the mutation occurs prior to the nth cell division. The probability density to acquire a family size u therefore exhibits a power law tail p(u) {propto} u-2. (Our argument ignores the stochasticity in cell division events, which however does not change the power law exponent.) B) The blue line indicates the probability Pr[U > u] that the family size U of a mutation is larger than u. The largest family size u* in a sample of N jackpot events should typically be of order N because the probability of sampling an even larger event is 1/n (dashed lines). A typical n-sample, therefore, has a mean family size of order log(n), which is obtained upon truncating the family size distribution at u*. It turns out that this effect generates a selection-like bias favoring majority alleles, which is compensated by rare sampling events that favor minority alleles.\\n\\nC_FIG\\n\\nWhile extensions of the Wright-Fisher diffusion process to capture skewed offspring numbers have been formally constructed [2, 3, 14, 20], also including selection and mutations [1, 10, 11, 16, 18], we still lack explicit finite time predictions for the probability distribution of allele frequency trajectories. Our goal here is to fill this gap for the particular case of the Luria-Delbriick jackpot distribution, by characterizing the allele frequency process in such a way that it can be easily generalized, intuitively understood and integrated in time.",

However, those studies were largely limited to European ancestries, restricting the generalizability of the findings and overlooking possible key genes poorly captured by common European genetic variation. Here, in up to 67,029 women of Japanese ancestry, we report 26 loci (all P<5x10{macron}8) for puberty timing or age at menopause, representing the first loci for reproductive ageing in any non-European population. Highlighted genes for menopause include GNRH1, which supports a primary, rather than passive, role for hypothalamic-pituitary GnRH signalling in the timing of menopause. For puberty timing, we demonstrate an aetiological role for receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases by combining evidence across population genetics and pre- and peri-pubertal changes in hypothalamic gene expression in rodent and primate models. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate widespread differences in allele frequencies and effect estimates between Japanese and European populations, highlighting the benefits and challenges of large-scale trans-ethnic approaches.",

We discovered that cardinal GABAergic neuron types are delineated by a transcriptional architecture that encodes their synaptic communication patterns. This architecture comprises 6 categories of ~40 gene families including cell adhesion molecules, transmitter-modulator receptors, ion channels, signaling proteins, neuropeptides and vesicular release components, and transcription factors. Combinatorial expression of select members across families shapes a multi-layered molecular scaffold along cell membrane that may customize synaptic connectivity patterns and input-output signaling properties.

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that metabolic markers of baseline brain oxygenation have a role to play in the early identification of the ischemic penumbra. Streamlined-qBOLD is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that does not require exogenous contrast. It is a refinement of the quantitative BOLD methodology that provides a simplified approach to mapping and quantifying baseline brain oxygenation related parameters (reversible transverse relaxation rate (R2'), deoxygenated blood volume (DBV) and deoxyhaemoglobin concentration ([dHb])) in a clinically relevant manner. Streamlined-qBOLD was applied to an exploratory cohort of acute stroke patients in a serial imaging study. Detailed voxel-level analysis was used to quantify the metabolic profile of ischaemic tissue on presentation and investigate these metrics in relation to tissue outcome. Individual patient examples illustrate the appropriate interpretation of R2', DBV and [dHb] in acute stroke and demonstrate the ability of this method to deliver regional information related to oxygen metabolism in the ischaemic tissue. Regional analysis confirms that R2', DBV and [dHb] vary between regions of ischaemia with different tissue outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive function relies on a dynamic, context-sensitive balance between functional integration and segregation in the brain. Previous work has proposed that this balance is mediated by global fluctuations in neural gain by projections from ascending neuromodulatory nuclei. To test this hypothesis in silico, we studied the effects of neural gain on network dynamics in a model of large-scale neuronal dynamics. We found that increases in neural gain pushed the network through an abrupt dynamical transition, leading to an integrated network topology that was maximal in frontoparietal  rich club regions. This gain-mediated transition was also associated with increased topological complexity, as well as increased variability in time-resolved topological structure, further highlighting the potential computational benefits of the gain-mediated network transition. These results support the hypothesis that neural gain modulation has the computational capacity to mediate the balance between integration and segregation in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Human neuroscience research faces several challenges with regards to reproducibility. While scientists are generally aware that data sharing is an important component of reproducible research, it is not always clear how to usefully share data in a manner that allows other labs to understand and reproduce published findings. Here we describe a new open source tool, AFQ-Browser, that builds an interactive website as a companion to a published diffusion MRI study. Because AFQ-browser is portable -- it runs in any modern web-browser -- it can facilitate transparency and data sharing. Moreover, by leveraging new web-visualization technologies to create linked views between different dimensions of a diffusion MRI dataset (anatomy, quantitative diffusion metrics, subject metadata), AFQ-Browser facilitates exploratory data analysis, fueling new scientific discoveries based on previously published datasets. In an era where Big Data is playing an increasingly prominent role in scientific discovery, so will browser-based tools for exploring high-dimensional datasets, communicating scientific discoveries, sharing and aggregating data across labs, and publishing data alongside manuscripts.",

    "abstract": "Social impairments are a hallmark of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), but empirical evidence for early brain network alterations in response to social stimuli is scant in ASD. Here, we recorded the gaze patterns and brain activity of toddlers and preschoolers with ASD and their typically developing (TD) peers while they explored dynamic social scenes. Source-space directed functional connectivity analyses revealed the presence of network alterations in the theta frequency band, manifesting as increased driving (hyper-activity) and stronger connections (hyper-connectivity) from key nodes of the social brain associated with autism. Further analyses of brain-behavioural relationships within the ASD group suggested that compensatory mechanisms from dorsomedial frontal, inferior temporal and insular cortical regions were associated with lower clinical impairment and less atypical gaze patterns. Our results provide strong evidence that directed functional connectivity alterations of social brain networks is a core component of atypical brain development at early stages of ASD.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptional co-activator YAP controls cell proliferation, survival, and tissue regeneration in response to changes in the mechanical environment. It is not known how mechanical stimuli such as tension are sensed and how the signal is transduced to control YAP activity. Here we show that the LIM domain protein TRIP6 acts as part of a mechanotransduction pathway at adherens junctions to promote YAP activity by inhibiting the LATS1/2 kinases. Previous studies showed that vinculin at adherens junctions becomes activated by mechanical tension. We show that vinculin inhibits Hippo signaling by recruiting TRIP6 to adherens junctions and stimulating its binding to and inhibition of LATS1/2 in response to tension. TRIP6 competes with MOB1 for binding to LATS1/2 thereby blocking MOB1 from recruiting the LATS1/2 activating kinases MST1/2. Together these findings reveal a novel mechanotransduction cascade that transduces tension signals sensed at adherens junctions to control Hippo pathway signaling.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of sleep and metabolic homeostasis are critical to an animals survival and under stringent evolutionary pressure. Animals display remarkable diversity in sleep and metabolic phenotypes; however, an understanding of the ecological forces that select for, and maintain, these phenotypic differences remain poorly understood. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a powerful model for investigating the genetic regulation of sleep and metabolic function, and screening in inbred fly lines has led to the identification of novel genetic regulators of sleep. Nevertheless, little is known about the contributions of naturally occurring genetic differences to sleep, metabolic phenotypes, and their relationship with geographic or environmental gradients. Here, we quantified sleep and metabolic phenotypes in 24 D. melanogaster populations collected from unique geographic localities. These studies reveal remarkable diversity in sleep, starvation resistance, and energy stores. We found that increased sleep duration is strongly associated with proximity to the equator and elevated average annual temperature, suggesting that environmental gradients strongly influence natural variation in sleep. Further, we found variation in metabolic regulation of sleep to be associated with free glucose levels, while starvation resistance associates with glycogen and triglyceride stores. Taken together, these findings reveal robust naturally occurring variation in sleep and metabolic traits in D. melanogaster and suggest that distance from the equator and median temperature is a significant evolutionary factor in sleep regulation and architecture.",

    "abstract": "Parasitism is a life strategy that has repeatedly evolved within the Florideophyceae. Historically, the terms adelphoparasite and alloparasite have been used to distinguish parasites based on the relative phylogenetic relationship of host and parasite. However, analyses using molecular phylogenetics indicate that nearly all red algal parasites infect within their taxonomic family, and a range of relationships exist between host and parasite. To date, all investigated adelphoparasites have lost their plastid, and instead, incorporate a host derived plastid when packaging spores. In contrast, a highly reduced plastid lacking photosynthesis genes was sequenced from the alloparasite Choreocolax polysiphoniae. Here we present the complete Harveyella mirabilis plastid genome, which has also lost genes involved in photosynthesis, and a partial plastid genome from Leachiella pacifica. The H. mirabilis plastid shares more synteny with free-living red algal plastids than that of C. polysiphoniae. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that C. polysiphoniae, H. mirabilis, and L. pacifica form a robustly supported clade of parasites, which retain their own plastid genomes, within the Rhodomelaceae. We therefore transfer all three genera from the exclusively parasitic family, Choreocolacaceae, to the Rhodomelaceae. Additionally, we recommend applying the terms archaeplastic parasites (formerly alloparasites), and neoplastic parasites (formerly adelphoparasites) to distinguish red algal parasites using a biological framework rather than taxonomic affiliation with their hosts.",

    "abstract": "Genetic interactions have been reported to underlie phenotypes in a variety of systems, but the extent to which they contribute to complex disease in humans remains unclear. In principle, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a platform for detecting genetic interactions, but existing methods for identifying them from GWAS data tend to focus on testing individual locus pairs, which undermines statistical power. Importantly, the global genetic networks mapped for a model eukaryotic organism revealed that genetic interactions often connect genes between compensatory functional modules in a highly coherent manner. Taking advantage of this expected structure, we developed a computational approach called BridGE that identifies pathways connected by genetic interactions from GWAS data. Applying BridGE broadly, we discovered significant interactions in Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia, hypertension, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Our novel approach provides a general framework for mapping complex genetic networks underlying human disease from genome-wide genotype data.",
