    "abstract": "In temperate humid catchments, evapotranspiration returns more than half of the annual precipitation to the atmosphere, thereby determining the balance available to recharge groundwaters and support stream flow and lake levels. Changes in evapotranspiration rates and therefore catchment hydrology could be driven by changes in land use or climate. Here we examine the catchment water balance over the past 50 y for a catchment in southwest Michigan covered by cropland, grassland, forest, and wetlands. Over the study period about 27% of the catchment has been abandoned from row-crop agriculture to perennial vegetation and about 20% of the catchment has reverted to deciduous forest, and the climate has warmed by 1.14{degrees}C. Despite these changes in land use, precipitation and stream discharge, and by inference catchment-scale evapotranspiration, have been stable over the study period. The remarkably stable rates of evapotranspirative water loss from the catchment across a period of significant land cover change suggest that rainfed annual crops and perennial vegetation do not differ greatly in evapotranspiration rates, and this is supported by measurements of evapotranspiration from various vegetation types based on soil water monitoring in the same catchment. Compensating changes in the other meteorological drivers of evaporative water demand besides air temperature--wind speed, atmospheric humidity, and net radiation--are also possible, but cannot be evaluated due to insufficient local data across the 50-y period. Regardless of the explanation, this study shows that the water balance of this landscape has been resilient in the face of both land cover and climate change over the past 50 y.",

    "abstract": "Over the 180 million years since their origin, the sex chromosomes of mammals have evolved a gene repertoire highly specialized for function in the male germline. The mouse Y chromosome is unique among mammalian Y chromosomes characterized to date in that it is large, gene-rich and euchromatic. Yet little is known about its diversity in natural populations. Here we take advantage of published whole-genome sequencing data to survey the diversity of sequence and copy number of sex-linked genes in three subspecies of house mice. Copy number of genes on the repetitive long arm of both sex chromosomes is highly variable, but sequence diversity in non-repetitive regions is decreased relative to expectations based on autosomes. We use simulations and theory to show that this reduction in sex-linked diversity is incompatible with neutral demographic processes alone, but is consistent with recent positive selection on genes active during spermatogenesis. Our results support the hypothesis that the mouse sex chromosomes are engaged in ongoing intragenomic conflict.",

    "abstract": "How the brain preserves information about multiple simultaneous items is poorly understood. We report that single neurons can represent multiple different stimuli by interleaving different signals across time. We record single units in an auditory region, the inferior colliculus, while monkeys localize 1 or 2 simultaneous sounds. During dual-sound trials, we find that some neurons fluctuate between firing rates observed for each single sound, either on a whole-trial or on a sub-trial timescale. These fluctuations are correlated in pairs of neurons, can be predicted by the state of local field potentials prior to sound onset, and, in one monkey, can predict which sound will be reported first. We find corroborating evidence of fluctuating activity patterns in a separate data set involving responses of inferotemporal cortex neurons to multiple visual stimuli. Alternation between activity patterns corresponding to each of multiple items may therefore be a general strategy to enhance the brain processing capacity, potentially linking such disparate phenomena as variable neural firing, neural oscillations, and limits in attentional/memory capacity.",

    "abstract": "Quality control of MRI is essential for excluding problematic acquisitions and avoiding bias in subsequent image processing and analysis. Visual inspection is subjective and impractical for large scale datasets. Although automated quality assessments have been demonstrated on single-site datasets, it is unclear that solutions can generalize to unseen data acquired at new sites. Here, we introduce the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC), a tool for extracting quality measures and fitting a binary (accept/exclude) classifier. Our tool can be run both locally and as a free online service via the OpenNeuro.org portal. The classifier is trained on a publicly available, multi-site dataset (17 sites, N=1102). We perform model selection evaluating different normalization and feature exclusion approaches aimed at maximizing across-site generalization and estimate an accuracy of 76%{+/-}13% on new sites, using leave-one-site-out cross-validation. We confirm that result on a held-out dataset (2 sites, N=265) also obtaining a 76% accuracy. Even though the performance of the trained classifier is statistically above chance, we show that it is susceptible to site effects and unable to account for artifacts specific to new sites. MRIQC performs with high accuracy in intra-site prediction, but performance on unseen sites leaves space for improvement which might require more labeled data and new approaches to the between-site variability. Overcoming these limitations is crucial for a more objective quality assessment of neuroimaging data, and to enable the analysis of extremely large and multi-site samples.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that conflict is common among gene trees in phylogenomic studies, and that less than one percent of genes may ultimately drive species tree inference in supermatrix analyses. Here, we examined two datasets where supermatrix and coalescent-based species trees conflict. We identified two highly influential \\\"outlier\\\" genes in each dataset. When removed from each dataset, the inferred supermatrix trees matched the topologies obtained from coalescent analyses. We also demonstrate that, while the outlier genes in the vertebrate dataset have been shown in a previous study to be the result of errors in orthology detection, the outlier genes from a plant dataset did not exhibit any obvious systematic error and therefore may be the result of some biological process yet to be determined. While topological comparisons among a small set of alternate topologies can be helpful in discovering outlier genes, they can be limited in several ways, such as assuming all genes share the same topology. Coalescent species tree methods relax this assumption but do not explicitly facilitate the examination of specific edges. Coalescent methods often also assume that conflict is the result of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here we explored a framework that allows for quickly examining alternative edges and support for large phylogenomic datasets that does not assume a single topology for all genes. For both datasets, these analyses provided detailed results confirming the support for coalescent-based topologies. This framework suggests that we can improve our understanding of the underlying signal in phylogenomic datasets by asking more targeted edge-based questions.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in the biology of sex-differences has eluded direct study in humans: how does sex chromosome dosage (SCD) shape genome function? To address this, we developed a systematic map of SCD effects on gene function by analyzing genome-wide expression data in humans with diverse sex chromosome aneuploidies (XO, XXX, XXY, XYY, XXYY). For sex chromosomes, we demonstrate a pattern of obligate dosage sensitivity amongst evolutionarily preserved X-Y homologs, and update prevailing theoretical models for SCD compensation by detecting X-linked genes whose expression increases with decreasing X- and/or Y-chromosome dosage. We further show that SCD-sensitive sex chromosome genes regulate specific co-expression networks of SCD-sensitive autosomal genes with critical cellular functions and a demonstrable potential to mediate previously documented SCD effects on disease. Our findings detail wide-ranging effects of SCD on genome function with implications for human phenotypic variation.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSex chromosome dosage (SCD) effects on human gene expression are central to the biology of sex differences and sex chromosome aneuploidy syndromes, but challenging to study given the co-segregation of SCD and gonadal status. We address this obstacle by systematically modelling SCD effects on genome wide expression data from a large and rare cohort of individuals with diverse SCDs (XO, XX, XXX, XXXX, XY, XXY, XYY, XXYY, XXXXY). Our findings update current models of sex chromosome biology by (i) pinpointing a core set of X- and Y-linked genes with \\\"obligate\\\" SCD sensitivity, (ii) discovering several non-canonical modes of X-chromosome dosage compensation, and (iii) dissecting complex regulatory effects of X-chromosome dosage on large autosomal gene networks with key roles in cellular functioning.",

    "abstract": "Age-dependent loss of cardiac tissue homeostasis largely impacts heart performance and contributes significantly to cardiovascular diseases later in life. Cellular quality control machinery, such as autophagy/lysosome system, plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiac health and preventing age-induced cardiomyopathy and heart failure. However, how aging alters the autophagy/lysosome system to impact cardiac function remains largely unknown. Here using Drosophila heart as a model system, we show that activin signaling, a member of TGF-beta superfamily, negatively regulates cardiac autophagy and cardiac health during aging. We found that cardiac-specific knockdown of Daw, an activin-like protein in Drosophila, increased cardiac autophagy and prevented age-related cardiac dysfunction, including arrhythmia and bradycardia (slow heart rate). Inhibition of autophagy blocked Daw knockdown-mediated cardioprotection. Consistently, cardiac-specific expression of constitutively activated activin type I receptor Babo disrupted cardiac function at young ages. Intriguingly, the key autophagy regulator, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), was not involved in activin-mediated autophagy. Instead, activin signaling genetically interacted with Rictor, the key subunit of mTORC2, to regulate autophagy and cardiac aging. Knockdown of Daw increased the mRNA expression of Rictor and the phosphorylation of AKT in fly hearts. Finally, cardiac-specific silencing of Daw not only improved cardiac health, but also prolonged lifespan. Thus, our findings highlight an emerging role of activin signaling and mTORC2 in the regulation of autophagy and cardiac aging.",

    "abstract": "Molecular variants of vitamin B12, siderophores and glycans occur. To take up variant forms, bacteria may express an array of receptors. The gut microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron has three different receptors to take up variants of vitamin B12 and 88 receptors to take up various glycans. The design of receptor arrays reflects key processes that shape cellular evolution. Competition may focus each species on a subset of the available nutrient diversity. Some gut bacteria can take up only a narrow range of carbohydrates, whereas species such as B. thetaiotaomicron can digest many different complex glycans. Comparison of different nutrients, habitats, and genomes provide opportunity to test hypotheses about the breadth of receptor arrays. Another important process concerns fluctuations in nutrient availability. Such fluctuations enhance the value of cellular sensors, which gain information about environmental availability and adjust receptor deployment. Bacteria often adjust receptor expression in response to fluctuations of particular carbohydrate food sources. Some species may adjust expression of uptake receptors for specific siderophores. How do cells use sensor information to control the response to fluctuations? That question about regulatory wiring relates to problems that arise in control theory and artificial intelligence. Control theory clarifies how to analyze environmental fluctuations in relation to the design of sensors and response systems. Recent advances in deep learning studies of artificial intelligence focus on the architecture of regulatory wiring and the ways in which complex control networks represent and classify environmental states. I emphasize the similar design problems that arise in cellular evolution, control theory, and artificial intelligence. I connect those broad conceptual aspects to many testable hypotheses for bacterial uptake of vitamin B12, siderophores and glycans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInvestigators often interpret genome-wide data by analyzing the expression levels of genes within pathways. While this within-pathway analysis is routine, the products of any one pathway can affect the activity of other pathways. Past efforts to identify relationships between biological processes have evaluated overlap in knowledge bases or evaluated changes that occur after specific treatments. Individual experiments can highlight condition-specific pathway-pathway relationships; however, constructing a complete network of such relationships across many conditions requires analyzing results from many studies.\n\nResultsWe developed PathCORE-T framework by implementing existing methods to identify pathway-pathway transcriptional relationships evident across a broad data compendium. PathCORE-T is applied to the output of feature construction algorithms; it identifies pairs of pathways observed in features more than expected by chance as functionally co-occurring. We demonstrate PathCORE-T by analyzing an existing eADAGE model of a microbial compendium and building and analyzing NMF features from the TCGA dataset of 33 cancer types. The PathCORE-T framework includes a demonstration web interface, with source code, that users can launch to (1) visualize the network and (2) review the expression levels of associated genes in the original data. PathCORE-T creates and displays the network of globally co-occurring pathways based on features observed in a machine learning analysis of gene expression data.\n\nConclusionsThe PathCORE-T framework identifies transcriptionally co-occurring pathways from the results of unsupervised analysis of gene expression data and visualizes the relationships between pathways as a network. PathCORE-T recapitulated previously described pathway-pathway relationships and suggested experimentally testable additional hypotheses that remain to be explored.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAbsent adaptive, individualized dose-finding in early-phase oncology trials, subsequent registration trials risk suboptimal dosing that compromises statistical power and lowers the probability of technical success (PTS) for the investigational drug. While much methodological progress has been made toward adaptive dose-finding, and quantitative modeling of dose-response relationships, most such work continues to be organized around a concept of  the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). But a new methodology, Dose Titration Algorithm Tuning (DTAT), now holds forth the promise of individualized  MTDi dosing. Relative to such individualized dosing, current  one-size-fits-all dosing practices amount to a constraint that imposes costs on society. This paper estimates the magnitude of these costs.\\n\\nMethodsSimulated dose titration as in (Norris 2017) is extended to 1000 subjects, yielding an empirical MTDi distribution to which a gamma density is fitted. Individual-level efficacy, in terms of the probability of achieving remission, is assumed to be an Emax-type function of dose relative to MTDi, scaled (arbitrarily) to identify MTDi with the LD50 of the individuals tumor. (Thus, a criterion 50% of the population achieve remission under individualized dosing in this analysis.) Current practice is modeled such that all patients receive a first-cycle dose at  the MTD, and those for whom MTDi < MTDthe experience a  dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) that aborts subsequent cycles. Therapy thus terminated is assumed to confer no benefit. Individuals for whom MTDi[&ge;] MTDthe tolerate a full treatment course, and achieve remission with probability determined by the Emax curve evaluated at MTDthe/MTDi. A closed-form expression is obtained for the population remission rate, and maximized numerically over MTDthe as a free parameter, thus identifying the best result achievable under one-size-fits-all dosing. A sensitivity analysis is performed, using both a perturbation of the assumed Emax function, and an antipodal alternative specification.\\n\\nResultsSimulated MTDi follow a gamma distribution with shape parameter  {approx} 1.75. The population remission rate under one-size-fits-all dosing at the maximizing value of MTDthe proves to be a function of the shape parameter--and thus the coefficient of variation (CV)--of the gamma distribution of MTDi. Within a plausible range of CV(MTDi), one-size-fits-all dosing wastes approximately half of the drugs population-level efficacy. In the sensitivity analysis, sensitivity to the perturbation proves to be of second order. The alternative exposure-efficacy specification likewise leaves all results intact.\\n\\nConclusionsThe CV of MTDi determines the efficacy lost under one-size-fits-all dosing at  the MTD. Within plausible ranges for this CV, failure to individualize dosing can effectively halve a drugs value to society. In a competitive environment dominated by regulatory hurdles, this may reduce the value of shareholders investment in the drug to zero.\\n\\nEpilogueThe main result on one-size-fits-all dosing is generalized to regimens with several dose levels. Implications for the ongoing ALTA-1L trial are briefly explored; the 2 dose levels in the brigatinib arm of this trial may lend it a competitive advantage over the single-dose crizotinib arm.",

Answers have been limited by the difficulty of directly measuring growth at the single cell level. Here we report direct measurement of single cell volumes over complete cell division cycles. The volume added across the cell cycle was independent of cell birth size, a size homeostasis behavior called \\\"adder\\\". Single-cell growth curves revealed that the homeostatic behavior relied on adaptation of G1 duration as well as growth rate modulations. We developed a general mathematical framework that characterizes size homeostasis behaviors.

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are a widely distributed, diverse group of photosynthetic bacteria that exhibit phototaxis, or motion in response to light. Cyanobacteria such as Synechocystis sp. secrete a mixture of complex polysaccharides that facilitate cell motion, while their type 4 pili allow them to physically attach to each other. Even though cells can respond individually to light, colonies of such bacteria are observed to move collectively towards the light source in dense finger-like projections. Agent-based models are especially useful in connecting individual cell behaviour with the emergent collective phenomena that arise out of their interactions. We present an agent-based model for cyanobacterial phototaxis that accounts for slime deposition as well as for direct physical links between bacteria, mediated through their type 4 pili. We reproduce the experimentally observed aggregation of cells at the colony boundary as a precursor to finger formation. Our model also describes the changes in colony morphology that occur when the location of the light source is abruptly changed. We find that the overall motion of cells toward light remains relatively unimpaired even if a fraction of them do not sense light, allowing heterogeneous populations to continue to mount a robust collective response to stimuli. Our work suggests that in addition to bio-chemical signalling via diffusible molecules in the context of bacterial quorum-sensing, short-ranged physical interactions may also contribute to collective effects in bacterial motility.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMany developmental disorders are associated with deficits in controlling and regulating behaviour. These difficulties are frequently observed across multiple groups of children including children with diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), specific learning difficulties, autistic spectrum disorder, or conduct disorder. The co-occurrence of these behavioural problems across disorders typically leads to comorbid diagnoses and can complicate intervention approaches. An alternative to classifying children on the basis of specific diagnostic criteria is to use a data-driven grouping that identifies dimensions of behaviour that meaningfully distinguish groups of children.\\n\\nMethodsThe sample consisted of 442 children identified by health and educational professionals as having difficulties in attention, learning and/or memory. The current study applied community clustering, a data-driven clustering algorithm, to group children by similarities across scales on a commonly used rating scale, the Conners-3 questionnaire. Further, the current study investigated if the groups identified by the data-driven algorithm could be identified by white matter connectivity using a structural connectomics approach combined with partial least squares analysis.\\n\\nResultsThe data-driven clustering yielded three distinct groups of children with symptoms of either: (1) elevated inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, and poor executive function, (2) learning problems, and (3) aggressive behaviour and problems with peer relationships. These groups were associated with significant inter-individual variation in white matter connectivity of the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex.\\n\\nConclusionIn sum, data-driven classification of executive function difficulties identifies stable groups of children, provides a good account of inter-individual differences, and aligns closely with underlying neurobiological substrates.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic relationships among the basal orders of winged insects remain unclear, in particular the relationship of the Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and the Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) with the Neoptera. Insect evolution is thought to have followed rapid divergence in the distant past and phylogenetic reconstruction may therefore be susceptible to problems of taxon sampling, choice of outgroup, marker selection, and tree reconstruction method. Here we newly sequenced three mitochondrial genomes representing the two most diverse families of the Ephemeroptera, one of which is a basal lineage of the order. We then used an additional 90 insect mitochondrial genomes to reconstruct their phylogeny using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. Bayesian analysis supported a basal Odonata hypothesis, with Ephemeroptera as sister group to the remaining insects. This was only supported when using an optimized data matrix from which rogue taxa and terminals affected by long-branch attraction were removed. None of our analyses supported a basal Ephemeroptera hypothesis or Ephemeroptera + Odonata as monophyletic clade sister to other insects (i.e., the Palaeoptera hypothesis). Our newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes of Baetis rutilocylindratus, Cloeon dipterum, and Habrophlebiodes zijinensis had a complete set of protein coding genes and a conserved orientation except for two inverted tRNAs in H. zijinensis. Increased mayfly sampling, removal of problematic taxa, and a Bayesian phylogenetic framework were needed to infer phylogenetic relationships within the three ancient insect lineages of Odonata, Ephemeroptera, and Neoptera. Pruning of rogue taxa improved the number of supported nodes in all phylogenetic trees. Our results add to previous evidence for the Odonata hypothesis and indicate that the phylogenetic resolution of the basal insects can be resolved with more data and sampling effort.",

    "abstract": "The anatomical connections of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) have driven hypotheses about its functional anatomy, including the hypothesis that the precise anatomical location of STN deep brain stimulation (DBS) determines the variability of motor and non-motor responses across Parkinson disease (PD) patients. We previously tested that hypothesis using a three-dimensional (3D) statistical method to interpret the acute effects of unilateral DBS at each patients clinically optimized DBS settings and active contact. Here we report a similar analysis from a new study in which DBS parameters were standardized and DBS locations were chosen blind to clinical response. In 74 individuals with PD and STN DBS, STN contacts were selected near the dorsal and ventral border of the STN contralateral to the more affected side of the body. Participants were tested off PD medications in each of 3 conditions (ventral STN DBS, dorsal STN DBS and DBS off) for acute effects on mood, apathy, working memory, response inhibition and motor function. Voltage, frequency, and pulse width were standardized, and participants and raters were blind to condition. In a categorical analysis, both dorsal and ventral STN DBS improved mean motor function without affecting cognitive measures. Dorsal STN DBS induced greater improvement in rigidity than ventral STN DBS, whereas ventral STN DBS was more effective for improving anxiety and mood. In the 3D analysis, contact location was significant only for bradykinesia and resting tremor, with the greatest improvement occurring with DBS in dorsal STN and zona incerta. These results provide new, direct functional evidence for the anatomically-derived model of STN using the novel 3D analysis, in which motor function is most represented in dorsal STN. However, our data suggest that functional segregation between motor and non-motor areas of the STN is limited, since locations that induced improvements in motor function and mood overlapped substantially.",

However, accurately inferring information from SPT studies is challenging due to biases in both data analysis and experimental design. To address analysis bias, we introduce \\\"Spot-On\\\", an intuitive web-interface. Spot-On implements a kinetic modeling framework that accounts for known biases, including molecules moving out-of-focus, and robustly infers diffusion constants and subpopulations from pooled single-molecule trajectories. To minimize inherent experimental biases, we implement and validate stroboscopic photo-activation SPT (spaSPT), which minimizes motion-blur bias and tracking errors. We validate Spot-On using experimentally realistic simulations and show that Spot-On outperforms other methods. We then apply Spot-On to spaSPT data from live mammalian cells spanning a wide range of nuclear dynamics and demonstrate that Spot-On consistently and robustly infers subpopulation fractions and diffusion constants.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTSpot-On is an easy-to-use website that makes a rigorous and bias-corrected modeling framework for analysis of single-molecule tracking experiments available to all.",

    "abstract": "IRX3 homeobox transcription factor plays a role in neural development and in the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance. T lymphocytes play an essential role in the pathogenesis of obesity and their expansion and differentiation is a tightly controlled process. Circulating cytokines trough activation of cell death mechanisms controls the number of CD4 and CD8 T cells, and failure to activate apoptosis is considered the main cause for their uncontrolled expansion. Here, the identification an essential anti-apoptotic pathway in T lymphocytes is presented, whereby IL-15 activation of Stat/Jak signaling cascade leads to induction of the IRX3 expression. IRX3, in turn, promotes T cells survival and self-renewal, at least partially, by controlling the expression of T-bet transcription factor eomesodermin (EOMES). The Stat/Jak signaling inhibition by Jak inhibitor 1 suppresses IRX3 transcription in T lymphocytes and tumor cell lines and increases apoptosis after growth factor deprivation. Our results demonstrate that IRX3 is essential in T lymphocytes differentiation and reveal that the IL-15-dependent IRX3 pro-survival pathway provides potential therapeutic target for regulation of T cell proliferation that has implications for immune cell malignancies, obesity and autoimmune diseases.",

The recent rapid spread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health emergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted mainly by the mosquito Aedes aegypti that also vectors dengue virus, however little is known about the interactions of the virus with the mosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of whole Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in response to ZIKV infection at 2, 7, and 14 days post-infection using RNA-Seq. Results showed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at each time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly changed among the three time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that most of the altered genes are involved in metabolic process, cellular process and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic non-coding RNAs were identified that were altered upon ZIKV infection. Further, we found correlational changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes with that of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic understanding of Ae. aegypti responses to ZIKV and helps to determine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host anti-viral response against the virus.\\n\\nImportanceVector-borne viruses pose great risks on human health. Zika virus has recently emerged as a global threat, rapidly expanding its distribution. Understanding the interactions of the virus with mosquito vectors at the molecular level is vital for devising new approaches in inhibiting virus transmission. In this study, we embarked on analyzing the transcriptional response of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to Zika virus infection. Results showed large changes both in coding and long non-coding RNAs. Analysis of these genes showed similarities with other flaviviruses, including dengue virus, which is transmitted by the same mosquito vector. The outcomes provide a global picture of changes in the mosquito vector in response to Zika virus infection.",

    "abstract": "The lifetime development of the waggle dance of 14 honeybees was automatically recorded just after the imaginal molt using high-definition camera modules connected with a Raspberry Pi computer and numbered radio-frequency identification tags fitted to the back of each bee. For most honeybees, waggle dance follow preceded the appearance of the first waggle dance from 1 week after the imaginal molt. The duration per trip increased just after waggle dance follow. Before the appearance of the first waggle dance, the honeybee repeatedly follows waggle dances that indicate a limited number (2-6) of food source locations. We discriminated between two types of foragers with different roles, recruits and novice scouts, by comparing the vectors indicated by the bees first waggle dance (sending vectors) with dances they had previously followed (received vectors). Of 14 tagged honeybees, 11 were categorized as recruits and 2 as novice scouts. For recruits (but not for novice scouts), the duration per trip increased significantly after waggle dances follow and substantially increased just before the appearance of the first waggle dance. Moreover, recruits increased the number of times they followed waggle dances indicating the same location, and their first waggle dance indicated this location. These results suggest that the differentiation of these two types of foragers is partly related to behavioral differences after waggle dance follows: whether trip is activated or not by follows a waggle dance.\\n\\nSummary statementBecause of technological difficulties, there are no studies comparing the development of recruit and scout waggle dances.

Accurate identification of pneumococcal serotypes is important for tracking the distribution and evolution of serotypes following the introduction of effective vaccines.

    "abstract": "BackgroundSWI/SNF is a large heterogenous multi-subunit chromatin remodeling complex. It consists of multiple sets of mutually exclusive components. Understanding how loss of one sibling of a mutually exclusive pair affects the occupancy and function of the remaining complex is needed to understand how mutations in a particular subunit might affect tumor formation. Recently, we showed that the members of the ARID family of SWI/SNF subunits (ARID1A, ARID1B, and ARID2) had complex transcriptional relationships including both antagonism and cooperativity. However, it remains unknown how loss of the catalytic subunit(s) affects the binding and genome-wide occupancy of the remainder complex and how changes in occupancy affect transcriptional output.\\n\\nResultsWe addressed this gap by depleting BRG1 and BRM, the two ATPase subunits in SWI/SNF, and characterizing the changes to chromatin occupancy of the remaining subunit and related this to transcription changes induced by loss of the ATPase subunits. We show that depletion of one subunit frequently leads to loss of the remaining subunit. This could cause either positive or negative changes in gene expression. At a subset of sites the sibling subunit is either retained or gained. Additionally, we show genome-wide that BRG1 and BRM have both cooperative and antagonistic interactions with respect to transcription. Importantly, at genes where BRG1 and BRM antagonise one another we observe a nearly complete rescue of gene expression changes in the combined BRG/BRM double knockdown.\\n\\nConclusionThis series of experiments demonstrate that mutually exclusive SWI/SNF complexes have heterogenous functional relationships and highlights the importance of considering the role of the remaining SWI/SNF complexes following loss or depletion of a single subunit.",

    "abstract": "In absence of efficient ways to test drug stability and efficacy, pharmaceuticals that have been stored outside of set temperature conditions are destroyed, often at great cost. This is especially problematic for biotherapeutics, which are highly sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Current platforms for assessing the stability of protein-based biotherapeutics in high throughput and in low volumes are unavailable outside of research and development laboratories and are not efficient for use in production, quality control, distribution, or clinical settings. In these alternative environments, microanalysis platforms could provide significant advantages for the characterization of biotherapeutic degradation. Here we present particle diffusometry (PD), a new technique to study degradation of biotherapeutic solutions. PD uses a simple microfluidic chip and microscope setup to calculate the Brownian motion of particles in a quiescent solution using a variation of particle image velocimetry (PIV) fundamentals. We show that PD can be used to measure the viscosity of protein solutions to discriminate intact protein from degraded samples as well as to determine the change in viscosity as a function of therapeutic concentration. PD viscosity analysis is applied to two particularly important biotherapeutic preparations: insulin, a commonly used protein for diabetic patients, and monoclonal antibodies which are an emerging class of biotherapeutics used to treat a variety of diseases such as autoimmune disorders and cancer. PD-based characterization of solution viscosity is a new tool for biotherapeutic analysis, and owing to its easy setup could readily be implemented at key points of the pharmaceutical delivery chain and in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "The high-throughput capacities of the Illumina sequencing platforms and possibility to label samples individually have encouraged a wide use of sample multiplexing. However, this practice results in read misassignment (usually <1%) across samples sequenced on the same lane. Alarmingly high rates of read misassignment of up to 10% were reported for the latest generation of lllumina sequencing machines. This potentially calls into question previously generated results and may make future use of the newest generation of platforms prohibitive. In this study we rely on barcodes, short sequences that are directly ligated to both ends of the DNA insert, which allows us to quantify the amount of index hopping. Correcting for multiple sources of noise, we identify on average only 0.470% of reads containing a hopped index. Multiplexing of samples on this platform is therefore unlikely to cause markedly different results to those obtained from older platforms.",

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of red fluorescence in fish, much effort has been made to elucidate its potential contribution to vision. However, whatever that function might be, it always implies that the combination of red fluorescence and reflectance of the red iris is sufficient to generate a visual contrast. Here, we present in vivo iris radiance measurements of T. delaisi under natural light fields at 5 and 20 m depth. We also took substrate radiance measurements of shaded and exposed foraging sites at those depths. To assess the visual contrast that can be generated by the red iris, we then calculated iris brightness in the 600-650 nm \\\"red\\\" waveband relative to substrate radiance. At 20 m depth, T. delaisi iris radiance substantially exceeded substrate radiance in the red waveband, regardless of exposure, and despite substrate fluorescence. Given that downwelling light in the 600-650 nm range is negligible at this depth, we can attribute this effect to iris fluorescence. As expected, contrasts were much weaker in 5 m - despite the added contribution of iris reflectance, but we identified specific substrates and conditions under which the pooled radiance caused by red reflectance and fluorescence still exceeded substrate radiance in the same waveband. Due to the negative effect of anesthesia on iris fluorescence these estimates are conservative. We conclude that the requirements to create visual brightness contrasts are fulfilled for a wide range of conditions in the natural environment of T. delaisi.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression changes have been recognized as important drivers of adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Little is known about the relative roles of plastic and evolutionary responses in complex gene expression networks during the early stages of divergence. Large gene expression data sets coupled with in silico methods for identifying co-expressed modules now enable systems genetics approaches also in non-model species for better understanding of gene expression responses during early divergence. Here, we combined gene co-expression analyses with population genetics to separate plastic and population (evolutionary) effects in expression networks using small salmonid populations as a model system. We show that plastic and population effects were highly variable among the six identified modules and that the plastic effects explained larger proportion of the total eigengene expression than population effects. A more detailed analysis of the population effects using a QST - FST comparison across 16622 annotated transcripts revealed that gene expression followed neutral expectations within modules and at the global level. Furthermore, two modules showed enrichment for genes coding for early developmental traits that have been previously identified as important phenotypic traits in thermal responses in the same model system indicating that co-expression analysis can capture expression patterns underlying ecologically important traits. We suggest that module-specific responses may facilitate the flexible tuning of expression levels to local thermal conditions. Overall, our study indicates that plasticity and neutral evolution are the main drivers of gene expression variance in the early stages of thermal adaptation in this system.",

We examined genetic correlations of PA with other traits and diseases, as well as tissue-specific gene expression patterns. With data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC; n=8,556) study, we performed a meta-analysis of our top hits for moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA).\\n\\nResultsWe identified 26 genome-wide loci across the five PA measures examined. Upon meta-analysis of the top hits for MVPA with results from the ARIC study, 8 of 10 remained significant at p<5x10-8. Interestingly, among these, the rs429358 variant in the APOE gene was the most strongly associated with MVPA. Variants in CADM2, a gene recently implicated in risk-taking behavior and other personality and cognitive traits, were found to be associated with regular engagement in strenuous sports or other exercises. We also identified thirteen loci consistently associated (p<0.005) with each of the five PA measures. We find genetic correlations of PA with educational attainment traits, chronotype, psychiatric traits, and obesity-related traits. Tissue enrichment analyses implicate the brain and pituitary gland as locations where PA-associated loci may exert their actions.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results provide new insight into the genetic basis of habitual PA, and the genetic links connecting PA with other traits and diseases.",

    "abstract": "Tim-3 is highly expressed on a subset of T cells during T cell exhaustion, in settings of chronic viral infection and tumors (1, 2). Using LCMV Clone-13, a model for chronic infection, we have found that Tim-3 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of T cell exhaustion. Nonetheless, expression of Tim-3 was sufficient to drive resistance to PD-L1 blockade therapy during chronic infection. Strikingly, expression of Tim-3 promoted development of short-term effector T cells, at the expense of memory precursor development, after acute LCMV infection. These effects were accompanied by increased Akt/mTOR signaling in T cells expressing endogenous or ectopic Tim-3. Conversely, Akt/mTOR signaling was reduced in effector T cells from Tim-3 deficient mice. Thus, Tim-3 is essential for optimal effector T cell responses, but may also contribute to exhaustion, by restricting development of long-lived memory T cells, including PD-1int \\\"stem-like\\\" exhausted T cells that expand during PD-1 pathway blockade. Taken together, our results suggest that Tim-3 is actually more similar to co-stimulatory receptors that are upregulated after T cell activation, rather than a dominant inhibitory protein like PD-1. These findings have significant implications for the development of anti-Tim-3 antibodies as therapeutic agents.\\n\\nSignificanceDuring a chronic viral infection, prolonged exposure to viral antigens leads to dysfunction or \\\"exhaustion\\\" of T cells specific to the virus, a condition also observed in T cells that infiltrate tumors. The exhausted state is associated with expression of specific cell-surface proteins, some of which may inhibit T cell activation. Expression of Tim-3 is associated with acquisition of T cell exhaustion, although it is also expressed transiently during acute infection. Here we provide evidence that a major function of Tim-3 is to enhance T cell activation, during either acute or chronic viral infection. However, Tim-3 is not required for development of exhaustion. Thus, we propose that Tim-3 would be better described as a stimulatory, rather than inhibitory, protein.",

    "abstract": "The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen leader protein (EBNA-LP) is the first viral latency-associated protein produced after EBV infection of resting B cells. Its role in B cell transformation is poorly defined, but it is reported to enhance gene activation by the EBV protein EBNA2 in vitro.\\n\\nWe generated two sets of EBNA-LP knockout (LPKO) EBVs containing a STOP codon within each repeat unit of IR1. Intronic mutations in the first of these knockouts suggested a role for the EBV sisRNAs in transformation. LPKOs with intact introns established lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from adult B cells at reduced efficiency, but umbilical cord B cells, and naive (IgD+, CD27-) adult B cells consistently died approximately two weeks after infection with LPKO, failing to establish LCLs.\\n\\nQuantitative PCR analysis of virus gene expression after infection identified both an altered ratio of the EBNA genes, and a dramatic reduction in transcript levels of both EBNA2-regulated virus genes (LMP1 and LMP2) and the EBNA2-independent EBER genes, particularly in the first 1-2 weeks. By 30 days post infection, these levels had equalised. In contrast, EBNA2-regulated host genes were induced efficiently by LPKO viruses. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that recruitment of EBNA2 and the host factors EBF1 and RBPJ to all latency promoters tested was severely delayed, whereas these same factors were recruited efficiently to several host genes, some of which exhibited increased EBNA2 recruitment.\\n\\nWe conclude that EBNA-LP does not simply co-operate with EBNA2 in activating gene transcription, but rather facilitates the recruitment of several transcription factors to the viral genome, to enable transcription of virus latency genes. Additionally, our findings suggest that different properties of EBV may have differing importance in transforming different B cell subsets.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects almost everyone. Once infected, people harbor the virus for life, shedding it in saliva. Infection of children is asymptomatic, but a first infection during adolescence or adulthood can cause glandular fever (mono). EBV is also implicated in several different cancers. EBV infection of B cells (the immune cell that produces antibodies) can drive them to replicate almost indefinitely ( transformation), generating cell lines. We have investigated the role of a virus protein - EBNA-LP - which is thought to support gene activation by the essential virus protein EBNA2.\\n\\nWe have made an EBV in which the EBNA-LP gene has been disrupted. This virus (LPKO) shows several properties. 1. It is reduced in its ability to transform adult cells, while immature B cells (more frequent in the young) die two weeks after LPKO infection. 2. Some virus genes fail to turn on immediately after LPKO infection. 3. Binding of EBNA2 to these genes is delayed, as is binding of some cellular factors. 4. EBNA-LP does not affect EBNA2-targeted cellular genes in the same way.\\n\\nThis shows that EBNA-LP is more important in immature cells, and that it regulates virus genes - but not host genes - more widely than simply through EBNA2.",

In this article, we conduct a comprehensive review of prior research on structural connectivity in social neuroscience and highlight the importance of this literature in clarifying brain mechanisms of social cognition. We pay particular attention to the research on three key social processes: face processing, embodied cognition, and theory of mind, and their respective underlying neural networks. To fully identify and characterize the anatomical architecture of these networks, we further implement probabilistic tractography on a large sample of diffusion-weighted imaging data. The combination of an in-depth literature review and the empirical investigation gives us an unprecedented, well-defined landscape of WM pathways underlying major social brain networks. Finally, we discuss current problems in the field, outline suggestions for best practice in diffusion imaging data collection and analysis, and offer new directions for future research.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "In a dynamic world, accurate beliefs about the environment are vital for survival, and individuals should therefore regularly seek out new information with which to update their beliefs. This aspect of behaviour is not well captured by standard theories of decision making, and the neural mechanisms of information seeking remain unclear. One recent theory posits that valuation of information results from representation of informative stimuli within canonical neural reward-processing circuits, even if that information lacks instrumental use. We investigated this question by recording EEG from twenty-three human participants performing a non-instrumental information-seeking task. In this task, participants could pay a monetary cost to receive advance information about the likelihood of receiving reward in a lottery at the end of each trial. Behavioural results showed that participants were willing to incur considerable monetary costs to acquire early but non-instrumental information. Analysis of the event-related potential elicited by informative cues revealed that the feedback-related negativity independently encoded both an information prediction error and a reward prediction error. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that information seeking results from processing of information within neural reward circuits, and suggests that information may represent a distinct dimension of valuation in decision making under uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe detection of fabrication or error within the scientific literature is an important and underappreciated problem. Retraction of scientific articles is rare, but retraction may also be conservative, leaving open the possiblity that many fabricated or erroneous findings remain in the literature as a result of lack of scrutiny. A recently statistical analysis of randomized controlled trials [1] has suggested that the reported statistics form these trials deviate substantially from expectation under truely random assignment, raising the possiblity of fraud or error. It has also been proposed that the method used could be implemented to prospectively screen research, for example by applying the method prior to publication.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsTo assess the properties of the method proposed in [1], I carry out both theoretical and empirical evaluations of the method. Simulations suggest that the method is sensitive to assumptions that could reasonably be violated in real randomized controlled trials. This suggests that deviation for expectation under this method can not be used to measure the extent of fraud or error within the literature, and raises questions about the utlity of the method for propsective screening. Empirically analysis of the results of the method on a large set of randomized trials suggests that important assumptions may plausibly be violated within this sample. Using retraction as a proxy for fraud or serious error, I show that the method faces serious challenges in terms of precision and sensitivity for the purposes of screening, and that the performance of the method as a screening tool may vary across journals and classes of retractions.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results in [1] should not be interpreted as indicating large amount of fraud or error within the literature. The use of this method for screening of the literature should be undertaken with great caution, and should recognize critical challenges in interpreting the results of this method.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative breeding is characterized by reproduction in the presence of helpers. What impact these helpers have on the reproductive success of group members is one of the long-standing questions in the cooperative breeding literature. In cooperative species, helpers are known to provide benefits during multiple stages or at a particular stage of the reproductive cycle. The aim of this study was to investigate whether helpers increased the daily survival rate of nests during the incubation stage in the Southern Lapwing (Vanellus chilensis), a crested plover with a cooperative breeding system. Southern Lapwings have a variable mating system, with some breeding groups composed of unassisted pairs, and others that breed in the presence of helpers. Our best supported model indicated a positive effect of the presence of helpers on the daily survival rate of nests, leading to a probability of nest success (i.e., survival until hatching) of 83%, compared to 51% for nests of unassisted pairs. But a null model had a similar model weight as the best supported model and was the second-best model. Our study provides evidence that helpers influence egg survival during the egg-incubation stage, which could influence the fitness of breeders.",

    "abstract": "Soluble huntingtin exon 1 (Httex1) with expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) engenders neurotoxicity in Huntingtons disease. To uncover the physical basis of this toxicity, we performed structural studies of soluble Httex1 for wild type and mutant polyQ lengths. Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments show evidence for conformational rigidity across the polyQ region. In contrast, hydrogen-deuterium exchange shows absence of backbone amide protection, suggesting negligible persistence of hydrogen bonds. The seemingly conflicting results are explained by all-atom simulations, which show that Httex1 adopts tadpole-like structures with a globular head encompassing the N-terminal amphipathic and polyQ regions and the tail encompassing the C-terminal proline-rich region. The surface area of the globular domain increases monotonically with polyQ length. This stimulates sharp increases in gain-of-function interactions in cells for expanded polyQ, and one of these interactions is with the stress-granule protein Fus. Our results highlight plausible connections between Httex1 structure and routes to neurotoxicity.",

However, none of the genes for nepetalactone biosynthesis have been discovered. Here we report the transcriptomes of two Nepeta species, each with distinctive profiles of nepetalactone stereoisomers. As a starting point for investigation of nepetalactone biosynthesis in Nepeta, these transcriptomes were used to identify candidate genes for iridoid synthase homologs, an enzyme that has been shown to form the core iridoid skeleton in several iridoid producing plant species. Iridoid synthase homologs identified from the transcriptomes were cloned, heterologously expressed, and then assayed with the 8-oxogeranial substrate. These experiments revealed that catalytically active iridoid synthase enzymes are present in Nepeta, though there are unusual mutations in key active site residues. Nevertheless, these enzymes exhibit similar catalytic activity and product profile compared to previously reported iridoid synthases from other plants. Notably, four nepetalactone stereoisomers with differing stereochemistry at the 4 and 7 positions - which are generated during the iridoid synthase reaction - are observed at different ratios in various Nepeta species. This work strongly suggests that the variable stereochemistry at these 4 and 7 positions of nepetalactone diastereomers is established further downstream in the iridoid pathway in Nepeta. Overall, this work provides a gateway into the biosynthesis of nepetalactones in Nepeta.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LISpecies within the Nepeta genus (such as catnip) produce nepetalactone iridoids\\nC_LIO_LIThe enzymes that produce the iridoid scaffold of nepetalactone were identified from two species of Nepeta\\nC_LIO_LIThe iridoid synthase enzymes are not responsible for the stereochemical variation in these iridoids\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cells require some metals, such as zinc and manganese, but excess levels of these metals can be toxic. As a result, cells have evolved complex mechanisms for maintaining metal homeostasis and surviving metal intoxication. Here, we present the results of a large-scale functional genomic screen in Drosophila cultured cells for modifiers of zinc chloride toxicity, together with transcriptomics data for wildtype or genetically zinc-sensitized cells challenged with mild zinc chloride supplementation. Altogether, we identified 47 genes for which knockdown conferred sensitivity or resistance to toxic zinc or manganese chloride treatment, and more than 1800 putative zinc-responsive genes. Analysis of the  omics data points to the relevance of ion transporters, glutathione-related factors, and conserved disease-associated genes in zinc detoxification. Specific genes identified in the zinc screen include orthologs of human disease-associated genes CTNS, PTPRN (also known as IA-2), and ATP13A2 (also known as PARK9). We show that knockdown of red dog mine (rdog; CG11897), a candidate zinc detoxification gene encoding an ABCC-type transporter family protein related to yeast cadmium factor (YCF1), confers sensitivity to zinc intoxication in cultured cells and that rdog is transcriptionally up-regulated in response to zinc stress. As there are many links between the biology of zinc and other metals and human health, the  omics datasets presented here provide a resource that will allow researchers to explore metal biology in the context of diverse health-relevant processes.",

    "abstract": "Genomic material within the nucleus is folded into successive layers in order to package and organize the long string of linear DNA. This hierarchical level of folding is closely associated with transcriptional regulation and DNA replication. Microscopic studies concluded that genome organization inside the nucleus is not random and chromosomes within the nucleus create territories1. More recent chromosome conformation studies have revealed that mammalian chromosomes are structured into tissue-invariant topologically associating domains (TADs) where the DNA within a given domain interacts more frequently together than with regions in other domains2,3. Genes within the same TADs represent similar expression and histone-modification profiles4. In addition, enhancer-promoter pairs within the same TAD respond similarly to hormone induction5 or differentiation cues6. Therefore, regions separating different TADs (boundaries) have important roles in reinforcing the stability of these domain-wide features. Indeed, TAD boundary disruptions in human genetic disorders7,8 or human cancers lead to misregulation of certain genes9,10, due to de novo enhancer exposure to promoters. Here, to understand effects and distributions of somatic structural variations across TADs, we utilized single nucleotide variations, deletions, inversions, tandem-duplications and complex rearrangements from 2658 high-coverage whole genome sequencing data across various cancer types with paired normal samples. We comprehensively profiled structural variations with respect to their effect on TAD boundaries, on the regulation of genes in human cancers.",

Increased rates of translation elongation of the N-terminal sequence of these integral membrane proteins can divert the nascent protein chains to the ribosome-associated complex (RAC) and Stress-Seventy Subfamily B (Ssb) chaperones.

    "abstract": "PurposeDNA methylation is a well characterized epigenetic repressor of mRNA transcription in many plant and vertebrate systems. However, the mechanism of this repression is not fully understood. The process of synthesizing a strand of RNA from DNA, or transcription, is controlled by proteins that regulate RNA polymerase activity by binding to specific gene regulatory sequences. Cone-rod homeobox (CRX) is a well-characterized mammalian transcription factor that controls photoreceptor cell specific gene expression. While much is known about the functions and DNA binding specificity of CRX, less is known about how DNA methylation modulates CRX binding affinity to genomic cis-regulatory elements.\\n\\nMethodsWe used bisulfite pyrosequencing of human ocular tissues to measure DNA methylation levels of the regulatory regions of RHO, PDE6B, PAX6, and LINE. To describe the molecular mechanism of repression, we used molecular modeling to illustrate the effect of DNA methylation on human RHO regulatory sequences.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we demonstrate an inverse correlation between DNA methylation in regulatory regions adjacent to the human RHO and PDE6B genes and their subsequent transcription in human ocular tissues. Docking of CRX to our DNA models shows that CRX interacts with the grooves of these sequences, suggesting changes in groove structure could regulate binding. Molecular dynamics simulations of the RHO promoter and enhancer regions show changes in the flexibility and groove width upon epigenetic modification. Models also demonstrate that changes to the local dynamics of CRX binding sites within RHO regulatory sequences which may account for the repression of CRX dependent transcription.\\n\\nConclusionCollectively, these data demonstrate epigenetic regulation of CRX binding sites in human retinal tissue and provide insight into the mechanism of this mode of epigenetic regulation to be tested in future experiments.",

To clarify its physiological effects, we acquired fMRI whilst simultaneously acquiring TDCS to the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) of healthy human participants, a region involved in coordinating activity within brain networks. TDCS caused widespread modulation of network activity depending on brain state ( rest or choice reaction time task) and polarity (anodal or cathodal). During task, TDCS increased salience network activation and default mode network deactivation, but had the opposite effect during  rest. Furthermore, there was an interaction between brain state and TDCS polarity, with cathodal effects more pronounced during task performance and anodal effects more pronounced during  rest. Overall, we show that rIFG TDCS produces brain state and polarity dependent effects within large-scale cognitive networks, in a manner that goes beyond predictions from the current literature.",

    "abstract": "The efficient coding hypothesis, which proposes that neurons are optimized to maximize information about the environment, has provided a guiding theoretical framework for sensory and systems neuroscience. More recently, a theory known as the Bayesian Brain hypothesis has focused on the brains ability to integrate sensory and prior sources of information in order to perform Bayesian inference. However, there is as yet no comprehensive theory connecting these two theoretical frameworks. We bridge this gap by formalizing a Bayesian theory of efficient coding. We define Bayesian efficient codes in terms of four basic ingredients: (1) a stimulus prior distribution; (2) an encoding model; (3) a capacity constraint, specifying a neural resource limit; and (4) a loss function, quantifying the desirability or undesirability of various posterior distributions. Classic efficient codes can be seen as a special case in which the loss function is the posterior entropy, leading to a code that maximizes mutual information, but alternate loss functions give solutions that differ dramatically from information-maximizing codes. In particular, we show that decorrelation of sensory inputs, which is optimal under classic efficient codes in low-noise settings, can be disadvantageous for loss functions that penalize large errors. Bayesian efficient coding therefore enlarges the family of normatively optimal codes and provides a more general framework for understanding the design principles of sensory systems. We examine Bayesian efficient codes for linear receptive fields and nonlinear input-output functions, and show that our theory invites reinterpretation of Laughlins seminal analysis of efficient coding in the blowfly visual system.\n\nOne of the primary goals of theoretical neuroscience is to understand the functional organization of neurons in the early sensory pathways and the principles governing them. Why do sensory neurons amplify some signals and filter out others? What can explain the particular configurations and types of neurons found in early sensory system? What general principles can explain the solutions evolution has selected for extracting signals from the sensory environment?\n\nTwo of the most influential theories for addressing these questions are the \"efficient coding\" hypothesis and the \"Bayesian brain\" hypothesis. The efficient coding hypothesis, introduced by Attneave and Barlow more than fifty years ago, uses the ideas from Shannons information theory to formulate a theory normatively optimal neural coding [1, 2]. The Bayesian brain hypothesis, on the other hand, focuses on the brains ability to perform Bayesian inference, and can be traced back to ideas from Helmholtz about optimal perceptual inference [3-7].\n\nA substantial literature has sought to alter or expand the original efficient coding hypothesis [5, 8-18], and a large number of papers have considered optimal codes in the context of Bayesian inference [19-26], However, the two theories have never been formally connected within a single, comprehensive theoretical framework. Here we propose to fill this gap by formulating a general Bayesian theory of efficient coding that unites the two hypotheses. We begin by reviewing the key elements of each theory and then describe a framework for unifying them. Our approach involves combining a prior and model-based likelihood function with a neural resource constraint and a loss functional that quantifies what makes for a \"good\" posterior distribution. We show that classic efficient codes arise when we use information-theoretic quantities for these ingredients, but that a much larger family of Bayesian efficient codes can be constructed by allowing these ingredients to vary. We explore Bayesian efficient codes for several important cases of interest, namely linear receptive fields and nonlinear response functions. The latter case was examined in an influential paper by Laughlin that examined contrast coding in the blowfly large monopolar cells (LMCs) [27]; we reanalyze data from this paper and argue that LMC responses are in fact better described as minimizing the average square-root error than as maximizing mutual information.",

    "abstract": "Genetic engineering of plants is at the core of sustainability efforts, natural product synthesis, and agricultural crop engineering. The plant cell wall is a barrier that limits the ease and throughput with which exogenous biomolecules can be delivered to plants. Current delivery methods either suffer from host range limitations, low transformation efficiencies, tissue damage, or unavoidable DNA integration into the host genome. Here, we demonstrate efficient diffusion-based biomolecule delivery into tissues and organs of intact plants of several species with a suite of pristine and chemically-functionalized high aspect ratio nanomaterials. Efficient DNA delivery and strong protein expression without transgene integration is accomplished in Nicotiana benthamiana (Nb), Eruca sativa (arugula), Triticum aestivum (wheat) and Gossypium hirsutum (cotton) leaves and arugula protoplasts. We also demonstrate a second nanoparticle-based strategy in which small interfering RNA (siRNA) is delivered to Nb leaves and silence a gene with 95% efficiency. We find that nanomaterials not only facilitate biomolecule transport into plant cells but also protect polynucleotides from nuclease degradation. Our work provides a tool for species-independent and passive delivery of genetic material, without transgene integration, into plant cells for diverse biotechnology applications.",
