    "abstract": "The excision of introns from pre-mRNA is an essential step in mRNA processing. We developed LeafCutter to study sample and population variation in intron splicing. LeafCutter identifies variable intron splicing events from short-read RNA-seq data and finds alternative splicing events of high complexity. Our approach obviates the need for transcript annotations and circumvents the challenges in estimating relative isoform or exon usage in complex splicing events. LeafCutter can be used both for detecting differential splicing between sample groups, and for mapping splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs). Compared to contemporary methods, we find 1.4-2.1 times more sQTLs, many of which help us ascribe molecular effects to disease-associated variants. Strikingly, transcriptome-wide associations between LeafCutter intron quantifications and 40 complex traits increased the number of associated disease genes at 5% FDR by an average of 2.1-fold as compared to using gene expression levels alone. LeafCutter is fast, scalable, easy to use, and available at https://github.com/davidaknowles/leafcutter.",

    "abstract": "Scientists have been unable to reach a consensus on why organisms age and why they live as long as they do. Here, a multidisciplinary approach was taken in an attempt to understand the root causes of aging. Nonequilibrium thermodynamics may play a previously unappreciated role in determining longevity by governing the dynamics of degradation and renewal within biomolecular ensembles and dictating the inevitability of fidelity loss. The proposed model offers explanations for species longevity trends that have been previously unexplained and for aging-related observations that are considered paradoxical within current paradigms--for example, the elevated damage levels found even in youth within many long-lived species, such as the naked mole-rat. This framework questions whether declining selective pressure is the primary driver of aging, and challenges major tenets of the disposable soma theory. Unifying pertinent principles from diverse disciplines leads to a theoretical framework of biological aging with fewer anomalies, and may be useful in predicting outcomes of experimental attempts to modulate the aging phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Big data offer a great opportunity for nature-based recreation (NbR) mapping and evaluation. However, it is important to determine when and how it is appropriate to use this resource. We used Scotland as a case study to validate the use of data from Flickr as an indicator of NbR on a national scale and at several regional spatial and temporal resolutions. We compared Flickr photographs to visitor statistics in the Cairngorms National Park (CNP) and determined whether temporal variability in photo counts could be explained by known annual estimates of CNP visitor numbers. We then used a unique recent national survey of nature recreation in Scotland to determine whether the spatial distribution of Flickr photos could be explained by known spatial variability in nature use. Following this validation work, we used Flickr data to identify hotspots of wildlife watching in Scotland and investigated how they changed between 2005 and 2015.We found that spatial and temporal patterns in Flickr count are explained by measures of visitation obtained through surveys and that this relationship is reliable down to a 10 Km scale resolution. Our findings have implications for planning and management of NbR as they suggest that photographs uploaded on Flickr reflect patterns of NbR at spatial and temporal scales that are relevant for ecosystem management.",

    "abstract": "MotivationPairwise alignment of nucleotide sequences has previously been carried out using the seed- and-extend strategy, where we enumerate seeds (shared patterns) between sequences and then extend the seeds by Smith-Waterman-like semi-global dynamic programming to obtain full pairwise alignments. With the advent of massively parallel short read sequencers, algorithms and data structures for efficiently finding seeds have been extensively explored. However, recent advances in single-molecule sequencing technologies have enabled us to obtain millions of reads, each of which is orders of magnitude longer than those output by the short-read sequencers, demanding a faster algorithm for the extension step that accounts for most of the computation time required for pairwise local alignment. Our goal is to design a faster extension algorithm suitable for single-molecule sequencers with high sequencing error rates (e.g., 10-15%) and with more frequent insertions and deletions than substitutions.\\n\\nResultsWe propose an adaptive banded dynamic programming algorithm for calculating pairwise semi-global alignment of nucleotide sequences that allows a relatively high insertion or deletion rate while keeping band width relatively low (e.g., 32 or 64 cells) regardless of sequence lengths. Our new algorithm eliminated mutual dependences between elements in a vector, allowing an efficient Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data parallelization. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm runs approximately 5x faster than the extension alignment algorithm in NCBI BLAST+ while retaining similar sensitivity (recall).\\n\\nWe also show that our extension algorithm is more sensitive than the extension alignment routine in DALIGNER, while the computation time is comparable.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe implementation of the algorithm and the benchmarking scripts are available at https://github.com/ocxtal/adaptivebandbench.\\n\\nContactmkasa@edu.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp",

    "abstract": "Force sensing and generation at the tissular and cellular scale is central to many biological events. There is a growing interest in modern cell biology for methods enabling force measurements in vivo. Optical trapping allows non-invasive probing of pico-Newton forces and thus emerged as a promising mean for assessing biomechanics in vivo. Nevertheless, the main obstacles rely in the accurate determination of the trap stiffness in heterogeneous living organisms, at any position where the trap is used. A proper calibration of the trap stiffness is thus required for performing accurate and reliable force measurements in vivo. Here, we introduce a method that overcomes these difficulties by accurately measuring hemodynamic profiles in order to calibrate the trap stiffness. Doing so, and using numerical methods to assess the accuracy of the experimental data, we measured flow profiles and drag forces imposed to trapped red blood cells of living zebrafish embryos. Using treatments enabling blood flow tuning, we demonstrated that such method is powerful in measuring hemodynamic forces in vivo with high accuracy and confidence. Altogether, this study demonstrates the power of optical tweezing in measuring low range hemodynamic forces in vivo and offers an unprecedented tool in both cell and developmental biology.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms driving lineage-specific evolution in both primates and rodents has been hindered by the lack of sister clades with a similar phylogenetic structure having high-quality genome assemblies. Here, we have created chromosome-level assemblies of the Mus caroli and Mus pahari genomes. Together with the Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus genomes, this set of rodent genomes is similar in divergence times to the Hominidae (human-chimpanzee-gorilla-orangutan). By comparing the evolutionary dynamics between the Muridae and Hominidae, we identified punctate events of chromosome reshuffling that shaped the ancestral karyotype of Mus musculus and Mus caroli between 3 to 6 MYA, but that are absent in the Hominidae. In fact, Hominidae show between four-and seven-fold lower rates of nucleotide change and feature turnover in both neutral and functional sequences suggesting an underlying coherence to the Muridae acceleration. Our system of matched, high-quality genome assemblies revealed how specific classes of repeats can play lineage-specific roles in related species. For example, recent LINE activity has remodeled protein-coding loci to a greater extent across the Muridae than the Hominidae, with functional consequences at the species level such as reproductive isolation. Furthermore, we charted a Muridae-specific retrotransposon expansion at unprecedented resolution, revealing how a single nucleotide mutation transformed a specific SINE element into an active CTCF binding site carrier specifically in Mus caroli. This process resulted in thousands of novel, species-specific CTCF binding sites. Our results demonstrate that the comparison of matched phylogenetic sets of genomes will be an increasingly powerful strategy for understanding mammalian biology.",

Cytokinins are adenine-based signaling molecules in plants that have never been shown to participate in signal transduction in other kingdoms of life. Here, we show that cytokinins induce the strong expression of the M. tuberculosis gene, Rv0077c. We found that a TetR-like transcriptional regulator, Rv0078, directly repressed expression of the Rv0077c gene. Strikingly, cytokinin-induced expression of Rv0077c resulted in a loss of acid-fast staining of M. tuberculosis. Although acid-fast staining is thought to be associated with changes in the bacterial cell envelope and virulence, Rv0077c-induced loss of acid-fastness did not affect antibiotic susceptibility or attenuate bacterial growth in mice. Collectively, these findings show cytokinins signal transcriptional changes that affect the M. tuberculosis cell envelope, and that cytokinin signaling is no longer limited to the kingdom plantae.",

    "abstract": "The accurate alignment of brains is fundamental to the statistical sensitivity and spatial localisation of group studies in brain imaging, and cortical surface-based alignment is generally accepted to be superior to volume-based approaches at aligning cortical areas. However, human subjects have considerable variation in cortical folding, and in the location of cortical areas relative to these folds, which makes aligning cortical areas based on folding alone a challenging problem. The Multimodal Surface Matching (MSM) tool is a flexible spherical registration approach that enables accurate registration of surfaces based on a variety of different features. Using MSM, we have previously shown that using areal features such as resting state-networks and myelin maps to drive cross-subject surface alignment improves group task fMRI statistics and map sharpness. However, the initial implementation of MSMs regularisation function did not penalize all forms of surface distortion evenly. In some cases, this allowed peak distortions to exceed neurobiologically plausible limits unless the regularisation strength was increased, in which case this prevented the algorithm from fully maximizing surface alignment. Here, we propose a new regularisation penalty, derived from physically relevant equations of strain (deformation) energy, and demonstrate that its use leads to improved and more robust alignment of multi-modal imaging data. In addition, since spherical warps incorporate projection distortions that are unavoidable when mapping from a convoluted cortical surface to the sphere, we also propose constraints to enforce smooth deformation of cortical anatomies. We test the impact of this approach for longitudinal modeling of cortical development for neonates (born between 32 and 45 weeks) and demonstrate that the proposed method increases the biological interpretability of the distortion fields and improves the statistical significance of population-based analysis relative to other spherical methods.",

Particularly, low perfusion may create hypoxic microenvironment and induce resistant clones. Thus, developing validated imaging approaches that define low perfusion compartments is crucial for clinical management.\\n\\nMethodsA total of 112 newly-diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma patients were prospectively recruited for maximal safe resection. Preoperative MRI included anatomical, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and chemical shift imaging (CSI). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were calculated from DTI and DSC respectively. Using thresholding methods, two low perfusion compartments (ADCH-rCBVL and ADCL-rCBVL) were identified. Volumetric analysis was performed. Lactate and macromolecule/lipid levels were determined from multivoxel spectroscopy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses.\\n\\nResultsTwo compartments displayed higher lactate and macromolecule/lipid levels than normal controls (each P < 0.001), suggesting hypoxic and pro-inflammatory microenvironment. The proportional volume of ADCL-rCBVL compartment was associated with a larger infiltration area (P < 0.001, rho = 0.42). Lower lactate in this compartment was associated with a less invasive phenotype visualized on DTI. Multivariate Cox regression showed higher lactate level in the ADCL-rCBVL compartment was associated with a worse survival (PFS: HR 2.995, P = 0.047; OS: HR 4.974, P = 0.005).\\n\\nConclusionsThe ADCL-rCBVL compartment represent a treatment resistant sub-region associated with glioblastoma invasiveness.

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding the embryonic stem cell (ESC) fate decision between self-renewal and proper differentiation is important for developmental biology and regenerative medicine. Attention has focused on mechanisms involving histone modifications, alternative pre-mRNA splicing, and cell-cycle progression. However, their intricate interrelations and joint contributions to ESC fate decision remain unclear.\\n\\nResultsWe analyze the transcriptomes and epigenomes of human ESC and five types of differentiated cells. We identify thousands of alternatively spliced exons and reveal their development and lineage-dependent characterizations. Several histone modifications show dynamic changes in alternatively spliced exons and three are strongly associated with 52.8% of alternative splicing events upon hESC differentiation. The histone modification-associated alternatively spliced genes predominantly function in G2/M phases and ATM/ATR-mediated DNA damage response pathway for cell differentiation, whereas other alternatively spliced genes are enriched in the G1 phase and pathways for self-renewal. These results imply a potential epigenetic mechanism by which some histone modifications contribute to ESC fate decision through the regulation of alternative splicing in specific pathways and cell-cycle genes. Supported by experimental validations and extended dataset from Roadmap/ENCODE projects, we exemplify this mechanism by a cell cycle-related transcription factor, PBX1, which regulates the pluripotency regulatory network by binding to NANOG. We suggest that the isoform switch from PBX1a to PBX1b links H3K36me3 to hESC fate determination through the PSIP1/SRSF1 adaptor, which results in the exon skipping of PBX1.\\n\\nConclusionWe reveal the mechanism by which alternative splicing links histone modifications to stem cell fate decision.",

This problem is often called the segmentation problem in the field of genomics, and the change-point problem in other scientific disciplines. Despite dozens of algorithms developed to address this problem in genomics research, methods with improved accuracy and speed are still needed to effectively tackle both existing and emerging genomic and epigenomic segmentation problems.\\n\\nResultsWe designed an efficient algorithm, called iSeg, for segmentation of genomic and epigenomic profiles. iSeg first utilizes dynamic programming to identify candidate segments and test for significance. It then uses a novel data structure based on two coupled balanced binary trees to detect overlapping significant segments and update them simultaneously during searching and refinement stages. Refinement and merging of significant segments are performed at the end to generate the final set of segments. By using an objective function based on the p-values of the segments, the algorithm can serve as a general computational framework to be combined with different assumptions on the distributions of the data. As a general segmentation method, it can segment different types of genomic and epigenomic data, such as DNA copy number variation, nucleosome occupancy, nuclease sensitivity, and differential nuclease sensitivity data. Using simple t-tests to compute p-values across multiple datasets of different types, we evaluate iSeg using both simulated and experimental datasets and show that it performs satisfactorily when compared with some other popular methods, which often employ more sophisticated statistical models. Implemented in C++, iSeg is also very computationally efficient, well suited for large numbers of input profiles and data with very long sequences.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have developed an effective and efficient general-purpose segmentation tool for sequential data and illustrated its use in segmentation of genomic and epigenomic profiles.",

As for the catecholamines, we observed that many polysaccharides promote the oxidation of such compounds, particularly in the presence of Cu2+. The reactions were monitored using RP-HPLC and SEC techniques. Melanin-like materials were purified through dialysis and evaluated using UV_Vis and FT_IR spectroscopic techniques. One such material, synthesized from chondroitin sulfate type A and serotonin in the presence of Cu2+ was found to affect the release of IL-l{beta} and IL-6 cytokines from immune cells.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies play an essential role in the immune system of vertebrates and are vital tools in research and diagnostics. While hypervariable regions of antibodies, which are responsible for binding, can be readily identified from their amino acid sequence, it remains challenging to accurately pinpoint which amino acids will be in contact with the antigen (the paratope). In this work, we present a sequence-based probabilistic machine learning algorithm for paratope prediction, named Parapred. Parapred uses a deep-learning architecture to leverage features from both local residue neighbourhoods and across the entire sequence. The method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methodology, and only requires a stretch of amino acid sequence corresponding to a hypervariable region as an input, without any information about the antigen. We further show that our predictions can be used to improve both speed and accuracy of a rigid docking algorithm.

    "abstract": "ObjectivesClinicians in the intensive care unit (ICU) are presented with a large number of physiological data consisting of periodic and frequently sampled measurements, such as heart rate and blood pressure, as well as aperiodic measurements, such as noninvasive blood pressure and laboratory studies. Because this data can be overwhelming, there is considerable interest in designing algorithms that help integrate and interpret this data and assist ICU clinicians in detecting or predicting in advance patients who may be deteriorating. In order to decide whether to deploy such algorithms in a clinical trial, it is important to evaluate these algorithms using retrospective data. However, the fact that these algorithms will be running continuously, i.e., repeatedly sampling incoming patient data, presents some novel challenges for algorithm evaluation. Commonly used measures of performance such as sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) are easily applied to static \\\"snapshots\\\" of patient data, but can be very misleading when applied to indicators or alerting algorithms that are running on continuous data. Our objective is to create a method for evaluating algorithm performance on retrospective data with the algorithm running continuously throughout the patients stay as it would in a real ICU.\\n\\nMethodsWe introduce our evaluation methodology in the context of evaluating an algorithm, a Hemodynamic Instability Indicator (HII), for assisting bedside ICU clinicians with the early detection of hemodynamic instability before the onset of acute hypotension. Each patients ICU stay is divided into segments that are labelled as hemodynamically stable or unstable based on clinician interventions typically aimed at treating hemodynamic instability. These segments can be of varying length with varying degrees of exposure to potential alerts, whether true positive or false positive. Furthermore, to simulate how clinicians might interact with the alerting algorithm, we use a dynamic alert supervision mechanism which suppresses subsequent alerts unless the indicator has significantly deteriorated since the prior alert. Under these conditions determining what counts as a positive or negative instance, and calculations of sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value can be problematic. We introduce a methodology for consistently counting positive and negative instances. The methodology distinguishes between counts based on alerting events and counts based on sub-segments, and show how they can be applied in calculating measures of performance such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value.\\n\\nResultsThe introduced methodology is applied to retrospective evaluation of two algorithms, HII and an alerting algorithm based on systolic blood pressure. We use a database, consisting of data from 41,707 patients from 25 US hospitals, to evaluate the algorithms. Both algorithms are evaluated running continuously throughout each patients stay as they would in a real ICU setting. We show how the introduced performance measures differ for different algorithms and for different assumptions.\\n\\nDiscussionThe standard measures of diagnostic tests in terms of true positives, false positives, etc. are based on certain assumptions which may not apply when used in the context of measuring the performance on an algorithm running continuously, and thus repeatedly sampling from the same patient. When such measures are being reported it is important that the underlying assumptions be made explicit; otherwise, the results can be very misleading.\\n\\nConclusionWe introduce a methodology for evaluating how an alerting algorithm or indicator will perform running continuously throughout every patients ICU stay, not just for a subset of patients for selected episodes.",

    "abstract": "Mass cytometry enables simultaneous analysis of over 40 proteins and their modifications in single cells through use of metal-tagged antibodies. Compared to fluorescent dyes, the use of pure metal isotopes strongly reduces spectral overlap among measurement channels. Crosstalk still exists, however, caused by isotopic impurity, oxide formation, and mass cytometer properties. Spillover effects can be minimized, but not avoided, by following a set of constraining rules when designing an antibody panel. Generation of such low crosstalk panels requires considerable expert knowledge, knowledge of the abundance of each marker and substantial experimental effort. Here we describe a novel bead-based compensation workflow that includes R-based software and a web tool, which enables correction for interference between channels. We demonstrate utility in suspension mass cytometry and show how this approach can be applied to imaging mass cytometry. Our approach greatly simplifies the development of new antibody panels, increases flexibility for antibody-metal pairing, improves overall data quality, thereby reducing the risk of reporting cell phenotype and function artifacts, and greatly facilitates analysis of complex samples for which antigen abundances are unknown.",

    "abstract": "The Complementarity plot (CP) is an established validation tool for protein structures, applicable to both, globular proteins (folding) as well as protein-protein complexes (binding). It computes the shape and electrostatic complementarities (Sm, Em) for amino acid side-chains buried within the protein interior or interface and plots them in a two-dimensional plot having knowledge-based probabilistic quality estimates for the residues as well as for the whole structure. The current report essentially presents an upgraded version of the plot with the implementation of the advanced multi-dielectric functionality (as in Delphi version 6.2 or higher) in the computation of electrostatic complementarity to make the validation tool physico-chemically more realistic. The two methods (single- and multi-dielectric) agrees decently in their resultant Em values and hence, provisions for both methods have been kept in the software suite. So to speak, the global electrostatic balance within a well-folded protein and / or a well-packed interface seems only marginally perturbed by the choice of different internal dielectric values. However, both from theoretical as well as practical grounds, the more advanced multi-dielectric version of the plot is certainly recommended for potentially producing more reliable results. The report also presents a new methodology and a variant plot, namely, CPdock, based on the same principles of complementarity, specifically designed to be used in the docking of proteins. The efficacy of the method to discriminate between good and bad docked protein complexes have been tested on a recent state-of-the-art docking benchmark. The results unambiguously indicate that CPdock can indeed be effective in the initial screening phase of a docking scoring pipeline before going into more sophisticated and computationally expensive scoring functions.

    "abstract": "Micronuclei (MN) arise from chromosomes or fragments that fail to be incorporated into the primary nucleus after cell division. These structures are a major source of genetic instability caused by DNA repair and replication defects coupled to aberrant Nuclear Envelope (NE). These problems ultimately lead to a spectrum of chromosome rearrangements called chromothripsis, a phenomenon that is a hallmark of several cancers. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism at the origin of this instability is still not understood. Here we show that lagging chromatin, although it can efficiently assemble Lamin A/C, always fails to recruit Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) proteins and that Polo-Like Kinase (PLK1) negatively regulates the NPC assembly. We also provide evidence for the requirement of PLK1 activity for the disassembly of NPCs, but not Lamina (A/C), at mitotic entry. Altogether this study reveals the existence of independent regulatory pathways for Lamin A/C and NPC reorganization during mitosis where Lamin A targeting to the chromatin is controlled by CDK1 activity (a clock-based model) while the NPC loading is also spatially monitored by PLK1.",

At low temperature, betaTub97EF, a beta-tubulin paralog stabilizing microtubules, is upregulated in a tissue-specific manner in the fly Drosophila melanogaster.\\n\\nAbstractCells in ectotherms function normally within an often wide temperature range. As temperature dependence is not uniform across all the distinct biological processes, acclimation presumably requires complex regulation. The molecular mechanisms coping with the disruptive effects of temperature variation are still poorly understood. Interestingly, one of five different beta-tubulin paralogs, betaTub97EF, was among the genes up-regulated at low temperature in cultured Drosophila cells. As microtubules are known to be cold-sensitive, we analyzed whether betaTub97EF protects microtubules at low temperatures. During development at the optimal temperature (25{degrees}C), betaTub97EF was expressed in a tissue-specific pattern primarily in the gut. There, as well as in hemocytes, expression was increased at low temperature (14{degrees}C). While betaTub97EF mutants were viable and fertile at 25{degrees}C, their sensitivity within the well-tolerated range was slightly enhanced during embryogenesis specifically at low temperatures. Changing beta-tubulin isoform ratios in hemocytes demonstrated that beta-Tubulin 97EF has a pronounced microtubule stabilizing effect. Moreover, betaTub97EF is required for normal microtubule stability in the gut. These results suggest that betaTub97EF up-regulation at low temperature contributes to acclimation by stabilizing microtubules.",

    "abstract": "The ability to reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with four transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and cMyc (abbreviated as OSKM)1 has provoked interest to define the molecular characteristics of this process2-7. Despite important progress, the dynamics of epigenetic reprogramming at high resolution in correctly reprogrammed iPSCs and throughout the entire process remain largely undefined. This gap in understanding results from the inefficiency of conventional reprogramming methods coupled with the difficulty of prospectively isolating the rare cells that eventually correctly reprogram into iPSCs. Here we characterize cell fate conversion from fibroblast to iPSC using a highly efficient deterministic murine reprogramming system engineered through optimized inhibition of Gatad2a-Mbd3/NuRD repressive sub-complex. This comprehensive characterization provides single-day resolution of dynamic changes in levels of gene expression, chromatin modifications, TF binding, DNA accessibility and DNA methylation. The integrative analysis identified two transcriptional modules that dominate successful reprogramming. One consists of genes whose transcription is regulated by on/off epigenetic switching of modifications in their promoters (abbreviated as ESPGs), and the second consists of genes with promoters in a constitutively active chromatin state, but a dynamic expression pattern (abbreviated as CAPGs). ESPGs are mainly regulated by OSK, rather than Myc, and are enriched for cell fate determinants and pluripotency factors. CAPGs are predominantly regulated by Myc, and are enriched for cell biosynthetic regulatory functions. We used the ESPG module to study the identity and temporal occurrence of activating and repressing epigenetic switching during reprogramming. Removal of repressive chromatin modifications precedes chromatin opening and binding of RNA polymerase II at enhancers and promoters, and the opposite dynamics occur during repression of enhancers and promoters. Genome wide DNA methylation analysis demonstrated that de novo DNA methylation is not required for highly efficient conducive iPSC reprogramming, and identified a group of super-enhancers targeted by OSK, whose early demethylation marks commitment to a successful reprogramming trajectory also in inefficient conventional reprogramming systems. CAPGs are distinctively regulated by multiple synergystic ways: 1) Myc activity, delivered either endogenously or exogenously, dominates CAPG expression changes and is indispensable for induction of pluripotency in somatic cells; 2) A change in tRNA codon usage which is specific to CAPGs, but not ESPGs, and favors their translation. In summary, our unbiased high-resolution mapping of epigenetic changes on somatic cells that are committed to undergo successful reprogramming reveals interleaved epigenetic and biosynthetic reconfigurations that rapidly commission and propel conducive reprogramming toward naive pluripotency.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccumulating evidence suggests that breastfeeding benefits the childrens intelligence. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) present in breast milk may explain part of this association. Under a nutritional adequacy hypothesis, an interaction between breastfeeding and genetic variants associated with endogenous LC-PUFAs synthesis might be expected. However, the literature on this topic is controversial.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe investigated this GenexEnvironment interaction in a de novo meta-analysis involving >12,000 individuals in the primary analysis, and >45,000 individuals in a secondary analysis using relaxed inclusion criteria. Our primary analysis used ever breastfeeding, FADS2 polymorphisms rs174575 and rs1535 coded assuming a recessive effect of the G allele, and intelligence quotient (IQ) in Z scores. Using random effects meta-analysis, ever breastfeeding was associated with 0.17 (95% CI: 0.03; 0.32) higher Z scores in IQ, or about 2.1 points. There was no strong evidence of interaction, with pooled covariate-adjusted interaction coefficients (i.e., difference between genetic groups of the difference in IQZ scores comparing ever with never breastfed individuals) of 0.12 (95% CI: -0.19; 0.43) and 0.06 (95% CI: -0.16; 0.27) for the rs174575 and rs1535 variants, respectively. Secondary analyses corroborated these results. In studies with >5.85 and <5.85 months of breastfeeding duration, pooled estimates for the rs174575 variant were 0.50 (95% CI: -0.06; 1.06) and 0.14 (95% CI: -0.10; 0.38), respectively, and 0.27 (95% CI: -0.28; 0.82) and -0.01 (95% CI: -0.19; 0.16) for the rs1535 variant. However, between-group comparisons were underpowered.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings do not support an interaction between ever breastfeeding and FADS2 polymorphisms. However, our subgroup analysis raises the possibility that breastfeeding supplies LC-PUFAs requirements for cognitive development (if such threshold exists) if it lasts for some (currently unknown) time. Future studies in large individual-level datasets would allow properly powered subgroup analyses and would improve our understanding on the role of breastfeeding duration in the breastfeedingxFADS2 interaction.",

    "abstract": "Following decades of declining mumps incidence amid widespread vaccination, the United States and other high-income countries have experienced a resurgence in mumps cases over the last decade. Outbreaks affecting vaccinated individuals--and communities with high vaccine coverage--have prompted concerns about the effectiveness of the live attenuated vaccine currently in use: it is unclear if immune protection wanes, or if the vaccine protects inadequately against mumps virus lineages currently circulating. Synthesizing data from epidemiological studies, we estimate that vaccine-derived protection wanes at a timescale of 27 (95%CI: 16 to 51) years. After accounting for this waning, we identify no evidence of changes in vaccine effectiveness over time associated with the emergence of heterologous virus genotypes. Moreover, a mathematical model of mumps transmission validates our findings about the central role of vaccine waning in the re-emergence of cases: outbreaks from 2006 to the present among young adults, and outbreaks occurring in the late 1980s and early 1990s among adolescents, align with peaks in the susceptibility of these age groups attributable to loss of vaccine-derived protection. In contrast, evolution of mumps virus strains escaping pressure would be expected to cause a higher proportion of cases among children. Routine use of a third dose at age 18y, or booster dosing throughout adulthood, may enable mumps elimination and should be assessed in clinical trials.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe estimated waning rate of vaccine-conferred immunity against mumps predicts observed changes in the age distribution of mumps cases in the United States since 1967.",

Characterising these patients can increase our understanding of the  hidden burden of COPD and the effectiveness of case detection interventions.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare patient and disease risk factors between patients with undiagnosed persistent airflow limitation and those with diagnosed COPD. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for observational studies of adult patients meeting accepted spirometric definitions of COPD. We extracted and pooled summary data on the proportion or mean of each risk factor among diagnosed and undiagnosed patients (unadjusted analysis), and coefficients for the adjusted association between risk factors and diagnosis status (adjusted analysis). This protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017058235).\\n\\nFindings2,083 records were identified through database searching and 16 articles were used in the meta-analyses. Diagnosed patients were less likely to have mild (v. moderate to very severe) COPD (odds ratio [OR] 0{middle dot}30, 95% CI 0{middle dot}24-0{middle dot}37, 6 studies) in unadjusted analysis. This association remained significant but its strength was attenuated in the adjusted analysis (OR 0{middle dot}72, 95% CI 0{middle dot}58-0{middle dot}89, 2 studies). Diagnosed patients were more likely to report respiratory symptoms such as wheezing (OR 3{middle dot}51, 95% CI 2{middle dot}19-5{middle dot}63, 3 studies) and phlegm (OR 2{middle dot}16, 95% CI 1{middle dot}38-3{middle dot}38, 3 studies), had more severe dyspnoea (modified Medical Research Council scale mean difference 0{middle dot}52, 95% CI 0{middle dot}40-0{middle dot}64, 3 studies) and slightly greater smoking history than undiagnosed patients. Patient age, sex, current smoking status, and the presence of coughing were not associated with a previous diagnosis.\\n\\nInterpretationPatients with undiagnosed persistent airflow limitation had less severe airflow obstruction and fewer respiratory symptoms than diagnosed patients. This indicates that there is lower disease burden among undiagnosed patients compared to those with diagnosed COPD, which may significantly delay the diagnosis of COPD.\\n\\nFundingCanadian Institutes of Health Research.\\n\\nDeclaration of interestsWe declare no competing interests.\\n\\nAuthor ContributionsMS, SB, and KJ formulated the study idea and designed the study.

We used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses of summary statistics to examine whether educational attainment is causally related to smoking.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of educational attainment and a range of smoking phenotypes (smoking initiation, cigarettes per day, cotinine levels and smoking cessation). Various complementary MR techniques (inverse-variance weighted regression, MR Egger, weighted-median regression) were used to test the robustness of our results. We found broadly consistent evidence across these techniques that higher educational attainment leads to reduced likelihood of smoking initiation, reduced heaviness of smoking among smokers (as measured via self-report and cotinine levels), and greater likelihood of smoking cessation among smokers.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings indicate a causal association between low educational attainment and increased risk of smoking, and may explain the observational associations between educational attainment and adverse health outcomes such as risk of coronary heart disease.",

One such strategy is the identification of collateral sensitivities, wherein evolution under a first drug induces susceptibility to a second. Here, we report that sequential drug regimens derived from in vitro evolution experiments may have overstated therapeutic benefit, predicting a collaterally sensitive response where cross resistance ultimately occurs. We quantify the likelihood of this phenomenon by use of a mathematical model parametrised with combinatorially complete fitness landscapes for Escherichia coli. Through experimental evolution we then verify that a second drug can indeed stochastically exhibit either increased susceptibility or increased resistance when following a first. Genetic divergence is confirmed as the driver of this differential response through targeted and whole genome sequencing. Taken together, these results highlight that the success of evolutionarily-informed therapies is predicated on a rigorous probabilistic understanding of the contingencies that arise during the evolution of drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of HIV during acute infection is often considered a neutral process. Recent analysis of sequencing data from this stage of infection, however, showed high levels of shared mutations between independent viral populations. This suggests that selection might play a role in the early stages of HIV infection. We adapted an existing model for random evolution during acute HIV-infection to include selection. Simulations of this model were used to fit a global mutational fitness effects distribution (MFED) to sequencing data of the env gene of individuals with acute HIV infection. Measures of sharing between viral populations were used as summary statistics to compare the data to the simulations. We confirm that evolution during acute infection is significantly different from neutral. The distribution of mutational fitness effects is best fit by distribution with a low, but significant fraction of beneficial mutations and a high fraction of deleterious mutations. While most mutations are neutral or deleterious in this model, about 5% of mutations is beneficial. These beneficial mutations will, on average, result in a small but significant increase in fitness. When assuming no epistasis, this indicates that at the moment of transmission HIV is near, but not on the fitness peak for early infection.",

In developing a large case/control schizophrenia (SZ) hiPSC-derived cohort of neural progenitor cells and neurons, we identified and accounted for a variety of technical and biological sources of variation. Reducing the stochastic effects of the differentiation process by correcting for cell type composition boosted the SZ signal in hiPSC-based models and increased the concordance with post mortem datasets. Because this concordance was strongest in hiPSC-neurons, it suggests that this cell type may better model genetic risk for SZ. We predict a growing convergence between hiPSC and post mortem studies as both approaches expand to larger cohort sizes. For studies of complex genetic disorders, to maximize the power of hiPSC cohorts currently feasible, in most cases and whenever possible, we recommend expanding the number of individuals even at the expense of the number of replicate hiPSC clones.",

    "abstract": "Damage caused by lodging is a significant problem in corn production that results in estimated annual yield losses of 5-20%. Over the past 100 years, substantial maize breeding efforts have increased lodging resistance by artificial selection. However, less research has focused on understanding the genetic architecture underlying lodging. Lodging is a problematic trait to evaluate since it is greatly influenced by environmental factors such as wind, rain, and insect infestation, which make replication difficult. In this study over 1,723 diverse inbred maize genotypes were crossed to a common tester and evaluated in five environments over multiple years. Natural lodging due to severe weather conditions occurred in all five environments. By testing a large population of genetically diverse maize lines in multiple field environments, we detected significant correlations for this highly environmentally influenced trait across environments and with important agronomic traits such as yield and plant height. This study also permitted the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for lodging. Several QTL identified in this study overlapped with loci previously mapped for stalk strength in related maize inbred lines. QTL intervals mapped in this study also overlapped candidate genes implicated in the regulation of lignin and cellulose synthesis.",

Eliminating or reducing production of RNA and proteins arising from these expanded loci holds therapeutic benefit. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a deactivated form of the Cas9 enzyme impedes transcription across expanded microsatellites. We observed a repeat length-, PAM-, and strand-dependent reduction in the abundance of repeat-containing RNAs upon targeting dCas9 directly to repeat sequences. Aberrant splicing patterns were rescued in DM1 cells, and production of RAN peptides characteristic of DM1, DM2, and C9orf72-ALS/FTD cells was drastically decreased. Systemic delivery of dCas9/gRNA by adeno-associated virus led to reductions in pathological RNA foci, rescue of chloride channel 1 protein expression, and decreased myotonia. These observations suggest that transcription of microsatellite repeat-containing RNAs is more sensitive to perturbation than transcription of other RNAs, indicating potentially viable strategies for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "During the third trimester of human brain development, the cerebral cortex undergoes dramatic surface expansion and folding. Physical models suggest that relatively rapid growth of the cortical gray matter helps drive this folding, and structural data suggests that growth may vary in both space (by region on the cortical surface) and time. In this study, we propose a new method to estimate local growth from sequential cortical reconstructions. Using anatomically-constrained Multimodal Surface Matching (aMSM), we obtain accurate, physically-guided point correspondence between younger and older cortical reconstructions of the same individual. From each pair of surfaces, we calculate continuous, smooth maps of cortical expansion with unprecedented precision. By considering 30 preterm infants scanned 2-4 times during the period of rapid cortical expansion (28 to 38 weeks postmenstrual age), we observe significant regional differences in growth across the cortical surface that are consistent with patterns of active folding. Furthermore, these growth patterns shift over the course of development, with non-injured subjects following a highly consistent trajectory. This information provides a detailed picture of dynamic changes in cortical growth, connecting what is known about patterns of development at the microscopic (cellular) and macroscopic (folding) scales. Since our method provides specific growth maps for individual brains, we are also able to detect alterations due to injury. This fully-automated surface analysis, based on tools freely available to the brain mapping community, may also serve as a useful approach for future studies of abnormal growth due to genetic disorders, injury, or other environmental variables.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe human brain exhibits complex folding patterns that emerge during the third trimester of fetal development. Minor folds are quasi-randomly shaped and distributed. Major folds, in contrast, are more conserved and form important landmarks. Disruption of cortical folding is associated with devastating disorders of cognition and emotion. Despite decades of study, the processes that produce normal and abnormal folding remain unresolved, although the relatively rapid tangential expansion of the cortex has emerged as a driving factor. Accurate and precise measurement of cortical growth patterns during the period of folding has remained elusive. Here, we illuminate the spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical expansion by analyzing MRI-derived surfaces of preterm infant brains, using a novel strain energy minimization approach.",

The gene regulatory network can integrate and encode a large number of different signals, including those elicited by exposure to stress. We find that many genes respond to at least one modality of stress but only a subset of stress-sensitive genes track stress exposure across multiple stress modalities and are thus universal markers of stress exposure. A sensitive and robust measure of stress exposure can be constructed using a small number of genes selected from this modality-independent set of stress-sensitive genes. This stress-sensitive gene expression (SSGE) index can detect chronic traumatic stress exposure in a wide range of different stress models in a manner that is relatively independent of the modality of stress exposure and that parallels the intensity of stress exposure in a dose-dependent manner.",

Our predicted branchpoints show large agreement with trends observed in the raw data, but analysis of conservation signatures and overlap with pathogenic variants reveal that our predicted branchpoints are generally more reliable than the raw data itself.

    "abstract": "Mareks disease virus (MDV) is a pathogen of chickens whose control has twice been un-dermined by pathogen evolution. Disease ecology is believed to be the main driver of this evolution, yet mathematical models of MDV disease ecology have never been confronted with data to test their reliability. Here, we develop a suite of MDV models that differ in the ecological mechanisms they include. We fit these models with maximum likelihood in  pomp to data on MDV concentration in dust collected from two commercial broiler farms. Using AIC to compare the models, we find that virus dynamics are influenced by between-flock variation in host susceptibility to virus, shedding rate from infected birds, and cleanout efficiency. We also find evidence that virus is reintroduced to farms approximately once per month, but we do not find evidence that virus sanitization rates vary between flocks. Of the models that survive model selection, we find agreement between parameter estimates and previous experimental data, as well as agreement between field data and the predictions of these models, suggesting robustness of model predictions. Using the set of surviving models, we explore how changes to farming practices are predicted to influence MDV costs, should pathogen evolution undermine existing control measures. By quantitatively capturing the mechanisms of disease ecology, we have laid the groundwork to explore the future trajectory of virus evolution.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen acquisition is a major challenge for herbivorous animals, and the repeated origins of herbivory across the ants have raised expectations that nutritional symbionts have shaped their diversification. Direct evidence for N-provisioning by internally housed symbionts is rare in animals; among the ants, it has been documented for just one lineage. In this study we dissect functional contributions by bacteria from a conserved, multi-partite gut symbiosis in herbivorous Cephalotes ants through in vivo experiments, (meta)genomics, and in vitro assays. Gut bacteria recycle urea, and likely uric acid, using recycled N to synthesize essential amino acids that are acquired by hosts in substantial quantities. Specialized core symbionts of 17 studied Cephalotes species encode the pathways directing these activities, and several recycle N in vitro. These findings point to a highly efficient N-economy, and a nutritional mutualism preserved for millions of years through the derived behaviors and gut anatomy of Cephalotes ants.\\n\\nCategoryBiological Sciences-Evolution",

    "abstract": "The invariable site plus {Gamma} model is widely used to model rate heterogeneity among alignment sites in maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. The proof that the invariable site plus continuous {Gamma} model is identifiable (model parameters can be inferred correctly given enough data) has increased the creditability of its application to phylogeny reconstruction. However, most phylogenetic software implement the invariable site plus discrete {Gamma} model, whose identifiability is likely but unproven. How well the parameters of the invariable site plus discrete {Gamma} model are estimated is still disputed. Especially the correlation of the fraction of invariable sites with the fractions of sites with a slow evolutionary rate is discussed as being problematic. We show that optimization heuristics as implemented in frequently used phylogenetic software cannot always reliably estimate the shape parameter, the proportion of invariable sites and the tree length. Here, we propose an improved optimization heuristic that accurately estimates the three parameters. While research efforts mainly focus on tree search methods, our results signify the equal importance of verifying and developing effective estimation methods for complex models of sequence evolution.",

Here, we report that somatic piRNAs were likely present in the ancestral arthropod more than 500 million years ago. Analysis of 20 species across the arthropod phylum suggests that somatic piRNAs targeting TEs and mRNAs are common among arthropods. The presence of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in chelicerates (horseshoe crabs, spiders, scorpions) suggests that arthropods originally used a plant-like RNA interference mechanism to silence TEs. Our results call into question the view that the ancestral role of the piRNA pathway was to protect the germline and demonstrate that small RNA silencing pathways have been repurposed for both somatic and germline functions throughout arthropod evolution.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between extrinsic factors, such as disruptive selection, and intrinsic factors, such as genetic incompatibilities among loci, can contribute to the maintenance of species boundaries. The relative roles of these factors in the establishment of reproductive isolation can be examined using species pairs characterized by gene flow throughout their divergence history. We investigated the process of speciation and the maintenance of species boundaries between Pinus strobiformis and P.flexilis. Utilizing ecological niche modeling, demographic modeling, and genomic cline analyses, we illustrated a history of divergence with continuous gene flow between these species. We found an abundance of advanced generation hybrids and a lack of loci exhibiting large allele frequency differences across the hybrid zone. Additionally, we found evidence for climate-associated variation in the hybrid index and niche divergence between parental species and the hybrid zone. Our results are consistent with extrinsic factors, such as climate, being an important isolating mechanism for these species. A buildup of intrinsic incompatibilities and of co-adapted gene complexes is also apparent in our results, although these appear to be in the earliest stages of development. This supports previous work in coniferous species demonstrating the importance of extrinsic factors in creating and enforcing species boundaries. Overall, we lend support to the hypothesis that varying strengths and directions of selection pressures across the long lifespans of conifers, in combination with their life history strategies, delay the evolution of strong intrinsic incompatibilities.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic correlations of couples for phenotypes evident at the time of mate choice, like height, are well documented. Similarly, phenotypic correlations among partners for traits not directly observable at the time of mate choice, like longevity or late-onset disease status, have been reported. Partner correlations for longevity and late-onset disease are comparable in magnitude to correlations in 1st degree relatives. These correlations could arise as a consequence of convergence after mate choice, due to initial assortment on observable correlates of one or more risk factors (e.g. BMI), referred to as indirect assortative mating, or both. Using couples from the UK Biobank cohort, we show that longevity and disease history of the parents of white British couples is correlated. The correlations in parental longevity are replicated in the FamiLinx cohort. These correlations exceed what would be expected due to variations in lifespan based on year and location of birth. This suggests the presence of assortment on factors correlated with disease and lifespan, which show correlations across generations. Birth year, birth location, Townsend Deprivation Index, height, waist to hip ratio, BMI and smoking history of UK Biobank couples explained ~70% of the couple correlation in parental lifespan. For cardiovascular diseases, in particular hypertension, we find significant correlations in genetic values among partners, which support a model where partners assort for risk factors genetically correlated with cardiovascular disease. Identifying the factors that mediate indirect assortment on longevity and human disease risk will help to unravel what factors affect human disease and ultimately longevity.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance in pathogens is extensively studied, yet little is known about how antibiotic resistance genes of typical gut bacteria influence microbiome dynamics. Here, we leverage genomes from metagenomes to investigate how genes of the premature infant gut resistome correspond to the ability of bacteria to survive under certain environmental and clinical conditions. We find that formula feeding impacts the resistome. Random forest models corroborated by statistical tests revealed that the gut resistome of formula-fed infants is enriched in class D beta-lactamase genes. Interestingly, Clostridium difficile strains harboring this gene are at higher abundance in formula-fed infants compared to C. difficile lacking this gene. Organisms with genes for major facilitator superfamily drug efflux pumps have faster replication rates under all conditions, even in the absence of antibiotic therapy. Using a machine learning approach, we identified genes that are predictive of an organisms direction of change in relative abundance after administration of vancomycin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The most accurate results were obtained by reducing annotated genomic data into five principal components classified by boosted decision trees. Among the genes involved in predicting if an organism increased in relative abundance after treatment are those that encode for subclass B2 beta-lactamases and transcriptional regulators of vancomycin resistance. This demonstrates that machine learning applied to genome-resolved metagenomics data can identify key genes for survival after antibiotics and predict how organisms in the gut microbiome will respond to antibiotic administration.\\n\\nImportanceThe process of reconstructing genomes from environmental sequence data (genome-resolved metagenomics) allows for unique insight into microbial systems. We apply this technique to investigate how the antibiotic resistance genes of bacteria affect their ability to flourish in the gut under various conditions. Our analysis reveals that strain-level selection in formula-fed infants drives enrichment of beta-lactamase genes in the gut resistome. Using genomes from metagenomes, we built a machine learning model to predict how organisms in the gut microbial community respond to perturbation by antibiotics.

    "abstract": "Microbial communities are accompanied by a diverse array of viruses. Through infections of abundant microbes, these viruses have the potential to mediate competition within the community, effectively weakening competitive interactions and promoting coexistence. This is of particular relevance for host-associated microbial communities, since the diversity of the microbiota has been linked to host health and functioning. Here, we study the interaction between two key members of the microbiota of the freshwater metazoan Hydra vulgaris. The two commensal bacteria Curvibacter sp. and Duganella sp. protect their host from fungal infections, but only if both of them are present. Coexistence of the two bacteria is thus beneficial for Hydra. Intriguingly, Duganella sp. appears to be the superior competitor in vitro due to its higher growth rate when both bacteria are grown seperately, but in coculture the outcome of competition depends on the relative initial abundances of the two species. The presence of an inducible prophage in the Curvibacter sp. genome which is able to lytically infect Duganella sp., led us to hypothesise that the phage modulates the interaction between these two key members of the Hydra microbiota. Using a mathematical model we show that the interplay of the lysogenic life-cycle of the Curvibacter phage and the lytic life-cycle on Duganella sp. can explain the observed complex competitive interaction between the two bacteria. Our results highlight the importance of taking lysogeny into account for understanding microbe-virus interactions and show the complex role phages can play in promoting coexistence of their bacterial hosts.",

    "abstract": "The orexin (Orx) system is known to play a critical role in drug addiction and reward-related behaviors. The dynorphin (Dyn) system, conversely, promotes depressive-like behavior and plays a key role in the aversive effects of stress. Orexin and Dyn are co-released and have opposing functions in reward and motivation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Earlier studies showed that microinjections of OrxA in the posterior paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (pPVT) exerted priming-like effects and reinstated cocaine-seeking behavior, suggesting that Orx transmission in the pPVT participates in cocaine-seeking behavior. The present study sought to determine whether Orx and Dyn interact in the pPVT. Using a cellular approach, brain slices were prepared for whole-cell recordings and to study excitatory transmission in pPVT neurons. The superfusion of OrxA increased spontaneous glutamatergic transmission by increasing glutamate release onto pPVT neurons, whereas DynA decreased glutamate release. Furthermore, the augmentation of OrxA-induced glutamate release was reversed by DynA. To corroborate the electrophysiological data, separate groups of male Wistar rats were trained to self-administer cocaine or sweetened condensed milk (SCM). After self-administration training, the rats underwent extinction training and were tested with intra-pPVT administration of OrxA{+/-}DynA under extinction conditions. OrxA reinstated cocaine-and SCM-seeking behavior, with a greater effect in cocaine animals. DynA selectively blocked OrxA-induced cocaine seeking vs. SCM seeking. The data indicate that DynA in the pPVT prevents OrxA-induced cocaine seeking, perhaps by reversing the OrxA-induced increase in glutamate release, identifying a novel therapeutic target to prevent cocaine relapse.",

    "abstract": "Hypothalamic orexin (Orx) neurons that project to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) have received growing interest because of their role in drug-seeking behavior. When injected in the posterior PVT (pPVT), OrxA reinstated extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior in rats that had long access (LgA) to cocaine for 6 h/day after an intermediate period of abstinence (I-Abst, 2-3 weeks). Considering the long-lasting nature of drug-seeking behavior and that the PVT sends projections to the hypothalamus, the present study examined whether (i) OrxAs priming effect is preserved after a period of protracted abstinence (P-Abst, 4-5 weeks) in LgA rats and (ii) the neural activation pattern (i.e., Fos+ and Fos+/Orx+ cells) in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), and perifornical area (PFA) following intra-pPVT OrxA administration that may explain OrxA-induced reinstatement in LgA animals. As reported previously, OrxA administration in the pPVT triggered cocaine-seeking behavior after I-Abst. With P-Abst, the priming effect of OrxA was absent. An intra-pPVT injection of OrxA produced a strong increase in neuronal activation (i.e., Fos expression) in the LH/DMH/PFA at I-Abst but not at P-Abst. The analysis of the activation (Fos+) of Orx neurons (Orx+) revealed an increase in Fos+/Orx+ expression in the LH/DMH/PFA at I-Abst only, thus paralleling the behavioral data. These data indicate that shortly after abstinence, PVT{leftrightarrow}LH/DMH/PFA connections are strongly recruited in animals with a history of cocaine dependence. The lack of effect at P-Abst suggests that the function of Orx receptors and connectivity of the PVT{leftrightarrow}LH/DMH/PFA circuit undergo significant neuroadaptations following P-Abst.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTA better understanding of the pathophysiological changes associated with cocaine addiction is needed to develop efficient pharmacotherapies. The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) and orexin (Orx) transmission within the PVT have been implicated in maladaptive (compulsive) behavior that is characteristic of drug addiction. The present study shows OrxA injections in the posterior PVT reinstates cocaine-seeking behavior in animals with a history of cocaine dependence, and this effect disappears after protracted abstinence, paralleled by the neuronal activation pattern in the hypothalamus. In subjects with a history of cocaine dependence, the function of Orx receptors and connectivity of the PVT{leftrightarrow} LH/DMH/PFA circuit undergo significant neuroadaptations.",

    "abstract": "Slow oscillations play a major role in neural plasticity. It is assumed that slow oscillatory up-states represent crucial time windows for memory reactivation and consolidation during sleep. Here we experimentally tested this assumption by utilizing closed-loop targeted memory reactivation (closed-loop TMR): Healthy participants were re-exposed to prior learned foreign vocabulary during up- and down-states of slow oscillations, respectively, in a within-subject design. We show that presenting memory cues during slow oscillatory up-states robustly improves recall performance, whereas memory cueing during down-states did not result in a clear behavioral benefit. On a neural basis successful memory reactivation during up-states was associated with a characteristic power increase in the theta and sleep spindle band. Such increases were completely absent for down-state memory cues. Our findings provide experimental support for the assumption that slow oscillatory up-states represent privileged time windows for memory reactivation, while the interplay of slow oscillations, theta and sleep spindle activity promote successful memory consolidation during sleep.",

    "abstract": "The feedback-related negativity, a frontocentral event-related potential (ERP) occurring 200350 milliseconds (ms) after emotionally-valued outcomes, has been posited as the neural correlate of reward prediction error, a key component of associative learning. Recent evidence challenged this interpretation and has led to the suggestion that this ERP expresses salience, instead. Here we distinguish between utility prediction error and salience by delivering or withholding hedonistically matched appetitive and aversive tastes, and measure ERPs to cues signalling each taste. We observed a typical FRN (computed as the loss-minus-gain difference wave) to appetitive taste, but a reverse-FRN to aversive taste. When tested axiomatically, frontocentral ERPs showed a salience response across tastes, with a particularly early response to outcome delivery, supporting recent propositions of a fast, unsigned and unspecific response to salient stimuli. ERPs also expressed aversive prediction error peaking at 285ms, which conformed to the logic of an axiomatic model of prediction error. With stimuli that most resemble those used in animal models we did not detect any frontocentral ERP signal for utility prediction error, in contrast with dominant views of the functional role of the feedback-related negativity ERP. We link the animal and human literature and present a challenge for current perspectives on associative learning research using ERPs.",

    "abstract": "Multiple studies have shown that data quality is a critical confound in the construction of brain networks derived from functional MRI. This problem is particularly relevant for studies of human brain development where important variables (such as participant age) are correlated with data quality. Nevertheless, the impact of head motion on estimates of structural connectivity derived from diffusion tractography methods remains poorly characterized. Here, we evaluated the impact of in-scanner head motion on structural connectivity using a sample of 949 participants (ages 8-23 years old) who passed a rigorous quality assessment protocol for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquired as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Structural brain networks were constructed for each participant using both deterministic and probabilistic tractography. We hypothesized that subtle variation in head motion would systematically bias estimates of structural connectivity and confound developmental inference, as observed in previous studies of functional connectivity. Even following quality assurance and retrospective correction for head motion, eddy currents, and field distortions, in-scanner head motion significantly impacted the strength of structural connectivity in a consistency-and length-dependent manner. Specifically, increased head motion was associated with reduced estimates of structural connectivity for high-consistency network edges, which included both short-and long-range connections. In contrast, motion inflated estimates of structural connectivity for low-consistency network edges that were primarily shorter-range. Finally, we demonstrate that age-related differences in head motion can both inflate and obscure developmental inferences on structural connectivity. Taken together, these data delineate the systematic impact of head motion on structural connectivity, and provide a critical context for identifying motion-related confounds in studies of structural brain network development.",

    "abstract": "Electrical stimulation is a widely used and effective tool in systems neuroscience, neural prosthetics, and clinical neurostimulation. However, electrical artifacts evoked by stimulation significantly complicate the detection of spiking activity on nearby recording electrodes. Here, we present ERAASR: an algorithm for Estimation and Removal of Artifacts on Arrays via Sequential principal components Regression. This approach leverages the similar structure of artifact transients, but not spiking activity, across simultaneously recorded channels on the array, across pulses within a train, and across trials. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated in macaque dorsal premotor cortex using acute linear multielectrode array recordings and single electrode stimulation. Large electrical artifacts appeared on all channels during stimulation. After application of ERAASR, the cleaned signals were quiescent on channels with no spontaneous spiking activity, whereas spontaneously active channels exhibited evoked spikes which closely resembled spontaneously occurring spiking waveforms. The ERAASR algorithm requires no special hardware and comprises sequential application of straightforward linear methods with intuitive parameters. Enabling simultaneous electrical stimulation and multielectrode array recording can help elucidate the causal links between neural activity and cognitive functions and enable the design and implementation of novel sensory protheses.",

    "abstract": "Memory reprocessing following acquisition enhances memory consolidation. Specifically, neural activity during encoding is thought to be  replayed during subsequent slow-wave sleep (SWS). This natural tendency of memory replay can be induced by external cueing, known as \\\"targeted memory reactivation\\\". Here, we analyzed data from a published study (van Dongen, Takashima, et al. 2012), where auditory cues reactivated learned visual object-location memories during SWS. Memory replay during sleep presumably involves a shift in connectivity across the brain. Therefore, we characterized the effects of memory reactivation on brain network connectivity using graph-theory. We found that cue presentation during SWS introduced increased network integration of the occipital cortex, a visual region that was also active during the object retrieval task. Importantly, enhanced network integration of the occipital cortex showed a behavioural benefit and predicted overnight memory stabilization. Furthermore, occipital cortex displayed enhanced connectivity with mnemonic regions, namely the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus and medial prefrontal cortex during cue versus control sound presentation. Finally, network integration of early occipital cortex during cueing in SWS was related to increased activation of the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, a region involved in coding for spatial associative information, at the post-sleep test. Together, these results support a neural mechanism where cue-induced replay during sleep promotes memory consolidation by increased integration of task-relevant perceptual regions with mnemonic regions.",

    "abstract": "Regeneration of propagating action potentials at nodes of Ranvier allows nerve impulses to be conducted over long distances. Proper nodal function is believed to rely on intimate associations among axons, myelinating oligodendrocytes, and perinodal astrocytes. Studies in the optic nerve, corpus callosum, and spinal cord suggest that NG2+ cells are also key constituents of CNS nodes and that these glia may influence conduction efficacy and formation of axon collaterals. However, the prevalence of NG2+ cell processes at CNS nodes of Ranvier has not been rigorously quantified. Here we used a transgenic mouse expressing membrane-targeted EGFP to visualize the fine processes of NG2+ cells and to quantify the spatial relationship between NG2+ cells and nodes of Ranvier in four distinct CNS white matter tracts. NG2+ cell processes came within close spatial proximity to a small percentage of nodes of Ranvier and approximately half of these spatial interactions were estimated to occur by chance. The majority of NG2+ cell process tips were not found in close proximity to nodes and gray matter NG2+ cells in regions of low nodal density were as morphologically complex as their white matter counterparts, indicating that attraction to nodes does not critically influence the elaboration of NG2+ cell processes. Finally, there was no difference in nodal density between small regions devoid of NG2+ cell processes and those containing numerous NG2+ cells processes, demonstrating that the function of CNS nodes of Ranvier does not require ongoing interaction with NG2+ cells.\\n\\nSignificance StatementEffective propagation of action potentials along neuronal axons is dependent upon periodic regeneration of depolarization at nodes of Ranvier. The position, structural integrity, and function of nodes of Ranvier is believed to be regulated, in part, by intimate physical interactions between nearby glial cells and nodes. Clarifying whether oligodendrocyte precursor cells are obligate members of this nodal support system is critical for defining whether these cells contribute to pathologies in which nodal structure is compromised.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy affects a huge number of patients by severe disruption of brain functions and is characterised by recurrent seizures, sometimes hard to be treated by medications. Seizure induced cellular consequences in ionic gradient and homeostasis are expected to result in electrophysiological differences between epileptic and non-epileptic neurons.\\n\\nIn the following work we demonstrate these differences in layer III cortical pyramidal neurons sourced from epileptic and non-epileptic human patient tissue. Although visually indistinguishable and featuring similar membrane potentials and latency to first spikes upon whole cell patch stimulation, epileptic pyramidal neurons display a larger rheobase and a smaller membrane resistance, responding less efficiently to electrical stimulation than their peri-tumorous equivalents. This decreased excitability contradicts results in comparable animal models of epilepsy and was further corroborated by detailed analysis of spiking characteristics and phase plot analysis of these events. Both point to an overexpression of K+ channels trying to compensate for the hyperexcited, epileptic network state. A computational model of a pyramidal neuron was utilized to give an estimate of the needful relative changes in K+ and Na+ conductances.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to document current clinical practice and report patient outcomes in presurgical language functional MRI (fMRI) for epilepsy surgery. Epilepsy surgical programs worldwide were surveyed as to the utility, implementation, and efficacy of language fMRI in the clinic; 82 programs responded between July 2015 and January 2016. Respondents were predominantly from the US (61%), were academic programs (85%), and predominantly evaluated adults (44%), both adults and children (40%), or children only (16%). Nearly all (96%) respondents reported using language fMRI. fMRI is used for language lateralization (100%) and for localizing (44%) language cortex to guide surgical margins. While typically considered useful, programs often reported at least one instance of disagreement with other measures (56%). When used to localize language cortex, direct brain stimulation typically confirmed fMRI findings (74%) but instances of unpredicted decline were reported by 17% of programs and unexpected preservation of function were reported by 54%. Programs reporting unexpected decline did not clearly differ from those which did not. Clinicians using fMRI to guide surgical margins typically map Brocas and Wernickes areas but not other known language areas. Language fMRI is widely used for lateralizing language cortex in patients with medically intractable epilepsy. It is also frequently used to localize language cortex though it is not yet well validated for this purpose. Many centers report cases of unexpected language preservation when fMRI activation is resected, and cases of language decline when it is not. Care will almost certainly be improved by standardizing protocols and accurately detailing the relationship between fMRI-positive areas and post-surgical language decline.",

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition of intestine characterized by severe inflammation and mucosal destruction, genetic analysis has shown that LPA contribute to IBD and patients of cystic fibrosis also display the phenotype of diarrhea. The purpose of this study is to investigate if this complex plays a role in the inflammatory responses of intestinal epithelium.\\n\\nWe then explored the role of this complex in maintaining the integrity of tight junction and inflammatory responses in these cells. In vitro assays show that inhibiting CFTR or LPA2 in the intestinal epithelial cell could disrupt the epithelial cell junction, and reduce the TER of intestinal epithelial cells in both mouse and human cell line. EUSA assay show that intriguing LPA2 through LPS or LPA can increase the secretion of IL-8, while inhibiting or SiRNA knockdown of LPA2 can decrease the secretion of IL-8 in mouse or human intestinal epithelial cells. The CFTR inhibitor can reduce the IL-8 secretion in both mouse and human cell line, the deletion of CFTR in mouse intestine does not affect the IL-8 level, but the knockdown of CFTR in human cell line reduced the IL-8 protein level. The deletion of CFTR in human also reduced the IL-8 mRNA level. This indicates the CFTR-LPA complex is necessary for the expression of IL-8.",

Using an optimized FISH staining protocol in a 384-well plate format in conjunction with a bespoke automated image analysis workflow, HiCTMap faithfully detects chromosome territories and their position in 2D and 3D in a large population of cells per experimental condition. We apply this novel technique to visualize chromosomes 18, X, and Y in male and female primary human skin fibroblasts, and show accurate detection of the correct number of chromosomes in the respective genotypes. Given the ability to visualize and quantitatively analyze large numbers of nuclei, we use HiCTMap to measure chromosome territory area and volume with high precision and determine the radial position of chromosome territories using either centroid or equidistant-shell analysis. The HiCTMap protocol is also compatible with RNA FISH as demonstrated by simultaneous labeling of X chromosomes and Xist RNA in female cells. We suggest HiCTMap will be a useful tool for routine precision mapping of chromosome territories in a wide range of cell types and tissues.",

    "abstract": "The tyrosine kinase Src is over-expressed in numerous human cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. While Src has been extensively studied, its contributions to collective cell migration in vivo remain incompletely understood. Here we show that Src42A, but not Src64, is required for the specification and migration of the border cells in the Drosophila ovary, a well-developed and genetically tractable in vivo cell migration model. We found active Src42A enriched at border cell/nurse cell interfaces, where E-cadherin is less abundant, and depleted from border cell/border cell and border cell/polar cell junctions where E-cadherin is more stable, whereas total Src42A protein co-localizes with E-cadherin. Over-expression of wild type Src42A mislocalized Src activity and prevented border cell migration. Constitutively active or kinase dead forms of Src42A also impeded border cells. These findings establish border cells as a model for investigating the mechanisms of action of Src in cooperative, collective, cell-on-cell migration in vivo.",

We extend a previous study of the detection abilities of these methods to a comparison of their localization abilities.\\n\\nMethodsThrough coalescent simulation, we compare several popular association methods. Cases and controls are sampled from a diploid population to mimic human studies. As benchmarks for comparison, we include two methods that cluster phenotypes on the true genealogical trees, a naive Mantel test considered previously in haploid populations and an extension that takes into account whether case haplotypes carry a causal variant. We first work through a simulated dataset to illustrate the methods. We then perform a simulation study to score the localization and detection properties.\\n\\nResultsIn our simulations, the association signal was localized least precisely by the naive Mantel test and most precisely by its extension. Most other approaches had intermediate performance similar to the single-variant Fishers-exact test.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results confirm earlier findings in haploid populations about potential gains in performance from genealogy-based approaches.

We used ChRO-seq to develop the first maps of nascent transcription in primary human glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumors. Whereas enhancers discovered in primary GBMs resemble open chromatin in the normal human brain, rare enhancers activated in malignant tissue drive regulatory programs similar to the developing nervous system. We identified enhancers that regulate genes characteristic of each known GBM subtype, identified transcription factors that drive them, and discovered a core group of transcription factors that control the expression of genes associated with clinical outcomes.

Despite the perennial damage and reduced productivity that result from water-deficit and unpredictable early season temperature fluctuations, these critical genes have not been previously examined in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). Here, we report the isolation of the G. hirsutum ABF homologs, characterization of their expression patterns in response to abiotic stress treatments, and examination of their functions through heterologous ectopic expression in Arabidopsis. As expected for an allotetraploid, G. hirsutum ABF homologs are present in the genome as homeologous pairs. These genes are differentially expressed, both among the homologs and within the homeologous pairs, in response to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) application, dehydration, and chilling temperatures. Furthermore, heterologous ectopic expression of many of the G. hirsutum ABF genes in Arabidopsis conferred increased tolerance to water deficit and osmotic stress, as well as cold tolerance, in a gene specific manner. These results indicate the G. hirsutum ABF homologs are functional in Arabidopsis and, as in other species, are likely to play an essential role in the abiotic stress response.\\n\\nHighlightThe Gossypium hirsutum ABF homeologs are differentially expressed in response to abiotic stress, and their ectopic expression in Arabidopsis can confer increased water deficit tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence from genome-wide studies of cancer show that chromatin-mediated epigenetic silencing at large cohorts of genes is strongly linked to a poor prognosis. This mechanism is thought to prevent cell differentiation and enable evasion of the immune system. Drugging the cancer epigenome with small molecule inhibitors to release silenced genes from the repressed state has emerged as a powerful approach for cancer research and drug development. Targets of these inhibitors include chromatin-modifying enzymes that can acquire drug-resistant mutations. In order to directly target a generally conserved feature, elevated trimethyl-lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), we developed the Polycomb-based Transcription Factor (PcTF), a fusion activator that targets methyl-histone marks via its N-terminal H3K27me3-binding motif, and co-regulates sets of silenced genes. Here, we report transcriptome profiling analyses of PcTF-treated breast cancer model cell lines. We identified a set of 19 PcTF-upregulated genes, or PUGs, that were consistent across three distinct breast cancer cell lines. These genes are associated with the interferon response pathway. Our results demonstrate for the first time a chromatin-mediated interferon-related transcriptional response driven by an engineered fusion protein that physically links repressive histone marks with active transcription.",

    "abstract": "Though the added value of proteomic measurements to gene expression profiling has been demonstrated, profiling of gene expression on its own remains the dominant means of understanding cellular responses to perturbation. Direct protein measurements are typically limited due to issues of cost and scale; however, the recent development of high-throughput, targeted sentinel mass spectrometry assays provides an opportunity for proteomics to contribute at a meaningful scale in high-value areas for drug development. To demonstrate the feasibility of a systematic and comprehensive library of perturbational proteomic signatures, we profiled 90 drugs (in triplicate) in six cell lines using two different proteomic assays -- one measuring global changes of epigenetic marks on histone proteins and another measuring a set of peptides reporting on the phosphoproteome -- for a total of more than 3,400 samples. This effort represents a first-of-its-kind resource for proteomics. The majority of tested drugs generated reproducible responses in both phosphosignaling and chromatin states, but we observed differences in the responses that were cell line-and assay-specific. We formalized the process of comparing response signatures within the data using a concept called connectivity, which enabled us to integrate data across cell types and assays. Furthermore, it facilitated incorporation of transcriptional signatures. Consistent connectivity among cell types revealed cellular responses that transcended cell-specific effects, while consistent connectivity among assays revealed unexpected associations between drugs that were confirmed by experimental follow-up. We further demonstrated how the resource could be leveraged against public domain external datasets to recognize therapeutic hypotheses that are consistent with ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).

    "abstract": "Bacterial actins are an evolutionarily diverse family of ATP-dependent filaments built from protomers with a conserved structural fold. Actin-based segregation systems are encoded on many bacterial plasmids and function to partition plasmids into daughter cells. The bacterial actin AlfA segregates plasmids by a mechanism distinct from other partition systems, dependent on its unique dynamic properties. Here, we report the near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structure of the AlfA filament, which reveals a strikingly divergent filament architecture resulting from the loss of a subdomain conserved in all other actins and a novel mode of ATP binding. Its unusual assembly interfaces and nucleotide interactions provide insight into AlfA dynamics, and expand the range of evolutionary variation accessible to actin quaternary structure.\\n\\nSignificance StatementActin filaments are dynamic cytoskeletal elements that assemble upon ATP binding. Actin homologs are present in all domains of life, and all share a similar three-dimensional structure of the assembling subunit, but evolutionary changes to subunit have generated many different actin filament structures. The filament structure of the bacterial actin AlfA, which positions plasmids - small, circular DNA molecules that encode important genes - to ensure that each daughter cell receives a copy at cell division. AlfA is different from all other actins in two critical ways: it binds to ATP in a unique way, and it is missing a quarter of the conserved structural core. These differences explain unusual AlfA assembly dynamics that underlie its ability to move plasmids.",

    "abstract": "Different lines of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster show variation in the ability to discriminate between volatiles produced by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under natural (nitrogen-limiting, YVN) or laboratory (sugar-limiting, YVL) conditions. Previous work in our laboratory uncovered a strong correlation between heightened sensitivity to YVN wild D. melanogaster lines that harbored a chimeric variant of the highly variable odorant receptor 22 (Or22) locus of D. melanogaster. We sought to determine if this trend held for an extended set of D. melanogaster lines, if observed variation within chimeric and non-chimeric lines could be explained by nucleotide polymorphisms and if replacing Or22 with a chimeric allele in a non-chimeric background could confer the enhanced ability to detect YVN. In parallel, we performed crosses of chimeric and non-chimeric fly lines and assayed the behavior of their progeny for enhanced sensitivity to YVN to assess the heritability of the Or22 locus. Ultimately, we found that, while the overall trend of increased sensitivity to YVN in chimeric lines persists, there are exceptions and variation that cannot be explained by sequence variation at the Or22 locus. In addition, we did not observe increased sensitivity for YVN upon replacing the Or22 allele in a non-chimeric line (OreR) with that from our most YVN-sensitive, chimeric line (ME). Though our results do not support our hypothesis that Or22 is the primary driver of sensitivity to YVN, Or22 remains an interesting locus in the context of fly-yeast ecology.",

These fluctuations were found to be correlated across brain regions, and are thought to reflect neuronal activity fluctuations between functionally connected areas of the brain. However, the origin of these infra-slow fluctuations remains unknown. Here, using a detailed computational model of the brain network, we show that spontaneous infra-slow (< 0.05 Hz) fluctuations could originate due to the ion concentration dynamics. The computational model implemented dynamics for intra and extracellular K+ and Na+ and intracellular Cl- ions, Na+/K+ exchange pump, and KCC2 co-transporter. In the network model representing resting awake-like brain state, we observed slow fluctuations in the extracellular K+ concentration, Na+/K+ pump activation, firing rate of neurons and local field potentials. Holding K+ concentration constant prevented generation of these fluctuations. The amplitude and peak frequency of this activity were modulated by Na+/K+ pump, AMPA/GABA synaptic currents and glial properties. Further, in a large-scale network with long-range connections based on CoCoMac connectivity data, the infra-slow fluctuations became synchronized among remote clusters similar to the resting-state networks observed in vivo. Overall, our study proposes that ion concentration dynamics mediated by neuronal and glial activity may contribute to the generation of very slow spontaneous fluctuations of brain activity that are observed as the resting-state fluctuations in fMRI and EEG recordings.",

We re-examine the question of signal transmission across the cortex in network models based on recently available mesoscopic, directed- and weighted-inter-areal connectivity data of the macaque cortex. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to feed-forward propagation models, the presence of long-range excitatory feedback projections could compromise stable signal propagation. Using population rate models as well as a spiking network model, we find that effective signal propagation can be accomplished by balanced amplification across cortical areas while ensuring dynamical stability. Moreover, the activation of prefrontal cortex in our model requires the input strength to exceed a threshold, in support of the ignition model of conscious processing, demonstrating our model as an anatomically-realistic platform for investigations of the global primate cortex dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Higher cognition may require the globally coordinated integration of specialized brain regions into functional networks. A collection of structural cortical hubs - referred to as the rich club - has been hypothesized to support task-specific functional integration. In the present paper, we use a whole-cortex model to estimate directed interactions between 68 cortical regions from fMRI activity for four different tasks (reflecting different cognitive domains) and resting state. We analyze the state-dependent input and output effective connectivity of the structural rich club and relate these to whole-cortex dynamics and network reconfigurations. We find that the cortical rich club exhibits an increase in outgoing effective connectivity during task performance as compared to rest while incoming connectivity remains constant. Increased outgoing connectivity targets a sparse set of peripheral regions with specific regions strongly overlapping between tasks. At the same time, community detection analyses reveal massive reorganizations of interactions among peripheral regions, including those serving as target of increased rich club output. This suggests that while peripheral regions may play a role in several tasks, their concrete interplay might nonetheless be task-specific. Furthermore, we observe that whole-cortex dynamics are faster during task as compared to rest. The decoupling effects usually accompanying faster dynamics appear to be counteracted by the increased rich club outgoing effective connectivity. Together our findings speak to a gating mechanism of the rich club that supports fast-paced information exchange among relevant peripheral regions in a task-specific and goal-directed fashion, while constantly listening to the whole network.",

However, the specific learning processes related to their activity at different times during learning remain poorly understood. We addressed this using behavioral tasks isolating distinct aspects of fear learning in rats. We show that brief optogenetic inhibition of BLA glutamatergic neurons around moments of aversive reinforcement or non-reinforcement causes reductions in the salience of conditioned stimuli, rendering these stimuli less able to be learned about and less able to control fear or safety behaviours. This salience reduction was stimulus-specific, long-lasting, and specific to aversive emotional states - precisely the goals of therapeutic interventions in human anxiety disorders. Our findings identify a core learning process disrupted by brief BLA optogenetic inhibition. They show that a primary function of BLA glutamatergic neurons is to maintain the salience of conditioned stimuli. This is a necessary precursor for these stimuli to gain and maintain control over fear and safety behavior.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe amygdala is essential for learning to fear and learning to reduce fear. However, the specific roles served by activity of different amygdala neurons at different times during learning is poorly understood. We used behavioral tasks isolating distinct aspects of learning in rats to show that brief optogenetic inhibition of BLA glutamatergic neurons around moments of reinforcement or non-reinforcement disrupts maintenance of conditioned stimulus (CS) salience. This causes a stimulus-specific, long-lasting, and aversive emotion specific deficit in the ability of the CS to be learned about or control fear responses. These consequences are the precisely goals of therapeutic interventions in human anxiety disorders. Our findings identify a core learning process disrupted by brief BLA optogenetic inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) biomagnifies in aquatic food chains and can reach high concentrations in fish-eating birds. Spatial patterns of Hg have been found in freshwater ecosystems across Canada for many taxa including fish and birds. However, it is often challenging to sample a representative population size of adult birds to monitor concentrations of contaminants over a large spatial scale. Moreover, adult birds can migrate and can show a contaminant profile that may not be representative of local resources. The aims of this study were (1) to determine if there was a spatial pattern of Hg in piscivorous birds, (2) to develop a model to estimate Hg concentrations in breeding adults using chicks as proxy, and (3) to develop predictive equations among non-lethal samples that representative of local resources in adults (blood and growing feathers). Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) chick growing feathers were sampled at 19 sites across Canada (n = 106). Adult tissues (freshly grown feathers; n = 8-16 per feather type and blood; n = 160) were sampled at five of those locations to establish correlations between age classes and between adult tissues. We found an increase in Hg concentrations with latitude up to 50{degrees}N followed by a decrease. There was a decrease in Hg concentrations from west to east, which contradicts previous studies. We found a good correlation of Hg concentrations between adults and chicks and among adult tissues. Our model showed that it is possible to estimate Hg concentrations in adults across Canada using chicks as proxy. Our study shows that chicks can be a suitable proxy for monitoring local mercury concentrations and that they are representative of adults.\\n\\nCapsule: Concentrations of mercury in cormorant chicks are influenced by latitude",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPain is modulated by expectation. Event-related potential (ERP) studies of the influence of expectation on pain typically utilise laser heat stimulation to provide a controllable nociceptive-specific stimulus. Short painful electric stimulation has a number of practical advantages, but is less nociceptive-specific. We compared the modulation of electric versus laser-evoked pain by expectation, and their corresponding pain-evoked and anticipatory ERPs.\\n\\nNew MethodWe developed understanding of recognised methods of laser and electric stimulation. We tested whether pain perception and neural activity induced by electric stimulation was modulated by expectation, whether this expectation elicited anticipatory neural correlates, and how these measures compared to those associated with laser stimulation. We elicited cue-evoked expectations of high and low pain and compared subjective ratings and corresponding ERPs in response to the delivery of laser and electric stimulation in a within-participant design.\\n\\nResultsDespite sensory and affective differences between laser and electric pain, intensity ratings and pain-evoked potentials were modulated equivalently by expectation, though ERPs only correlated with pain ratings in the laser pain condition. Anticipatory correlates significantly differentiated pain intensity expectation to laser but not electric pain.\\n\\nComparison with Existing MethodPrevious studies have consistently shown that laser-evoked potentials are modulated by expectation. We extend this by showing electric pain-evoked potentials are equally modulated by expectation, within the same participants. We also show a difference between the pain types in anticipation.\\n\\nConclusionsThough laser-evoked potentials express a stronger relationship with pain perception, both laser and electric stimulation may be used to study the modulation of pain-evoked potentials by expectation. Anticipatory-evoked potentials are elicited by both pain types, but they may reflect different processes and did not correlate with pain perception.",
