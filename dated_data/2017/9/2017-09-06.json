    "abstract": "Disorders of the brain exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and frequently share symptoms, provoking debate about the extent of their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders based on summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of 215,683 patients and 657,164 controls, and their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric disorders show substantial sharing of common variant risk, while neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another. We observe limited evidence of sharing between neurological and psychiatric disorders, but do identify robust sharing between disorders and several cognitive measures, as well as disorders and personality types. We also performed extensive simulations to explore how power, diagnostic misclassification and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a source of risk for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.",

    "abstract": "The size of nearly all cells is modulated by nutrients. Thus, cells growing in poor nutrients can be nearly half the size of cells in rich nutrients. In budding yeast, cell size is thought to be controlled almost entirely by a mechanism that delays cell cycle entry until sufficient growth has occurred in G1 phase. Here, we show that most growth of a new daughter cell occurs in mitosis. When the rate of growth is slowed by poor nutrients, the duration of mitosis is increased, which suggests that cells compensate for slow growth in mitosis by increasing the duration of growth. The amount of growth required to complete mitosis is reduced in poor nutrients, leading to a large reduction in cell size. Together, these observations suggest that mechanisms that control the extent of growth in mitosis play a major role in cell size control in budding yeast.",

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in the rich temporal and spectral properties of the brain's functional connectome that are provided by Electro- and Magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). However, the problem of leakage between brain sources that arises when reconstructing brain activity from EEG/MEG recordings outside the head makes it difficult to distinguish true connections from spurious connections, even when connections are based on measures that ignore zero-lag dependencies. In particular, standard anatomical parcellations for potential cortical sources tend to over- or under-sample the real spatial resolution of EEG/MEG. By using information from cross-talk functions (CTFs) that objectively describe leakage for a given sensor configuration and distributed source reconstruction method, we introduce methods for optimising the number of parcels while simultaneously minimising the leakage between them. More specifically, we compare two image segmentation algorithms: 1) a split-and-merge (SaM) algorithm based on standard anatomical parcellations and 2) a region growing (RG) algorithm based on all the brain vertices with no prior parcellation. Interestingly, when applied to minimum-norm reconstructions for EEG/MEG configurations from real data, both algorithms yielded approximately 70 parcels despite their different starting points, suggesting that this reflects the resolution limit of this particular sensor configuration and reconstruction method. Importantly, when compared against standard anatomical parcellations, resolution matrices of adaptive parcellations showed notably higher sensitivity and distinguishability of parcels. Furthermore, extensive simulations of realistic networks under various circumstances revealed significant improvements in network reconstruction accuracies, particularly in reducing false leakage-induced connections. Adaptive parcellations therefore allow a more accurate reconstruction of functional EEG/MEG connectomes.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe introduce adaptive cortical parcellation algorithms for E/MEG source estimation.\\nC_LIO_LIAlgorithms are based on cross-talk functions and image segmentation methods.\\nC_LIO_LIThe resulting parcellations yielded ~70 parcels regardless of starting point.\\nC_LIO_LISensitivity and distinguishability improved compared to anatomical parcellations.\\nC_LIO_LIAccuracy of realistic whole-brain network reconstruction improved significantly.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cellular aging plays an important role in many diseases, such as cancers, metabolic syndromes and neurodegenerative disorders. There has been steady progress in identifying aging-related factors such as reactive oxygen species and genomic instability, yet an emerging challenge is to reconcile the contributions of these factors with the fact that genetically identical cells can age at significantly different rates. Such complexity requires single-cell analyses designed to unravel the interplay of aging dynamics and cell-to-cell variability. Here we use novel microfluidic technologies to track the replicative aging of single yeast cells and reveal that the temporal patterns of heterochromatin silencing loss regulate cellular lifespan. We found that cells show sporadic waves of silencing loss in the heterochromatic ribosomal DNA (rDNA) during the early phases of aging, followed by sustained loss of silencing preceding cell death. Isogenic cells have different lengths of the early intermittent silencing phase that largely determine their final lifespans. Combining computational modeling and experimental approaches, we found that the intermittent silencing dynamics is important for longevity and is dependent on the conserved Sir2 deacetylase, whereas either sustained silencing or sustained loss of silencing shortens lifespan. These findings reveal, for the first time, that the temporal patterns of a key molecular process can directly influence cellular aging and thus could provide guidance for the design of temporally controlled strategies to extend lifespan.\\n\\nSignificanceAging is an inevitable consequence of living, and with it comes increased morbidity and mortality. Novel approaches to mitigating age-related chronic diseases demand a better understanding of the biology of aging. Studies in model organisms have identified many conserved molecular factors that influence aging. The emerging challenge is to understand how these factors interact and change dynamically to drive aging. Using multidisciplinary technologies, we have revealed a sirtuin-dependent intermittent pattern of chromatin silencing during yeast aging that is crucial for longevity. Our findings highlight the important role of silencing dynamics in aging, which deserves careful consideration when designing schemes to delay or reverse aging by modulating sirtuins and silencing.",

    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cells (RGC) transplantation is a promising strategy to restore visual function resulting from irreversible RGC degeneration occurring in glaucoma or inherited optic neuropathies. We previously demonstrated FGF2 induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) to RGC lineage, capable of retinal Ganglion Cell Layer (GCL) integration upon transplantation in mice. Here, we evaluated possible improvement of visual function by transplantation of ES cell derived neural progenitors in RGC depleted glaucoma mice models. ESC derived neural progenitors (ES-NP) were transplanted into NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) injected, RGC-ablated mouse models and a pre-clinical glaucoma mouse model (DBA/2J) having sustained higher intra ocular pressure (IOP). Visual acuity and functional integration was evaluated by behavioural experiments and immunohistochemistry, respectively. GFP-expressing ES-NPs transplanted in NMDA-injected RGC-depleted mice differentiated into RGC lineage and possibly integrating into GCL. An improvement in visual acuity was observed after two months of transplantation, when compared to the pre-transplantation values. Expression of c-Fos in the transplanted cells, upon light induction, further suggests functional integration into the host retinal circuitry. However, the transplanted cells did not send axonal projections into optic nerve. Transplantation experiments in DBA/2J mouse showed no significant improvement in visual functions, possibly due to both host and transplanted retinal cell death which could be due to an inherent high IOP. We showed that, transplantation of ES-NPs into the retina of RGC-ablated mouse models could survive, differentiate to RGC lineage, and possibly integrate into GCL to improve visual function. However, for the survival of transplanted cells in glaucoma, strategies to control the IOP are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Cycads are the only early seed plants that have evolved a specialized root to host endophytic bacteria that fix nitrogen. To provide evolutionary and functional insights into this million-year old symbiosis, we investigate endophytic bacterial sub-communities isolated from coralloid roots of species from Dioon (Zamiaceae) sampled from their natural habitats. We employed a sub-community co-culture experimental strategy to reveal both predominant and rare bacteria, which were characterized using phylogenomics and detailed metabolic annotation. Diazotrophic plant endophytes, including Bradyrhizobium, Burkholderia, Mesorhizobium, Nostoc, and Rhizobium species, dominated the epiphyte-free sub-communities. Draft genomes of six cyanobacteria species were obtained after shotgun metagenomics of selected sub-communities and used for whole-genome inferences that suggest two Dioon-specific monophyletic groups and a level of specialization characteristic of co-evolved symbiotic relationships. In agreement with this, the genomes of these cyanobacteria were found to encode unique biosynthetic gene clusters, predicted to direct the synthesis of specialized metabolites, mainly involving peptides. After combining genome mining with metabolite profiling using multiphoton excitation fluorescence microscopy, we also show that Caulobacter species co-exist with cyanobacteria, and may interact with them by means of a novel indigoidine-like specialized metabolite. We provide an unprecedented view of the composition of the cycad coralloid root, including phylogenetic and functional patterns mediated by specialized metabolites that may be important for the evolution of ancient symbiotic adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Msp1 is a conserved AAA ATPase in budding yeast localized to mitochondria where it prevents accumulation of mistargeted tail-anchored (TA) proteins, including the peroxisomal TA protein Pex15. Msp1 also resides on peroxisomes but it remains unknown how native TA proteins on mitochondria and peroxisomes evade Msp1 surveillance. We used live-cell quantitative cell microscopy tools and drug-inducible gene expression to dissect Msp1 function. We found that a small fraction of peroxisomal Pex15, exaggerated by overexpression, is turned over by Msp1. Kinetic measurements guided by theoretical modeling revealed that Pex15 molecules at mitochondria display age-independent Msp1 sensitivity. By contrast, Pex15 molecules at peroxisomes are rapidly converted from an initial Msp1-sensitive to an Msp1-resistant state. Lastly, we show that Pex15 interacts with the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex3, which shields Pex15 from Msp1-dependent turnover. In sum, our work argues that Msp1 selects its substrates on the basis of their solitary membrane existence.",

Here we tested whether such feedback responses can account for changes in arm configuration and for arbitrary visuomotor transformations - two manipulations that alter how muscles at the elbow and wrist need to be coordinated to achieve task success. Participants used a planar three degree-of-freedom exoskeleton robot to move a cursor to a target following a mechanical perturbation that flexed the elbow. In our first experiment, the cursor was mapped to the veridical position of the robot handle, but participants grasped the handle with two different hand orientations (thumb pointing upward or thumb point downward). We found that large rapid feedback responses were evoked in wrist extensor muscles when wrist extension helped move the cursor to the target (i.e., thumb upward), and in wrist flexor muscles when wrist flexion helped move the cursor to the target (i.e., thumb downward). In our second experiment, participants grasped the robot handle with their thumb pointing upward, but the cursors movement was either veridical, or was mirrored such that flexing the wrist moved the cursor as if the participant extended their wrist, and vice versa. After extensive practice, we found that rapid feedback responses were appropriately tuned to the wrist muscles that supported moving the cursor to the target when the cursor was mapped to the mirrored movement of the wrist, but were not tuned to the appropriate wrist muscles when the cursor was remapped to the wrists veridical movement.",

    "abstract": "Rodents lick to consume fluids. The reward value of ingested fluids is likely to be encoded by neuronal activity entrained to the lick cycle. Here, we investigated relationships between licking and reward signaling by the medial frontal cortex [MFC], a key cortical region for reward-guided learning and decision-making. Multi-electrode recordings of spike activity and field potentials were made in male rats as they performed an incentive contrast licking task. Rats received access to higher and lower value sucrose rewards over alternating 30 sec periods. They learned to lick persistently when higher value rewards were available and to suppress licking when lower value rewards were available. Spectral analysis of spikes and fields revealed evidence for reward value being encoded by the strength of phase-locking of a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm to the rats lick cycle. Recordings during the initial acquisition of the task found that the strength of phase-locking to the lick cycle was strengthened with experience. A modification of the task, with a temporal gap of 2 sec added between reward deliveries, found that the rhythmic signals persisted during periods of dry licking, a finding that suggests the MFC encodes either the value of the currently available reward or the vigor with which rats act to consume it. Finally, we found that reversible inactivations of the MFC in the opposite hemisphere eliminated the encoding of reward information. Together, our findings establish that a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm, generated by the rodent medial frontal cortex, is synchronized to rewarded actions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe cellular and behavioral mechanisms of reward signaling by the medial frontal cortex [MFC] have not been resolved. We report evidence for a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm that is generated by the MFC and synchronized with ongoing consummatory actions. Previous studies of MFC reward signaling have inferred value coding upon temporally sustained activity during the period of reward consumption. Our findings suggest that MFC activity is temporally sustained due to the consumption of the rewarding fluids, and not necessarily the abstract properties of the rewarding fluid. Two other major findings were that the MFC reward signals persist beyond the period of fluid delivery and are generated by neurons within the MFC.",

We construct a model from this theory and find that it predicts set size effects. Notably, these effects are mediated by probing probability, which aligns with previous empirical findings. The model accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability on encoding precision in nine delayed-estimation experiments. Moreover, we find support for the prediction that the total amount of invested resource can vary non-monotonically with set size. Finally, we show that it is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset or even none of the relevant items in a task.

We tested this presumption by studying the relationship between variability of functional morphological traits and GDM levels in American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus), in green houses located in two geographical sites. Our analyses revealed that body linear morphometry, skull geometry, scaled mass index, packed cell volume and neutrophil counts differed significantly among males and females within and between localities. GDM, nonetheless, was rather similar among sex and locality groups. These results show that levels of GDM, at least under our experimental contexts, does not correlate with functional morphological trait variability.",

    "abstract": "Genetic expression of fluorescently labeled proteins is essential to visualizing dynamic behavior within live cells. Recent advances in microscopy have increased resolution to the level where it is now possible to capture individual molecules interacting. However, the criteria for determining whether a fluorescent label perturbs protein function have not undergone a corresponding increase in resolution. The effects of protein labeling on cell function are still judged by whether populations of protein localize and interact with known binding partners. Here we use integrins, bidirectional signal adhesion molecules that regulate interactions between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton through a well-defined series of conformational changes to show that not all labeling strategies are the same. We found that labeling the beta subunit decreased the mobility of individual integrin molecules and the protrusive activity of the entire cell. While integrins with labeled alpha subunits behaved similarly to unlabeled integrins, labeling the beta subunit increased the size of adhesions by elevating integrin affinity and exposing the ligand induced binding domain to change the molecule conformation. Thus, our single molecule and cellular data indicate that the ability of labeled proteins to localize and interact with known binding partners does not guarantee it does not alter protein function. We propose that the behaviors of individual molecules rather than the ensemble behavior of populations need to be considered as criteria to determine if a probe is non-perturbative.",

    "abstract": "Neocortical regions are organized into columns and layers. Connections between layers run mostly perpendicular to the surface suggesting a columnar functional organization. Some layers have long-range excitatory lateral connections suggesting interactions between columns. Similar patterns of connectivity exist in all regions but their exact role remain a mystery. In this paper, we propose a network model composed of columns and layers that performs robust object learning and recognition. Each column integrates its changing input over time to learn complete predictive models of observed objects. Excitatory lateral connections across columns allow the network to more rapidly infer objects based on the partial knowledge of adjacent columns. Because columns integrate input over time and space, the network learns models of complex objects that extend well beyond the receptive field of individual cells. Our network model introduces a new feature to cortical columns. We propose that a representation of location relative to the object being sensed is calculated within the sub-granular layers of each column. The location signal is provided as an input to the network, where it is combined with sensory data. Our model contains two layers and one or more columns. Simulations show that using Hebbian-like learning rules small single-column networks can learn to recognize hundreds of objects, with each object containing tens of features. Multi-column networks recognize objects with significantly fewer movements of the sensory receptors. Given the ubiquity of columnar and laminar connectivity patterns throughout the neocortex, we propose that columns and regions have more powerful recognition and modeling capabilities than previously assumed.",

    "abstract": "Transcripts are frequently modified by structural variations, which leads to a fused transcript of either multiple genes (known as a fusion gene) or a gene and a previously non-transcribing sequence. Detecting these modifications (called transcriptomic structural variations, or TSVs), especially in cancer tumor sequencing, is an important and challenging computational problem. We introduce SQUID, a novel algorithm to accurately predict both fusion-gene and non-fusion-gene TSVs from RNA-seq alignments. SQUID unifies both concordant and discordant read alignments into one model, and doubles the accuracy on simulation data compared to other approaches. With SQUID, we identified novel non-fusion-gene TSVs on TCGA samples.",

To probe the mechanisms by which histone modifications are read out, we designed an obligate pair of H3 heterodimers, termed H3X and H3Y, which we extensively validated genetically and biochemically. Comparing the effects of asymmetric histone tail point mutants with those of symmetric double mutants revealed that a single methylated H3K36 per nucleosome was sufficient to silence cryptic transcription in vivo. We also demonstrate the utility of this system for analysis of histone modification crosstalk, using mass spectrometry to separately identify modifications on each H3 molecule within asymmetric nucleosomes. The ability to generate asymmetric nucleosomes in vivo and in vitro provides a powerful and generalizable tool to probe the mechanisms by which H3 tails are read out by effector proteins in the cell.",

    "abstract": "Homologous Recombination (HR) is one of the key pathways to repair Double Strand Breaks (DSBs). Rad51 serves an important function of catalysing strand exchange between two homologous chromosomes in the HR pathway. In higher organisms, Rad51 function is indispensable with its absence leading to early embryonic lethality, thus precluding any mechanistic probing of the system. In contrast, absence of Drosophila rad51 (Dmrad51/spnA) has been associated with defects in female germline causing ventralization of the egg, without any reported detrimental consequences to Drosophila somatic tissues. In this study, we have performed a systematic analysis of somatic development of dmrad51 null mutant flies by using genetic complementation between multiple dmrad51 alleles. Our current study, for the first time, uncovers the requirement of Dmrad51 in somatic tissue maintenance at both larval and pupal stages. Also, we show that dmrad51 mutant exhibit patterning defects in abdominal cuticle in the stripes and bristles, while there appears to be only subtle defects in the adult wing and eye. Interestingly, dmrad51 null mutant and other alleles show discernible phenotype of low temperature sensitivity, suggesting a role for Dmrad51 in temperature sensitive cellular processes, which thus presents an elegant system for probing temperature sensitive cellular/tissue responses that ensue when a mutation leads to the loss of protein expression (null mutant) rather than its altered protein structure.",

While scientists are generally aware that data sharing is an important component of reproducible research, it is not always clear how to usefully share data in a manner that allows other labs to understand and reproduce published findings. Here we describe a new open source tool, AFQ-Browser, that builds an interactive website as a companion to a published diffusion MRI study. Because AFQ-browser is portable -- it runs in any modern web-browser -- it can facilitate transparency and data sharing. Moreover, by leveraging new web-visualization technologies to create linked views between different dimensions of a diffusion MRI dataset (anatomy, quantitative diffusion metrics, subject metadata), AFQ-Browser facilitates exploratory data analysis, fueling new scientific discoveries based on previously published datasets. In an era where Big Data is playing an increasingly prominent role in scientific discovery, so will browser-based tools for exploring high-dimensional datasets, communicating scientific discoveries, sharing and aggregating data across labs, and publishing data alongside manuscripts.",

    "abstract": "Human T cells are central to physiological immune homeostasis, which protects us from pathogens without collateral autoimmune inflammation. They are also the main effectors in most current cancer immunotherapy strategies1. Several decades of work have aimed to genetically reprogram T cells for therapeutic purposes2-5, but as human T cells are resistant to most standard methods of large DNA insertion these approaches have relied on recombinant viral vectors, which do not target transgenes to specific genomic sites6, 7. In addition, the need for viral vectors has slowed down research and clinical use as their manufacturing and testing is lengthy and expensive. Genome editing brought the promise of specific and efficient insertion of large transgenes into target cells through homology-directed repair (HDR), but to date in human T cells this still requires viral transduction8, 9. Here, we developed a non-viral, CRISPR-Cas9 genome targeting system that permits the rapid and efficient insertion of individual or multiplexed large (>1 kilobase) DNA sequences at specific sites in the genomes of primary human T cells while preserving cell viability and function. We successfully tested the potential therapeutic use of this approach in two settings. First, we corrected a pathogenic IL2RA mutation in primary T cells from multiple family members with monogenic autoimmune disease and demonstrated enhanced signalling function. Second, we replaced the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) locus with a new TCR redirecting T cells to a cancer antigen. The resulting TCR-engineered T cells specifically recognized the tumour antigen, with concomitant cytokine release and tumour cell killing. Taken together, these studies provide preclinical evidence that non-viral genome targeting will enable rapid and flexible experimental manipulation and therapeutic engineering of primary human immune cells.",

    "abstract": "How HIV-1 genomic RNA (gRNA) is packaged into assembling virus remains unclear. Here, we use biochemical and in situ approaches to identify the complex in which the capsid protein Gag first associates with gRNA, termed the packaging initiation complex. First, we show that in the absence of assembling Gag, non-nuclear non-translating gRNA is nearly absent from the soluble fraction of provirus-expressing cells, and is found instead primarily in complexes >30S. When we express a Gag mutant known to be arrested at packaging initiation, we find only one complex containing Gag and gRNA; thus, this complex corresponds to the packaging initiation complex. This [~]80S complex also contains two cellular facilitators of assembly, ABCE1 and the RNA granule protein DDX6, and therefore corresponds to a co-opted host RNA granule and a previously described capsid assembly intermediate. Additionally, we find this granule-derived packaging initiation complex in HIV-1-infected H9 T cells, and demonstrate that wild-type Gag forms both the packaging initiation complex and a larger granule-derived complex corresponding to a late packaging/assembly intermediate. We also demonstrate that packaging initiation complexes are far more numerous than P bodies in situ. Finally, we show that Gag enters the [~]80S granule to form the packaging initiation complex via a two-step mechanism. In a step that is independent of a gRNA-binding domain, Gag enters a broad class of RNA granules, most of which lack gRNA. In a second step that is dependent on the gRNA-binding nucleocapsid domain of Gag or a heterologous gRNA-binding domain, Gag enters a gRNA-containing subset of these granules. Thus, we conclude that packaging in cells does not result from random encounters between Gag and gRNA; instead our data support a fundamentally different model in which Gag is directed to gRNA within a unique host RNA granule to initiate this critical event in HIV-1 replication.\\n\\nNontechnical SummaryTo form infectious virus, the HIV-1 capsid protein Gag must associate with and package the viral genomic RNA (gRNA) during the virus assembly process. HIV-1 Gag first associates with gRNA in the cytoplasm, forming a complex termed the packaging initiation complex; this complex subsequently targets to the plasma membrane where Gag completes the assembly and packaging process before releasing the virus from the cell. Although the packaging initiation complex is critical for infectious virus formation, its identity and composition, and the mechanism by which it is formed, remain unknown. Here we identify the packaging initiation complex, and demonstrate that it corresponds to a host RNA granule that is co-opted by the virus. RNA granules are diverse complexes utilized by host cells for all aspects of RNA storage and metabolism besides translation. Our study also defines the mechanism by which HIV-1 Gag enters this host RNA granule to form the packaging initiation complex, and reveal that it involves two steps that depend on different regions of Gag. Our finding that Gag co-opts a poorly studied host complex to first associate with gRNA during packaging provides a new paradigm for understanding this critical event in the viral life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Large repeat rich genomes present challenges for assembly and identification of gene models with short read technologies. Here we present a method we call Virtual Genome Walking which uses an iterative assembly approach to first identify exons from de-novo assembled transcripts and assemble whole genome reads against each exon. This process is iterated allowing the extension of exons. These linked assemblies are refined to generate gene models including upstream and downstream genomic sequence as well as intronic sequence. We test this method using a 20X genomic read set for the axolotl, the genome of which is estimated to be 30 Gb in size. These reads were previously reported to be effectively impossible to assemble. Here we provide almost 1 Gb of assembled sequence describing over 19,000 gene models for the axolotl. Gene models stop assembling either due to localised low coverage in the genomic reads, or the presence of repeats. We validate our observations by comparison with previously published axolotl bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences. In addition we analysed axolotl intron length, intron-exon structure, repeat content and synteny. These gene-models, sequences and annotations are freely available for download from https://tinyurl.com/y8gydc6n. The software pipeline including a docker image is available from https://github.com/LooseLab/iterassemble.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveOsteoarthritis (OA) impacts humans and several other animals. Thus, the mechanisms underlying this disorder, such as specific skeletal tissue DNA methylation patterns, may be evolutionary conserved. However, associations between methylation and OA have not been readily studied in nonhuman animals. Baboons serve as important models of disease and develop OA at rates similar to those in humans. Therefore, this study investigated the associations between methylation and OA in baboons to advance the evolutionary understanding of OA.\\n\\nDesignTrabecular bone and cartilage was collected from the medial condyles of adult female baboon femora, five with and five without knee OA. The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K array) was used to identify DNA methylation patterns in these tissues.\\n\\nResultsApproximately 44% of the 450K array probes reliably align to the baboon genome, contain a CpG site of interest, and maintain a wide distribution throughout the genome. Of the two filtering methods tested, both identified significantly differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between healthy and OA individuals in cartilage tissues, and some of these patterns overlap with those previously identified in humans. Conversely, no DMPs were found between tissue types or between disease states in bone tissues.\\n\\nConclusionsOverall, the 450K array can be used to measure genome-wide DNA methylation in baboon tissues and identify significant associations with complex traits. The results of this study indicate that some DNA methylation patterns associated with OA are evolutionarily conserved, while others are not. This warrants further investigation in a larger and more phylogenetically diverse sample set.",

    "abstract": "In Escherichia coli, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway removes ultraviolet (UV) light-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 dipyrimidine photoproducts (6-4 PPs). Activation of alternative repair pathways, such as base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide incision repair (NIR), is inoperative because this organism lacks both the necessary BER DNA glycosylase and NIR UV endonuclease to initiate repair of these lesions. To determine if initiation of either pathway would enhance survival to biologically-relevant UV irradiation, the BER and NIR pathways were activated by expression of Chlorella virus-1 pyrimidine dimer glycosylase (cv-pdg) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe UV endonuclease (UVDE), respectively. The substrate specificity of cv-pdg includes CPDs and ring-fragmented purines, 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine, but not 6-4 PPs. In contrast, while UVDE incises DNA containing CPDs and 6-4 PPs, it was not previously known if the substrate specificity of UVDE included DNA containing ring-fragmented purines. Mass spectrometry was used to establish that these oxidatively-induced lesions were not substrates for UVDE. Expression of either cv-pdg or UVDE in NER-deficient E. coli significantly enhanced survival following UVB irradiation, but not to the levels of wild type (WT) cells. Survival of NER-proficient, homologous recombination-deficient cells could also be significantly enhanced by expression of either enzyme, suggesting that in response to UVB exposure, interactions between NER and activated BER or NIR pathways could be additive. Further, expression of cv-pdg or UVDE in WT E. coli enhanced survival following solar-simulated light (SSL) exposures.",

The relationships observed in left ventral pathways are consistent with studies in older children, and demonstrate that structural markers for language difficulties are apparent as young as 3 years of age.

It has thus been difficult to dissect chromatin structure and function within fully native DNA substrates. Here, we circumvent these limitations by exploiting the minimalist genome of the eukaryote Oxytricha trifallax, whose notably small ~3kb chromosomes mainly encode single genes. Guided by high-resolution epigenomic maps of nucleosome organization, transcription, and DNA N6-methyladenine (m6dA) locations, we reconstruct full-length Oxytricha chromosomes in vitro and use these synthetic facsimiles to dissect the influence of m6dA and histone post-translational modifications on nucleosome organization. We show that m6dA directly disfavors nucleosomes in a quantitative manner, leading to local decreases in nucleosome occupancy that are synergistic with histone acetylation. The effect of m6dA can be partially reversed by the action of an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler. Furthermore, erasing m6dA marks from Oxytricha chromosomes leads to proportional increases in nucleosome occupancy across the genome. This work showcases Oxytricha chromosomes as powerful yet practical models for studying eukaryotic chromatin and transcription in the context of biologically relevant DNA substrates.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDe novo synthesis of complete, epigenetically defined Oxytricha chromosomes\\nC_LIO_LIEpigenomic profiles of chromatin organization in Oxytrichas miniature chromosomes\\nC_LIO_LIm6dA directly disfavors nucleosome occupancy in natural and synthetic chromosomes\\nC_LIO_LIHistone acetylation and chromatin remodelers temper the impact of m6dA on chromatin\\nC_LI",

We report that this pathway is normally absent in Calu-3 human lung adenocarcinoma cells in 3-Dimensional culture, but that paracrine signals from MRC5 lung fibroblasts can induce correct orientation of polarity and acinar morphogenesis. We identify HGF, acting through the c-Met receptor, as the key polarity-inducing morphogen, which acts to activate {beta}1-integrin-dependent adhesion. HGF and ECM-derived integrin signals co-operate via a c-Src-dependent inhibition of the RhoA-ROCK1 signalling pathway via p190A RhoGAP. This occurred via controlling localization of these signalling pathways to the ECM-abutting surface of cells in 3-Dimensional culture.

Terminal differentiation is often coupled with permanent exit from the cell cycle and existing data suggests a close relationship between a repressive chromatin structure and silencing of the cell cycle in postmitotic cells. Here we examine the relationship between chromatin organization, terminal differentiation and cell cycle exit.\\n\\nResultsWe focused our studies on the Drosophila wing, where epithelial cells transition from active proliferation to a postmitotic state in a temporally controlled manner. We find there are two stages of G0 in this tissue, a flexible G0 period where cells can be induced to re-enter the cell cycle under specific genetic manipulations and a state we call \\\"robust\\\", where cells become strongly refractory to cell cycle re-entry. Compromising the flexible G0 by driving ectopic expression of cell cycle activators causes a global disruption of the clustering of heterochromatin-associated histone modifications such as H3K27 trimethylation and H3K9 trimethylation, as well as their associated repressors, Polycomb and heterochromatin protein 1(HP1). However, this disruption is reversible. When cells enter a robust G0 state, even in the presence of ectopic cell cycle activity, clustering of heterochromatin associated modifications are restored. If cell cycle exit is bypassed, cells in the wing continue to terminally differentiate, but heterochromatin clustering is severely disrupted. Heterochromatin-dependent gene silencing does not appear to be required for cell cycle exit, as compromising the H3K27 methyltransferase Enhancer of zeste, and/or HP1 cannot prevent the robust cell cycle exit, even in the face of normally oncogenic cell cycle activities.\\n\\nConclusionsHeterochromatin clustering during terminal differentiation is a consequence of cell cycle exit, rather than differentiation. Compromising heterochromatin-dependent gene silencing does not disrupt cell cycle exit.",

In a genetic screen using C. elegans we identified that FACT maintains cell identities and acts as a barrier for transcription factor-mediated cell fate reprogramming. Strikingly, FACTs role as a reprogramming barrier is conserved in humans as we show that FACT depletion enhances reprogramming of fibroblasts into stem cells and neurons. Such activity of FACT is unexpected since known reprogramming barriers typically repress gene expression by silencing chromatin. In contrast, FACT is a positive regulator of gene expression suggesting an unprecedented link of cell fate maintenance with counteracting alternative cell identities. This notion is supported by ATAC-seq analysis showing that FACT depletion results in decreased but also increased chromatin accessibility for transcription factors. Our findings identify FACT as a cellular reprogramming barrier in C. elegans and humans, revealing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for cell fate protection.",

Despite being located on the medically critical genomic region and abundance of evidences indicating its functionality, the role of this gene in human cells was utterly unknown. Due to absence of any prior knowledge regarding the function of DSCR4, for the first time here we used a gene-overexpression approach to discover biological importance and cellular roles of this gene. Our analysis strongly indicates DSCR4 to be mainly involved in regulation of the interconnected biological pathways related to cell migration, coagulation and immune system. We also showed that the predicted biological functions are consistent with tissue-specific expression of DSCR4 in migratory immune system leukocyte cells and neural crest cells that shape facial morphology of human embryo. Immune system and neural crest cells are also shown to be affected in Down syndrome patients who suffer from the same type of DSCR4 misregulation as in our study which further support our findings. Providing evidence for the critical roles of DSCR4 in human cells, our findings establish the basis for further investigations on the roles of DSCR4 in etiology of Down syndrome and unique characteristics of hominoids.",

Its variability in terms of amplitude, waveform shape and spatial distribution over subjects scalp makes its attenuation a challenging task. In this study, we aimed to provide a detailed characterization of the BCG properties, including its temporal dependency on cardiac events and its spatio-temporal dynamics. To this end, we used high-density EEG data acquired during simultaneous functional MR imaging in six healthy volunteers. First, we investigated the relationship between cardiac activity and BCG occurrences in the EEG recordings. We observed large variability in the delay between ECG and subsequent BCG events (ECG-BCG delay) across subjects and non-negligible epoch-by-epoch variations at the single subject level. Also, we found positive correlations between heart rate variability and ECG-BCG delay. The inspection of spatial-temporal variations revealed a prominent non-stationarity of the BCG signal. We identified five main BCG waves, which were common across subjects. Principal component analysis revealed two spatially distinct patterns to explain most of the variance (85% in total). These components are possibly related to head rotation and pulse-driven scalp expansion, respectively. Our results may inspire the development of novel, more effective methods for the removal of the BCG, capable of isolating and attenuating artifact occurrences while preserving true neuronal activity.",

    "abstract": "The number of leaves a plant has is one of the key traits (phenotypes) describing its development and growth. Here, we propose an automated, deep learning based approach for counting leaves in model rosette plants. While state-of-the-art results on leaf counting with deep learning methods have recently been reported, they obtain the count as a result of leaf segmentation and thus require per-leaf (instance) segmentation to train the models (a rather strong annotation). Instead, our method treats leaf counting as a direct regression problem and thus only requires as annotation the total leaf count per plant. We argue that combining different datasets when training a deep neural network is beneficial and improves the results of the proposed approach. We evaluate our method on the CVPPP 2017 Leaf Counting Challenge dataset, which contains images of Arabidopsis and tobacco plants. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the winner of the previous CVPPP challenge, improving the results by a minimum of 50% on each of the test datasets, and can achieve this performance without knowing the experimental origin of the data (i.e. \\\"in the wild\\\" setting of the challenge). We also compare the counting accuracy of our model with that of per leaf segmentation algorithms, achieving a 20% decrease in mean absolute difference in count (|DiC|).",

    "abstract": "Methylophaga nitratireducenticrescens strain JAM1 is a methylotrophic, marine bacterium that was isolated from a denitrification reactor treating a closed-circuit seawater aquarium. It can sustain growth under anoxic conditions by reducing nitrate (NO3-) to nitrite (NO2-), which accumulates in the medium. These physiological traits are attributed to gene clusters that encode two dissimilatory nitrate reductases (NarGHJI). M. nitratireducenticrescens strain JAM1 also contains gene clusters encoding two putative nitric oxide reductase (NO) reductases and one putative nitrous oxide (N2O) reductase, suggesting that NO and N2O can be reduced by strain JAM1. In this study, we show that strain JAM1 can reduce NO to N2O and N2O to N2 and can sustain growth under anoxic conditions by reducing N2O as the sole electron acceptor. Although strain JAM1 lacks a gene encoding a dissimilatory copper-(NirK) or cytochrome cd1-type (NirS) NO2- reductase, NO3--amended strain JAM1 cultures produce N2O, representing up to 6% of the N-input. NO2- was shown to be the key intermediate of this production process. In NO3-amended cultures, we analyzed denitrification genes in succession of net N2O-production and -consumption phases at the gene expression level. These phases were found to correlate with changes in the expression levels of the NO reductase gene cnorB1 and nnrS, which indicated NO production in the cultures.\\n\\nImportanceBy showing that all the three denitrification reductases are active, this demonstrates that Methylophaga nitratireducenticrescens JAM1 is one of many bacteria species that maintain genes associated primarily with denitrification, but not necessarily related to the maintenance of the entire pathway. The reason to maintain such incomplete pathway could be related to the specific role of strain JAM1 in the denitrifying biofilm of a denitrification reactor from which it originates. The small production of N2O via NO in strain JAM1 did not involve Nar contrary to what was demonstrated in Escherichia coli. M. nitratireducenticrescens JAM1 is the only reported Methylophaga species that has the capacity to grow under anoxic conditions by using NO3- and N2O as sole electron acceptors for its growth. It is also one of a few marine methylotrophs that is studied at the physiological and genetic levels in relation to its capacity to perform denitrifying activities.",

    "abstract": "Rhythmic visual stimulation (\\\"flicker\\\") is primarily used to \\\"tag\\\" processing of low-level visual and high-level cognitive phenomena. However, preliminary evidence suggests that flicker may also entrain endogenous brain oscillations, thereby modulating cognitive processes supported by those brain rhythms. Here we tested the interaction between 10 Hz flicker and endogenous alpha-band (~10 Hz) oscillations during a selective visuospatial attention task. We recorded EEG from human participants (both genders) while they performed a modified Eriksen flanker task in which distractors and targets flickered within (10 Hz) or outside (7.5 or 15 Hz) the alpha band. By using a combination of EEG source separation, time-frequency, and single-trial linear mixed effects modeling, we demonstrate that 10 Hz flicker interfered with stimulus processing more on incongruent than congruent trials (high vs. low selective attention demands). Crucially, the effect of 10 Hz flicker on task performance was predicted by the distance between 10 Hz and individual alpha peak frequency (estimated during the task). Finally, the flicker effect on task performance was more strongly predicted by EEG flicker responses during stimulus processing than during preparation for the upcoming stimulus, suggesting that 10 Hz flicker interfered more with reactive than proactive selective attention. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that visual flicker entrained endogenous alpha-band networks, which in turn impaired task performance. Our findings also provide novel evidence for frequency-dependent exogenous modulation of cognition that is determined by the correspondence between the exogenous flicker frequency and the endogenous brain rhythms.\\n\\nSignificanceHere we provide novel evidence that the interaction between exogenous rhythmic visual stimulation and endogenous brain rhythms can have frequency-specific behavioral effects. We show that alpha-band (10 Hz) flicker impairs stimulus processing in a selective attention task when the stimulus flicker rate matches individual alpha peak frequency. The effect of sensory flicker on task performance was stronger when selective attention demands were high, and was stronger during stimulus processing and response selection compared to the pre-stimulus anticipatory period. These findings provide novel evidence that frequency-specific sensory flicker affects online attentional processing, and also demonstrate that the correspondence between exogenous and endogenous rhythms is an overlooked prerequisite when testing for frequency-specific cognitive effects of flicker.",

The molecular effects of these treatments were characterized using sublethal doses, SNP genotyping and mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Protein expression was analyzed using probabilistic graphical models, showing that treatments elicit various responses in some biological processes, providing insights into cell responses to metabolism drugs. Moreover, a flux balance analysis approach using protein expression values was applied, showing that predicted growth rates were comparable with cell viability measurements and suggesting an increase in reactive oxygen species response enzymes due to metformin treatment.

Vesicle fusion behavior differed between vesicle types, cell types, developmental stage, and extracellular environment. Experiment-based mathematical calculations indicated that VAMP2-mediated vesicle fusion supplied excess material for the plasma membrane expansion that occurred early in neuronal morphogenesis, which was balanced in part by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Spatial statistics uncovered distinct spatiotemporal regulation of exocytosis in the soma and neurites of developing neurons that was modulated by developmental stage, exposure to the guidance cue netrin-1, and the brain-enriched ubiquitin ligase TRIM9. In melanoma cells, exocytosis occurred less frequently with distinct spatial clustering patterns.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disorder with a poor prognosis. Deleterious variation within components of the transforming growth factor-{beta} pathway, particularly the bone morphogenetic protein type 2 receptor (BMPR2), underlie most heritable forms of PAH. Since the missing heritability likely involves genetic variation confined to small numbers of cases, we performed whole genome sequencing in 1038 PAH index cases and 6385 PAH-negative control subjects. Case-control analyses revealed significant overrepresentation of rare variants in novel genes, namely ATP13A3, AQP1 and SOX17, and provided independent validation of a critical role for GDF2 in PAH. We provide evidence for familial segregation of mutations in SOX17 and AQP1 with PAH. Mutations in GDF2, encoding a BMPR2 ligand, led to reduced secretion from transfected cells. In addition, we identified pathogenic mutations in the majority of previously reported PAH genes, and provide evidence for further putative genes. Taken together these findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of PAH and indicate unexplored pathways for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Genetic privacy is an area of active research. While it is important to identify new risks, it is equally crucial to supply policymakers with accurate information based on scientific evidence. Recently, Lippert et al. (PNAS, 2017) investigated the status of genetic privacy using trait-predictions from whole genome sequencing. The authors sequenced a cohort of about 1000 individuals and collected a range of demographic, visible, and digital traits such as age, sex, height, face morphology, and a voice signature. They attempted to use the genetic features in order to predict those traits and re-identify the individuals from small pool using the trait predictions. Here, I report major flaws in the Lippert et al. manuscript. In short, the authors technique performs similarly to a simple baseline procedure, does not utilize the power of whole genome markers, uses technically wrong metrics, and finally does not really identify anyone.",

    "abstract": "The type I interferon (IFN-I)-inducible human restriction factor TRIM5 inhibits the infection of human cells by specific nonhuman retroviruses, such as N-MLV and EIAV, but does not generally target HIV-1. However, the introduction of two aminoacid substitutions, R332G and R355G, in the human TRIM5 (huTRIM5) domain responsible for retroviral capsid recognition leads to efficient HIV-1 restriction. Using a DNA transfection-based CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing protocol, we successfully mutated TRIM5 to its HIV-1-restrictive version by homology-directed repair (HDR) in HEK293T cells. Nine clones bearing at least one HDR-edited TRIM5 allele containing both mutations were isolated (5.6% overall efficiency), whereas another one contained only the R332G mutation. Of concern, several of these HDR-edited clones contained on-target undesired mutations, and none had all the alleles corrected. We observed a lack of HIV-1 restriction in the cell clones generated, even when cells were stimulated with IFN-I prior to infection. This, however, was partly explained by the unexpectedly low potential for TRIM5-mediated restriction activity in this cell line. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of editing the TRIM5 gene to in human cells and identifies the main challenges to be addressed in order to use this approach to confer protection from HIV-1.",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations are important for memory formation in the brain. The de-synchronisation of Alpha (10Hz) oscillations in the neo-cortex has been shown to predict successful memory encoding and retrieval. However, when engaging in learning, it has been found that the hippocampus synchronises in Theta (4Hz) oscillations, and that learning is dependent on the phase of Theta. This inconsistency as to whether synchronisation is  good for memory formation leads to confusion over which oscillations we should expect to see and where during learning paradigm experiments. This paper seeks to respond to this inconsistency by presenting a neural network model of how a well-functioning learning system could exhibit both of these phenomena, i.e. desynchronization of alpha and synchronisation of theta during successful memory encoding.\\n\\nWe present a spiking neural network (the Sync/deSync model) of the neo-cortical and hippocampal system. The simulated hippocampus learns through an adapted spike-time dependent plasticity rule, in which weight change is modulated by the phase of an extrinsically generated theta oscillation. Additionally, a global passive weight decay is incorporated, which is also modulated by theta phase. In this way, the Sync/deSync model exhibits theta phase-dependent long-term potentiation and long-term depression. We simulated a learning paradigm experiment and compared the oscillatory dynamics of our model with those observed in single-cell and scalp-EEG studies of the medial temporal lobe. Our Sync/deSync model suggests that both the de-synchronisation of neo-cortical Alpha and the synchronisation of hippocampal Theta are necessary for successful memory encoding and retrieval.\\n\\nSignificance statementA fundamental question is the role of rhythmic activation of neurons, i.e. how their firing oscillates between high and low rates. A particularly important question is how oscillatory dynamics between the neo-cortex and hippocampus contribute to memory formation. We present a spiking neural-network model of such memory formation, with the central ideas that 1) in neo-cortex, neurons need to break-out of an alpha oscillation in order to represent a stimulus (i.e. alpha desynchronises), while 2) in hippocampus, the firing of neurons at theta facilitates formation of memories (i.e. theta synchronises). Accordingly, successful memory formation is marked by reduced neo-cortical alpha and increased hippocampal theta. This pattern has been observed experimentally and gives our model its name - the Synch/deSynch model.",

    "abstract": "We all vary in our mental health, even among healthy (undiagnosed) individuals. Understanding this variability may reveal factors driving the onset of mental illness, as well as factors driving sub-clinical mental health problems that can still influence quality of life. To better understand the large-scale brain network mechanisms underlying this variability in mental health we examined the relationship between mental health symptoms and resting-state functional connectivity patterns in cognitive control systems. The frontoparietal cognitive control network (FPN) consists of flexible hubs that can regulate distributed systems depending on current goals, and dysfunction in the FPN has been identified in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Alterations in FPN connectivity may influence mental health by disrupting the ability to regulate symptoms in a goal-directed manner. This suggests that the FPN may play an important role in the promotion and maintenance of mental health generally. Here we test the hypothesis that disruptions in FPN connectivity are related to mental health (depression) symptoms even among healthy individuals. This hypothesis is consistent with a general role of FPN in the regulation of mental health symptoms. We found that depression symptoms were negatively correlated with between-network global connectivity (BGC) of the FPN as well as the default mode network (DMN). This suggests that decreased connectivity between the FPN (and, separately, DMN) and the rest of the brain is related to increased depression symptoms among undiagnosed individuals. These findings complement previous clinical studies to support the hypothesis that global FPN connectivity contributes to the regulation of mental health symptoms across both mentally healthy and unhealthy individuals.",

    "abstract": "The humpback whale has long been considered a rare straggler into the Persian Gulf, however new evidence contradicts this concept. We here critically review published and new records for Megaptera novaeangliae occurrence in the Gulf for the period 1883-2017. Of eight authenticated records (6 specimens, 2 live-sightings), seven are contemporary cases while one is a mid-Holocene specimen from UAE. An additional four are possible but unsubstantiated reports. Four regional, current, range states are confirmed, i.e. Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar. Four of the five newly reported cases are from Irans coastal waters. We conclude that the Persian Gulf is part of the habitual range of the Arabian Sea humpback whale population, and has been since at least the mid-Holocene. It is unknown whether frequent passage occurs through the Strait of Hormuz or whether whales are (semi)resident. The low abundance of this endangered population and frequent deleterious anthropogenic events, particularly ship strikes and net entanglements, are cause for major concern. In view of its historical and taxonomic relevance, the formal description of Megaptera indica Gervais, 1883, from Iraq, now thought to be a subspecies M. novaeangliae indica, is here translated from French.",
