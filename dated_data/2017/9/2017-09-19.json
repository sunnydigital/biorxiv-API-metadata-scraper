    "abstract": "O_LIThe disease costs of sociality have largely been understood through the link between group size and transmission. However, infectious disease spread is driven primarily by the social organization of interactions in a group and not its size.\\nC_LIO_LIWe used statistical models to review the social network organization of 47 species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and insects by categorizing each species into one of three social systems, relatively solitary, gregarious and socially hierarchical. Additionally, using computational experiments of infection spread, we determined the disease costs of each social system.\\nC_LIO_LIWe find that relatively solitary species have large variation in number of social partners, that socially hierarchical species are the least clustered in their interactions, and that social networks of gregarious species tend to be the most fragmented. However, these structural differences are primarily driven by weak connections, which suggests that different social systems have evolved unique strategies to organize weak ties.\\nC_LIO_LIOur synthetic disease experiments reveal that social network organization can mitigate the disease costs of group living for socially hierarchical species when the pathogen is highly transmissible. In contrast, highly transmissible pathogens cause frequent and prolonged epidemic outbreaks in gregarious species.\\nC_LIO_LIWe evaluate the implications of network organization across social systems despite methodological challenges, and our findings offer new perspective on the debate about the disease costs of group living. Additionally, our study demonstrates the potential of meta-analytic methods in social network analysis to test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses on cooperation, group living, communication, and resilience to extrinsic pressures.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Whole cell responses arise from coordinated interactions between diverse human gene products functioning within various pathways underlying sub-cellular processes (SCP). Lower level SCPs interact to form higher level SCPs, often in a context specific manner to give rise to whole cell function. We sought to determine if capturing such relationships enables us to describe the emergence of whole cell functions from interacting SCPs. We developed the \\\"Molecular Biology of the Cell\\\" ontology based on standard cell biology and biochemistry textbooks and review articles. Currently, our ontology contains 5,392 genes, 753 SCPs and 19,182 expertly curated gene-SCP associations. Our algorithm to populate the SCPs with genes enables extension of the ontology on demand and the adaption of the ontology to the continuously growing cell biological knowledge. Since whole cell responses most often arise from the coordinated activity of multiple SCPs, we developed a dynamic enrichment algorithm that flexibly predicts SCP-SCP relationships beyond the current taxonomy. This algorithm enables us to identify interactions between SCPs as a basis for higher order function in a context dependent manner, allowing us to provide a detailed description of how SCPs together can give rise to whole cell functions. We conclude that this ontology can, from omics data sets, enable the development of detailed multidimensional SCP networks for predictive modeling of emergent whole cell functions.",

    "abstract": "Spatial organisation of the genome is essential for regulating gene activity, yet the mechanisms that shape this three-dimensional organisation in eukaryotes are far from understood. Here, we combine bioinformatic determination of chromatin states during normal growth and heat shock, and computational polymer modelling of genome structure, with quantitative microscopy and Hi-C to demonstrate that differential mobility of yeast chromosome segments leads to spatial self-organisation of the genome. We observe that more than forty percent of chromatin-associated proteins display a poised and heterogeneous distribution along the chromosome, creating a heteropolymer. This distribution changes upon heat shock in a concerted, state-specific manner. Simulating yeast chromosomes as heteropolymers, in which the mobility of each segment depends on its cumulative protein occupancy, results in functionally relevant structures, which match our experimental data. This thermodynamically driven self-organisation achieves spatial clustering of poised genes and mechanistically contributes to the directed relocalisation of active genes to the nuclear periphery upon heat shock.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryUnequal protein occupancy and chromosome segment mobility drive 3D organisation of the genome.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community in Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100025). Reproductive interference is considered a strong ecological force, potentially leading to species exclusion. This supposes that the net effect of reproductive interactions is strongly negative for one of the species involved. Testing this requires a comprehensive analysis of interspecific reproductive interactions, accounting for the order and timing of mating events, and for their effects on either fertility or fecundity. To this aim, we measured reproductive interactions between a focal species, Tetranychus urticae, and an invasive (T.evansi) and a resident (T. ludeni) species, varying the mating sequence and interval, and measuring the effect of such crosses on fecundity and offspring sex ratio (a measure of fertility, as these species are haplodiploid). We found that mating with heterospecifics affected fecundity and sex ratio negatively, but also positively, depending on the species involved, and on the order and timing of mating events. Overall, the net effect of reproductive interactions was weak despite strong effects of particular events. In natural situations, the outcome of reproductive interactions will thus hinge upon the frequency of each event.",

We present an approach to building computational models directly from natural language using automated assembly. Molecular mechanisms described in simple English are read by natural language processing algorithms, converted into an intermediate representation and assembled into executable or network models. We have implemented this approach in the Integrated Network and Dynamical Reasoning Assembler (INDRA), which draws on existing natural language processing systems as well as pathway information in Pathway Commons and other online resources. We demonstrate the use of INDRA and natural language to model three biological processes of increasing scope: (i) p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage; (ii) adaptive drug resistance in BRAF-V600E mutant melanomas; and (iii) the RAS signaling pathway. The use of natural language for modeling makes routine tasks more efficient for modeling practitioners and increases the accessibility and transparency of models for the broader biology community.\\n\\nStandfirst textINDRA uses natural language processing systems to read descriptions of molecular mechanisms and assembles them into executable models.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIINDRA decouples the curation of knowledge as word models from model implementation\\nC_LIO_LIINDRA is connected to multiple natural language processing systems and can draw on information from curated databases\\nC_LIO_LIINDRA can assemble dynamical models in rule-based and reaction network formalisms, as well as Boolean networks and visualization formats\\nC_LIO_LIWe used INDRA to build models of p53 dynamics, resistance to targeted inhibitors of BRAF in melanoma, and the Ras signaling pathway from natural language\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The direct monitoring of mosquito populations in field settings is a crucial input for shaping appropriate and timely control measures for mosquito-borne diseases. Here, we demonstrate that commercially available mobile phones are a powerful tool for acoustically mapping mosquito species distributions worldwide. We show that even low-cost mobile phones with very basic functionality are capable of sensitively acquiring acoustic data on species-specific mosquito wingbeat sounds, while simultaneously recording the time and location of the human-mosquito encounter. We survey a wide range of medically important mosquito species, to quantitatively demonstrate how acoustic recordings supported by spatio-temporal metadata enable rapid, non-invasive species identification. As proof-of-concept, we carry out field demonstrations where minimally-trained users map local mosquitoes using their personal phones. Thus, we establish a new paradigm for mosquito surveillance that takes advantage of the existing global mobile network infrastructure, to enable continuous and large-scale data acquisition in resource-constrained areas.",

    "abstract": "The auditory system processes temporal information at multiple scales, and disruptions to this temporal processing may lead to deficits in auditory tasks such as detecting and discriminating sounds in a noisy environment. Here, a modelling approach is used to study the temporal regularity of firing by chopper cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus, in both the normal and impaired auditory system. Chopper cells, which have a strikingly regular firing response, divide into two classes, sustained and transient, based on the time course of this regularity. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the behaviour of chopper cells, and the difference between sustained and transient cells in particular. However, there is no conclusive evidence so far. Here, a reduced mathematical model is developed and used to compare and test a wide range of hypotheses with a limited number of parameters. Simulation results show a continuum of cell types and behaviours: chopper-like behaviour arises for a wide range of parameters, suggesting that multiple mechanisms may underlie this behaviour. The model accounts for systematic trends in regularity as a function of stimulus level that have previously only been reported anecdotally. Finally, the model is used to predict the effects of a reduction in the number of auditory nerve fibres (deafferentation due to, for example, cochlear synaptopathy). An interactive version of this paper in which all the model parameters can be changed is available online.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIA low parameter model reproduces chopper cell firing regularity\\nC_LIO_LIMultiple factors can account for sustained vs transient chopper cell response\\nC_LIO_LIThe model explains stimulus level dependence of firing regularity\\nC_LIO_LIThe model predicts chopper cells fire more irregularly after deafferentation\\nC_LIO_LIAn interactive version of the paper allows readers to change parameters\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Farming was first introduced to southeastern Europe in the mid-7th millennium BCE - brought by migrants from Anatolia who settled in the region before spreading throughout Europe. To clarify the dynamics of the interaction between the first farmers and indigenous hunter-gatherers where they first met, we analyze genome-wide ancient DNA data from 223 individuals who lived in southeastern Europe and surrounding regions between 12,000 and 500 BCE. We document previously uncharacterized genetic structure, showing a West-East cline of ancestry in hunter-gatherers, and show that some Aegean farmers had ancestry from a different lineage than the northwestern Anatolian lineage that formed the overwhelming ancestry of other European farmers. We show that the first farmers of northern and western Europe passed through southeastern Europe with limited admixture with local hunter-gatherers, but that some groups mixed extensively, with relatively sex-balanced admixture compared to the male-biased hunter-gatherer admixture that prevailed later in the North and West. Southeastern Europe continued to be a nexus between East and West after farming arrived, with intermittent genetic contact from the Steppe up to 2,000 years before the migration that replaced much of northern Europes population.",

    "abstract": "Working with cancer whole genomes sequenced over a period of many years in different sequencing centres requires a validated framework to compare the quality of these sequences. The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), a project a cohort of over 2800 donors provided us with the challenge of assessing the quality of the genome sequences. A non-redundant set of five quality control (QC) measurements were assembled and used to establish a star rating system. These QC measures reflect known differences in sequencing protocol and provide a guide to downstream analyses of these whole genome sequences. The resulting QC measures also allowed for exclusion samples of poor quality, providing researchers within PCAWG, and when the data is released for other researchers, a good idea of the sequencing quality. For a researcher wishing to apply the QC measures for their data we provide a Docker Container of the software used to calculate them. We believe that this is an effective framework of quality measures for whole genome, cancer sequences, which will be a useful addition to analytical pipelines, as it has to the PCAWG project.",

    "abstract": "The influence of oncogenic phenomena on the ecology and evolution of animal species is fast becoming an important research topic. Similar to host-pathogen interactions, cancer negatively affects host fitness, which should lead to the selection of host control mechanisms, including behavioral traits that best minimize the proliferation of malignant cells. Social behavior is one such trait, which is suggested to influence cancer progression. While the ecological benefits of sociality in gregarious species are widely acknowledged, only limited data are available on the role of the social environment on cancer progression. Here, we exposed adult Drosophila, with colorectal-like tumors, to different social environments. First, we show that cancerous flies kept in complete isolation exhibit increased tumor progression. Yet, more surprisingly, we find that cancerous flies, kept in groups with other noncancerous individuals, also develop tumors at a faster rate compared to those kept with other cancerous conspecifics, suggesting a strong impact of social group composition on cancer growth. Finally, we show that flies can discriminate between individuals at different stages of tumor growth and selectively choose their social environment accordingly. Control flies actively avoid flies with cancer but only at the later stages of tumor development, whereas cancerous flies display strong social interactions with cancerous flies in the early stages of tumor growth. Our study demonstrates the reciprocal links between cancer and social interactions, as well as highlighting how sociality impacts health and fitness in animals and its potential implications for disease ecology and ecosystem dynamics.",

Despite its popularity in functional MRI (fMRI) studies, its reliability and reproducibility have not been evaluated. We investigated reproducibility and reliability of PPI effects during a simple visual task, and examined the effect of deconvolution on the PPI results. A large open-access dataset was analyzed (n = 138), where a visual task was scanned twice with repetition times (TRs) of 645 ms and 1400 ms, respectively. We first replicated our previous results by using the left and right middle occipital gyrus as seeds. Then ROI-wise (regions of interest) analysis was performed among twenty visual-related thalamic and cortical regions, and negative PPI effects were found between many ROIs with the posterior fusiform gyrus as a hub region. Both the seed-based and ROI-wise results were similar between the two runs and between the two PPI methods with and without deconvolution. The non-deconvolution method and the short TR run in general had larger effect sizes and greater extents. However, the deconvolution method performed worse in the 645 ms TR run than the 1400 ms TR run in the voxel-wise analysis. Given the general similar results between the two methods and the uncertainty of deconvolution, we suggest that deconvolution may be not necessary for PPI analysis on block-designed data. Lastly, intraclass correlations between the two runs were much lower for the PPI effects than the activation main effects, which raise cautions on performing inter-subject correlations and group comparisons on PPI effects.",

Dormancy allows a population to maintain a reservoir of genetic and phenotypic diversity (i.e., a seed bank) that can contribute to the long-term survival of a population. This strategy can be potentially adaptive and has long been of interest to ecologists and evolutionary biologists. However, comparatively little is known about how dormancy influences the fundamental evolutionary forces of genetic drift, mutation, selection, recombination, and gene flow. Here, we investigate how seed banks affect the processes underpinning evolution by reviewing existing theory, implementing novel simulations, and determining how and when dormancy can influence evolution as a population genetic process. We extend our analysis to examine how seed banks can alter macroevolutionary processes, including rates of speciation and extinction. Through the lens of population genetic theory, we can understand the extent that seed banks influence microbial evolutionary dynamics.",

Within BD cases, there was an effect gradient, indexed by the nature of psychosis, with prominent mood-incongruent psychotic features having the strongest association (RR=1.46, (95% C.1.1.36, 1.57)), followed by mood-congruent psychosis (RR= 1.24, (95% C.1. 1.17, 1.33)) and lastly, BD cases with no history of psychosis (RR= 1.09, (95% C.1. 1.04, 1.15)).\\n\\nConclusionWe show for the first time a polygenic-risk gradient, across schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, indexed by the occurrence and level of mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe construction of rank hierarchies based on agonistic interactions between two individuals (\\\"dyads\\\") is an important component in the characterization of the social structure of groups. To this end, winner-loser matrices are typically created, which collapse the outcome of dyadic interactions over time, resulting in the loss of all information contained in the temporal domain. Methods that track changes in the outcome of dyadic interactions (such as \\\"Elo-scores\\\") are receiving increasing interest. Critically, individual scores are not just based on the succession of wins and losses, but depend on the values of starting scores and an update (\\\"tax\\\") coefficient. Recent studies improved existing methods by introducing a point estimation of these auxiliary parameters on the basis of a maximum likelihood (ML) approach. For a sound assessment of the rank hierarchies generated this way, we argue that measures of uncertainty of the estimates, as well as a quantification of the robustness of the methods, are also needed.\\nC_LIO_LIWe introduce a Bayesian inference (BI) approach using   partial pooling\\\", which rests on the assumption that all starting scores are samples from the same distribution. We compare the outcome of the ML approach to that of the BI approach using real-world data. In addition, we simulate different scenarios to explore in which way the Elo-score responds to social events (such as rank changes), and low numbers of observations.\\nC_LIO_LIEstimates of the starting scores based on  partial pooling\\\" are more robust than those based on ML, also in scenarios where some individuals have only few observations. Our simulations show that assumed rank differences may fall well within the  uncertain\\\" range, and that low sampling density, unbalanced designs, and coalitionary leaps involving several individuals within the hierarchy may yield unreliable results.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results support the view that Elo rating can be a powerful tool in the analysis of social behaviour, when the data meet certain criteria. Assessing the uncertainty greatly aids in the interpretation of results. We advocate running simulation approaches to test how well Elo scores reflect the (simulated) true structure and how sensitive the score is to true changes in the hierarchy.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Divalent d-block metal cations (DDMCs), such as Fe, Zn and Mn, participate in many biological processes. Understanding how specific DDMCs are transported to and within the cell and what controls their binding selectivity to different proteins is crucial for defining the mechanisms of metalloproteins. To better understand such processes, we scanned the RCSB Protein Data Bank, performed a de novo structural-based comprehensive analysis of seven DDMCs and found their amino acid binding and coordination geometry propensities. We then utilized these results to characterize the correlation between metal selectivity, specific binding site composition and phylogenetic classification of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) protein family, a family of DDMC transporters found throughout evolution and sharing a conserved structure, yet with different members displaying distinct metal selectivity. Our analysis shows that DDMCs differ, at times significantly, in terms of their binding propensities, and that in each CDF clade, the metal selectivity-related binding site has a unique and conserved sequence signature. However, only limited correlation exists between the composition of the DDMC binding site in each clade and the metal selectivity shown by its proteins.",

    "abstract": "Bioinformatic analyses and tools make extensive use of k-mers (fixed contiguous strings of k nucleotides) as an informational unit. K-mer analyses are both useful and fast, but are strongly affected by single-nucleotide polymorphisms or sequencing errors, effectively hindering direct-analyses of whole regions and decreasing their usability between evolutionary distant samples.\\n\\nWe introduce a concept of skip-mers, a cyclic pattern of used-and-skipped positions of k nucleotides spanning a region of size S [&ge;] k, and show how analyses are improved compared to using k-mers. The entropy of skip-mers increases with the larger span, capturing information from more distant positions and increasing the specificity, and uniqueness, of larger span skip-mers within a genome. In addition, skip-mers constructed in cycles of 1 or 2 nucleotides in every 3 (or a multiple of 3) lead to increased sensitivity in the coding regions of genes, by grouping together the more conserved nucleotides of the protein-coding regions.\\n\\nWe implemented a set of tools to count and intersect skip-mers between different datasets. We used these tools to show how skip-mers have advantages over k-mers in terms of entropy and increased sensitivity to detect conserved coding sequence, allowing better identification of genic matches between evolutionarily distant species.

    "abstract": "BackgroundRemarkable advances for clinical diagnosis and treatment in cancers including lung cancer involve cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection through next generation sequencing. However, before the sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA detection can be widely recognized, the consistency of mutations in tumor tissue and ctDNA should be evaluated. The urgency of this consistency is extremely obvious in lung cancer to which great attention has been paid to in liquid biopsy field.\\n\\nMethodsWe have developed an approach named systematic error correction sequencing (Sec-Seq) to improve the evaluation of sequence alterations in circulating cell-free DNA. Averagely 10 ml preoperative blood samples were collected from 30 patients containing pulmonary space occupying pathological changes by traditional clinic diagnosis. cfDNA from plasma, genomic DNA from white blood cells, and genomic DNA from solid tumor of above patients were extracted and constructed as libraries for each sample before subjected to sequencing by a panel contains 50 cancer-associated genes encompassing 29 kb by custom probe hybridization capture with average depth >40000, 7000, or 6300 folds respectively.\\n\\nResultsDetection limit for mutant allele frequency in our study was 0.1%. The sequencing results were analyzed by bioinformatic expertise based on our previous studies on the baseline mutation profiling of circulating cell-free DNA and the clinicopathological data of these patients. Among all the lung cancer patients, 78% patients were predicted as positive by ctDNA sequencing when the shreshold was defined as at least one of the hotspot mutations detected in the blood (ctDNA) was also detected in tumor tissue. Pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis were detected as negative according to the above standard. When evaluating all hotspots in driver genes in the panel, 24% mutations detected in tumor tissue (tDNA) were also detected in patients blood (ctDNA). When evaluating all genetic variations in the panel, including all the driver genes and passenger genes, 28% detected in tumor tissue (tDNA) were also detected in patients blood (ctDNA). Positive detection rates of plasma ctDNA in stage I lung cancer patients is 85%, compared with 17% of tumor biomarkers.\\n\\nConclusionWe demonstrated the importance of sequencing both circulating cell-free DNA and genomic DNA in tumor tissue for ctDNA detection in lung cancer currently. We also determined and confirmed the consistency of ctDNA and tumor tissue through NGS according to the criteria explored in our studies. Our strategy can initially distinguish the lung cancer from benign lesions of lung. Our work shows that the consistency will be benefited from the optimization in sensitivity and specificity in ctDNA detection.",

    "abstract": "We construct genomic predictors for heritable and extremely complex human quantitative traits (height, heel bone density, and educational attainment) using modern methods in high dimensional statistics (i.e., machine learning). Replication tests show that these predictors capture, respectively, ~40, 20, and 9 percent of total variance for the three traits. For example, predicted heights correlate ~0.65 with actual height; actual heights of most individuals in validation samples are within a few cm of the prediction. The variance captured for height is comparable to the estimated SNP heritability from GCTA (GREML) analysis, and seems to be close to its asymptotic value (i.e., as sample size goes to infinity), suggesting that we have captured most of the heritability for the SNPs used. Thus, our results resolve the common SNP portion of the \\\"missing heritability\\\" problem - i.e., the gap between prediction R-squared and SNP heritability. The ~20k activated SNPs in our height predictor reveal the genetic architecture of human height, at least for common SNPs. Our primary dataset is the UK Biobank cohort, comprised of almost 500k individual genotypes with multiple phenotypes. We also use other datasets and SNPs found in earlier GWAS for out-of-sample validation of our results.",

    "abstract": "Population genomic studies can reveal the allele frequencies at millions of SNPs, with the numbers of observed low frequency SNPs increasing as more genomes are sequenced. Rare alleles tend to be younger than common alleles and are especially useful for studying demographic history, selection and heritability1,2. However, allele frequency can be a poor proxy for allele age, as genetic drift and natural selection can lead to alleles that are both rare and old. In order to allow joint assessments of allele frequency and allele age, a new estimator of allele age was developed that can be applied to variants of the lowest observed frequencies (singletons). By examining the geographic and age distribution of very rare variants in a large genomic sample from the UK3, we identify new evidence of gene flow from Africa into the ancestors of the modern UK population. A substantial proportion of variants with observed frequencies as low as 1.4 x 10-4 are orders of magnitude older than can be explained without African gene flow and are found at much higher frequencies within modern African populations. We estimate that African populations contributed approximately 1.2% of the UK gene pool and did so approximately 400 years ago. These findings are relevant both to our understanding of human history and to the nature of rare variation segregating within populations: a variant that is rare because it is a recent mutation in the direct ancestor of the population will have had a very different evolutionary history than an ancient one that has persisted at high frequencies in a diverged population and only recently arrived through migration.",

    "abstract": "Alpha oscillations play a special role in vision. During sensory processing, reverse-correlation techniques revealed that white-noise luminance sequences elicit a robust occipital [~]10 Hz response that periodically reverberates the input sequence for up to 1 s. These perceptual echoes constitute the impulse response function of the visual system. However, the spatial dimension of perceptual echoes remains unknown: do they reverberate across the cortex simultaneously? Does stimulation over multiple visual coordinates evoke multiple synchronized echoes, or do they show consistent phase differences? Here, we tested the spatial dimension of perceptual echoes in two electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments manipulating the location of the visual stimulation. When a single disc flickered a white-noise luminance sequence in the upper visual field, we observed a single \\\"echo wave\\\" originating in posterior sensors and spatially propagating towards frontal ones (i.e. periodic travelling wave). The presentation of two independent flickering discs in separate visual hemifields produced two simultaneous and superimposed echo waves propagating in opposite directions, one in response to each stimulus. Strikingly, at many electrode sites, the phase of the two echoes differed, with a phase advance for the contralateral stimulus location. EEG source reconstruction tentatively located the waves within contralateral parieto-occipital cortex. In conclusion, the alpha rhythm processes stimulus information as a travelling wave that propagates across the cortical representation of retinotopic space in the human brain. In line with the \\\"cortical scanning\\\" hypothesis (Pitts & McCulloch, 1947), these results suggest the existence of an additional spatial dimension embedded in the phase of the alpha rhythm.\\n\\nSignificance statementHow does the spatial dimension of sensory processing relate to the temporal dimension of brain rhythms? Using correlation techniques, we characterized perceptual echoes, the average electroencephalogram response induced by visual stimuli that change luminance randomly. We found that perceptual echoes are actually periodic waves that travel through human visual cortex. Strikingly these periodic waves show consistent phase differences across the visual field, processing screen locations sequentially across distinct phases of the cycle following basic retinotopy. These results suggest the existence of an additional \\\"hidden\\\" spatial dimension in sensory cortex, encoded in the phase of the alpha oscillatory cycle. This could mean that perceptual echoes behave like sweeps of a sonar, processing the visual field in cycles of [~]100 ms duration.",

    "abstract": "Grey matter atrophy is present from the earliest clinical stages of multiple sclerosis (MS), but the temporal ordering is poorly understood. We aimed to determine the sequence in which grey matter regions become atrophic in MS, and its association with disability accumulation.\\n\\nIn this longitudinal study, we included 1,417 subjects: 253 with clinically-isolated syndrome (CIS), 708 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 128 secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), 125 primary-progressive MS (PPMS), and 203 healthy controls from 7 European centres. Subjects underwent repeated MRI scanning (total number of scans 3,604); the mean follow-up for patients was 2.41yrs (SD{+/-}1.97). Disability was scored using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). We calculated the volume of brain grey matter regions and brainstem using an unbiased within-subject template. We used an established data-driven event-based model (EBM) to determine the sequence of occurrence of atrophy and its uncertainty. We assigned each subject to a specific EBM stage, based on the number of their atrophic regions. We used nested linear mixed-effects regression models to explore the associations between the rate of increase in the EBM stages over time, disease duration and annual rate of EDSS gain.\\n\\nThe first regions to become atrophic in CIS and relapse-onset MS patients (RRMS and SPMS) were the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, followed by the middle cingulate cortex, brainstem and thalamus. The sequence of atrophy in PPMS showed a similar involvement of the thalamus, cuneus, precuneus, and pallidum, followed by the brainstem and posterior cingulate cortex. The cerebellum, caudate and putamen showed early atrophy in relapse-onset MS and late atrophy in PPMS. Patients with SPMS showed the highest EBM stages (highest number of atrophic regions, all p<0.001) at study entry. Rates of increase in EBM stages were significantly different from healthy controls in all MS phenotypes, except for CIS. The increase in the number of atrophic regions (EBM stage) was associated with disease duration in all patients. EBM stage was associated with disability accumulation in RRMS independent of disease duration (p<0.0001).\\n\\nThis data-driven staging of atrophy progression in a large MS sample demonstrates that grey matter atrophy spreads to involve more regions over time. The sequence in which regions become atrophic is reasonably consistent across MS phenotypes. The spread of atrophy was associated with disease duration, and disability accumulation in RRMS.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Reductions in MAP and mean MCAv (MCAVmean) during initial orthostatic stress (0-30 s after sit-to-stand) and the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension were also determined.

We functionally profiled genes required for fatty acid catabolism and lipid accumulation, validating results with 35 targeted deletion strains. We found that both mitochondrial and peroxisomal enzymes were required for growth on fatty acids, with different peroxisomal enzymes required on different fatty acids. We identified a high-confidence set of 150 genes affecting lipid accumulation, including genes with predicted function in signaling cascades, gene expression, protein modification and vesicular trafficking, autophagy, amino acid synthesis and tRNA modification, as well as genes of unknown function.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWModeling discrete phenotypic traits for either ancestral character state reconstruction or morphology-based phylogenetic inference suffers from ambiguities of character coding, homology assessment, dependencies, and selection of adequate models. These drawbacks occur because trait evolution is driven by two key processes - hierarchical and hidden - which are not accommodated simultaneously by the available phylogenetic methods. The hierarchical process refers to the dependencies between anatomical body parts, while the hidden process refers to the evolution of gene regulatory networks underlying trait development. Herein, I demonstrate that these processes can be efficiently modeled using structured Markov models equipped with hidden states, which resolves the majority of the problems associated with discrete traits. Integration of structured Markov models with anatomy ontologies can adequately incorporate the hierarchical dependencies, while the use of the hidden states accommodates hidden evolution of gene regulatory networks and substitution rate heterogeneity. I assess the new models using simulations and theoretical synthesis. The new approach solves the long-standing tail color problem (that aims at coding tail when it is absent) and presents a previously unknown issue called the \\\"two-scientist paradox\\\". The latter issue refers to the confounding nature of the coding of a trait and the hidden processes driving the traits evolution; failing to account for the hidden process may result in a bias, which can be avoided by using hidden state models. All this provides a clear guideline for coding traits into characters. This paper gives practical examples of using the new framework for phylogenetic inference and comparative analysis.",

    "abstract": "The vast biochemical repertoire found in microbial communities from a wide-range of environments allows screening and isolation of novel enzymes with improved catalytic features. In this sense, metagenomics approaches have been of high relevance for providing enzymes used in diverse industrial applications. For instance, glycosyl hydrolases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of carbohydrates to sugars, are essential for bioethanol production from renewable resources. In the current study, we have focused on the prospection of protease and glycosyl hydrolase activities from microbial communities inhabiting a soil sample by using the lacZ-based plasmid pSEVA232 in the generation of a screenable metagenomic library. For this, we used a functional screen based on skimmed milk agar and a pH indicator dye as previously reported in literature. Although we effectively identified nine positive clones in the screenings, subsequent experiments revealed that this phenotype was not because of the hydrolytic activity encoded in the metagenomic fragments, but rather due to the insertion of small metagenomic DNA fragments in frame within the coding region of the lacZ alpha gene present in the original vector. We concluded that the current method has a higher tendency for false positive recovery of clones, when used in combination with a lacZ-based vector. Finally, we discuss the molecular explanation for positive phenotype recovering and highlight the importance of reporting boundaries in metagenomic screenings methodologies.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas13a enzymes are RNA-guided, RNA-activated ribonucleases. Their properties have been exploited as powerful tools for RNA detection, RNA imaging and RNA regulation. However, the relationship between target RNA binding and HEPN (higher-eukaryotes-and-prokaryotes nucleotide-binding)- domain nuclease activation is not well understood. Using sequencing experiments coupled with in vitro biochemistry, we find that Cas13as target RNA binding affinity and HEPN-nuclease activity are differentially affected by the number of and position of mismatches between the guide and target. We identify a central  binding seed where perfect base pairing is absolutely required for target binding, and a separate  nuclease switch where imperfect base-pairing results in tight binding but no HEPN-nuclease activation. These results demonstrate that the binding and cleavage activities of Cas13a are decoupled, highlighting a complex specificity landscape. Our findings underscore a need to consider the range of effects off-target recognition has on Cas13as RNA binding and cleavage behavior for RNA-targeting tool development.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic disease is often characterized by altered cellular contractility and deformability, lending cells and groups of cells the flexibility to navigate through different microenvironments. This ability to change cell shape is driven in large part by the structural elements of the mechanobiome, which includes cytoskeletal proteins that sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that key mechanoresponsive proteins (those which accumulate in response to mechanical stress), specifically nonmuscle myosin IIA and IIC, -actinin 4, and filamin B, are highly upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC) and in patient-derived pancreatic cancer cell lines. Their less responsive sister paralogs (myosin IIB, -actinin 1, and filamin A) show a smaller dynamic range or disappear with PDAC progression. We demonstrate that these mechanoresponsive proteins directly impact cell mechanics using knock-down and overexpression cell lines. We further quantify the nonmuscle myosin II family members in patient-derived cell lines and identify a role for myosin IIC in the formation of transverse actin arcs in single cells and cortical actin belts in tissue spheroids. We harness the upregulation of myosin IIC and its impact of cytoskeletal architecture through the use of the mechanical modulator 4-hydroxyacetophenone (4-HAP), which increases myosin IIC assembly and stiffens cells. Here, 4-HAP decreases dissemination, induces cortical actin belts, and slows retrograde actin flow in spheroids. Finally, mice having undergone hemi-splenectomies with PDAC cells and then treated with 4-HAP have a reduction in liver metastases. Thus, increasing the activity of these mechanoresponsive proteins (in this case, by increasing myosin IIC assembly) to overwhelm the ability of cells to polarize and invade may be an effective strategy to improve the five-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer patients, currently hovering around 6%.",

    "abstract": "Structural priming is the tendency to repeat syntactic structure across sentences and can be divided into short-term (prime to immediately following target) and long-term (across an experimental session) components. This study investigates how non-declarative memory could support both the transient, short-term and the persistent, long-term structural priming effects commonly seen in the literature. We propose that these characteristics are supported by different subcomponents of non-declarative memory: Perceptual and conceptual non-declarative memory respectively. Previous studies have suggested that these subcomponents age differently, with only conceptual memory showing age-related decline. By investigating how different components of structural priming vary across the lifespan, we aim to elucidate how non-declarative memory supports two seemingly different components of structural priming. In 167 participants ranging between 20 and 85 years old, we find no change in short-term priming magnitude and performance on perceptual tasks, whereas both long-term priming and conceptual memory vary with age. We suggest therefore that the two seemingly different components of structural priming are supported by different components of non-declarative memory. These findings have important implications for theoretical accounts of structural priming.",

    "abstract": "It is increasingly recognized that Alzheimers disease (AD) exists before dementia is present and that shifts in amyloid beta occur long before clinical symptoms can be detected. Early detection of these molecular changes is a key aspect for the success of interventions aimed at slowing down rates of cognitive decline. Recent evidence indicates that of the two established methods for measuring amyloid, a decrease in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) amyloid {beta}1-42 (A{beta}1-42) may be an earlier indicator of Alzheimers disease risk than measures of amyloid obtained from Positron Emission Topography (PET). However, CSF collection is highly invasive and expensive. In contrast, blood collection is routinely performed, minimally invasive and cheap. In this work, we develop a blood-based signature that can provide a cheap and minimally invasive estimation of an individuals CSF amyloid status using a machine learning approach. We show that a Random Forest model derived from plasma analytes can accurately predict subjects as having abnormal (low) CSF A{beta}1-42 levels indicative of AD risk (0.84 AUC, 0.78 sensitivity, and 0.73 specificity). Refinement of the modeling indicates that only APOE{varepsilon}4 carrier status and four analytes are required to achieve a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, we show across an independent validation cohort that individuals with predicted abnormal CSF A{beta}1-42 levels transitioned to an AD diagnosis over 120 months significantly faster than those predicted with normal CSF A{beta}1-42 levels and that the resulting model also performs reasonably across PET A{beta}1-42 status.\\n\\nThis is the first study to show that a machine learning approach, using plasma protein levels, age and APOE{varepsilon}4 carrier status, is able to predict CSF A{beta}1-42 status, the earliest risk indicator for AD, with high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "What forces direct brain organization and its plasticity? When a brain region is deprived of its input would this region reorganize based on compensation for the disability and experience, or would strong limitations of brain structure limit its plasticity? People born without hands activate their sensorimotor hand region while moving body parts used to compensate for this ability (e.g. their feet). This has been taken to suggest a neural organization based on functions, such as performing manual-like dexterous actions, rather than on body parts. Here we test the selectivity for functionally-compensatory body parts in the sensorimotor cortex of people born without hands. Despite clear compensatory foot use, the sensorimotor hand area in the dysplasic subjects showed preference for body parts whose cortical territory is close to the hand area, but which are not compensatorily used as effectors. This suggests that function-based organization, originally proposed for congenital blindness and deafness, does not apply to cases of the primary sensorimotor cortex deprivation in dysplasia. This is consistent with the idea that experience-independent functional specialization occurs at relatively high levels of representation. Indeed, increased and selective foot movement preference in the dysplasics was found in the association cortex, in the inferior parietal lobule. Furthermore, it stresses the roles of neuroanatomical constraints such as topographical proximity and connectivity in determining the functional development of brain regions. These findings reveal limitations to brain plasticity and to the role of experience in shaping the functional organization of the brain.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWhat determines the role of brain regions, and their plasticity when typical inputs or experience is not provided? To what extent can extreme compensatory use affect brain organization? We tested the functional reorganization of the primary sensorimotor cortex hand area in people born without hands, who use their feet for every-day tasks. We found that it is preferentially activated by close-by body-parts which cannot serve as effectors, and not by the feet. In contrast, foot-selective compensatory plasticity was found in the association cortex, in an area involved in tool use. This shows limitations of compensatory plasticity and experience in modifying brain organization of early topographical cortex, as compared to association cortices where function-based organization is the driving factor.\\n\\nClassificationBiological Sciences\\\\Neuroscience",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal oscillations arise from coordinated activity among distinct populations of neurons and are associated with cognitive functions and behaviors. Although much progress has been made toward identifying the relative contribution of specific neuronal populations in hippocampal oscillations, far less is known about the role of hippocampal area CA2, which is thought to support social aspects of episodic memory. Furthermore, the little existing evidence on the role of CA2 in oscillations has led to conflicting conclusions. Therefore, we sought to identify the specific contribution of CA2 pyramidal neurons to brain oscillations using a controlled experimental system. We used excitatory and inhibitory DREADDs in transgenic mice to acutely and reversibly manipulate CA2 pyramidal cell activity. Here, we report on the role of CA2 in hippocampal-prefrontal cortical network oscillations and social behavior. We found that excitation or inhibition of CA2 pyramidal cells bidirectionally regulated hippocampal and prefrontal cortical low gamma oscillations and inversely modulated hippocampal ripple oscillations. Further, CA2 inhibition impaired social approach behavior. These findings support a role for CA2 in low gamma generation and ripple modulation within the hippocampus and underscore the importance of CA2 neuronal activity in extrahippocampal oscillations and social behavior.",

    "abstract": "The number of simultaneously recorded electrodes in neuroscience is steadily increasing, providing new opportunities for understanding brain function, but also new challenges for appropriately dealing with the increase in dimensionality. Multivariate source-separation analysis methods have been particularly effective at improving signal-to-noise ratio while reducing the dimensionality of the data, and are widely used for cleaning, classifying, and source-localizing multichannel neural time series data. Most source-separation methods produce a spatial component (that is, a weighted combination of channels to produce one time series); here, this is extended to apply sourceseparation to a time series, with the idea of obtaining a weighted combination of successive time points, such that the weights are optimized to satisfy some criteria. This is achieved via a two-stage source-separation procedure, in which an optimal spatial filter is first constructed, and then its optimal temporal basis function is computed. This second stage is achieved with a time-delay-embedding matrix, in which additional rows of a matrix are created from time-delayed versions of existing rows. The optimal spatial and temporal weights can be obtained by solving a generalized eigendecomposition of covariance matrices. The method is demonstrated in simulated data and in an empirical EEG study on theta-band activity during response conflict. Spatiotemporal source separation has several advantages, including defining empirical filters without the need to apply sinusoidal narrowband filters.",

Genetic analysis of BE could facilitate therapeutic discovery. We used an intermittent, limited access BE paradigm involving sweetened palatable food (PF) to examine genetic differences in BE, conditioned food reward, and compulsive-like eating between C57BL/6J (B6J) and DBA/2J (D2J) inbred mouse strains. D2J mice showed a robust escalation in intake and conditioned place preference for the PF-paired side. D2J mice also showed a unique style of compulsive-like eating in the light/dark conflict test where they rapidly hoarded and consumed PF in the preferred unlit environment. BE and compulsive-like eating exhibited narrow-sense heritability estimates between 56 and 73 percent. To gain insight into the genetic basis, we phenotyped and genotyped a small cohort of 133 B6J x D2J-F2 mice at the peak location of three quantitative trait loci (QTL) previously identified in F2 mice for sweet taste (chromosome 4: 156 Mb), bitter taste (chromosome 6: 133 Mb) and behavioral sensitivity to drugs of abuse (chromosome 11: 50 Mb). The D2J allele on chromosome 6 was associated with greater PF intake on training days and greater compulsive-like PF intake, but only in males, suggesting that decreased bitter taste may increase BE in males. The D2J allele on chromosome 11 was associated with an increase in final PF intake and slope of escalation across days. Future studies employing larger crosses and genetic reference panels comprising B6J and D2J alleles will identify causal genes and neurobiological mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical loading is an important aspect of post-surgical care. The timing of load application relative to the injury event is thought to differentially regulate repair depending on the stage of healing. Here, we show using a novel mechanobiological model of cortical defect repair that daily loading (5 N peak load, 2 Hz, 60 cycles, 4 consecutive days) during hematoma consolidation and inflammation disrupts the injury site and activates cartilage formation on the periosteal surface adjacent to the defect. We also show that daily loading during the matrix deposition phase enhances both bone and cartilage formation at the defect site, while loading during the remodeling phase results in an enlarged woven bone regenerate. All loading regimens resulted in abundant cellular proliferation within the regenerate and at the periosteal surface and fibrous tissue formation directly above the defect. Stress was concentrated at the edges of the defect during exogenous loading, and finite element (FE)-modeled longitudinal strain ({varepsilon}zz) values along the anterior and posterior borders of the defect (~2200 {varepsilon}) were an order of magnitude larger than strain values on the proximal and distal borders (~50-100 {varepsilon}). These findings demonstrate that all phases of cortical defect healing are sensitive to physical stimulation. In addition, the proposed novel mechanobiological model offers several advantages including its technical simplicity and its well-characterized and spatially confined repair program, making effects of physical and biological interventions more easily assessed.",

    "abstract": "Reliable interpretation and quantification of cellular features in fluorescence microscopy requires an accurate estimate of microscope resolution. This is typically obtained by measuring the image of a non-biological proxy for a point-like object, such as a fluorescent bead. While appropriate for confocal microscopy, bead-based measurements are problematic for Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) and similar techniques where the resolution depends critically on the choice of fluorophore and acquisition parameters. We demonstrate that for a known geometry, e.g. tubules, the resolution can be accurately measured by fitting a model that accounts for both the Point Spread Function (PSF) and the fluorophore distribution. To address the problem of coupling between tubule diameter and PSF width, we developed a technique, Nested-loop Ensemble PSF (NEP) fitting. NEP fitting enables extraction of the size of cellular features and the PSF in fixed-cell and live-cell images without relying on beads or pre-calibration. We validate our technique using fixed microtubules and apply it to measure the diameter of endoplasmic reticulum tubules in live COS-7 cells. NEP fitting has been implemented as a plugin for the PYthon Microscopy Environment (PYME), a freely available and open source software.",

    "abstract": "Almost every cell in the human body extends a primary cilium. Defective cilia function leads to a set of disorders known as ciliopathies characterised by debilitating developmental defects affecting many tissues. Here we report a new role for regulator of calcineurin 2, RCAN2, in primary cilia function. It localises to centrioles and the basal body and is required to maintain normal cilia length. RCAN2 was identified as the most strongly upregulated gene from a comparative RNAseq analysis of cells in which expression of the Golgi matrix protein giantin had been abolished by gene editing. In contrast to previous work where we showed that depletion of giantin by RNAi results in defects in ciliogenesis and in cilia length control, giantin knockout cells generate normal cilia on serum withdrawal. Furthermore, giantin knockout zebrafish show increased expression of RCAN2. Importantly, suppression of RCAN2 expression in giantin knockout cells results in the same defects in cilia length control seen on RNAi of giantin itself. Together these data define RCAN2 as a regulator of cilia function that can compensate for loss of giantin function.",

    "abstract": "Fungi undergo changes in cell shape in response to environmental stimuli that drive pathogenesis and niche adaptation, such as the yeast-to-hyphal transition of dimorphic fungi in response to changing temperature. The basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans undergoes an unusual morphogenetic transition in the host lung from haploid yeast to large, highly polyploid cells termed Titan cells. Titan cells influence fungal interaction with host cells, including through increased drug resistance, altered cell size, and altered Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern exposure. Despite the important role these cells play in pathogenesis, understanding the environmental stimuli that drive the morphological transition, and the molecular mechanisms underlying their unique biology, has been hampered by the lack of a reproducible in vitro induction system. Here we demonstrate reproducible in vitro Titan cell induction in response to environmental stimuli consistent with the host lung. In vitro Titan cells exhibit all the properties of in vivo generated Titan cells, the current gold standard, including altered capsule, cell wall, size, high mother cell ploidy, and aneuploid progeny. We identify bacterial peptidoglycan as a serum compound associated with shift in cell size and ploidy, and demonstrate the capacity of bronchial lavage fluid and E. coli co-culture to induce Titanisation. Additionally, we demonstrate the capacity of our assay to identify established and previously undescribed regulators of Titanisation in vitro and investigate the Titanisation capacity of clinical isolates and their impact on disease outcome. Together, these findings provide new insight into the environmental stimuli and molecular mechanisms underlying the yeast-to-titan transition and establish an essential in vitro model for the future characterization of this important morphotype.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryChanges in cell shape underlie fungal pathogenesis by allowing immune evasion and dissemination. Aspergillus and Candida albicans hyphae drive tissue penetration. Histoplasma capsulatum and C. albicans yeast growth allows evasion and dissemination. As major virulence determinates, morphogenic transitions are extensively studied in animal models and in vitro. The pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is a budding yeast that, in the host lung, switches to an unusual morphotype termed the Titan cell. Titans are large, polyploid, have altered cell wall and capsule, and produce haploid daughters. Their size prevents engulfment by phagocytes, yet they are linked to dissemination and altered immune response. Despite their important influence on disease, replicating the yeast-to-Titan switch in vitro has proved challenging. Here we show that Titans are induced by host-relevant stimuli, including serum and bronchio-alveolar lavage fluid. We identify bacterial peptidoglycan as a relevant inducing compound and predict an in vivo Titan defect for a clinical isolate. Genes regulating in vivo Titanisation also influence in vitro formation. Titanisation is a conserved morphogenic switch across the C. neoformans species complex. Together, we show that Titan cells are a regulated morphotype analogous to the yeast-to-hyphal transition and establish new ways to study Titans outside the host lung.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcosis is amongst the most important invasive fungal infections globally, with cryptococcal meningitis causing an estimated 180,000 deaths each year in HIV infected patients alone. Patients with other forms of immunosuppression are also at risk, and disease is increasingly recognized in apparently immunocompetent individuals. Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii (serotype A, molecular type VNI) has a global distribution and is responsible for the majority of cases. Here, we used the consensus ISHAM Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) for C. neoformans to define the population structure of clinical isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii from Vietnam (n=136) and Laos (n=81). We placed these isolates into the global context using published MLST data from 8 other countries (total N = 669). We observed a phylo-geographical relationship in which Laos was similar to its Southeast Asian neighbor Thailand in being dominated (83%) by Sequence Type (ST) 4 and its Single Locus Variant ST6. On the other hand, Vietnam was uniquely intermediate between Southeast Asia and East Asia having both ST4/ST6 (35%) and ST5 (48%) which causes the majority of cases in East Asia. Analysis of genetic distance (Fst) between different populations of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii supported the intermediate nature of the population from Vietnam. A strong association between ST5 and infection in apparently immunocompetent, HIV-uninfected patients was observed in Vietnam (OR: 7.97, [95%CI: 3.18-19.97], p < 0.0001). Our study emphasizes that Vietnam, with its intermediate Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii population structure, provides the strongest epidemiological evidence of the relationship between ST5 and infection of HIV-uninfected patients. Human population genetic distances within the region suggest these differences in CNVG population across Southeast Asia are driven by ecological factors rather than host factors.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCryptococcus neoformans is a yeast that causes meningitis in people, usually with damaged immune systems. There are >180,000 deaths in HIV-infected patients each year, most occurring where there are the highest HIV/AIDS disease burdens. Vietnam and Laos have contributed significantly to clinical trials aiming to improve the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, but the relationship of isolates from these countries to the global population is not yet described. Here, we address this knowledge gap by using Multilocus Sequence Typing to study the population of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii (CNVG) in Laos and Vietnam, with the specific aim of incorporating these populations into the wider global context. We found that, in most countries, a single lineage (family) of strains was responsible for most disease. The Vietnamese CNVG population was unusual in that 2 main lineages circulated at the same time. The Vietnamese CNVG population occupies a middle ground between Thailand/Laos in the west and China in the east. The differences in population structure moving from West to East are probably due to ecological differences. Disease in HIV uninfected patients was almost always due to members of a single family of strains (ST5).",

The conserved Cdk9 kinase is essential for regulated eukaryotic transcription3, but its mechanistic role remains incompletely understood. Here, we use altered-specificity kinase mutations and highly-specific inhibitors in fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe to examine the role of Cdk9, and related Cdk7 and Cdk12 kinases, on transcription at base-pair resolution using Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq). Within a minute, Cdk9 inhibition causes a dramatic reduction in the phosphorylation of Pol II-associated factor, Spt5. The effects of Cdk9 inhibition on transcription are the more severe than inhibition of Cdk7 and Cdk12 and result in a shift of Pol II towards the transcription start site (TSS). A kinetic time course of Cdk9 inhibition reveals that early transcribing Pol II is the most compromised, with a measured rate of only ~400 bp/min, while Pol II that is already well into the gene continues rapidly to the end of genes with a rate > 1 kb/min. Our results indicate that while Pol II in S. pombe can escape promoter-proximal pausing in the absence of Cdk9 activity, it is impaired in elongation, suggesting the existence of a conserved global regulatory checkpoint that requires Cdk9 kinase activity.",

    "abstract": "The end of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription cycle is strictly regulated to ensure proper mRNA maturation and prevent interference between neighboring genes1. Pol II slowing downstream of the cleavage and polyadenylation signal (CPS) leads to recruitment of cleavage and polyadenylation factors and termination2, but how this chain of events is initiated remains unclear. In a chemical-genetic screen, we identified protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) isoforms as substrates of human positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), the cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9)-cyclin T1 complex3. Here we show that Cdk9 and PP1 govern phosphorylation of the conserved transcription factor Spt5 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Cdk9 phosphorylates both Spt5 and a negative regulatory site on the PP1 isoform Dis24. Sites phosphorylated by Cdk9 in the Spt5 carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) are dephosphorylated by Dis2 in vitro, and Cdk9 inhibition in vivo leads to rapid Spt5 dephosphorylation that is retarded by concurrent Dis2 inactivation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis indicates that Spt5 is dephosphorylated as transcription complexes traverse the CPS, prior to or concomitant with slowing of Pol II5. A Dis2-inactivating mutation stabilizes Spt5 phosphorylation (pSpt5) on chromatin, promotes transcription beyond the normal termination zone detected by precision run-on transcription and sequencing (PRO-seq)6, and is suppressed by ablation of Cdk9 target sites in Spt5. These results support a model whereby the transition of Pol II from elongation to termination is regulated by opposing activities of Cdk9 and Dis2 towards their common substrate Spt5--a bistable switch analogous to a Cdk1-PP1 module that controls mitotic progression4.",

    "abstract": "There are two fundamental reasons why sensory inputs to the brain change over time. Sensory inputs can change due to external factors or they can change due to our own behavior. Interpreting behavior-generated changes requires knowledge of how the body is moving, whereas interpreting externally-generated changes relies solely on the temporal sequence of input patterns. The sensory signals entering the neocortex change due to a mixture of both behavior and external factors. The neocortex must disentangle them but the mechanisms are unknown. In this paper, we show that a single neural mechanism can learn and recognize both types of sequences. In the model, cells are driven by feedforward sensory input and are modulated by contextual input. If the contextual input includes information derived from efference motor copies, the cells learn sensorimotor sequences. If the contextual input consists of nearby cellular activity, the cells learn temporal sequences. Through simulation we show that a network containing both types of contextual input automatically separates and learns both types of input patterns. We review experimental data that suggests the upper layers of cortical regions contain the anatomical structure required to support this mechanism.",

It is unclear if this clinical heterogeneity expresses a dimensional or categorical difference in ADHD.\\n\\nMethodsWe first studied differences in functional connectivity in multi-echo resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) acquired from 80 medication-naive adults with ADHD and 123 matched healthy controls. We then used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to identify latent relationships between symptoms and patterns of altered functional connectivity (dimensional biotype) in patients. Clustering methods were implemented to test if the individual associations between resting-state brain connectivity and symptoms reflected a non-overlapping categorical biotype.\\n\\nResultsAdults with ADHD showed stronger functional connectivity compared to healthy controls, predominantly between the default-mode, cingulo-opercular and subcortical networks. CCA identified a single mode of brain-symptom co-variation, corresponding to an ADHD dimensional biotype. This dimensional biotype is characterized by a unique combination of altered connectivity correlating with symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity, inattention, and intelligence. Clustering analyses did not support the existence of distinct categorical biotypes of adult ADHD.\\n\\nConclusionsOverall, our data advance a novel finding that the reduced functional segregation between default-mode and cognitive control networks supports a clinically important dimensional biotype of childhood-onset adult ADHD.

This connection, termed tripartite attachment complex (TAC), is essential for the segregation of the replicated mitochondrial genomes prior to cytokinesis. Here we identify a protein complex consisting of three integral mitochondrial outer membrane proteins - TAC60, TAC42 and TAC40 - which are essential subunits of the TAC. TAC60 contains separable mitochondrial import and TAC-sorting signals and its biogenesis depends on the main outer membrane protein translocase. TAC40 is a member of the mitochondrial porin family, whereas TAC42 represents a novel class of mitochondrial outer membrane {beta}-barrel proteins. Consequently TAC40 and TAC42 contain C-terminal {beta}-signals.

However, combining all these software into a single data analysis pipeline might be technically difficult.\\n\\nResultsHere we present two R packages, bigstatsr and bigsnpr, allowing for management and analysis of large scale genomic data to be performed within a single comprehensive framework. To address large data size, the packages use memory-mapping for accessing data matrices stored on disk instead of in RAM. To perform data pre-processing and data analysis, the packages integrate most of the tools that are commonly used, either through transparent system calls to existing software, or through updated or improved implementation of existing methods. In particular, the packages implement a fast derivation of Principal Component Analysis, functions to remove SNPs in Linkage Disequilibrium, and algorithms to learn Polygenic Risk Scores on millions of SNPs. We illustrate applications of the two R packages by analysing a case-control genomic dataset for the celiac disease, performing an association study and computing Polygenic Risk Scores.

Contamination is particularly critical in low microbial biomass body sites and environments, where it can comprise most of a sample if not all. Recentrifuge implements a robust method for the removal of negative-control and crossover taxa from the rest of samples. With Recentrifuge, researchers can analyze results from taxonomic classifiers using interactive charts with emphasis on the confidence level of the classifications. In addition to contamination-subtracted samples, Recentrifuge provides shared and exclusive taxa per sample, thus enabling robust contamination removal and comparative analysis in clinical and environmental metagenomics.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWhether in a clinical or environmental sample, metagenomics can reveal what microorganisms exist and what they do.

The scarcer the microbes are in an environment, the more essential it is to have solutions to these issues. Examples of sites with few microbes are not only habitats with low levels of nutrients, but also many body tissues and fluids. Recentrifuges novel approach combines statistical, mathematical and computational methods to tackle those challenges with efficiency and robustness: it seamlessly removes diverse contamination, provides a confidence level for every result, and unveils the generalities and specificities in the metagenomic samples.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic homeostasis is coordinately controlled by diverse inputs, which must be understood to combat metabolic disorders. Here we introduce DBL-1, the C. elegans BMP2/4 homolog, as a significant regulator of lipid homeostasis. We used neutral lipid staining and a lipid droplet marker to demonstrate that both increases and decreases in DBL-1/BMP signaling result in reduced lipid stores and lipid droplet count. We find that lipid droplet size, however, correlates positively with the level of DBL 1/BMP signaling. Regulation of lipid accumulation in the intestine occurs through non-cell-autonomous signaling, since expression of SMA-3, a Smad signal transducer, in the epidermis (hypodermis) is sufficient to rescue the loss of lipid accumulation. Finally, genetic evidence indicates that DBL-1/BMP functions upstream of Insulin/IGF-1 Signaling (IIS) in lipid metabolism. We conclude that BMP signaling regulates lipid metabolism in C. elegans through inter-organ signaling to IIS, shedding light on a less well-studied regulatory mechanism for metabolic homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "A widely accepted two-wave scenario of human settlement of Oceania involves the first out-of-Africa migration ca 50,000 ya, and one of the most geographically-widespread dispersals of people, known as the Austronesian expansion, which reached the Bismarck Archipelago by about 3,450 ya. While earlier genetic studies provided evidence for extensive sex-biased admixture between the incoming and the indigenous populations, some archaeological, linguistic and genetic evidence indicates a more complicated picture of settlement. To study regional variation in Oceania in more detail, we have compiled a genome-wide dataset of 823 individuals from 72 populations (including 50 populations from Oceania) and over 620,000 autosomal SNPs. We show that the initial dispersal of people from the Bismarck Archipelago into Remote Oceania occurred in a \\\"leapfrog\\\" fashion, completely by-passing the main chain of the Solomon Islands, and that the colonization of the Solomon Islands proceeded in a bi-directional manner. Our results also support a divergence between western and eastern Solomons, in agreement with the sharp linguistic divide known as the Tryon-Hackman line. We also report substantial post-Austronesian gene flow across the Solomons. In particular, Santa Cruz (in Remote Oceania) exhibits extraordinarily high levels of Papuan ancestry that cannot be explained by a simple bottleneck/founder event scenario. Finally, we use simulations to show that discrepancies between different methods for dating admixture likely reflect different sensitivities of the methods to multiple admixture events from the same (or similar) sources. Overall, this study points to the importance of fine-scale sampling to understand the complexities of human population history.",

    "abstract": "Changes in pathogen genetic variation within hosts alter the severity and spread of infectious diseases, with important implications for clinical disease and public health. Genetic drift may play a strong role in shaping pathogen variation, but analyses of drift in pathogens have oversimplified pathogen population dynamics, either by considering dynamics only at a single scale (within hosts, between hosts), or by making drastic simplifying assumptions (host immune systems can be ignored, transmission bottlenecks are complete). Moreover, previous studies used genetic data to infer the strength of genetic drift, whereas we test whether the genetic drift imposed by pathogen population processes can be used to explain genetic data. We first constructed and parameterized a mathematical model of gypsy moth baculovirus dynamics that allows genetic drift to act within and between hosts. We then quantified the genome-wide diversity of baculovirus populations within each of 143 field-collected gypsy moth larvae using Illumina sequencing. Finally, we determined whether the genetic drift imposed by host-pathogen population dynamics in our model explains the levels of pathogen diversity in our data. We found that when the model allows drift to act at multiple scales, including within hosts, between hosts, and between years, it can accurately reproduce the data, but when the effects of drift are simplified by neglecting transmission bottlenecks and stochastic variation in virus replication within hosts, the model fails. A de novo mutation model and a purifying selection model similarly fail to explain the data. Our results show that genetic drift can play a strong role in determining pathogen variation, and that mathematical models that account for pathogen population growth at multiple scales of biological organization can be used to explain this variation.",

Here, we identified 137 protein sites that experienced deceleration in their rate of evolution along the HIV-1/SIV phylogeny, likely indicating gain-of-function and consequent adaptation. The majority of such events occurred in parallel to cross-species transmission events and varied between HIV-1 groups, indicating independent adaptation strategies. The evolutionary rate decelerations we found were particularly prominent in accessory proteins that counteract host antiviral restriction factors, suggesting that these factors are a major barrier to viral adaptation to a new host. Surprisingly, we observed that the non-pandemic HIV-1 group O, derived from gorillas, exhibited more rate deceleration events than the pandemic group M, derived from chimpanzees. We suggest that the species barrier is higher when the genetic distance of the hosts increases. Our approach paves the way for subsequent studies on cross-species transfers in other major pathogens.",

We integrated human brain-specific DNase I footprinting and TF-gene co-expression to reconstruct a transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) model for the human brain, predicting the brain-specific binding sites and target genes for 741 TFs. We used this model to predict core TFs involved in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Our results suggest that disease-related transcriptomic and genetic changes converge on small sets of disease-specific regulators, with distinct networks underlying neurodegenerative vs. psychiatric diseases. Core TFs were frequently implicated in a disease through multiple mechanisms, including differential expression of their target genes, disruption of their binding sites by disease-associated SNPs, and associations of the genetic loci encoding these TFs with disease risk. We validated our models predictions through systematic comparison to publicly available ChIP-seq and TF perturbation studies and through experimental studies in primary human neural stem cells. Combined genetic and transcriptional evidence supports roles for neuronal and microglia-enriched, MEF2C-regulated networks in Alzheimers disease; an oligodendrocyte-enriched, SREBF1-regulated network in schizophrenia; and a neural stem cell and astrocyte-enriched, POU3F2-regulated network in bipolar disorder.

We found enrichment of GWAS signals for T2D and fasting glucose was concentrated in subsets of islet enhancers characterised by open chromatin and hypomethylation, with the former annotation predominant. At several loci (including CDC123, ADCY5, KLHDC5) the combination of fine-mapping genetic data and chromatin state enrichment maps, supplemented by allelic imbalance in chromatin accessibility pinpointed likely causal variants.

We observed highly activated human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the tumor, as well as minor subsets of innate immune cells in both settings.

Indeed, administration of a neutralizing mAb to human ICOS reduced Treg proportions and numbers and improved CD4+ T cell proliferation in humanized mice. Moreover, a combination of the anti-ICOS mAb with cyclophosphamide reduced tumor growth, and that was associated with an improved CD8 to Treg ratio. However, depletion of human CD8+ T cells only marginally affected tumor control whereas depletion of murine myeloid cells abrogated the effect of the combination therapy.

    "abstract": "Low copy-number plasmid pLS32 of Bacillus subtilis subsp. natto contains a partitioning system that ensures segregation of plasmid copies during cell division. The partitioning locus comprises actin-like protein AlfA, adaptor protein AlfB and the centromeric sequence parN. Similar to the ParMRC partitioning system from E. coli plasmid R1, AlfA filaments form actin-like double helical filaments that arrange into an antiparallel bipolar spindle, which attaches its growing ends to sister plasmids, through interactions with AlfB and parN. Since, compared with ParM and other actin-like proteins, AlfA is highly diverged in sequence, we determined the atomic structure of non-bundling AlfA filaments to 3.4 [A] resolution by cryo-EM. The structure reveals how the deletion of subdomain IIB of the canonical actin-fold has been accommodated by unique longitudinal and lateral contacts, whilst still enabling formation of left-handed, double helical, polar and staggered filaments that are architecturally similar to ParM. Through cryo-EM reconstruction of bundling AlfA filaments we obtained a pseudo-atomic model of AlfA doublets: the assembly of two filaments. The filaments are antiparallel, as required by the segregation mechanism, and exactly anti-phasic with 8-fold integer helical symmetry, to enable efficient doublet formation. The structure of AlfA filaments and doublets shows, in atomic detail, signs of the strong evolutionary pressure for simplicity, placed on plasmids: deletion of an entire domain of the actin fold is compensated by changes to all interfaces so that the required properties of polymerisation, nucleotide hydrolysis and antiparallel doublet formation are retained to fulfil the system's biological raison d'etre.\\n\\nSignificance StatementProtein filaments perform a vast array of functions inside almost all living cells. Actin-like proteins in archaea and bacteria have previously been found to form a surprising diversity of filament architectures, reflecting their divergent cellular roles. Actin-like AlfA is unique in that it is much smaller than all other filament forming actin-like proteins. With an atomic structure of the AlfA filament, obtained by high-resolution electron cryo-microscopy, we have revealed--at atomic level of detail--how AlfA filaments form dynamic filaments capable of transporting plasmid DNA in cells and how these filaments arrange into antiparallel bundles required for the segregation mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Coenocytes (multinucleated cells formed by sequential nuclear divisions without cytokinesis) are commonly found across the eukaryotic kingdom, including in animals, plants and several lineages of unicellular eukaryotes. Despite their commonality, little is known about how cell growth, nuclear divisions and cell divisions are coordinated in coenocytes. Among the unicellular eukaryotes that form coenocytes are ichthyosporeans, a lineage of unicellular holozoans that are of significant interest due to their phylogenetic placement as one of the closest relatives to animals. Here, we characterize the coenocytic cell division cycle in the ichthyosporean Sphaeroforma arctica. In laboratory conditions, we observed that S. arctica cells undergo a highly regular periodic coenocytic cell cycle. Nuclear division cycles occur synchronously within the coenocyte and in regular time intervals (~11 hours per nuclear cycle) until reaching 64-128 nuclei and releasing daughter cells. The duration of the nuclear division cycles is constant across a wide range of nutrient concentration. In contrast, the volume of the coenocytes increase more slowly in lower nutrient concentration, which also results in smaller newborn daughter cells. This suggests that S. arctica cells are capable to adapt the cell growth rate to nutrient concentration while maintaining the timing of nuclear division cycles, suggesting that in ichthyosporeans the mechanisms regulating highly periodic nuclear division cycles operate independently from mechanisms sensing the cell size.",

Here we used light sheet fluorescence microscopy to follow microglia-synapse interactions in developing organotypic hippocampal cultures, complemented by three-dimensional ultrastructural characterization using correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). Our findings define a set of dynamic microglia-synapse interactions, including the selective partial phagocytosis, or trogocytosis (trogo-: nibble), of presynaptic structures and the induction of postsynaptic spine head filopodia by microglia.

Because codon choice is key to gene expression and therefore cellular outcomes, it has been argued that gene synthesis will allow researchers to source genes from organisms that would otherwise have been incompatible, opening up more-distant parts of the tree of life as sources for transgenes. We test if this hypothesis is true for academic biological research using a 10-year data set from Addgene, the non-profit plasmid repository. We observe ~19,000 unique genes deposited to Addgene and classify them by whether they are natural or synthetic using a nucleotide-only technique that we develop here. We find that synthetic genes are an increasing share of Addgene deposits. Most importantly, we find direct evidence that researchers are using gene synthesis to source genes from more genetically-distant organisms, particularly for genes that are longer and thus might otherwise be particularly challenging to express. Thus, we provide the first empirical evidence that gene synthesis is leading biologists and bioengineers to sample more broadly across the rich genetic diversity of life, increasingly making that functionality available for industrial or biomedical advances.",

    "abstract": "Studies of mating and reproductive behavior have contributed much to our understanding of various animals ecological success. The desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, is an important agricultural pest. However, knowledge of locust courtship and precopulatory behavior is surprisingly limited. Here we provide a comprehensive study of the precopulatory behavior of both sexes of the desert locust in the gregarious phase, with particular emphasis on the conflict between the sexes. Detailed HD-video monitoring of courtship and mating of 20 locust pairs, in a controlled environment, enabled both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the behavior. A comprehensive list of behavioral elements was used to generate an eight-step ethogram, depicting from first encounter between the sexes to actual copulation. Further analyses included the probability of each element occurring, and a kinematic diagram based on a transitional matrix. Eleven novel behavioral elements are described in this study, and two potential points of conflict between the sexes are identified. Locust sexual interaction was characterized by the dominance of the males during the pre-mounting stage, and an overall stereotypic male courtship behavior. In contrast, females displayed no clear courtship-related behavior and an overall less organized behavioral sequence. Central elements in the sexual behavior of the females were low-amplitude hind-leg vibration, as well as rejecting males by jumping and kicking. Intricate reciprocal interactions between the sexes were evident mostly at the mounting stage. The reported findings contribute important insights to our knowledge of locust mating and reproductive behavior, and may assist in confronting this devastating agricultural pest.",

    "abstract": "Transposable Elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences that make up significant fractions of amniote genomes. However, they are difficult to detect and annotate ab initio because of their variable features, lengths and clade-specific variants. We have addressed this problem by refining and developing a Comprehensive ab initio Repeat Pipeline (CARP) to identify and cluster TEs and other repetitive sequences in genome assemblies. The pipeline begins with a pairwise alignment using krishna, a custom aligner. Single linkage clustering is then carried out to produce families of repetitive elements. Consensus sequences are then filtered for protein coding genes and then annotated using Repbase and a custom library of retrovirus and reverse transcriptase sequences. This process yields three types of family: fully annotated, partially annotated and unannotated. Fully annotated families reflect recently diverged/young known TEs present in Repbase. The remaining two types of families contain a mixture of novel TEs and segmental duplications. These can be resolved by aligning these consensus sequences back to the genome to assess copy number vs. length distribution. Our pipeline has three significant advantages compared to other methods for ab initio repeat identification: 1) we generate not only consensus sequences, but keep the genomic intervals for the original aligned sequences, allowing straightforward analysis of evolutionary dynamics, 2) consensus sequences represent low-divergence, recently/currently active TE families, 3) segmental duplications are annotated as a useful by-product. We have compared our ab initio repeat annotations for 7 genome assemblies (1 unpublished) to other methods and demonstrate that CARP compares favourably with RepeatModeler, the most widely used repeat annotation package.\\n\\nAuthor summaryTransposable elements (TEs) are interspersed repetitive DNA sequences, also known as  jumping genes, because of their ability to replicate in to new genomic locations. TEs account for a significant proportion of all eukaryotic genomes. Previous studies have found that TE insertions have contributed to new genes, coding sequences and regulatory regions. They also play an important role in genome evolution. Therefore, we developed a novel, ab initio approach for identifying and annotating repetitive elements. The idea is simple: define a \\\"repeat\\\" as any sequence that occurs at least twice in the genome. Our ab initio method is able to identify species-specific TEs with high sensitivity and accuracy including both TEs and segmental duplications. Because of the high degree of sequence identity used in our method, the TEs we find are less diverged and may still be active. We also retain all the information that links identified repeat consensus sequences to their genome intervals, permiting direct evolutionary analysis of the TE families we identify.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesHematological abnormalities that include changes in bone marrow, such as in anemia and pancytopenia, are common among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, particularly in the advanced stage of disease. This study aimed to provide better experimental evidence of such manifestations in animal models.\\n\\nDesignNOD/SCID/JAK3null (NOJ) mice were transplanted with human cord-derived CD34+ cells with or without transduction with a lentiviral vector expressing a promoter-targeting shRNA called PromA.\\n\\nMethodsAt 16 weeks after transplantation, mice engrafted with CD34+ cells were infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1JRFL.\\n\\nResultsAt week 2 post infection, HIV replication was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and splenocytes. In mice transplanted with unmanipulated CD34+ cells, viral replication was accompanied by a loss of peripheral/spleen CD4+CCR5+ T cells. Interestingly, bone marrow CD34+ cells in HIV-infected mice were also depleted, but in a CXCR4-associated manner. Conversely, the lentiviral transfer of PromA in CD34+ cells prior to transplantation rendered the humanized NOJ mice resistant to HIV replication in CD4+ T cells, resulting in better preservation of peripheral/spleen CD4+CCR5+ T cells and bone marrow CD34+ cells at two weeks after infection.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results implicate the importance of evaluating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell pools in addition to peripheral CD4+ T-cell counts to assess the early stage of HIV infection. Moreover, stable gene transfer of PromA to hematopoietic stem cells not only limited HIV replication but also led to preservation of different subsets of hematopoietic cells, including bone marrow stem/progenitor cells.",

    "abstract": "Urine is a promising biomarker source for clinical proteomics studies. Although regional physiological differences are common in multi-center clinical studies, the presence of significant differences in the urinary proteomes of individuals from different regions remains unknown. In this study, morning urine samples were collected from healthy urban residents in three regions of China and urinary proteins were preserved using a membrane-based method (Urimem). The urine proteomes of 27 normal samples were analyzed using LC-MS/MS and compared among the three regions. We identified 1,898 proteins from Urimem samples using label-free proteome quantification, of which 62 urine proteins were differentially expressed among the three regions. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that inter-regional differences caused less significant changes in the urine proteome than inter-sex differences. Of the 62 differentially expressed proteins, 10 have been reported to be disease biomarkers in previous clinical studies. Urimem facilitates urinary protein storage for large-scale urine sample collection, and thus accelerates biobank development and urine biomarker studies employing proteomics approaches. Regional differences are a confounding factor influencing the urine proteome and should be considered in future multi-center biomarker studies.",

Here, we employed transient and stable gene silencing-and over-expression systems in Hordeum vulgare (barley) to study the function of HvARM1 (for H. vulgare Armadillo 1), a partial gene duplicate of the U-box/armadillo-repeat E3 ligase HvPUB15 (for H. vulgare Plant U-Box 15). The partial ARM1 gene was derived from an ancient gene-duplication event in a common ancestor of the Triticeae tribe of grasses comprising the major crop species H. vulgare, Triticum aestivum and Secale cereale. The barley gene HvARM1 contributed to quantitative host as well as nonhost resistance to the biotrophic powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis, and allelic variants were found to be associated with powdery mildew-disease severity. Both HvPUB15 and HvARM1 proteins interacted in yeast and plant cells with the susceptibility-related, plastid-localized barley homologs of THF1 (for Thylakoid formation 1) and of ClpS1 (for Clp-protease adaptor S1) of Arabidopsis thaliana. The results suggest a neo-functionalization HvARM1 to increase resistance against powdery mildew and provide a link to plastid function in susceptibility to biotrophic pathogen attack.",

    "abstract": "Multiple studies have suggested the critical roles of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) as well as a transcription factor (TF) network in generating the robust cell-cycle transcriptional program. However, the precise mechanisms by which these components function together in the gene regulatory network remain unclear. Here we show that the TF network can generate and transmit a \\\"pulse\\\" of transcription independently of CDK oscillations. The premature firing of the transcriptional pulse is prevented by early G1 inhibitors, including transcriptional corepressors and the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex APCCdh1. We demonstrate that G1 cyclin-CDKs facilitate the activation and accumulation of TF proteins in S/G2/M phases through inhibiting G1 transcriptional corepressors (Whi5 and Stb1) and APCCdh1, thereby promoting the initiation and propagation of the pulse by the TF network. These findings suggest a unique oscillatory mechanism in which global phase-specific transcription emerges from a pulse-generating network that fires once-and-only-once at the start of the cycle.",

    "abstract": "The environment can moderate the effect of genes - a phenomenon called gene-environment (GxE) interaction. There are two broad types of GxE modeled in human behavior - qualitative GxE, where the effects of individual genetic variants differ depending on some environmental moderator, and quantitative GxE, where the additive genetic variance changes as a function of an environmental moderator. Tests of both qualitative and quantitative GxE have traditionally relied on comparing the covariances between twins and close relatives, but recently there has been interest in testing such models on unrelated individuals measured on genomewide data. However, to date, there has been no ability to test quantitative GxE effects in unrelated individuals using genomewide data because standard software cannot solve nonlinear constraints. Here, we introduce a maximum likelihood approach with parallel constrained optimization to fit such models. We use simulation to estimate the accuracy, power, and type I error rates of our method and to gauge its computational performance, and then apply this method to IQ data measured on 40,172 individuals with whole-genome SNP data from the UK Biobank. We found that the additive genetic variation of IQ tagged by SNPs increases as socioeconomic status (SES) decreases, opposite the direction found by several twin studies conducted in the U.S. on adolescents, but consistent with several studies from Europe and Australia on adults.",

    "abstract": "We describe a simple optical method that creates structured illumination of a photoactivatable probe and apply this method to characterize chromatin motions in the nuclei of live cells. A laser beam coupled to a diffractive optical element at the back focal plane of an excitation objective generates an array of near diffraction-limited beamlets with FWHM of 340{+/-}30 nm, which simultaneously photoactivate a 7x7 matrix pattern of GFP-labeled histones, with spots 1.70 m apart. From the movements of the photoactivated spots, we map chromatin diffusion coefficients at multiple microdomains of the cell nucleus. The results show correlated motions of nearest chromatin microdomain neighbors, whereas chromatin movements are uncorrelated at the global scale of the nucleus. The method also reveals DNA damage-dependent decrease in chromatin diffusion. The DOE instrumentation can easily and cheaply be implemented on commercial inverted fluorescence microscopes to analyze adherent cell culture models. A protocol to measure chromatin motions in non-adherent human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells is also described. We anticipate that the method will contribute to the identification of the mechanisms regulating chromatin mobility, which influences most genomic processes and may underlie the biogenesis of genomic translocations associated with hematologic malignancies.",

Traditionally, the robustness of ecological networks has been evaluated based on simulation studies where primary extinctions occur at random or as a function of species specialization, ignoring other important biological factors. Here, we estimate the robustness of a seed dispersal network from a grassland-forest mosaic in southern Brazil, simulating distinct scenarios of woody plant species extinction, including scenarios where species are eliminated based on their evolutionary and functional distinctiveness. Our results suggest that the network is more robust when species are eliminated based on their evolutionary uniqueness, followed by random extinctions, the extinction of the most specialist species, functional distinctiveness and, at last, when the most generalist species are sequentially eliminated. Our results provide important information for grassland-forest mosaic management, as they indicate that loss of generalist species and functional diversity makes the system more likely to collapse.",

    "abstract": "The fact that relatively simple entities, such as particles or neurons, or even ants or bees or humans, give rise to fascinatingly complex behavior when interacting in large numbers is the hallmark of complex systems science. Agent-based models are frequently employed for modeling and obtaining a predictive understanding of complex systems. Since the sheer number of equations that describe the behavior of an entire agent-based model often makes it impossible to solve such models exactly, Monte Carlo simulation methods must be used for the analysis. However, unlike pairwise interactions among particles that typically govern solid-state physics systems, interactions among agents that describe systems in biology, sociology or the humanities often involve group interactions, and they also involve a larger number of possible states even for the most simplified description of reality. This begets the question: When can we be certain that an observed simulation outcome of an agent-based model is actually stable and valid in the large system-size limit? The latter is key for the correct determination of phase transitions between different stable solutions, and for the understanding of the underlying microscopic processes that led to these phase transitions. We show that a satisfactory answer can only be obtained by means of a complete stability analysis of subsystem solutions. A subsystem solution can be formed by any subset of all possible agent states. The winner between two subsystem solutions can be determined by the average moving direction of the invasion front that separates them, yet it is crucial that the competing subsystem solutions are characterized by a proper composition and spatiotemporal structure before the competition starts. We use the spatial public goods game with diverse tolerance as an example, but the approach has relevance for a wide variety of agent-based models.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in automated plant phenotyping have enabled the collection time series measurements from the same plants of a wide range of traits over different developmental time scales. The availability of time series phenotypic datasets has increased interest in statistical approaches for comparing patterns of change between different plant genotypes and different treatment conditions. Two widely used methods of modeling growth over time are point-wise analysis of variance (ANOVA) and parametric sigmoidal curve fitting. Point-wise ANOVA yields discontinuous growth curves, which do not reflect the true dynamics of growth patterns in plants. In contrast, fitting a parametric model to a time series of observations does capture the trend of growth, however these models require assumptions regarding the true pattern of plant growth. Depending on the species, treatment regime, and subset of the plant lifecycle sampled this assumptions will not always hold true. Here we introduce a different approach - functional ANOVA - which yields continuous growth curves without requiring assumptions regarding patterns of plant growth. We compare and validate this approach using data from an experiment measuring growth of two maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) genotypes under two water availability treatments over a 21-day period. Functional ANOVA enables a nonparametric estimation of the dynamics of changes in plant traits over time without assumptions regarding curve shape. In addition to estimating smooth curves of trait values over time, functional ANOVA also estimates the the derivatives of these curves - e.g. growth rates - simultaneously. Using two different subsampling strategies, we demonstrate that this functional ANOVA method enables the comparison of growth curves between plants phenotyped on non-overlapping days with little reduction in estimation accuracy. This means functional ANOVA based approaches can allow larger numbers of samples and biological replicates to be scored in a single experiment given fixed amounts of phenotyping infrastructure and personnel.",
