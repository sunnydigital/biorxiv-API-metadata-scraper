    "abstract": "Variational Bayes (VB), variational maximum likelihood (VML), restricted maximum likelihood (ReML), and maximum likelihood (ML) are cornerstone parametric statistical estimation techniques in the analysis of functional neuroimaging data. However, the theoretical underpinnings of these model parameter estimation techniques are rarely covered in introductory statistical texts. Because of the widespread practical use of VB, VML, ReML, and ML in the neuroimaging community, we reasoned that. a theoretical treatment of their relationships and their application in a basic modelling scenario may be helpful for both neuroimaging novices and practitioners alike. In this technical study, we thus revisit the conceptual and formal underpinnings of VB, VML, ReML, and ML and provide a detailed account of their mathematical relationships and implementational details. We further apply VB, VML, ReML, and ML to the general linear model (GLM) with non-spherical error covariance as commonly encountered in the first-level analysis of fMRI data. To this end, we explicitly derive the corresponding free energy objective functions and ensuing iterative algorithms. Finally, in the applied part of our study, we evaluate the parameter and model recovery properties of VB, VML, ReML, and ML, first in an exemplary setting and then in the analysis of experimental fMRI data acquired from a single participant under visual stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Models of disease transmission in a population with changing densities must assume a relation between infectious contacts and density. Typically, a choice is made between a constant (frequency-dependence) and a linear (density-dependence) contact-density function, but it is becoming increasingly clear that intermediate, nonlinear functions intermediate are more realistic. It is currently not clear however what the exact consequences would be of different contact-density functions in fluctuating populations. By combining field data on rodent host (Mastomys natalensis) demography, experimentally-derived contact-density data, and laboratory and field data Morogoro virus infection dynamics, we explored the effects of different contact-density function shapes on transmission dynamics and invasion/persistence. While invasion and persistence were clearly affected by the shape of the function, the effects on outbreak characteristics such as infection prevalence and seroprevalence were less obvious. This means that it may be difficult to distinguish between the different shapes based on how well models fit to real data. The shape of the transmission-density function should therefore be chosen with care, and is ideally based on existing information such as a previously quantified contact- or transmission-density relationship or the underlying biology of the host species in relation to the infectious agent.",

    "abstract": "Accurate annotations of genes and their transcripts is a foundation of genomics, but no annotation technique presently combines throughput and accuracy. As a result, reference gene collections remain incomplete: many gene models are fragmentary, while thousands more remain uncatalogued-particularly for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). To accelerate lncRNA annotation, the GENCODE consortium has developed RNA Capture Long Seq (CLS), combining targeted RNA capture with third-generation long-read sequencing. We present an experimental re-annotation of the GENCODE intergenic lncRNA population in matched human and mouse tissues, resulting in novel transcript models for 3574 / 561 gene loci, respectively. CLS approximately doubles the annotated complexity of targeted loci, outperforming existing short-read techniques. Full-length transcript models produced by CLS enable us to definitively characterize the genomic features of lncRNAs, including promoter- and gene-structure, and protein-coding potential. Thus CLS removes a longstanding bottleneck of transcriptome annotation, generating manual-quality full-length transcript models at high-throughput scales.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

We present a theory based upon the crystal structure of UCNPs to estimate the molecular weight of UCNPs: enabling insight into UCNP molecular weight for the first time. We estimate the theoretical molecular weight of various UCNPs reported in the literature, predicting that spherical NaYF4 UCNPs {small tilde} 10 nm in diameter will be {small tilde}1 MDa (i.e. 106 g/mol), whereas UCNPs {small tilde} 45 nm in diameter will be {small tilde}100 MDa (i.e. 108 g/mol). We also predict that hexagonal crystal phase UCNPs will be of greater molecular weight than cubic crystal phase UCNPs. Additionally we find that a Gaussian UCNP diameter distribution will correspond to a lognormal UCNP molecular weight distribution. Our approach could potentially be generalised to predict the molecular weight of other arbitrary crystalline nanoparticles: as such, we provide standalone graphic user interfaces to calculate the molecular weight both UCNPs and arbitrary crystalline nanoparticles. We expect knowledge of UCNP molecular weight to be of wide utility in biomedical applications where reporting UCNP quantity in absolute numbers or molarity will be beneficial for inter-study comparison and repeatability.",

    "abstract": "To optimize processing, the human visual system utilizes regularities present in naturalistic visual input. One of these regularities is the relative position of objects in a scene (e.g., a sofa in front of a television), with behavioral research showing that regularly positioned objects are easier to perceive and to remember. Here we use fMRI to test how positional regularities are encoded in the visual system. Participants viewed pairs of objects that formed minimalistic two-object scenes (e.g., a \\\"living room\\\" consisting of a sofa and television) presented in their regularly experienced spatial arrangement or in an irregular arrangement (with interchanged positions). Additionally, single objects were presented centrally and in isolation. Multi-voxel activity patterns evoked by the object pairs were modeled as the average of the response patterns evoked by the two single objects forming the pair. In two experiments, this approximation in object-selective cortex was significantly less accurate for the regularly than the irregularly positioned pairs, indicating integration of individual object representations. More detailed analysis revealed a transition from independent to integrative coding along the posterior-anterior axis of the visual cortex, with the independent component (but not the integrative component) being almost perfectly predicted by object selectivity across the visual hierarchy. These results reveal a transitional stage between individual object and multi-object coding in visual cortex, providing a possible neural correlate of efficient processing of regularly positioned objects in natural scenes.",

The species is generally thought to be of Mexican origin and to have incidentally followed the expansion of maize cultivation into North America thousands of years ago. However, this hypothesis has never been investigated formally. In this study, the genetic variability of samples collected throughout North America was analysed at 13 microsatellite marker loci to explore precisely the population genetic structure and colonization history of D. v. virgifera. In particular, we used up-to-date Approximate Bayesian Computation methods based on random forest algorithms to test a Mexican versus a central-USA origin of the species, and to compare various possible timings of colonization. This analysis provided strong evidence that the origin of D. v. virgifera was southern (Mexico, or even further south). Surprisingly, we also found that the expansion of the species north of its origin was recent - probably not before 1100 years ago - thus indicating it was not directly associated with the early history of maize expansion out of Mexico, a far more ancient event.",

Point mutations in the BICD2 gene have been identified in patients with a dominant form of spinal muscular atrophy, but how these mutations cause disease is unknown. To investigate this question, we have developed in vitro motility assays with purified DDB and BICD2s membrane vesicle partner, the GTPase Rab6a. Rab6a-GTP, either in solution or bound to artificial liposomes, released BICD2 from an autoinhibited state and promoted robust dynein-dynactin transport. In these assays, BICD2 mutants showed an enhanced ability to form motile DDB complexes. Increased retrograde transport by BICD2 mutants also was observed in cells using an inducible organelle transport assay. When overexpressed in rat hippocampal neurons, the hyperactive BICD2 mutants decreased neurite growth. Our results reveal that dominant mutations in BICD2 hyperactivate DDB motility and suggest that an imbalance of minus- versus plus-end-directed microtubule motility in neurons may underlie spinal muscular atrophy.",

    "abstract": "The detection of ancient gene flow between human populations is an important issue in population genetics. A common tool for detecting ancient admixture events is the D-statistic. The D-statistic is based on the hypothesis of a genetic relationship that involves four populations, whose correctness is assessed by evaluating specific coincidences of alleles between the groups.\\n\\nWhen working with high throughput sequencing data calling genotypes accurately is not always possible, therefore the D-statistic currently samples a single base from the reads of one individual per population. This implies ignoring much of the information in the data, an issue especially striking in the case of ancient genomes.\\n\\nWe provide a significant improvement to overcome the problems of the D-statistic by considering all reads from multiple individuals in each population. We also apply type-specific error correction to combat the problems of sequencing errors and show a way to correct for introgression from an external population that is not part of the supposed genetic relationship, and how this leads to an estimate of the admixture rate.\\n\\nWe prove that the D-statistic is approximated by a standard normal. Furthermore we show that our method outperforms the traditional D-statistic in detecting admixtures. The power gain is most pronounced for low/medium sequencing depth (1-10X) and performances are as good as with perfectly called genotypes at a sequencing depth of 2X. We show the reliability of error correction on scenarios with simulated errors and ancient data, and correct for introgression in known scenarios to estimate the admixture rates.",

    "abstract": "One cause of cancer mortality is tumor evolution to therapy-resistant disease. First line therapy often targets the dominant clone, and drug resistance can emerges from preexisting clones that gain fitness through therapy-induced natural selection. Such mutations may be identified using targeted sequencing assays by analysis of noise in high-depth data. Here, we develop a comprehensive, unbiased model for sequencing error background. We find that noise in sufficiently deep DNA sequencing data can be approximated by aggregating negative binomial distributions. Mutations with frequencies above noise may have prognostic value. We evaluate our model with simulated exponentially expanded populations as well as data from cell line and patient sample dilution experiments, demonstrating its utility in prognosticating tumor progression. Our results may have the potential to identify significant mutations that can cause recurrence. These results are relevant in the pretreatment clinical setting to determine appropriate therapy and prepare for potential recurrence pretreatment.",

Compared to other tools, TRaIT supports multi-region and single-cell sequencing data within the same statistical framework, and delivers expressive models that capture many complex evolutionary phenomena. TRaIT improves accuracy, robustness to data-specific errors and computational complexity compared to competing methods.\n\nConclusionsWe show that the application of TRaIT to single-cell and multi-region cancer datasets can produce accurate and reliable models of single-tumour evolution, quantify the extent of intra-tumour heterogeneity and generate new testable experimental hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "In recent work, we discovered that the presence of highly substoichiometric amounts (10-8 molar ratio) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria caused fibrinogen clotting to lead to the formation of an amyloid form of fibrin. We here show that the broadly equivalent lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from two species of Gram-positive bacteria have similarly (if not more) potent effects. Using thioflavin T fluorescence to detect amyloid as before, the addition of low concentrations of free ferric ion is found to have similar effects. Luminescent conjugated oligothiophene dyes (LCOs), marketed under the trade name AmytrackerTM, also stain classical amyloid structures. We here show that they too give very large fluorescence enhancements when clotting is initiated in the presence of the four amyloidogens (LPS, ferric ions and two LTA types). The staining patterns differ significantly as a function of both the amyloidogens and the dyes used to assess them, indicating clearly that the nature of the clots formed is different. This is also the case when clotting is measured viscometrically using thromboelastography. Overall, the data provide further evidence for an important role of bacterial cell wall products in the various coagulopathies that are observable in chronic, inflammatory diseases. The assays may have potential in both diagnostics and therapeutics.",

Preplay sequences have been hypothesized to participate in hippocampal learning and memory, but such functional roles and their potential cellular mechanisms remain unexplored. Here, we report a computational model based on the functional propagation of preplay sequences in the CA3 neuronal network. The model instantiates two synaptic pathways in CA3 neurons, one for proximal dendrite-somatic interactions to generate intrinsic preplay sequences and the other for distal dendritic processing of extrinsic sensory signals. The core dendritic computation is the maximization of matching between patterned activities in the two compartments through nonlinear spike generation. The model performs robust one-shot learning with long-term stability and independence that are modulated by the plasticity of dendrite-targeted inhibition. This model demonstrates that learning models combined with dendritic computations can enable preplay sequences to act as templates for rapid and stable memory formation.",

Certain fungi secrete acids as part of their lifestyle and interestingly these also have many eqolisin paralogs, up to nine paralogs have been recorded. This suggests functional redundancy and diversification, which was the subject of the research we performed and describe here.\\n\\nResultsWe identified eqolisin homologs by means of iterative HMMER analysis of the NR database. The identified sequences were scrutinized for which we defined novel hallmarks, identified by molecular dynamics simulations of mutants of highly conserved positions, using the structure of an eqolisin that was crystallized in the presence of a transition state inhibitor. Four conserved glycines were shown to be required for functionality. A substitution of W67F is shown to be accompanied by the L105W substitution. Molecular dynamics shows that the W67 binds to the substrate via a {pi}-{pi} stacking and a salt bridge, the latter being stronger in a virtual W67F/L105W double mutant of the resolved structure of Scytalido-carboxyl peptidase-B (PDB ID: 2IFW)). Additional likely fatal mutants are discussed.\\n\\nUpon sequence scrutiny we obtained a set of 233 sequences that in all likelihood lack false positives. This was used to reconstruct a Bayesian phylogenetic tree. We identified 14 putative specificity determining positions (SDPs) of which four are explained by mere structural explanations and nine seem to correspond to functional diversification related wit substrate binding ans specificity. A first sub-network of SDPs is related to substrate specificity whereas the second sub-network seems to affect the dynamics of three loops that are involved in substrate binding.\\n\\nHighlightsEqolisins are acid proteases found in prokaryotes and fungi only.\\n\\nThe recently co-evolved W67F-L105W substitutions promote substrate binding\\n\\nTwo Specificity Determining Networks, SDN1 and 2, were identified\\n\\nSDN1 has four Specificity Determining Positions involved in substrate specificity\\n\\nSDN2 has five Specificity Determining Positions involved in loop-substrate dynamics",

    "abstract": "Tumours with profound copy-number aberration elude molecular stratification due to their genomic complexity. By representing this complexity as a mixture of copy-number signatures, we provide molecular explanations for differing clinical outcomes. Here we present a method for copy-number signature identification, deriving eight signatures in 117 shallow whole-genome sequenced high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC), which validated on independent cohorts of 95 deep whole-genome sequenced, and 402 SNP array-profiled cases. Three copy-number signatures predicted longer overall survival, while the others predicted poorer outcome. We found evidence for the mutational processes giving rise to copy-number change for six of the eight signatures via correlations with other genomic features. Our results provide insights into the pathogenesis of HGSOC by uncovering multiple mutational processes that shape genomes following TP53 mutation. Importantly, our work shows that most HGSOC have a mixture of mutational processes suggesting that targeting a single mutator phenotype may be therapeutically suboptimal.",

    "abstract": "Xanthan gum, a complex polysaccharide comprising glucose, mannose and glucuronic acid residues, is involved in numerous biotechnological applications in cosmetics, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, food and petroleum industries. Additionally, its oligosaccharides were shown to possess antimicrobial, antioxidant and few other properties. Yet, despite its extensive usage, little is known about xanthan gum degradation pathways and mechanisms.\\n\\nThermogutta terrifontis R1 was described as the first thermophilic representative of the Planctomycetes phylum. As other cultivated planctomycetes, it grows well on various carbohydrates including oligo- and polysaccharides, however, its capability of anaerobic growth with or without electron acceptors was a novel finding among the representatives of this phylum.\\n\\nThe aim of this work is to examine T. terrifontis catabolic pathways with a special focus on the xanthan gum degradation pathway using genomic and transriptomic sequencing. Genomic analysis revealed more than a hundred glycosidases, polysaccharide lyases and other CAZymes, involved in oligo- and polysaccharide degradation by T. terrifontis, proteins of central carbohydrate metabolism and aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Furthermore, the combination of genomic and transcriptomic approaches revealed a putative novel xanthan gum degradation pathway involving unusual catalytic steps and enzymes: novel glycosidase(s) of DUF1080 family, hydrolyzing xanthan gum beta-glucosidic backbone linkages and beta-mannosidases instead of xanthan lyases for degradation of terminal beta-mannosidic linkages. Surprisingly, the genes coding DUF1080 proteins were found in high number in T. terrifontis and in many other Planctomycetes genomes, which, together with our observation that xanthan gum being a selective substrate for many planctomycetes, supports the important role of DUF1080 in xanthan gum degradation. Our findings shed light on the metabolism of the first thermophilic planctomycete, capable to degrade a number of polysaccharides, either aerobically or anaerobically, including the biotechnologically important bacterial polysaccharide xanthan gum. The results serve as good foundation for future exploration of T. terrifontis and its enzymes in biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "Precise control of the relative ratio of retinal neurons and glia generated during development is essential for visual function. We show that Lhx2, which encodes a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor essential for specification and differentiation of retinal Muller glia, also plays a critical role in the development of retinal neurons. Overexpression of Lhx2, and its transcriptional coactivator Ldb1, triggers cell cycle exit and inhibits both Notch signaling and retinal gliogenesis. Lhx2/Ldb1 overexpression also induced the formation of wide-field amacrine cells (wfACs). In contrast Rnf12, which encodes a negative regulator of LDB1, is necessary for the initiation of retinal gliogenesis. We also show that LHX2 protein binds upstream of multiple neurogenic bHLH factors including Ascl1 and Neurog2, which are necessary for suppression of gliogenesis and wfAC formation respectively, and activates their expression. Finally, we demonstrate that the relative level of the LHX2-LDB1 complex in the retina decreases in tandem with the onset of gliogenesis. These findings show that control of Lhx2 function by Ldb1 and Rnf12 acts as a molecular mechanism underpinning the coordinated differentiation of neurons and Muller glia in postnatal retina.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe molecular mechanisms that control the ratio neurons and glia that are generated by neuronal progenitors remain unclear. Here we show that Lhx2, a transcription factor essential for retinal gliogenesis, also controls development of retinal neurons. The Lhx2 coactivator Ldb1 promotes Lhx2-dependent neurogenesis, while the Lhx2 corepressor Rnf12 is necessary and sufficient for retinal gliogenesis. Furthermore, Lhx2 directly regulates expression of bHLH factors that promote neural development, which are necessary for Lhx2-dependent neurogenesis. Finally, we show that levels of the LHX2-LDB1 complex, which activates transcription, drop as gliogenesis begins. Dynamic regulation of Lhx2 activity by Ldb1 and Rnf12 thus controls the relative levels of retinal neurogenesis and gliogenesis, and may have similar functions elsewhere in the developing nervous system.",

Propolis and its constituents have been subjected to many studies and are known for their antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic properties. In our study, antioxidant and antitumor capacity of propolis from Konya Sakyatan and Kiziloren regions were investigated. According to our result, Kzloren propolis sample possesses higher antioxidant component and antioxidant capacity than Sakyatan sample. Accordingly, Kiziloren sample showed antiproliferative effect at much lower doses compared to the Sakyatan sample. Both samples effectively inhibited the migration of cancer cells at their determined IC50 dosages. Obtained data indicates that constituents of propolis can greatly vary from one sample to another even in the same region and propolis selections for cancer prevention and treatment studies should be carefully considered.",

    "abstract": "Easy access to high-energy food has been linked to high rates of obesity in the world. Understanding the way that access to palatable (high fat or high calorie) food can lead to overconsumption is essential for both preventing and treating obesity. Although the body of studies focused on the effects of high energy diets is growing, our understanding of how different factors contribute to food choices is not complete. In this study, we present a mathematical model that is able to predict rats calorie intake to a high-energy diet based on their ingestive behavior to a standard chow diet. Specifically, we propose an equation that describes the relation between the body weight (W), energy density (E), time elapsed from the start of diet (T), and daily calorie intake (C). We tested our model on two independent data sets. Our results show that the suggested model is able to predict the calorie intake patterns with high accuracy. Additionally, the only free parameter of our proposed equation ({rho}), which is unique to each animal, has a strong correlation with their calorie intake and weight gain. Additionally, we discuss the relevance of our derived parameter in the context of measuring reward sensitivity in reinforcement learning based studies.",

    "abstract": "Data sharing is increasingly recommended as a means of accelerating science by facilitating collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility. While few oppose data sharing philosophically, a range of barriers deter most researchers from implementing it in practice (e.g., workforce and infrastructural demands, sociocultural and privacy concerns, lack of standardization). To justify the significant effort required for sharing data (e.g., organization, curation, distribution), funding agencies, institutions, and investigators need clear evidence of benefit. Here, using the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative, we present a brain imaging case study that provides direct evidence of the impact of open sharing on data use and resulting publications over a seven-year period (2010-2017). We dispel the myth that scientific findings using shared data cannot be published in high-impact journals and demonstrate rapid growth in the publication of such journal articles, scholarly theses, and conference proceedings. In contrast to commonly used  pay to play models, we demonstrate that openly shared data can increase the scale (i.e., sample size) of scientific studies conducted by data contributors, and can recruit scientists from a broader range of disciplines. These findings suggest the transformative power of data sharing for accelerating science and underscore the need for the scientific ecosystem to embrace the challenge of implementing data sharing universally.",

    "abstract": "The future of infectious disease surveillance and outbreak response is trending towards smaller hand-held solutions for point-of-need pathogen detection.1-4 Although recent advances have paved the way for these technologies to include sequencing of pathogens directly from clinical samples, the ability to carry out unbiased sequencing for pathogen discovery and subtyping directly from environmental samples has yet to be demonstrated with hand-held platforms.5 Products such as the two3 qPCR system from Biomeme Inc., as well as the MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, have generated renewed prospects for point-of-need diagnostics and near real-time environmental testing and characterization of viral and microbial pathogens. Here, samples of Culex cedecei mosquitoes collected in Southern Florida, USA were tested for Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV), a previously-weaponized arthropod-borne RNA-virus capable of causing acute and fatal encephalitis in animal and human hosts. A single 20-mosquito pool tested positive for VEEV by real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) on the Biomeme two3. The virus-positive sample was then subjected to unbiased metatranscriptome sequencing on the MinION and determined to contain Everglades Virus (EVEV), a strain of VEEV transmitted exclusively by Culex cedecei in South Florida. The result was confirmed on \\\"gold standard\\\" thermocyclers and sequencing machines, and comparison to nanopore results is discussed. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the use of unbiased sequence-based detection and subtyping of a high-consequence biothreat pathogen directly from an environmental sample using field-forward hardware and protocols. The further development and validation of methods designed for field-based diagnostic metagenomics and pathogen discovery, such as those suitable for use in mobile \\\"pocket laboratories\\\", will address a growing demand for public health teams to carry out their mission where it is most urgent: at the point-of-need.6",

To get insights into these matters, we analyzed chemical reaction networks with different topologies and degrees of complexity, interacting or not with the environment. We showed that the global level of fluctuations at the steady state, as measured by the sum of the Fano factors of the number of molecules of all species, is directly related to the topology of the network. For systems with zero deficiency, this sum is constant and equal to the rank of the network. For higher deficiencies, we observed an increase or decrease of the fluctuation levels according to the values of the reaction fluxes that link internal species, multiplied by the associated stoichiometry. We showed that the noise is reduced when the fluxes all flow towards the species of higher complexity, whereas it is amplified when the fluxes are directed towards lower complexity species.\\n\\nPACS numbers: 02.50.Ey, 05.10.Gg, 05.40.Ca, 87.18.-h",

    "abstract": "A profile comparison method with position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) is one of the most accurate alignment methods. Currently, cosine similarity and correlation coefficient are used as scoring functions of dynamic programming to calculate similarity between PSSMs. However, it is unclear that these functions are optimal for profile alignment methods. At least, by definition, these functions cannot capture non-linear relationships between profiles. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to discover a novel scoring function, which was more suitable for the profile comparison method than the existing ones. Firstly we implemented a new derivative free neural network by combining the conventional neural network with evolutionary strategy optimization method. Next, using the framework, the scoring function was optimized for aligning remote sequence pairs. Nepal, the pairwise profile aligner with the novel scoring function significantly improved both alignment sensitivity and precision, compared to aligners with the existing functions. Nepal improved alignment quality because of adaptation to remote sequence alignment and increasing the expressive power of similarity score. The novel scoring function can be realized using a simple matrix operation and easily incorporated into other aligners. With our scoring function, the performance of homology detection and/or multiple sequence alignment for remote homologous sequences would be further improved.",

    "abstract": "Cells are capable of cytoskeleton remodeling in response to environmental cues at the plasma membrane. The propensity to remodel in response to a mechanical stimulus is reflected in part by the lifetime of the membrane-cytoskeleton bonds upon application of a tensile loading rate. We measure the lifetime and force to rupture membrane-cytoskeleton linkages of a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell line, HN-31 by applying a tensile loading rate (< 60 pN/s) with a handle bound to a cell, while monitoring the displacement of the handle at 2 kHz after averaging. We observe the lifetime increases with loading rate, rf to a maximum after which it decreases with further increase in rf. This biphasic relationship appears insensitive to drugs that target microtubule assembly, but is no longer detectable, i.e., lifetime is independent of rf in cells with reduced active Rho-GTPases. The loading rate-time relationship resembles catch-slip behavior reported upon applying tensile loads to separate protein complexes. Under small loads the bonds catch to increase lifetimes, under larger loads their lifetime shortens and they dissociate in a slip-like manner. Our data conforms to a model that considers the membrane-cytoskeleton bonds exhibit a load-dependent conformational change and dissociate via two pathways. We also find the membrane-cytoskeleton linkages strengthen with stationary compressive load, FSC (|FSC| < 40 pN), and conclude this metastatic cell line responds to small mechanical stimuli by promoting cytoskeleton remodeling as evident by observing F-actin within the membrane nanotube (10 {micro}m length) formed after bond rupture.",

Here we are proposing  Dhaka a variational autoencoder based single cell analysis tool to transform genomic data to a latent encoded feature space that is more efficient in differentiating between the hidden tumor subpopulations. This technique is generalized across different types of genomic data such as copy number variation from DNA sequencing and gene expression data from RNA sequencing. We have tested the method on two gene expression datasets having 4K to 6K tumor cells and two copy number variation datasets having 250 to 260 tumor cells. Analysis of the encoded feature space revealed sub-populations of cells bearing distinct genomic signatures and the evolutionary relationship between them, which other existing feature transformation methods like t-SNE and PCA fail to do.",

    "abstract": "The cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a destructive insect pest that feeds on a wide range of plants. The High Five cell line (Hi5), originally derived from T. ni ovaries, is often used for efficient expression of recombinant proteins. Here, we report a draft assembly of the 368.2 Mb T. ni genome, with 90.6% of all bases assigned to one of its 28 chromosomes and predicted 14,037 predicted protein-coding genes. Manual curation of gene families involved in chemoreception and detoxification reveals T. ni-specific gene expansions that may explain its widespread distribution and rapid adaptation to insecticides. Using male and female genome sequences, we define Z-linked and repeat-rich W-linked sequences. Transcriptome and small RNA data from T. ni thorax, ovary, testis, and Hi5 cells reveal distinct expression profiles for 295 microRNA- and >393 piRNA-producing loci, as well as 39 genes encoding core small RNA pathway proteins. siRNAs target both endogenous transposons and the exogenous TNCL virus. Surprisingly, T. ni siRNAs are not 2{acute}-O-methylated. Five piRNA-producing loci account for 34.9% piRNAs in the ovary, 49.3% piRNAs in the testis, and 44.0% piRNAs in Hi5 cells. Nearly all of the W chromosome is devoted to piRNA production: >76.0% of bases in the assembled W produce piRNAs in ovary. To enable use of the T. ni germline-derived Hi5 cell line as a model system, we have established efficient genome editing and single-cell cloning protocols. Taken together, the T. ni genome provides insights into pest control and allows Hi5 cells to become a new tool for studying small RNAs ex vivo.",

    "abstract": "Physiological ageing affects brain structure and function impacting its morphology, connectivity and performance. However, at which extent brain-connectivity metrics reflect the age of an individual and whether treatments or lifestyle factors such as physical activity influence the age-connectivity match is still unclear. Here, we assessed the level of physical activity and collected brain images from healthy participants (N=155) ranging from 10 to 80 years to build functional (resting-state) and structural (tractography) connectivity matrices that were combined as connectivity descriptors. Connectivity descriptors were used to compute a maximum likelihood age estimator that was optimized by minimizing the mean absolute error. The connectivity-based estimated age, i.e. the brain-connectome age (BCA), was compared to the chronological age (ChA). Our results were threefold. First, we showed that ageing widely affects the structural-functional connectivity of multiple structures, such as the anterior part of the default mode network, basal ganglia, thalamus, insula, cingulum, hippocampus, parahippocampus, occipital cortex, fusiform, precuneus and temporal pole. Second, our analysis showed that the structure-function connectivity between basal ganglia and thalamus to orbitofrontal and frontal areas make a major contribution to age estimation. Third, we found that high levels of physical activity reduce BCA as compared to ChA, and vice versa, low levels increment it. In conclusion, the BCA model results highlight the impact of physical activity and the key role played by the connectivity between basal ganglia and thalamus to frontal areas on the process of healthy aging. Notably, the same methodology can be generally applied both to evaluate the impact of other factors and therapies on brain ageing, and to identify the structural-functional brain connectivity correlate of other biomarkers than ChA.",

    "abstract": "The use of transcranial, low intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging neuromodulation technology that shows promise for both therapeutic and research applications. Compared with other noninvasive neuromodulation approaches, key technical advantages include high lateral resolution of stimulation and deep penetration depth. However, empirically observed effects in vivo are diverse; for example, variations in sonication location and waveform can alternatively elicit putatively inhibitory or excitatory effects. At a fundamental level, it is unclear how FUS alters the function of neural circuits at the site of sonication. To address this knowledge gap, we developed an approach to optically interrogate the spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity in the cortex directly at the acoustic focus, thereby offering a glimpse into the local effects of FUS on distributed populations of neurons in vivo. Our experiments probed electrical activity through the use of voltage sensitive dyes (VSDs) and, in transgenic GCaMP6f mice, monitored associated Ca2+ responses. Our results directly demonstrate that low-intensity FUS adjusts both the kinetics and spatial patterns of sensory receptive fields at the acoustic focus in vivo. Although our experimental configuration limits interpretation to population activity, the use of VSDs ensures that the detected alterations reflect activity in cortical neurons, unobscured by signals in subcortical or laterally distant cortical regions. More generally, this optical measurement paradigm can be implemented to observe FUS-induced alterations in cortical representation with higher lateral resolution spatial versatility than is practical through more conventional electrodebased measurements. Our findings suggest that reports of FUS-induced sensory modulation in human studies may partly reflect alterations cortical representation and reactivity.",

    "abstract": "Effective behaviour and cognition requires the ability to make predictions about the temporal properties of events, such as duration. It is well known that violations of temporal structure within sequences of stimuli lead to neurophysiological effects known as the (temporal) mismatch negativity (TMMN). However, previous studies investigating this phenomenon have typically presented successive stimulus intervals (i.e., durations) within a rhythmic structure, conflating the contributions of rhythmic temporal processing with those specific to duration. In a novel behavioural paradigm which extends the classic temporal oddball design, we examined the neurophysiological correlates of prediction violation under both rhythmically (isochronous) and arrhythmically (anisochronous) presented durations, in visual and auditory modalities. Using event-related potential (ERP), multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), and temporal generalisation analysis (TGA) analyses, we found evidence for common, and distinct neurophysiological responses related to duration predictions and their violation, across isochronous and anisochronous conditions. Further, using TGA we could directly compare processes underlying duration prediction violation across different modalities, despite differences in processing latency of audition and vision. We discovered a common set of neurophysiological responses that are elicited whenever a duration prediction is violated, regardless of presentation modality, indicating the existence of a supramodal duration prediction mechanism. Altogether, our data show that the human brain encodes predictions specifically about duration, in addition to those from rhythmic structure, and that the neural underpinnings of these predictions generalize across modalities. These findings support the idea that time perception is based on similar principles of inference as characterize  predictive processing theories of perception.",

Children born to exposed mothers are at highest risk of learning and memory and motor deficits. We developed a mouse model that mimics human variation in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) to determine if genetic variation increases susceptibility to developmental PCB exposure. In our previous studies, we found that high-affinity AhrbCyp1a2(-/-) and poor-affinity AhrdCyp1a2(-/-) knockout mice were most susceptible to learning and memory deficits following developmental PCB exposure compared with AhrbCyp1a2(+/+) wild type mice (C57BL/6J strain). Our follow-up studies focused on motor deficits, because human studies have identified PCBs as a potential risk factor for Parkinsons disease. Dams were treated with an environmentally relevant PCB mixture at gestational day 10 and postnatal day 5. We used a motor battery that included tests of nigrostriatal function as well as cerebellar function, because PCBs deplete thyroid hormone, which is essential to normal cerebellar development. There was a significant effect of PCB treatment in the rotarod test with impaired performance in all three genotypes, but decreased motor learning as well in the two Cyp1a2(-/-) knockout lines. Interestingly, we found a main effect of genotype with corn oil-treated control Cyp1a2(-/-) mice performing significantly worse than Cyp1a2(+/+) wild type mice. In contrast, we found that PCB-treated high-affinity Ahrb mice were most susceptible to disruption of nigrostriatal function with the greatest deficits in AhrbCyp1a2(-/-) mice. We conclude that differences in both genes affect susceptibility to motor deficits following developmental PCB exposure.",

MERIT incorporates an all-inclusive variant caller and considers genomic context, including the nucleotides immediately at 5' and 3', thereby establishing error rates for 96 possible substitutions as well as four singlebase and 16 double-base indels. We apply MERIT to ultra-deep sequencing data (1,300,000x) and show a significant relationship between error rates and genomic contexts. We devise an in silico approach to determine the optimal sequencing depth, where errors occur at rates similar to those of true mutations. Finally, we assess nucleotide-incorporation fidelity of four high-fidelity DNA polymerases in clinically relevant loci, and demonstrate how fixed detection thresholds may result in substantial false positive as well as false negative calls.",

We introduce a new and efficient approach, called the containment min hash approach, that is more suitable for estimating the Jaccard index of sets of very different size. We accomplish this by leveraging another probabilistic method (in particular, Bloom filters) for fast membership queries. We derive bounds on the probability of estimate errors for the containment min hash approach and show it significantly improves upon the classical min hash approach.

Conditional deletion of Baf60c in cardiomyocytes results in postnatal dilated cardiomyopathy with impaired contractile function. Baf60c regulates a gene expression program that includes genes encoding contractile proteins, modulators of sarcomere function, and cardiac metabolic genes. Many of the genes deregulated in Baf60c null embryos are targets of the MEF2/SRF co-factor Myocardin (MYOCD). In a yeast two-hybrid screen we identify MYOCD as a BAF60c interacting factor; we show that BAF60c and MYOCD directly and functionally interact.

Here, we present a first draft genome of a species from the family Milnesiidae, namely Milnesium tardigradum. We consistently place M. tardigradum and the two previously sequenced Hypsibiidae species, Hypsibius dujardini and Ramazzottius varieornatus, as sister group of the nematodes with the arthropods as outgroup. Based on this placement, we identify a massive gene loss thus far attributed to the nematodes which predates their split from the tardigrades. We provide a comprehensive catalog of protein domain expansions linked to stress response and show that previously identified tardigrade-unique proteins are erratically distributed across the genome of M. tardigradum. We further suggest alternative pathways to cope with high stress levels that are yet unexplored in tardigrades and further promote the phylum Tardigrada as a rich source of stress protection genes and mechanisms.",

Whether codon usage is also generally shaped by natural selection in large organisms, despite their relatively small effective population size (Ne), is unclear. Codon usage bias in animals has only been studied in a handful of model organisms so far, and can be affected by confounding, non-adaptive processes such as GC-biased gene conversion and experimental artefacts. Using population transcriptomics data we analysed the relationship between codon usage, gene expression, allele frequency distribution and recombination rate in 31 non-model species of animals, each from a different family, covering a wide range of effective population sizes. We disentangled the effects of translational selection and GC-biased gene conversion on codon usage by separately analysing GC-conservative and GC-changing mutations. We report evidence for effective translational selection on codon usage in large-Ne species of animals, but not in small-Ne ones, in agreement with the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution. C- and T-ending codons are generally preferred over synonymous G- and A-ending ones, for reasons that remain to be determined. In contrast, we uncovered a conspicuous effect of GC-biased gene conversion, which is widespread in animals and the main force determining the fate of AT{leftrightarrow}GC mutations.

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that can cause life-threatening cryptoccocal meningitis, predominantly within immunocompromised individuals. Cortical infarcts are observed in as many as 30% of cryptococcal meningitis cases, being particularly common in severe infection. Limited clinical case studies suggest infarcts are secondary to vasculitis and blood vessel damage caused by cryptococcal infection. However, the cause of infarcts in cryptococcal infection has not been determined. To examine potential causes of vascular damage and cryptococcal dissemination in cryptococcal infection, the zebrafish C. neoformans infection model was used. We demonstrate that spread of cryptococci from the vasculature occurs at sites where cryptococci grow within the blood vessels, originating from a single or small number of cryptococci. We find that cryptococcal cells become trapped within the vasculature and can proliferate there resulting in vasodilation. Localised cryptococcal growth in the vasculature is also associated with sites of dissemination - in some cases simultaneously with a loss of blood vessel integrity. Using a cell-cell junction protein reporter (VE-cadherin) we identified sites dissemination associated with both intact blood vessels and where vessel rupture occurred. Thus, we have identified a mechanism for blood vessel damage during cryptococcal infection that may represent a cause of the vascular damage and cortical infarction observed in cryptococcal meningitis.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHuman infection by the fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, can lead to life-threatening cryptococcal meningitis. In severe cases of cryptococcal meningitis, a lack of blood supply can cause tissue death and a resulting area of dead tissue (infarct) in the brain. Although vasculature inflammation in known to occur in cryptococcal meningitis, the cause of infarcts in unknown. Using a zebrafish model of cryptococcal infection, the growth and dissemination of fungal cells was observed over time. We show that cryptococcal cells become trapped and proliferate in the vasculature, resulting in cryptococcoma that damage the blood vessels. We propose that vessel damage results from increased blood pressure caused by cryptococci blocking blood vessels suggesting that the vascular damage that ensues on cryptococcoma formation may in turn be a cause of infarct formation seen in cryptococcal meningitis.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in image-based plant phenotyping, applying state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to tackle challenging problems, such as leaf segmentation (a multi-instance problem) and counting. Most of these algorithms need labelled data to learn a model for the task at hand. Despite the recent release of a few plant phenotyping datasets, large annotated plant image datasets for the purpose of training deep learning algorithms are lacking. One common approach to alleviate the lack of training data is dataset augmentation. Herein, we propose an alternative solution to dataset augmentation for plant phenotyping, creating artificial images of plants using generative neural networks. We propose the Arabidopsis Rosette Image Generator (through) Adversarial Network: a deep convolutional network that is able to generate synthetic rosette-shaped plants, inspired by DC-GAN (a recent adversarial network model using convolutional layers). Specifically, we trained the network using A1, A2, and A4 of the CVPPP 2017 LCC dataset, containing Arabidopsis Thaliana plants. We show that our model is able to generate realistic 128 x 128 colour images of plants. We train our network conditioning on leaf count, such that it is possible to generate plants with a given number of leaves suitable, among others, for training regression based models. We propose a new Ax dataset of artificial plants images, obtained by our ARIGAN. We evaluate this new dataset using a state-of-the-art leaf counting algorithm, showing that the testing error is reduced when Ax is used as part of the training data.",

    "abstract": "Humans display anticipatory motor responses to minimize the adverse effects of predictable perturbations. A widely accepted explanation for this behavior relies on the notion of an inverse model that, learning from motor errors, anticipates corrective responses. Here, we propose and validate the alternative hypothesis that anticipatory control can be realized through a cascade of purely sensory predictions that drive the motor system, reflecting the causal sequence of the perceptual events preceding the error. We compare both hypotheses in a simulated anticipatory postural adjustment task. We observe that adaptation in the sensory domain, but not in the motor one, supports the robust and generalizable anticipatory control characteristic of biological systems. Our proposal unites the neurobiology of the cerebellum with the theory of active inference and provides a concrete implementation of its core tenets with great relevance both to our understanding of biological control systems and, possibly, to their emulation in complex artefacts.",

    "abstract": "Humans and non-human animals ability to process time on the scale of milliseconds and seconds is essential for adaptive behaviour. A central question of how brains keep track of time is how specific temporal information across different sensory modalities is. In the present study, we show that encoding of temporal intervals in auditory and visual modalities are qualitatively similar. Human participants were instructed to reproduce intervals in the range from 750 ms to 1500 ms marked by auditory or visual stimuli. Our behavioural results suggest that, although participants were more accurate in reproducing intervals marked by auditory stimuli, there was a strong correlation in performance between modalities. Using multivariate pattern analysis in scalp EEG, we show that activity during late periods of the intervals was similar within and between modalities. Critically, we show that a multivariate pattern classifier was able to accurately predict the elapsed interval, even when trained on an interval marked by a stimulus of a different sensory modality. Taken together, our results suggest that, while there are differences in the processing of intervals marked by auditory and visual stimuli, they also share a common neural representation.",

    "abstract": "Emotional Enhancement of free recall can be context dependent. It is readily observed when emotional and neutral scenes are encoded and recalled together, in a  mixed list, but diminishes when these scenes are encoded separately, in  pure lists. We examined the hypothesis that this effect is due to differences of allocation of attention to neutral stimuli according to whether they are presented in mixed or pure lists, especially when encoding is intentional. Using picture stimuli that were controlled for semantic relatedness, our results contradicted this hypothesis. The amplitude of well-known electrophysiological markers of emotion-related attention - the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN), the Late Positive Potential (LPP), and the Slow Wave (SW) - was higher for emotional stimuli. Crucially, the emotional modulation of these ERPs was insensitive to list context, observed equally in pure and mixed lists. Although list context did not modulate neural markers of emotion-related attention, list context did modulate the effect of emotion on free recall. The apparent decoupling of the emotional effects on attention and memory challenges existing hypotheses accounting for the emotional enhancement of memory. We close by discussing whether findings are more compatible with an alternative hypothesis, where the magnitude of emotional memory enhancement is, at least in part, a consequence of retrieval dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Florivory, the damage to flowers by herbivores can affect fitness both directly and indirectly. Flowers consumed by florivores may fail to produce fruit or produce lower seed set because of direct damage to reproductive organs. In addition, eaten flowers are less attractive to pollinators because of reduced or modified advertisement, which reduces pollination services. While observational data are abundant, experimental evidence is scarce and results are contrasting. We tested experimentally the effect of florivory on both pollinator visitation and reproductive success in three species of the Royal Irises, which have large flowers that are attractive to pollinators, and potentially also for florivores. We hypothesized that florivory will reduce pollen deposition due to reduced attractiveness to pollinators, while fruit set and seed set will depend on the extent of florivory. We performed artificial florivory in two experiments over two years. In the first experiment, each of the three floral units of a single Iris flower was subject to either low or high artificial florivory, or left un-touched as control. We counted the number of pollen grains deposited on each of the three stigmas as a measure of pollinator visitation. In the second experiment, three flowers of the same plant received low, high, or no artificial florivory and were further recorded for fruit and seed production. In 2016, high artificial florivory revealed lower number of pollen grains on stigmas of Iris atropurpurea, but in 2017 there was no difference. Similarly, number of pollen grains in high artificial was lower than low florivory in 2017 in I. petrana. No significant effect of florivory was found on pollen grain deposition, fruit set or seed set. The results remained consistent across species and across years. The results undermine the assumption that flower herbivory is necessarily antagonistic interaction and suggests that florivores may not be strong selection agents on floral reproductive biology in the Oncocyclus irises.",

    "abstract": "The fitness and evolution of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes are affected by the organization of their genomes. In particular, the physical clustering of functionally related genes can facilitate coordinated gene expression and can prevent the breakup of co-adapted alleles in recombining populations. While clustering may thus result from selection for phenotype optimization and persistence, the extent to which eukaryotic gene organization in particular is driven by specific environmental selection pressures has rarely been systematically explored. Here, we investigated the genetic architecture of fungal genes involved in the degradation of phenylpropanoids, a class of plant-produced secondary metabolites that mediate many ecological interactions between plants and fungi. Using a novel gene cluster detection method, we identified over one thousand gene clusters, as well as many conserved combinations of clusters, in a phylogenetically and ecologically diverse set of fungal genomes. We demonstrate that congruence in gene organization over small spatial scales in fungal genomes is often associated with similarities in ecological lifestyle. Additionally, we find that while clusters are often structured as independent modules with little overlap in content, certain gene families merge multiple modules in a common network, suggesting they are important components of phenylpropanoid degradation strategies. Together, our results suggest that phenylpropanoids have repeatedly selected for gene clustering in fungi, and highlight the interplay between gene organization and ecological evolution in this ancient eukaryotic lineage.",

Although the TATA-Binding Protein (TBP) subunit of TFIID is necessary and sufficient for in vitro transcription, the TBP-Associated Factor (TAF) subunits recognize downstream promoter elements, act as co-activators, and interact with nucleosomes. Here we show that transcription induces stable TAF binding to downstream promoter DNA, independent of upstream contacts, TBP, or other basal transcription factors. This transcription-dependent TAF complex promotes subsequent activator-independent transcription, and promoter response to TAF mutations in vivo correlates with the level of downstream, rather than overall, Taf1 crosslinking. We propose a new model in which TAFs function as reinitiation factors, accounting for the differential responses of promoters to various transcription factor mutations.",

    "abstract": "The plant hormone auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) has a profound influence over plant cell growth and differentiation. Current understanding of vein development in leaves is based on the canalization of auxin into self-reinforcing streams which determine the sites of vascular cell differentiation. However, the role of auxin biosynthesis during leaf development in the context of leaf vein patterning has not been much studied so far. Here we characterize the context specific importance of auxin biosynthesis, auxin transport and mechanical regulations in a growing leaf. We show that domains of auxin biosynthesis predict the positioning of vascular cells. In mutants that have reduced capacity in auxin biosynthesis, leaf vein formation is decreased. While exogenous application of auxin does not compensate the loss of vein formation in auxin biosynthesis mutants, inhibition of polar auxin transport does compensate the vein-less phenotype, suggesting that the site-specific accumulation of auxin, which is likely to be mainly caused by the local auxin biosynthesis, is important for leaf vein formation. Our computational model of midvein development brings forth the interplay of cell stiffness and auxin dependent cell division. We propose that local auxin biosynthesis has the integral role in leaf vascular development.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIBuilt spatially and temporally resolved auxin biosynthesis map in growing leaf primordium of Arabidopsis.\\nC_LIO_LIExpression domains of auxin biosynthetic enzymes within primordia strongly correlated with leaf vein initiation.\\nC_LIO_LIResults show that domains of auxin biosynthesis within primordia drive leaf vein initiation and patterning.\\nC_LI\\n\\nHighlights and eTOC BlurbUsing modelling and a spatiotemporal analysis of auxin biosynthesis and transport, Kneuper et al. show that tissue specific auxin biosynthesis defines places of vein initiation hence underlining the importance of auxin concentration in vein initiation.",

The phenotypic variation found in organismal development is biased towards certain phenotypes, but the molecular mechanisms behind such restrictions are still poorly understood. Gene regulatory networks have been proposed as one cause of constrained phenotypic variation. However, most of the evidence for this is theoretical rather than experimental. Here, we study evolutionary biases in two synthetic gene regulatory circuits expressed in E. coli that produce a gene expression stripe - a pivotal pattern in embryonic development. The two parental circuits produce the same phenotype, but create it through different regulatory mechanisms. We show that mutations cause distinct novel phenotypes in the two networks and use a combination of experimental measurements, mathematical modelling and DNA sequencing to understand why mutations bring forth only some but not other novel gene expression phenotypes. Our results reveal that the regulatory mechanisms of networks restrict the possible phenotypic variation upon mutation. Consequently, seemingly equivalent networks can indeed be distinct in how they constrain the outcome of further evolution.",

However, how these remodelers are integrated in metabolic stability pathways is not well known. Here, we report an expansive genetic screen with chromatin remodelers and metabolic regulators in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that, unlike the SWR1 remodeler, the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex is composed of multiple distinct functional subunit modules. We identified a strikingly divergent genetic signature for the Ies6 subunit module that links the INO80 complex to metabolic homeostasis, including mitochondrial maintenance. INO80 is also needed to communicate TORC1-mediated signaling to chromatin and maintains histone acetylation at TORC1-responsive genes. Furthermore, computational analysis reveals subunits of INO80 and mTORC1 have high co-occurrence of alterations in human cancers. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the INO80 complex is a central component of metabolic homeostasis that influences histone acetylation and may contribute to disease when disrupted.",

    "abstract": "Patients with drug refractory temporal lobe epilepsy frequently accumulate cognitive impairment over time, suggesting neuronal loss induced by seizures. We measured serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a neuronal injury marker, relative to levels of S100{beta}, a marker of glial injury, at 6 AM, 9 AM, noon, 3 PM, and 6 PM over the course of several days in 7 epilepsy patients and 4 healthy controls. All epilepsy patients exhibited significant deviations in NSE levels through time, and 4 of the epilepsy patients exhibited large sample entropy values and large signal variation metrics for NSE relative to S100{beta}. Controls did not exhibit such changes. Correlation analysis revealed that NSE levels were significantly elevated after clinical seizure events. There was also a highly significant relationship between increased EEG spike frequency and an increase in serum NSE levels measured 24 hours later. The detection of large but transient post-ictal increases in NSE suggests that even self-limited seizures may cause an injury to neurons that underlies cognitive decline in some patients. Post-ictal assessment of serum NSE may serve as a biomarker for measuring the efficacy of future acute neuroprotective strategies in epilepsy patients.",

    "abstract": "The domestication of diverse grain crops from wild grasses resulted from artificial selection for a suite of overlapping traits producing changes referred to in aggregate as \\\"domestication syndrome\\\". Parallel phenotypic change can be accomplished by either selection on orthologous genes, or selection on non-orthologous genes with parallel phenotypic effects. To determine how often artificial selection for domestication traits in the grasses targeted orthologous genes, we employed resequencing data from wild and domesticated accessions of Zea (maize) and Sorghum (sorghum). Many \\\"classic\\\" domestication genes identified through QTL mapping in populations resulting from wild/domesticated crosses indeed show signatures of parallel selection in both maize and sorghum. However, the overall number of genes showing signatures of parallel selection in both species is not significantly different from that expected by chance. This suggests that, while a small number of genes will extremely large phenotypic effects have been targeted repeatedly by artificial selection during domestication, the optimization portion of domestication targeted small and largely non-overlapping subsets of all possible genes which could produce equivalent phenotypic alterations.",

    "abstract": "Despite widespread taxonomic representation, the function of gene body methylation (GBM) remains uncertain. One hypothesis is that GBM mediates phenotypic plasticity. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed whole-genome methylation and transcriptome profiling on reciprocally transplanted colony fragments of the reef-building coral Acropora millepora. GBM was only slightly affected by transplantation but these small changes correlated with coral fitness in the new environment. Specifically, for transplanted corals, similarity in GBM patterns to native corals positively correlated with growth rate, as well as carbohydrate, protein, lipid and endosymbiont content. Between populations, elevated GBM positively correlated with transcription, supporting previous findings that GBM is associated with stable and active transcription. Contrary to expectations however, changes in transcription as a result of transplantation did not correlate with changes in GBM and did not predict fitness. This indicates that on physiological time scales GBM is not directly coupled to transcription, leaving open the question about the mechanism linking GBM to fitness during acclimatization.",
