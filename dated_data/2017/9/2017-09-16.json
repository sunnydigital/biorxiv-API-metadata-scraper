    "abstract": "When we perform a cognitive task, multiple brain regions are engaged. Understanding how these regions interact is a fundamental step to uncover the neural bases of behavior. Most research on the interactions between brain regions has focused on the univariate responses in the regions. However, fine grained patterns of response encode important information, as shown by multivariate pattern analysis. In the present article, we introduce and apply multivariate pattern connectivity (MVPC): a technique to study the dependence between brain regions in humans in terms of the multivariate relations between their patterns of responses. MVPC characterizes the responses in each brain region as trajectories in region-specific multidimensional spaces, and models the multivariate relationship between these trajectories. Considering the fusiform face area (FFA) as a seed region, we used searchlight-based MVPC to reveal interactions between regions undetected by univariate functional connectivity analyses. MVPC (but not functional connectivity) identified significant interactions between right FFA and the right anterior temporal lobe, the right superior temporal sulcus, and the dorsal visual stream. Additionally, MVPC outperformed univariate connectivity in its ability to explain independent variance in the responses of individual voxels. In the end, MVPC uncovered different connectivity profiles associated with different representational subspaces of FFA: the first principal component of FFA shows differential connectivity with occipital and parietal regions implicated in the processing of low-level properties of faces, while the second and third components show differential connectivity with anterior temporal regions implicated in the processing of invariant representations of face identity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHuman behavior is supported by systems of brain regions that exchange infor-mation to complete a task. This exchange of information between brain regions leads to statistical relationships between their responses over time. Most likely, these relationships do not link only the mean responses in two brain regions, but also their finer spatial patterns. Analyzing finer response patterns has been a key advance in the study of responses within individual regions, and can be leveraged to study between-region interactions. To capture the overall statistical relationship between two brain regions, we need to describe each regions responses with respect to dimensions that best account for the variation in that region over time. These dimensions can be different from region to region. We introduce an approach in which each regions responses are characterized in terms of region-specific dimensions that best account for its responses, and the relationships between regions are modeled with multivariate linear models. We demonstrate that this approach provides a better account of the data as compared to standard functional connectivity, and we use it to discover multiple dimensions within the fusiform face area that have different connectivity profiles with the rest of the brain.",

    "abstract": "It is a long standing question as to which genes define the characteristic facial features among different ethnic groups. In this study, we use Uyghurs, an ancient admixed population to query the genetic bases why Europeans and Han Chinese look different. Facial traits were analyzed based on high-dense 3D facial images; numerous biometric spaces were examined for divergent facial features between European and Han Chinese, ranging from inter-landmark distances to dense shape geometrics. Genome-wide association analyses were conducted on a discovery panel of Uyghurs. Six significant loci were identified four of which, rs1868752, rs118078182, rs60159418 at or near UBASH3B, COL23A1, PCDH7 and rs17868256 were replicated in independent cohorts of Uyghurs or Southern Han Chinese.

    "abstract": "When infants and adults communicate, they exchange social signals of availability and communicative intention such as eye gaze. Previous research indicates that when communication is successful, close temporal dependencies arise between adult speakers and listeners neural activity. However, it is not known whether similar neural contingencies exist within adult-infant dyads. Here, we used dual-electroencephalography to assess whether direct gaze increases neural coupling between adults and infants during screen-based and live interactions. In Experiment 1 (N=17), infants viewed videos of an adult who was singing nursery rhymes with (a) Direct gaze (looking forward); (b) Indirect gaze (head and eyes averted by 20{degrees}); or (c) Direct-Oblique gaze (head averted but eyes orientated forward). In Experiment 2 (N=19), infants viewed the same adult in a live context, singing with Direct or Indirect gaze. Gaze-related changes in adult-infant neural network connectivity were measured using Partial Directed Coherence. Across both experiments, the adult had a significant (Granger)-causal influence on infants neural activity, which was stronger during Direct and Direct-Oblique gaze relative to Indirect gaze. During live interactions, infants also influenced the adult more during Direct than Indirect gaze. Further, infants vocalised more frequently during live Direct gaze, and individual infants who vocalized longer also elicited stronger synchronisation from the adult. These results demonstrate that direct gaze strengthens bi-directional adult-infant neural connectivity during communication. Thus, ostensive social signals could act to bring brains into mutual temporal alignment, creating a joint-networked state that is structured to facilitate information transfer during early communication and learning.",

    "abstract": "It has been indicated that both egocentric and allocentric representation systems exist in parallel, and combine to support spatial navigation according to the task. Identifying the neuronal mechanisms and functional roles of the interactions between the two systems promises to provide new insights into the organization of human navigation network. Here we combined resting-state fMRI and behavioral tasks to investigate how the core structures of these systems (i.e., hippocampus and caudate) functionally interact, and further examined their behavioral relevance in navigation in healthy young adults (N = 190). We found a slightly positive connectivity between the hippocampus and caudate (especially in good navigators), suggesting an effective hippocampal-caudate cross talk, which may facilitate the functional integration of the two systems. Interestingly, the hippocampal-caudate interaction correlated with better self-reported navigation ability. Moreover, using an extra 3D pointing task in virtual reality, we found that individuals behavioral performance could be largely predicted by the hippocampal-caudate interactions. Overall, our study demonstrated the intrinsic interaction between two representation systems of the navigation network and its functional roles in behaviors, and further study on dynamic interaction would help us understand better their role in normal aging and psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundColorectal cancer is a worldwide health problem. Despite growing evidence that members of the gut microbiota can drive tumorigenesis, little is known about what happens to it after treatment for an adenoma or carcinoma. This study tested the hypothesis that treatment for adenoma or carcinoma alters the abundance of bacterial populations associated with disease to those associated with a normal colon. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes in the feces of 67 individuals before and after treatment for adenoma (N = 22), advanced adenoma (N = 19), and carcinoma (N = 26).\\n\\nResultsThere were small changes to the bacterial community associated with adenoma or advanced adenoma and large changes associated with carcinoma. The communities from patients with carcinomas changed significantly more than those with adenoma following treatment (P-value < 0.001). Although treatment was associated with intrapersonal changes, the change in the abundance of individual OTUs in response to treatment was not consistent within diagnosis groups (P-value > 0.05). Because the distribution of OTUs across patients and diagnosis groups was irregular, we used the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to identify groups of OTUs that could be used to classify pre and post-treatment samples for each of the diagnosis groups. Although the three models could differentiate between the pre and post-treatment samples, there was little overlap between the OTUs that were indicative of each treatment. To determine whether individuals who underwent treatment were more likely to have OTUs associated with normal colons we used a larger cohort that contained individuals with normal colons and those with adenomas, advanced adenomas, and carcinomas. We again built Random Forest models and measured the change in the positive probability of having one of the three diagnoses to assess whether the post-treatment samples received the same classification as the pre-treatment samples. Samples from patients who had carcinomas changed towards a microbial milieu that resembles the normal colon after treatment (P-value < 0.05). Finally, we were unable to detect any significant differences in the microbiota of individuals treated with surgery alone and those treated with chemotherapy or chemotherapy and radiation (P-value > 0.05).\\n\\nConclusionsBy better understanding the response of the microbiota to treatment for adenomas and carcinomas, it is likely that biomarkers will eventually be validated that can be used to quantify the risk of recurrence and the likelihood of survival. Although it was difficult to identify significant differences between pre and post-treatment samples from patients with adenoma and advanced adenoma, this was not the case for carcinomas. Not only were there large changes in pre versus post-treatment samples for those with carcinoma, but these changes were towards a more normal microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Vision research has been shaped by the seminal insight that we can understand the higher-tier visual cortex from the perspective of multiple functional pathways with different goals. In this paper, we try to give a computational account of the functional organization of this system by reasoning from the perspective of multi-task deep neural networks. Machine learning has shown that tasks become easier to solve when they are decomposed into subtasks with their own cost function. We hypothesize that the visual system optimizes multiple cost functions of unrelated tasks and this causes the emergence of a ventral pathway dedicated to vision for perception, and a dorsal pathway dedicated to vision for action. To evaluate the functional organization in multi-task deep neural networks, we propose a method that measures the contribution of a unit towards each task, applying it to two networks that have been trained on either two related or two unrelated tasks, using an identical stimulus set. Results show that the network trained on the unrelated tasks shows a decreasing degree of feature representation sharing towards higher-tier layers while the network trained on related tasks uniformly shows high degree of sharing. We conjecture that the method we propose can be used to analyze the anatomical and functional organization of the visual system and beyond. We predict that the degree to which tasks are related is a good descriptor of the degree to which they share downstream cortical-units.",

    "abstract": "Genetic engineering of natural light-gated ion channels has proven a powerful way to generate optogenetic tools for a wide variety of applications. In recent years, blue light-activated engineered anion conducting channelrhodopsins (eACRs) have been developed, improved, and were successfully applied in vivo. We asked whether the approaches used to create eACRs can be transferred to other well-characterized cation-conducting channelrhodopsins (CCRs) to obtain eACRs with a broad spectrum of biophysical properties. We generated 22 variants using two conversion strategies applied to 11 CCRs and screened them for membrane expression, photocurrents and anion selectivity. We obtained two novel eACRs, Phobos and Aurora, with blue-and red-shifted action spectra and photocurrents similar to existing eACRs. Furthermore, step-function mutations greatly enhanced the cellular operational light sensitivity due to a slowed-down photocycle. These bistable eACRs can be reversibly toggled between open and closed states with brief light pulses of different wavelengths. All new eACRs reliably inhibited action potential firing in pyramidal CA1 neurons. In Drosophila larvae, eACRs conveyed robust and specific light-dependent inhibition of locomotion and nociception.",

    "abstract": "Modern scientific discovery depends on collecting large heterogeneous datasets with many sources of variability, and applying domain-specific pipelines from which one can draw insight or clinical utility. For example, macroscale connectomics studies require complex pipelines to process raw functional or diffusion data and estimate connectomes. Individual studies tend to customize pipelines to their needs, raising concerns about their reproducibility, which add to a longer list of factors that may differ across studies and result in failures to replicate (including sampling, experimental design, and data acquisition protocols). Mitigating these issues requires multi-study datasets and the development of pipelines that can be applied across them. We developed NeuroDatas MRI to Graphs (NDMG) pipeline using several functional and diffusion studies, including the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducability, to estimate connectomes. Without any manual intervention or parameter tuning, NDMG ran on 25 different studies ({approx}6,000 scans) from 19 sites, with each scan resulting in a biologically plausible connectome (as assessed by multiple quality assurance metrics at each processing stage). For each study, the connectomes from NDMG are more similar within than across individuals, indicating that NDMG is preserving biological variability. Moreover, the connectomes exhibit near perfect consistency for certain connectional properties across every scan, individual, study, site and modality; these include stronger ipsilateral than contralateral connections and stronger homotopic than heterotopic connections. Yet, the magnitude of the differences varied across individuals and studies--much more so when pooling data across sites, even after controlling for study, site, and basic demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, and ethnicity). This indicates that other experimental variables (possibly those not measured or reported) are contributing to this variability, which if not accounted for can limit the value of aggregate datasets, as well as expectations regarding the accuracy of findings and likelihood of replication. We therefore provide a set of principles to guide the development of pipelines capable of pooling data across studies while maintaining biological variability and minimizing measurement error. This open science approach provides us with an opportunity to understand and eventually mitigate spurious results for both past and future studies.",

While lncRNAs share most molecular properties with mRNAs, they are more likely to be enriched in the nucleus, a feature that is likely to be crucial for function of many lncRNAs, but whose molecular underpinnings remain largely unclear. In order identify elements that can force nuclear localization we screened libraries of short fragments tiled across nuclear RNAs, which were cloned into the untranslated regions of an efficiently exported mRNA. The screen identified a short sequence derived from Alu elements and found in many mRNAs and lncRNAs that increases nuclear accumulation and reduces overall expression levels. Measurements of the contribution of individual bases and short motifs to the element functionality identified a combination of RCCTCCC motifs that are bound by the abundant nuclear protein HNRNPK. Increased HNRNPK binding and C-rich motifs are predictive of substantial nuclear enrichment in both lncRNAs and mRNAs, and this mechanism is conserved across species. Our results thus detail a novel pathway for regulation of RNA accumulation and subcellular localization that has been co-opted to regulate the fate of transcripts that integrated Alu elements.",

    "abstract": "Discovering disease pathways, which can be defined as sets of proteins associated with a given disease, is an important problem that has the potential to provide clinically actionable insights for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Computational methods aid the discovery by relying on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. They start with a few known disease-associated proteins and aim to find the rest of the pathway by exploring the PPI network around the known disease proteins. However, the success of such methods has been limited, and failure cases have not been well understood. Here we study the PPI network structure of 519 disease pathways. We find that 90% of pathways do not correspond to single well-connected components in the PPI network. Instead, proteins associated with a single disease tend to form many separate connected components/regions in the network. We then evaluate state-of-the-art disease pathway discovery methods and show that their performance is especially poor on diseases with disconnected pathways. Thus, we conclude that network connectivity structure alone may not be sufficient for disease pathway discovery. However, we show that higher-order network structures, such as small subgraphs of the pathway, provide a promising direction for the development of new methods.",

    "abstract": "Plants utilize an innate immune system to protect themselves from disease. While many molecular components of plant innate immunity resemble the innate immunity of animals, plants also have evolved a number of truly unique defense mechanisms, particularly at the physiological level. Plants flexible developmental program allows them the unique ability to simply produce new organs as needed, affording them the ability to replace damaged organs. Here we develop a system to study pathogen-triggered leaf abscission in Arabidopsis. Cauline leaves infected with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae abscise as part of the defense mechanism. Pseudomonas syringae lacking a functional type III secretion system fail to elicit an abscission response, suggesting that the abscission response is a novel form of immunity triggered by effectors. HAESA/HAESA-like 2, INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION, and NEVERSHED are all required for pathogen-triggered abscission to occur. Additionally phytoalexin deficient 4, enhanced disease susceptibility 1, salicylic acid induction deficient 2, and senescence-associated gene 101 plants with mutations in genes necessary for bacterial defense and salicylic acid signaling, and NahG transgenic plants with low levels of salicylic acid fail to abscise cauline leaves normally. Bacteria that physically contact abscission zones trigger a strong abscission response; however, long distance signals are also sent from distal infected tissue to the abscission zone, alerting the abscission zone of looming danger. We propose a threshold model regulating cauline leaf defense where minor infections are handled by limiting bacterial growth, but when an infection is deemed out of control, cauline leaves are shed. Together with previous results our findings suggest that salicylic acid may regulate both pathogen- and drought-triggered leaf abscission.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPlants have a flexible development program that determine their form. We describe an organ level defense response in Arabidopsis to bacterial attack where plants simply shed heavily infected leaves. The genetics regulating this defense mechanism are comprised of both classical defense genes and floral organ abscission genes working together. Long distance signals are transmitted from infected areas to abscission zones which activate the abscission receptor. Salicylic acid, a defense hormone, signaling is necessary for cauline leaf abscission.",

    "abstract": "The sequence domains underlying long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) activities, including their characteristic nuclear enrichment, remain largely unknown. It has been proposed that these domains can originate from neofunctionalised fragments of transposable elements (TEs), otherwise known as RIDLs (Repeat Insertion Domains of Long Noncoding RNA), although just a handful have been identified. It is challenging to distinguish functional RIDL instances against a numerous genomic background of neutrally-evolving TEs. We here show evidence that a subset of TE types experience evolutionary selection in the context of lncRNA exons. Together these comprise an enrichment group of 5374 TE fragments in 3566 loci. Their host lncRNAs tend to be functionally validated and associated with disease. This RIDL group was used to explore the relationship between TEs and lncRNA subcellular localisation. Using global localisation data from ten human cell lines, we uncover a dose-dependent relationship between nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution, and evolutionarily-conserved L2b, MIRb and MIRc elements. This is observed in multiple cell types, and is unaffected by confounders of transcript length or expression. Experimental validation with engineered transgenes shows that these TEs drive nuclear enrichment in a natural sequence context. Together these data reveal a role for TEs in regulating the subcellular localisation of lncRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Allosteric regulation - the control of protein function by sites far from the active site - is a common feature of proteins that enables dynamic cellular responses. Reversible modifications such as phosphorylation are well suited to mediate such regulatory dynamics, yet the evolution of new allosteric regulation demands explanation. To understand this, we mutationally scanned the surface of a prototypical kinase to identify readily evolvable phosphorylation sites. The data reveal a set of spatially distributed \\\"hotspots\\\" that coevolve with the active site and preferentially modulate kinase activity. By engineering simple consensus phosphorylation sites at these hotspots we successfully rewired in vivo cell signaling. Beyond synthetic biology, the hotspots are frequently used by the diversity of natural allosteric regulatory mechanisms in the kinase family and exploited in human disease.\\n\\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYCell signaling is easily rewired by introducing new phosphoregulation at latent allosteric surface sites.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms by which different microbes colonize the healthy human gut versus other body sites, the gut in disease states, or other environments remain largely unknown. Identifying microbial genes influencing fitness in the gut could lead to new ways to engineer probiotics or disrupt pathogenesis. We approach this problem by measuring the statistical association between having a species having a gene and the probability that the species is present in the gut microbiome. The challenge is that closely related species tend to be jointly present or absent in the microbiome and also share many genes, only a subset of which are involved in gut adaptation. We show that this phylogenetic correlation indeed leads to many false discoveries and propose phylogenetic linear regression as a powerful solution. To apply this method across the bacterial tree of life, where most species have not been experimentally phenotyped, we use metagenomes from hundreds of people to quantify each species prevalence in and specificity for the gut microbiome. This analysis reveals thousands of genes potentially involved in adaptation to the gut across species, including many novel candidates as well as processes known to contribute to fitness of gut bacteria, such as acid tolerance in Bacteroidetes and sporulation in Firmicutes. We also find microbial genes associated with a preference for the gut over other body sites, which are significantly enriched for genes linked to fitness in an in vivo competition experiment. Finally, we identify gene families associated with higher prevalence in patients with Crohns disease, including Proteobacterial genes involved in conjugation and fimbria regulation, processes previously linked to inflammation. These gene targets may represent new avenues for modulating host colonization and disease. Our strategy of combining metagenomics with phylogenetic modeling is general and can be used to identify genes associated with adaptation to any environment.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWhy do certain microbes and not others colonize our gut, and why do they differ between healthy and sick people? One explanation is the genes in their genomes. If we can find microbial genes involved in gut adaptation, we may be able to keep out pathogens and encourage the growth of beneficial microbes. One could look for genes that were present more often in prevalent microbes, and less often in rare ones.\\n\\nHowever, this ignores that related species are more likely to share an environment and also share many unrelated phenotypes simply because of common ancestry. To solve this problem, we used a method from ecology that accounts for phylogenetic relatedness. We first calculated gut prevalence for thousands of species using a compendium of shotgun sequencing data, then tested for genes associated with prevalence, adjusting for phylogenetic relationships. We found genes that are associated with overall gut prevalence, with a preference for the gut over other body sites, and with the gut in Crohns disease versus health. Many of these findings have biological plausibility based on existing literature. We also showed agreement with the results of a previously published high-throughput screen of bacterial gene knockouts in mice. These results, and this type of analysis, may eventually lead to new strategies for maintaining gut health.",

    "abstract": "The nanomechanical properties of various biological and cellular surfaces are increasingly investigated with Scanning Probe Microscopy. Surface stiffness measurements are currently being used to define metastatic properties of various cancerous cell lines and other related biological tissues. Here we present a unique methodology to understand depth dependent nanomechanical variations in stiffness in biopolymers and live cells. In this study we have used A2780 & NIH3T3 cell lines and 0.5% & 1% Agarose to investigate depth dependent stiffness and porosity on nanomechanical properties in different biological systems. This analytical methodology can circumvent the issue associated with the contribution of substrates on cell stiffness. Here we demonstrate that by calculating  continuous-step-wise-modulus on force vs. distance curves one can observe minute variation as function of depth. Due to the presence of different kinds of cytoskeletal filament, dissipation of contact force might vary from one portion of a cell to another. On NIH3T3 cell lines, stiffness profile of Circular Dorsal Ruffles could be observed in form of large parabolic feature with changes in stiffness at different depth. In biopolymers like agarose, depending upon the extent of polymerization in there can be increase or decrease in stiffness due variations in pore size and extent to which crosslinking is taking place at different depths. 0.5% agarose showed gradual decrease in stiffness whereas with 1% agarose there was slight increase in stiffness as one indents deeper into its surface.",

    "abstract": "Prescribed burns are widely used for managing North American deciduous forests due to their ability to positively affect plant community structure and composition. This study examines the effects of neighboring herbaceous plants on the recruitment of Quercus alba (white oak) seedlings in fire-managed parts of Shawnee National Forest (Illinois, USA). Herbs were clipped to induce plant community stress and relative growth rates (RGRs) of planted white oak seedlings were assessed to determine if a competitive or facilitative dynamic is present. In addition to RGR, we observed the mycorrhizal network via fungal colonization in mesh bags to quantify belowground activity for our experimental plots. Our results supported fires positive effects on tree recruitment and herbaceous growth. Clipping combined with fire management decreased RGR. This finding suggests that a facilitative dynamic is at play and herbaceous neighbors help white oak seedlings persist due to protection from environmental stressors (p = 0.017). Soil moisture played a large role in promoting tree fitness on each of our sites. Lower hyphal biomass was observed in areas where herbs were clipped. We further speculate that the stress caused by clipping may have suspended or eliminated the need for mycorrhizae to form, possibly due to herb mortality. Knowing how herbs and trees interact will lead to purposeful forest community planning especially in fire-managed forests where herbs are likely to dominate post-prescribed burn.",

    "abstract": "The most precious places for conservation are those that make the largest contribution to regional, national or global biodiversity. The two key concepts for determining the contribution of a specific site are Complementarity (the gain in diversity achieved when adding that site to a set of other sites) and Irreplaceability (here defined as the overall complementarity of that site when compared to a range of possible combinations of other sites). Generalised Complementarity Analysis (GCA) is a mathematical framework that provides an exact analytical solution for the expected complementarity (gain in diversity) of a focal site, when added to a set of other sites of a given size (m). Diversity is defined very generally to allow for complementarity to be calculated for species richness, Functional Diversity or Phylogenetic Diversity. The expected irreplaceability of a focal site is then defined in GCA as the area under the curve of expected complementarity values for all possible values of m. GCA is much more computationally efficient than existing algorithmic approaches and is scalable to very large numbers of sites. Because complementarity and irreplaceability are calculated for all possible combinations of sites, GCA serves as a null model for systematic conservation planning algorithms that seek to optimise site selection. However, because truly irreplaceable sites remain so under all possible site selections, GCA is a powerful conservation planning tool in its own right, providing an efficient means of identifying the worlds most precious places for conservation.",
