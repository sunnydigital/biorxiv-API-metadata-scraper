    "abstract": "Mitochondrial FoF1 ATP synthase is a membrane bound molecular machine central to cellular energy conversion and cristae architecture. Recently, a novel domain has been visualized in the intermembrane space region of mammalian ATP synthase. The complete three-dimensional (3D) structure, composition and function of this domain - which we term intermembrane space domain (IMD) - are unknown. Here, we present two distinct 3D structures of monomeric bovine FoF1 ATP synthase by single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that differ by the presence and absence of the IMD. Comparison of both structures reveals the IMD to be a bipartite and weakly associated domain of FoF1 ATP synthase. The tubular sub-domain of the IMD appears to contact the rotor-ring region, its globular sub-domain is anchored in the membrane-bending kink of the ATP synthase. However, absence of the IMD does not impact the kink in the transmembrane region ruling out a functional role in membrane bending. By combining our structural analysis with chemical cross-linking and reported biochemical, genetic and structural data we identify 6.8PL and DAPIT as the subunits forming the intermembrane space domain. We compare the present structure of the mammalian IMD in the bovine FoF1 ATP synthase monomer with structures of dimeric FoF1 ATP synthase from yeast and ciliate showing that the IMD is a common, but structurally divergent feature of several mitochondrial ATP synthases. On the basis of our analysis we discuss potential functions of the novel domain in rotary catalysis, oligomerization and mitochondrial permeability transition.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-based genome editing is an enabling technology with potential to dramatically transform multiple industries. Identification of additional editing tools will be imperative for broad adoption and application of this technology. A novel Type V, Class 2 CRISPR nuclease system was identified from Microgenomates and Smithella bacterial species (CRISPR from Microgenomates and Smithella, Cms1). This system was shown to efficiently generate indel mutations in the major crop plant rice (Oryza sativa). Cms1 are distinct from other Type V nucleases, are smaller than most other CRISPR nucleases, do not require a tracrRNA, and have an AT-rich protospacer-adjacent motif site requirement. A total of four novel Cms1 nucleases across multiple bacterial species were shown to be functional in a eukaryotic system. This is a major expansion of the Type V CRISPR effector protein toolbox and increases the diversity of options available to researchers.",

    "abstract": "Experiments in synthetic biology and microbiology can benefit from protein expression systems with low cell-to-cell variability (noise) and expression levels precisely tunable across a useful dynamic range. Despite advances in understanding the molecular biology of microbial gene regulation, many experiments employ protein-expression systems exhibiting high noise and nearly all-or-none responses to induction. I present an expression system that incorporates elements known to reduce gene expression noise: negative autoregulation and bicistronic transcription. I show by stochastic simulation that while negative autoregulation can produce a more gradual response to induction, bicistronic expression of a repressor and gene of interest can be necessary to reduce noise below the extrinsic limit. I synthesized a plasmid-based system incorporating these principles and studied its properties in Escherichia coli cells, using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy to characterize induction dose-response, induction/repression kinetics and gene expression noise. By varying ribosome binding site strengths, expression levels from 55-- 10,740 molecules/cell were achieved with noise below the extrinsic limit. Individual strains are inducible across a dynamic range greater than 20-fold. Experimental comparison of different regulatory networks confirmed that bicistronic autoregulation reduces noise, and revealed unexpectedly high noise for a conventional expression system with a constitutively expressed transcriptional repressor. I suggest a hybrid, low-noise expression system to increase the dynamic range.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heritable mood disorder characterized by episodes of mania and depression. Although genomewide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified genetic loci contributing to BD risk, sample size has become a rate-limiting obstacle to genetic discovery. Electronic health records (EHRs) represent a vast but relatively untapped resource for high-throughput phenotyping. As part of the International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD), we previously validated automated EHR-based phenotyping algorithms for BD against in-person diagnostic interviews (Castro et al. 2015). Here, we establish the genetic validity of these phenotypes by determining their genetic correlation with traditionally-ascertained samples. Case and control algorithms were derived from structured and narrative text in the Partners Healthcare system comprising more than 4.6 million patients over 20 years. Genomewide genotype data for 3,330 BD cases and 3,952 controls of European ancestry were used to estimate SNP-based heritability (h2g) and genetic correlation(rg) between EHR-based phenotype definitions and traditionally-ascertained BD cases in GWAS by the ICCBD and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) using LD score regression. We evaluated BD cases identified using 4 EHR-based algorithms: an NLP-based algorithm (95-NLP) and 3 rule-based algorithms using codified EHR with decreasing levels of stringency - \\\"coded-strict\\\", \\\"coded-broad\\\", and \\\"coded-broad based on a single clinical encounter\\\" (coded-broad-SV). The analytic sample comprised 862 95-NLP, 1,968 coded-strict, 2,581 coded-broad, 408 coded-broad-SV BD cases, and 3,952 controls. The estimated h2g were 0.24 (p=0.015), 0.09 (p=0.064), 0.13 (p=0.003), 0.00 (p=0.591) for 95-NLP, coded-strict, coded-broad and coded-broad-SV BD, respectively. The h2g for all EHR-based cases combined except coded-broad-SV (excluded due to 0 h2g) was 0.12 (p=0.004). These h2g were lower or similar to the h2g observed by the ICCBD+PGCBD (0.23, p=3.17E-80, total N=33,181). However, the rg between ICCBD+PGCBD and the EHR-based cases were high for 95-NLP (0.66, p=3.69x10-5), coded-strict (1.00, p=2.40x10-4), and coded-broad (0.74, p=8.11x10-7). The rg between EHR-based BDs ranged from 0.90 to 0.98. These results provide the first genetic validation of automated EHR-based phenotyping for BD and suggest that this approach identifies cases that are highly genetically correlated with those ascertained through conventional methods. High throughput phenotyping using the large data resources available in EHRs represents a viable method for accelerating psychiatric genetic research.",

We identify 818,054 indel variants (<50 bp) and 27,622 SVs ([&ge;]50 bp) per human genome. We also discover 156 inversions per genome--most of which previously escaped detection. Fifty-eight of the inversions we discovered intersect with the critical regions of recurrent microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Taken together, our SV callsets represent a sevenfold increase in SV detection compared to most standard high-throughput sequencing studies, including those from the 1000 Genomes Project. The method and the dataset serve as a gold standard for the scientific community and we make specific recommendations for maximizing structural variation sensitivity for future large-scale genome sequencing studies.",

    "abstract": "Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is believed to lack chromatin and histones. Instead, it is coated solely by the transcription factor TFAM, which binds the mtDNA without sequence specificity and packs it into a bacterial-like nucleoid in a dose-dependent fashion. We asked whether mtDNA packaging is more regulated than once thought. As a first step to address this question, we analyzed mtDNA DNase-I-seq experiments in 324 different human cell types and found, for the first time, a pattern of 29 Genomic footprinting (DGF) sites throughout the mtDNA shared by [~]90% of the tested samples. Low SNP density at the DGF sites, and their conservation in mouse DNase-seq experiments, reflect strong selective constraints. Co-localization of the DGFs with known mtDNA regulatory elements and with recently-discovered transcription pausing sites, suggest a role for such DGFs in mtDNA transcription. Altered mtDNA DGF pattern in IL-3 treated CD+34 cells offer first clue to their physiological importance. Taken together, human mtDNA has a conserved and regulated protein-DNA organization, which is likely involved in regulation of mtDNA gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Common scab disease on root and tuber plants is caused by Streptomyces scabies and related species which use the cellulose synthase inhibitor thaxtomin A as main phytotoxin. Thaxtomin production is primarily triggered by the import of cello-oligosaccharides. Once inside the cell, the fate of the cello-oligosaccharides is dichotomized into i) fueling glycolysis with glucose for the saprophytic lifestyle through the action of {beta}-glucosidase(s) (BG), and ii) eliciting the pathogenic lifestyle by inhibiting the CebR-mediated transcriptional repression of thaxtomin biosynthetic genes. Here we investigated the role of scab57721 encoding a putative BG (BglC) in the onset of the pathogenicity of S. scabies. Enzymatic assays showed that BglC was able to release glucose from cellobiose, cellotriose and all other cello-oligosaccharides tested. Its inactivation resulted in a phenotype opposite to what was expected as we monitored reduced production of thaxtomin when the mutant was cultivated on media containing cello-oligosaccharides as unique carbon source. This unexpected phenotype could be attributed to the highly increased activity of alternative intracellular BGs, probably as a compensation of bglC inactivation, which then prevented cellobiose and cellotriose accumulation to reduce the activity of CebR. In contrast, when the bglC null mutant was cultivated on media devoid of cello-oligosaccharides it instead constitutively produced thaxtomin. This observed hypervirulent phenotype does not fit with the proposed model of the cello-oligosaccharide-mediated induction of thaxtomin production and suggests that the role of BglC in the route to the pathogenic lifestyle of S. scabies is more complex than currently presented.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer prognosis and response to endocrine therapy strongly depends on the expression of the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR, respectively). Although much is known about ER gene (ESR1) regulation after hormonal stimulation, how it is regulated in hormone-free condition is not fully understood. We used ER-/PR-positive breast cancer cells to investigate the role of PR in ESR1 regulation in the absence of hormones. We show that PR binds to the low-methylated ESR1 promoter and maintains both gene expression and DNA methylation of the ESR1 locus in hormone-deprived breast cancer cells. Depletion of PR reduces ESR1 expression, with a concomitant increase in gene promoter methylation. The high amount of methylation in the ESR1 promoter of PR-depleted cells persists after the stable re-expression of PR and inhibits PR binding to this genomic region. As a consequence, the rescue of PR expression in PR-depleted cells is insufficient to restore ESR1 expression. Consistently, DNA methylation impedes PR binding to consensus progesterone responsive elements. These findings contribute to understanding the complex crosstalk between PR and ER and suggest that the analysis of ESR1 promoter methylation in breast cancer cells can help to design more appropriate targeted therapies for breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrediction of functional outcome after stroke based on initial presentation remains an open challenge, suggesting that an important aspect is missing from these prediction models. There exists the notion of a protective mechanism called brain reserve, which may be utilized to understand variations in disease outcome. In this work we expand the concept of brain reserve (effective reserve) to improve prediction models of functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke (AIS).\\n\\nMethodsConsecutive AIS patients with acute brain MRI (<48 hours) were eligible for this study. White matter hyperintensity and acute infarct volume were determined on T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion weighted images, respectively. Modified Rankin Scale scores (mRS) were obtained at 90 days post-stroke. Effective reserve (eR) was defined as a latent variable using structural equation modeling by including age, systolic blood pressure, and intracranial volume measurements.\\n\\nResultsOf 453 AIS patients (mean age 66.6{+/-}14.7 years), 36% were male and 311 hypertensive. There was inverse association between eR and 90-day mRS (path coefficient -0.18{+/-}0.01, p<0.01). As compared to a model without eR, correlation between predicted mRS and observed mRS improved in the eR-based model (Spearmans {rho} 0.29{+/-}0.18 versus 0.15{+/-}0.17, p<0.001). Furthermore, hypertensive patients exhibited lower eR (p<10-6).\\n\\nConclusionUsing eR in prediction models of stroke outcome is feasible and leads to better model performance. Furthermore, higher eR is associated with more favorable functional post-stoke outcome and might correspond to an overall better vascular health.",

The costs of suboptimal decisions are clear: resources are wasted and patients may be put at risk. We argue that Bayesian methods provide answers to all of these problems and use hERG-mediated QT prolongation as a case study. Benefits of Bayesian machine learning models include intuitive probabilistic statements of risk that incorporate all sources of uncertainty, the option to include diverse data and external information, and visualisations that have a clear link between the output from a statistical model and what this means for risk. Furthermore, Bayesian methods are easy to use with modern software, making their adoption for safety screening straightforward. We include R and Python code to encourage the adoption of these methods.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCotinine - a nicotine by-product and biomarker of passive perinatal tobacco smoke exposure - is historically considered to lack significant health effects. We challenged this notion and sought \\\"proof-of-concept\\\" evidence of the adverse developmental potential of exposure to this substance at real-life levels.\\n\\nMethodsPregnant C57 mice drank nicotine or cotinine-laced water for 6wks from conception (NPRE = 2% saccharin+100g nicotine/ml; CPRE = 2% saccharin + 10g cotinine/ml) or for 3wks after birth (CPOST = 2% saccharin + 30g cotinine/ml). Controls drank 2% saccharin (CTRL). At 17{+/-}1weeks male pups (CTRL n=6; CPOST n=6; CPRE n=8; NPRE n=9) were instrumented for EEG and blood pressure (BP) telemetry. We evaluated (i) cardiovascular control during sleep (at rest / during stress); (ii) arterial reactivity ex vivo; (iii) expression of genes involved in arterial constriction/dilation.\\n\\nResultsBlood cotinine levels (ELISA) recapitulated passive smoker mothers-infants. Pups exposed only to cotinine exhibited (i) mild bradycardia - hypotension at rest (p<0.001); (ii) attenuated (CPRE, p<0.0001) or reverse (CPOST; p<0.0001) BP reactivity to asphyxia; (iii) pronounced adrenergic hypo-contractility (p<0.0003), low Protein Kinase C (p<0.001) and elevated adrenergic receptor mRNA (p<0.05) (all drug-treated arteries). NPRE pups also exhibited endothelium-mediated dysfunction.\\n\\nConclusionsCotinine has subtle, enduring developmental consequences. Some cardiovascular effects of nicotine can plausibly arise via conversion to cotinine. Low-level exposure to this metabolite may pose unrecognized perinatal risks. Adults must avoid inadvertently exposing a fetus or infant to cotinine as well as nicotine.",

    "abstract": "Viral diseases are a leading cause of worldwide yield losses in crop production. Breeding of resistance genes (R gene) into elite crop cultivars has been the standard and most cost-effective practice. However, R gene-mediated resistance is limited by the available R genes within genetic resources and in many cases, by strain specificity. Therefore, it is important to generate new and broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. The CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat, CRISPR-associated) editing system has been employed to confer resistance to human viruses and several plant single-stranded DNA geminiviruses, pointing out the possible application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for virus control. Here we demonstrate that strong viral resistance to cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), a pararetrovirus with a double-stranded DNA genome, can be achieved through Cas9-mediated multiplex targeting of the viral coat protein sequence. We further show that small interfering RNAs (siRNA) are produced and mostly map to the 3' end of guide RNAs (gRNA), although very low levels of siRNAs map to the spacer region as well. However, these siRNAs are not responsible for the inhibited CaMV infection because there is no resistance if Cas9 is not present. We have also observed edited viruses in systematically infected leaves in some transgenic plants, with short deletions or insertions consistent with Cas9-induced DNA breaks at the gRNA target sites in coat protein coding sequence. These edited coat proteins, in most cases, led to earlier translation stop and thus, non-functional coat proteins. We also recovered wild-type CP sequence in these infected transgenic plants, suggesting these edited viral genomes were packaged by wild-type coat proteins. Our data demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used for virus control against plant pararetroviruses with further modifications.",

Using figure codes as anchors, we linked evidence fragments to INTACT data records as an example of distant supervision so that we could use INTACTs preexisting, manually-curated structured interaction data to act as a gold standard for machine reading experiments. We report preliminary baseline event extraction measures from this collection based on a publicly available, machine reading system (REACH).

    "abstract": "For many bacteria with sequenced genomes, we do not understand how they synthesize some amino acids. This makes it challenging to reconstruct their metabolism, and has led to speculation that bacteria might be cross-feeding amino acids. We studied heterotrophic bacteria from 10 different genera that grow without added amino acids even though an automated tool predicts that the bacteria have gaps in their amino acid synthesis pathways. Across these bacteria, there were 11 gaps in their amino acid biosynthesis pathways that we could not fill using current knowledge. Using genome-wide mutant fitness data, we identified novel enzymes that fill 9 of the 11 gaps and hence explain the biosynthesis of methionine, threonine, serine, or histidine by bacteria from six genera. We also found that the sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris synthesizes homocysteine (which is a precursor to methionine) by using DUF39, NIL/ferredoxin, and COG2122 proteins, and that homoserine is not an intermediate in this pathway. Our results suggest that most free-living bacteria can likely make all 20 amino acids and illustrate how high-throughput genetics can uncover previously-unknown amino acid biosynthesis genes.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation in immune responses during pregnancy increase the risk of a having a child with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases among pregnant women, and symptoms often worsen during pregnancy. We recently developed a mouse model of maternal allergic asthma (MAA) that induces changes in sociability, repetitive and perseverative behaviors in the offspring. Since epigenetic changes help a static genome adapt to the maternal environment, activation of the immune system may epigenetically alter fetal microglia, the brains resident immune cells. We therefore tested the hypothesis that epigenomic alterations to microglia may be involved in behavioral abnormalities observed in MAA offspring. We used the genome-wide approaches of whole genome bisulfite sequencing to examine DNA methylation and RNA sequencing to examine gene expression in microglia from juvenile MAA offspring. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were enriched for immune signaling pathways and important microglial developmental transcription factor binding motifs. Differential expression analysis identified genes involved in controlling microglial sensitivity to the environment and shaping neuronal connections in the developing brain. Differentially expressed associated genes significantly overlapped genes with altered expression in human ASD cortex, supporting a role for microglia in the pathogenesis of ASD.\\n\\nMain PointsMaternal allergic asthma induces changes in DNA methylation and transcription in juvenile offspring microglia\\n\\nDifferentially methylated regions are enriched for functions and transcription factor binding motifs involved in inflammation and microglial development\\n\\nDifferentially expressed genes and differentially methylated regions are enriched for genes dysregulated in Autism Spectrum Disorders",
