    "abstract": "The effects of k-space sampling and signal decay on the effective spatial resolution of MRI and functional MRI (fMRI) are commonly assessed by means of the magnitude point-spread function (PSF), defined as the absolute values (magnitudes) of the complex MR imaging PSF. It is commonly assumed that this magnitude PSF signifies blurring, which can be quantified by its full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). Here we show that the magnitude PSF fails to accurately represent the true effects of k-space sampling and signal decay.\\n\\nFirstly, a substantial part of the width of the magnitude PSF is due to MRI sampling per se. This part is independent of any signal decay and its effect depends on the spatial frequency composition of the imaged object. Therefore, it cannot always be expected to introduce blurring. Secondly, MRI reconstruction is typically followed by taking the absolute values (magnitude image) of the reconstructed complex image. This introduces a non-linear stage into the process of image formation. The complex imaging PSF does not fully describe this process, since it does not reflect the stage of taking the magnitude image. Its corresponding magnitude PSF fails to correctly describe this process, since convolving the original pattern with the magnitude PSF is different from the true process of taking the absolute following a convolution with the complex imaging PSF. Lastly, signal decay can have not only a blurring, but also a high-pass filtering effect. This cannot be reflected by the strictly positive width of the magnitude PSF.\\n\\nAs an alternative, we propose to first approximate the MRI process linearly. We then model the linear approximation by decomposing it into a signal decay-independent MR sampling part and an approximation of the signal decay effect. We approximate the latter as a convolution with a Gaussian PSF or, if the effect is that of high-pass filtering, as reversing the effect of a convolution with a Gaussian PSF. We show that for typical high-resolution fMRI at 7 Tesla, signal decay in Spin-Echo has a moderate blurring effect (FWHM = 0.89 voxels, corresponds to 0.44 mm for 0.5 mm wide voxels). In contrast, Gradient-Echo acts as a moderate high-pass filter that can be interpreted as reversing a Gaussian blurring with FWHM = 0.59 voxels (0.30 mm for 0.5 mm wide voxels). Our improved approximations and findings hold not only for Gradient-Echo and Spin-Echo fMRI but also for GRASE and VASO fMRI. Our findings support the correct planning, interpretation, and modeling of high-resolution fMRI.",

    "abstract": "The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia suppresses the capacity for arboviral transmission in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, and can spread through wild mosquito populations following local introductions. Recent introductions in Cairns, Australia have demonstrated slower than expected spread, that could be due to: i) barriers to Ae. aegypti dispersal; ii) leptokurtically distributed dispersal distances; and iii) intergenerational loss of Wolbachia. We investigated these three potential causes using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and an assay for the Wolbachia infection wMel in 161 Ae. aegypti collected from Cairns in 2015. We observed a significant barrier effect of Cairns highways on Ae. aegypti dispersal using distance-based redundancy analysis and patch-based simulation analysis. We detected putative full-siblings in ovitraps 1312m apart, suggesting long-distance female movement likely mediated by human transport. Finally, we found a pair of full-siblings of different infection status, suggesting loss of Wolbachia in the field. While the long-distance movement and Wolbachia loss currently represent single observations, these findings together with the identified dispersal barriers can contribute to the slow spread of Wolbachia through the Ae. aegypti population in Cairns. Our landscape genomics approach can be extended to other host/symbiont systems that are being considered for biocontrol.",

    "abstract": "The order Hymenochaetales of white rot fungi contain some of the most aggressive wood decayers causing tree deaths around the world. Despite their ecological importance and the impact of diseases they cause, little is known about the evolution and transmission patterns of these pathogens. Here, we sequenced and undertook comparative genomics analyses of Hymenochaetales genomes using brown root rot fungus Phellinus noxius, wood-decomposing fungus Phellinus lamaensis, laminated root rot fungus Phellinus sulphurascens, and trunk pathogen Porodaedalea pini. Many gene families of lignin-degrading enzymes were identified from these fungi, reflecting their ability as white rot fungi. Comparing against distant fungi highlighted the expansion of 1,3-beta-glucan synthases in P. noxius, which may account for its fast-growing attribute. We identified 13 linkage groups conserved within Agaricomycetes, suggesting the evolution of stable karyotypes. We determined that P. noxius has a bipolar heterothallic mating system, with unusual highly expanded ~60 kb A locus as a result of accumulating gene transposition. We investigated the population genomics of 60 P. noxius isolates across multiple islands of the Asia Pacific region. Whole-genome sequencing showed this multinucleate species contains abundant poly-allelic single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) with atypical allele frequencies. Different patterns of intra-isolate polymorphism reflect mono-/heterokaryotic states which are both prevalent in nature. We have shown two genetically separated lineages with one spanning across many islands despite the geographical barriers. Both populations possess extraordinary genetic diversity and show contrasting evolutionary scenarios. These results provide a framework to further investigate the genetic basis underlying the fitness and virulence of white rot fungi.",

    "abstract": "Microbial diversity on earth is extraordinary, and soils alone harbor thousands of species per gram of soil. Understanding how this diversity is sorted and selected into habitat niches is a major focus of ecology and biotechnology, but remains only vaguely understood. A systems-biology approach was used to mine information from databases to show how it can be used to answer questions related to the core microbiome of habitat-microbe relationships. By making use of the burgeoning growth of information from databases, our tool \\\"COREMIC\\\" meets a great need in the search for understanding niche partitioning and habitat-function relationships. The work is unique, furthermore, because it provides a user-friendly statistically robust web-tool (http://coremic2.appspot.com), developed using Google App Engine, to help in the process of database mining to identify the \\\"core microbiome\\\" associated with a given habitat. A case study is presented using data from 31 switchgrass rhizosphere community habitats across a diverse set of soil and sampling environments. The methodology utilizes an outgroup of 28 non-switchgrass (other grasses and forbs) to identify a core switchgrass microbiome. Even across a diverse set of soils (5 environments), and conservative statistical criteria (presence in more than 90% samples and FDR q-val < 0.05% for Fishers exact test) a core set of bacteria associated with switchgrass was observed. These included, among others, closely related taxa from Lysobacter spp., Mesorhizobium spp, and Chitinophagaceae. These bacteria have been shown to have functions related to the production of bacterial and fungal antibiotics and plant growth promotion. COREMIC can be used as a hypothesis generating or confirmatory tool that shows great potential for identifying taxa that may be important to the functioning of a habitat (e.g. host plant). The case study, in conclusion, shows that COREMIC can identify key habitat-specific microbes across diverse samples, using currently available databases and a unique freely available software.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms initiating a branching process that can lead to new species are broadly classified as chromosomal and genic. Chromosomal mechanisms are supported by breeding studies involving exchanges of individual chromosomes or their segments between mouse subspecies. There are also studies of the rapidly mutating mouse PR/SET-domain 9 (prdm9) gene, which encodes PRDM9, a protein targeting DNA recombination hotspots. When PRDM9 is bound symmetrically with equal strength, the meiotic repair of mutations in one parental strand, based on information on the allelic strand (conversion), would seem to be unbiased in discriminating between strands. So mismatches detected between pairing paternal and maternal DNA strands (heteroduplexes) undergo unbiased conversions (to homoduplexes). This leaves uncertainty on whether a mutation has been corrected or compounded. However, it has been hypothesized that tagging of mismatch regions, so that both strands are epigenetically marked as uncertain, would make it possible over numerous generations for mutations to be corrected (biased conversions) whenever asymmetry is detected. Thus, variation would decrease and members of a species would remain within its bounds. Intriguingly, new experimental studies show that, when chromosomally interpreted, PRDM9 also works through asymmetrical epigenetic labelling to confine members to species bounds. To the extent that the experimentally observed and hypothetical anti-speciation asymmetries can be related, chromosomal mechanisms are further supported.",

    "abstract": "The progress of cancer genome sequencing projects yields unprecedented information of mutations for numerous patients. However, the complexity of mutation profiles of patients hinders the further understanding of mechanisms of oncogenesis. One basic question is how to uncover mutations with functional impacts. In this work, we introduce a computational method to predict functional somatic mutations for each of patient by integrating mutation recurrence with similarity of expression profiles of patients. With this method, the functional mutations are determined by checking the mutation enrichment among a group of patients with similar expression profiles. We applied this method to three cancer types and identified the functional mutations. Comparison of the predictions for three cancer types suggested that most of the functional mutations were cancer-type-specific with one exception to p53. By checking prediction results, we found that our method effectively filtered non-functional mutations resulting from large protein sizes. In addition, this methods can also perform functional annotation to each patient to describe their association with signalling pathways or biological processes. In breast cancer, we predicted \\\"cell adhesion\\\" and other mutated gene associated terms to be significantly enriched among patients.",

    "abstract": "Head Direction cells form an internal compass that signals head azimuth orientation even in the absence of visual landmarks. It is well accepted that head direction properties are generated through a ring attractor that is updated using rotation self-motion cues. The properties and origin of this self-motion velocity drive remain, however, unknown. We propose a unified, quantitative framework whereby the attractor velocity input represents a multisensory self-motion estimate computed through an internal model that uses sensory prediction error based on vestibular, visual, and somatosensory cues to improve on-line motor drive. We show how context-dependent strength of recurrent connections within the attractor itself, rather than the self-motion input, explain differences in head direction cell firing between free foraging and restrained movements. We also summarize recent findings on how head tilt relative to gravity influences the azimuth coding of head direction cells, and explain why and how these effects reflect an updating self-motion velocity drive that is not purely egocentric. Finally, we highlight recent findings that the internal compass may be three-dimensional and hypothesize that the additional vertical degrees of freedom are defined based on global allocentric gravity cues.",

    "abstract": "It is often unavoidable to combine data from different sequencing centers or sequencing platforms when compiling datasets with a large number of individuals. However, the different data are likely to contain specific systematic errors that will appear as SNPs. Here, we devise a method to detect systematic errors in combined datasets. To measure quality differences between individual genomes, we study pairs of variants that reside on different chromosomes and co-occur in individuals. The abundance of these pairs of variants in different genomes is then used to detect systematic errors due to batch effects. Applying our method to the 1000 Genomes dataset, we find that coding regions are enriched for errors, where about 1% of the higher-frequency variants are predicted to be erroneous, whereas errors outside of coding regions are much rarer (<0.001%). As expected, predicted errors are less often found than other variants in a dataset that was generated with a different sequencing technology, indicating that many of the candidates are indeed errors. However, predicted 1000 Genomes errors are also found in other large datasets; our observation is thus not specific to the 1000 Genomes dataset. Our results show that batch effects can be turned into a virtue by using the resulting variation in large scale datasets to detect systematic errors.",

Despite widespread use of cisplatin in cancer treatment and its role in contributing to secondary malignancies, its mutational signature has not been delineated. We hypothesize that cisplatins mutational signature can serve as a biomarker to identify cisplatin mutagenesis in suspected secondary malignancies. Knowledge of which tissues are at risk of developing cisplatin-induced secondary malignancies could lead to guidelines for non-invasive monitoring for secondary malignancies after cisplatin chemotherapy.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed whole genome sequencing of 10 independent clones of cisplatin-exposed MCF-10A and HepG2 cells, and delineated the patterns of single- and dinucleotide mutations in terms of flanking sequence, transcription strand bias, and other characteristics. We used the mSigAct signature presence test and non-negative matrix factorization to search for cisplatin mutagenesis in hepatocellular carcinomas and esophageal adenocarcinomas.\\n\\nResultsAll clones showed highly consistent patterns of single- and dinucleotide substitutions. The proportion of dinucleotide substitutions was high: 8.1% of single nucleotide substitutions were part of dinucleotide substitutions, presumably due to cisplatins propensity to form intra-and inter-strand crosslinks between purine bases in DNA. We identified likely cisplatin exposure in 9 hepatocellular carcinomas and 3 esophageal adenocarcinomas. All hepatocellular carcinomas for which clinical data were available and all esophageal cancers indeed had histories of cisplatin treatment.\\n\\nConclusionsWe experimentally delineated the single- and dinucleotide mutational signature of cisplatin.

    "abstract": "Several bacterial and archaeal lineages produce nanostructures that morphologically resemble small tailed viruses, but, unlike most viruses, contain apparently random pieces of the host genome. Since these elements can deliver the packaged DNA to other cells, they were dubbed Gene Transfer Agents (GTAs). Because many genes involved in GTA production have viral homologs, it has been hypothesized that the GTA ancestor was a virus. Whether GTAs represent an atypical virus, a defective virus, or a virus co-opted by the prokaryotes for some function, remains to be elucidated. To evaluate these possibilities, we examined the distribution and evolutionary histories of genes that encode a GTA in the -proteobacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus (RcGTA). We report that although homologs of many individual RcGTA genes are abundant across bacteria and their viruses, RcGTA-like genomes are mainly found in one subclade of -proteobacteria. When compared to the viral homologs, genes of the RcGTA-like genomes evolve significantly slower, and do not have higher %A+T nucleotides than their host chromosomes. Moreover, they appear to reside in stable regions of the bacterial chromosomes that are generally conserved across taxonomic orders. These findings argue against RcGTA being an atypical or a defective virus. Our phylogenetic analyses suggest that RcGTA ancestor likely originated in the lineage that gave rise to contemporary -proteobacterial orders Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales, Caulobacterales, Parvularculales, and Sphingomonadales, and since that time the RcGTA-like element has co-evolved with its host chromosomes. Such evolutionary history is compatible with maintenance of these elements by bacteria due to some selective advantage. As for many other prokaryotic traits, horizontal gene transfer played a substantial role in the evolution of RcGTA-like elements, not only in shaping its genome components within the orders, but also in occasional dissemination of RcGTA-like regions across the orders and even to different bacterial phyla.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that mitochondrial genomes harboring common mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms might have functional difference and could be associated with common complex human diseases such as metabolic syndrome and cancer that are related to mitochondrial dysfunction. However, there has been no report examining the functional difference of mitochondrial genome in the pathogenesis of such diseases at the cellular or molecular level. In order to examine the effect of mitochondrial genome on metabolic syndrome or cancer without interference from nuclear genes, we analyzed trans-mitochondrial cytoplasmic hybrid cells (cybrids) with common Asian mtDNA haplogroups A, B, D, and F from healthy volunteers. The mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates of cybrids were associated with multiple components of metabolic syndrome such as body mass index, waist circumference, serum triglyceride levels and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In addition, the cybrids showed varying degree of tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo. Especially, the cybrids harboring mtDNA haplogroup D had a significantly slower growth rate. These findings suggest that the phenotypes of common complex diseases in humans can be determined by their mitochondrial genomes. Therefore, not only nuclear genome but also mitochondrial genome should be considered in explaining the genetic pathogenesis of common complex human diseases.",

    "abstract": "The perceptual upright is thought to be constructed by the central nervous system (CNS) as a vector sum; by combining estimates on the upright provided by the visual system and the bodys inertial sensors with prior knowledge that the upright is usually above the head. Results from a number of recent studies furthermore show that the weighting of the respective sensory signals is proportional to their reliability, consistent with a Bayesian interpretation of the idea of a vector sum (Forced Fusion, FF). However, findings from a study conducted in partial gravity suggest that the CNS may rely on a single sensory system (Cue Capture, CC), or choose to process sensory signals differently based on inferred signal causality (Causal Inference, CI). We developed a novel Alternative-Reality system to manipulate visual and physical tilt independently, and tasked participants (n=28) to indicate the perceived upright for various (in-)congruent combinations of visual-inertial stimuli. Overall, the data appear best explained by the FF model. However, an evaluation of individual data reveals considerable variability, favoring different models in about equal proportions of participants (FF, n=12; CI, n=7, CC, n=9). Given the observed variability, we conclude that the notion of a vector sum does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the perception of the upright.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a fully automated lung CT cancer diagnosis system, DeepLung. DeepLung contains two parts, nodule detection and classification. Considering the 3D nature of lung CT data, two 3D networks are designed for the nodule detection and classification respectively. Specifically, a 3D Faster R-CNN is designed for nodule detection with a U-net-like encoder-decoder structure to effectively learn nodule features. For nodule classification, gradient boosting machine (GBM) with 3D dual path network (DPN) features is proposed. The nodule classification subnetwork is validated on a public dataset from LIDC-IDRI, on which it achieves better performance than state-of-the-art approaches, and surpasses the average performance of four experienced doctors. For the DeepLung system, candidate nodules are detected first by the nodule detection subnetwork, and nodule diagnosis is conducted by the classification subnetwork. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the DeepLung is comparable to the experienced doctors both for the nodule-level and patient-level diagnosis on the LIDC-IDRI dataset.",

    "abstract": "Conventional models of genome evolution generally include the assumption that mutations accumulate gradually and independently over time. We characterized the occurrence of sudden spikes in the accumulation of genome-wide loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting the existence of a mitotic systemic genomic instability process (mitSGI). We characterized the emergence of a rough colony morphology phenotype resulting from an LOH event spanning a specific locus (ACE2/ace2-A7). Surprisingly, half of the clones analyzed also carried unselected secondary LOH tracts elsewhere in their genomes. The number of secondary LOH tracts detected was 20-fold higher than expected assuming independence between mutational events. Secondary LOH tracts were not detected in control clones without a primary selected LOH event. We then measured the rates of single and double LOH at different chromosome pairs and found that coincident LOH accumulated at rates 30-100 fold higher than expected if the two underlying single LOH events occurred independently. These results were consistent between two different strain backgrounds, and in mutant strains incapable of entering meiosis. Our results indicate that a subset of mitotic cells within a population experience systemic genomic instability episodes, resulting in multiple chromosomal rearrangements over one or few generations. They are reminiscent of early reports from the classic yeast genetics literature, as well as recent studies in humans, both in the cancer and genomic disorder contexts, all of which challenge the idea of gradual accumulation of structural genomic variation. Our experimental approach provides a model to further dissect the fundamental mechanisms responsible for mitSGI.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTPoint mutations and alterations in chromosome structure are generally thought to accumulate gradually and independently over many generations. Here, we combined complementary genetic approaches in budding yeast to track the appearance of chromosomal changes resulting in loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). Contrary to expectations, our results provided evidence for the occurrence of non-independent accumulation of multiple LOH events over one or a few cell generations. These results are analogous to recent reports of bursts of chromosomal instability in humans. Our experimental approach provides a framework to further dissect the fundamental mechanisms underlying systemic chromosomal instability processes, including in the human cancer and genomic disorder contexts.",

However, the paradigms are built upon fundamentally different (and seemingly opposing) models of perceptual learning; namely, Predictive Coding (MMN) and Hebbian plasticity (LTP). The aims of the current study were to 1) compare the generative mechanisms of the MMN and visual LTP, therefore assessing whether Predictive Coding and Hebbian mechanisms co-occur in the brain, and 2) assess whether the paradigms identify similar group differences in plasticity. Forty participants were split into two groups based on the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and were presented with both paradigms. Consistent with Predictive Coding and Hebbian predictions, Dynamic Causal Modelling revealed that the generation of the MMN modulates forward and backward connections in the underlying network, while visual LTP only modulates forward connections. Genetic differences were identified in the ERPs for both paradigms, but were only apparent in backward connections of the MMN network. These results suggest that both Predictive Coding and Hebbian mechanisms are utilized by the brain under different task demands. Additionally, both tasks provide unique insight into plasticity mechanisms, which has important implications for future studies of aberrant plasticity in clinical populations.",

    "abstract": "The behavioral effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) can change qualitatively when stimulation is preceded by initial state manipulations such as priming or adaptation. In addition, baseline performance level of the participant has been shown to play a role in modulating the impact of TMS. Here we examined the link between these two. This was done using data from a previous study using a TMS-priming paradigm, in which, at group level, TMS selectively facilitated targets incongruent with the prime while having no statistically significant effects on other prime-target congruencies. Correlation and linear mixed-effects analyses indicated that, for all prime-target congruencies, a significant linear relationship between baseline performance and the magnitude of the induced TMS effect was present: low levels of baseline performance were associated with TMS-induced facilitations and high baseline performance with impairments. Thus as performance level increased, TMS effects turned from facilitation to impairment. The key finding was that priming shifted the transition from facilitatory to disruptive effects for targets incongruent with the prime, such that TMS-induced facilitations were obtained until a higher level of performance than for other prime-target congruencies. Given that brain state manipulations such as priming operate via modulations of neural excitability, this result is consistent with the view that neural excitability, coupled with nonlinear neural effects, underlie behavioral effects of TMS.",

    "abstract": "The development of chemotherapeutic resistance resulting in tumor relapse is largely the consequence of the mechanism of competitive release of pre-existing resistant tumor cells selected for regrowth after chemotherapeutic agents attack the previously dominant chemo-sensitive population. We introduce a prisoners dilemma mathematical model based on the replicator of three competing cell populations: healthy (cooperators), sensitive (defectors), and resistant (defectors) cells. The model is shown to recapitulate prostate-specific antigen measurement data from three clinical trials for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with 1) prednisone, 2) mitoxantrone and prednisone and 3) docetaxel and prednisone. Continuous maximum tolerated dose schedules reduce the sensitive cell population, initially shrinking tumor volume, but subsequently \\\"release\\\" the resistant cells to re-populate and re-grow the tumor in a resistant form. Importantly, a model fit of prostate data shows the emergence of a positive fitness cost associated with a majority of patients for each drug, without predetermining a cost in the model a priori. While the specific mechanism associated with this cost may be very different for each of the drugs, a measurable fitness cost emerges in each. The evolutionary model allows us to quantify responses to conventional therapeutic strategies as well as to design adaptive strategies.",

Genome mapping has revealed the functional units of chromatin at the sub-megabase scale as self-interacting regions called topologically associating domains (TADs) and showed they correspond to replication domains (RDs). A quantitative structural and dynamic description of RD behavior in the nucleus is however missing, as visualization of dynamic subdiffraction-sized RDs remains challenging. Using fluorescence labeling of RDs combined with correlative live and super-resolution microscopy in situ, we determined biophysical parameters to characterize the internal organization, spacing and mechanical coupling of RDs. We found that RDs are typically 150 nm in size and contain four co-replicating regions spaced 60 nm apart. Spatially neighboring RDs are spaced 300 nm apart and connected by highly flexible linker regions that couple their motion only below 550 nm. Our pipeline allows a robust quantitative characterization of chromosome structure in situ, and provides important biophysical parameters to understand general principles of chromatin organization.",

We show that E13.5 Pdgfra+ populations are not OPCs, exhibiting instead hallmarks of neural progenitors. A subset of these progenitors, which we refer as pre-OPCs, rewires their transcriptional landscape, converging into indistinguishable OPC states at E17.5 and post-natal stages. P7 brain and spinal cord OPCs present similar transcriptional profiles at the single-cell level, indicating that OPC states are not region-specific. Postnatal OPC progeny of E13.5 Pdgfra+ have electrophysiological and transcriptional profiles similar to OPCs derived from subsequent specification waves. In addition, lineage tracing indicates that a subset of E13.5 Pdgfra+ cells also originate cells of the pericyte lineage. In summary, our results indicate that embryonic Pdgfra+ cells are diverse and give rise at post-natal stages to distinct cell lineages, including OPCs with convergent transcriptional profiles in different CNS regions.",
