    "abstract": "Paleochronic reversion (an atavism) in Psophocarpus presents a basic floral phylloid ground state. That ground state can quickly change as permutation transformation (Tx) begins. The form of permutation can vary as phyllotactic phylloid (TPhyld) and/or floral axial decompression (TAxl) presenting linear elongation (TLong), rotational (TRtn) and/or lateral (TLat) components. Research with 70 reverted floral specimens documented varying degrees of phyllotactic permutation at the bracts (Bt) region and inter-bracts (IBS) sub-region of the pre-whorls pedicel-bracts anatomic zone. Permutation further yielded an inter-zonal pericladial stalk (PCL). It continued at the floral whorls zone: the calyx (Cl), corolla (Crla), androecium (Andr), and gynoecium (Gynec) with components therein. These organ regions present a continuum as an axial dynamic vector space {pound}Taxi of floral permutation dominated by axial expansion (AE) so that an anatomic sequence of permutation activity runs from the bracts (Bt) region to the carpel (Crpl) inclusive with components therein, summarized by the formula:\\n\\n [Formula]stamen fltn [Formula] Andr spiral [Formula] Crpl {+/-}(Crpl web {+/-} VASCARP {+/-} Crpl diadn {+/-} Crpl fltn {+/-} [fltn no] {+/-} Crpl Rtn) = Tx.

    "abstract": "Analysis of de novo mutations (DNMs) from sequencing data of nuclear families has identified risk genes for many complex diseases, including multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Most of these efforts have focused on mutations in protein-coding sequences. Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) strongly suggests that variants important to human diseases often lie in non-coding regions. Extending DNM-based approaches to non-coding sequences is, however, challenging because the functional significance of non-coding mutations is difficult to predict. We propose a new statistical framework for analyzing DNMs from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. This method, TADA-Annotations (TADA-A), is a major advance of the TADA method we developed earlier for DNM analysis in coding regions. TADA-A is able to incorporate many functional annotations such as conservation and enhancer marks, learn from data which annotations are informative of pathogenic mutations and combine both coding and non-coding mutations at the gene level to detect risk genes. It also supports meta-analysis of multiple DNM studies, while adjusting for study-specific technical effects. We applied TADA-A to WGS data of [~]300 autism family trios across five studies, and discovered several new autism risk genes. The software is freely available for all research uses.",

    "abstract": "The perceived effort level of an action shapes everyday decisions. Despite the importance of these perceptions for decision-making, the behavioral and neural representations of the subjective cost of effort are not well understood. While a number of studies have implicated anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in decisions about effort/reward trade-offs, none have experimentally isolated effort valuation from reward and choice difficulty, a function that is commonly ascribed to this region. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor brain activity while human participants engaged in uncertain choices for prospective physical effort. Our task was designed to examine effort-based decision making in the absence of reward and separated from choice difficulty - allowing us to investigate the brains role in effort valuation, independent of these other factors. Participants exhibited subjectivity in their decision-making, displaying increased sensitivity to changes in subjective effort as objective effort levels increased. Analysis of blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activity revealed that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) encoded the subjective valuation of prospective effort and ACC encoded choice difficulty. These results provide insight into the processes responsible for decision-making regarding effort, dissociating the roles of vmPFC and ACC in prospective valuation of effort and choice difficulty.",

    "abstract": "In Arabidopsis, development during flowering is coordinated by transport of the hormone auxin mediated by polar-localized PIN-FORMED1 (AtPIN1). However Arabidopsis has lost a PIN clade sister to AtPIN1, Sister-of-PIN1 (SoPIN1), which is conserved in flowering plants. We previously proposed that the AtPIN1 organ initiation and vein patterning functions are split between the SoPIN1 and PIN1 clades in grasses. Here we show that in the grass Brachypodium sopin1 mutants have organ initiation defects similar to Arabidopsis atpin1, while loss of PIN1 function in Brachypodium has little effect on organ initiation but alters stem growth. Heterologous expression of Brachypodium SoPIN1 and PIN1b in Arabidopsis provides further evidence of functional specificity. SoPIN1 but not PIN1b can mediate flower formation in null atpin1 mutants, although both can complement a missense allele. The behavior of SoPIN1 and PIN1b in Arabidopsis illustrates how membrane and tissue-level accumulation, transport activity, and interaction contribute to PIN functional specificity.",

    "abstract": "Diverse subsets of cortical interneurons play a particularly important role in the stability of the neural circuits underlying cognitive and higher order brain functions, yet our understanding of how this diversity is generated is far from complete. We applied massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq to profile a developmental time course of interneuron development, measuring the transcriptomes of over 60,000 progenitors during their maturation in the ganglionic eminences and embryonic migration into the cortex. While diversity within mitotic progenitors is largely driven by cell cycle and differentiation state, we observed sparse eminence-specific transcription factor expression, which seeds the emergence of later cell diversity. Upon becoming postmitotic, cells from all eminences pass through one of three precursor states, one of which represents a cortical interneuron ground state. By integrating datasets across developmental timepoints, we identified transcriptomic heterogeneity in interneuron precursors representing the emergence of four cardinal classes (Pvalb, Sst, Id2 and Vip), which further separate into subtypes at different timepoints during development. Our analysis revealed that the ASD-associated transcription factor Mef2c discriminates early Pvalb-precursors in E13.5 cells, and removal of Mef2c confirms its essential role for Pvalb interneuron development. These findings shed new light on the molecular diversification of early inhibitory precursors, and suggest gene modules that may link developmental specification with the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "It has long been suspected that the rate of mutation varies across the human genome at a large scale based on the divergence between humans and other species. It is now possible to directly investigate this question using the large number of de novo mutations (DNMs) that have been discovered in humans through the sequencing of trios. We show that there is variation in the mutation rate at the 100KB, 1MB and 10MB scale that cannot be explained by variation at smaller scales, however the level of this variation is modest at large scales - at the 1MB scale we infer that ~90% of regions have a mutation rate within 50% of the mean. Different types of mutation show similar levels of variation and appear to vary in concert which suggests the pattern of mutation is relatively constant across the genome and hence unlikely to generate variation in GC-content. We confirm this using two different analyses. We find that genomic features explain less than 50% of the explainable variance in the rate of DNM. As expected the rate of divergence between species and the level of diversity within humans are correlated to the rate of DNM. However, the correlations are weaker than if all the variation in divergence was due to variation in the mutation rate. We provide evidence that this is due the effect of biased gene conversion on the probability that a mutation will become fixed. We find no evidence that linked selection affects the relationship between divergence and DNM density. In contrast to divergence, we find that most of the variation in diversity can be explained by variation in the mutation rate. Finally, we show that the correlation between divergence and DNM density declines as increasingly divergent species are considered.\\n\\nAuthor summaryUsing a dataset of 40,000 de novo mutations we show that there is large-scale variation in the mutation rate at the 100KB and 1MB scale. We show that different types of mutation vary in concert and in a manner that is not expected to generate variation in base composition; hence mutation bias is not responsible for the large-scale variation in base composition that is observed across human chromosomes. As expected large-scale variation in the rate of divergence between species and the variation within species across the genome, are correlated to the rate of mutation, but the correlation between divergence and the mutation rate is not as strong as they could be. We show that biased gene conversion is responsible for weakening the correlation. In contrast we find that most of the variation across the genome in diversity can be explained by variation in the mutation rate. Finally, we show that the correlation between the rate of mutation in humans and the divergence between humans and other species, weakens as the species become more divergent.",

While there are many single-species studies and integrative reviews documenting this pattern, a data-intensive approach has not been used yet to determine the generality of this pattern. We assessed the strength and direction of the intraspecific relationship between temperature and individual mass for 952 bird and mammal species. For eighty-seven percent of species, temperature explained less than 10% of variation in mass, and for 79% of species the correlation was not statistically significant. These results suggest that Bergmanns rule is not general and temperature is not a dominant driver of biogeographic variation in mass. Further understanding of size variation will require integrating multiple processes that influence size. The lack of dominant temperature forcing weakens the justification for the hypothesis that global warming could result in widespread decreases in body size.",

    "abstract": "Proposals to increase research reproducibility frequently call for focusing on effect sizes instead of p values, as well as for increasing the statistical power of experiments. However, it is unclear to what extent these two concepts are indeed taken into account in basic biomedical science. To study this in a real-case scenario, we performed a systematic review of effect sizes and statistical power in studies on learning of rodent fear conditioning, a widely used behavioral task to evaluate memory. Our search criteria yielded 410 experiments comparing control and treated groups in 122 articles. Interventions had a mean effect size of 29.5%, and amnesia caused by memory-impairing interventions was nearly always partial. Mean statistical power to detect the average effect size observed in well-powered experiments with significant differences (37.2%) was 65%, and was lower among studies with non-significant results. Only one article reported a sample size calculation, and our estimated sample size to achieve 80% power considering typical effect sizes and variances (15 animals per group) was reached in only 12.2% of experiments. Actual effect sizes correlated with effect size inferences made by readers on the basis of textual descriptions of results only when findings were non-significant, and neither effect size nor power correlated with study quality indicators, number of citations or impact factor of the publishing journal. In summary, effect sizes and statistical power have a wide distribution in the rodent fear conditioning literature, but do not seem to have a large influence on how results are described or cited. Failure to take these concepts into consideration might limit attempts to improve reproducibility in this field of science.",

    "abstract": "Membrane tethering is a fundamental process essential for compartmental specificity of intracellular membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells. Rab-family small GTPases and specific sets of Rab-interacting effector proteins, including coiled-coil tethering proteins and multisubunit tethering complexes, have been reported to be responsible for membrane tethering. However, whether and how these key components directly and specifically tether subcellular membranes still remains enigmatic. Using chemically defined proteoliposomal systems reconstituted with purified human Rab proteins and synthetic liposomal membranes to study the molecular basis of membrane tethering, we established here that Rab-family GTPases have a highly conserved function to directly mediate membrane tethering, even in the absence of any types of Rab effectors such as the so-called tethering proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that membrane tethering mediated by endosomal Rab11a is drastically and selectively stimulated by its cognate Rab effectors, class V myosins (Myo5A and Myo5B), in a GTP-dependent manner. Of note, Myo5A and Myo5B exclusively recognized and cooperated with the membrane-anchored form of their cognate Rab11a to support membrane tethering mediated by trans-Rab assemblies on apposing membranes. Our findings support the novel concept that Rab-family proteins provide a bona fide membrane tether to physically and specifically link two distinct lipid bilayers of subcellular membranes. They further indicate that Rab-interacting effector proteins, including class V myosins, can regulate these Rab-mediated membrane tethering reactions.",

One putative mechanism underlying this afferent response involves an acute excitation of meningeal afferents by cortical efflux of K+ and the ensuing antidromic release of pro-inflammatory sensory neuropeptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).\\n\\nObjectivesWe sought to investigate whether (i) a brief meningeal K+ stimulus leads to CGRP-dependent enhancement of meningeal afferent responses, and (ii) CSD-induced meningeal afferent activation and sensitization involve CGRP receptor signaling.\\n\\nMethodsExtracellular single-unit recording were used to record the activity of meningeal afferents in anesthetized male rats. Stimulations included a brief meningeal application of K+ or induction of CSD in the frontal cortex using pinprick. CSD was documented by recording changes in cerebral blood flow using laser Doppler flowmetery. CGRP receptor activity was inhibited with BIBN4096 (333M, i.v.).\\n\\nResultsMeningeal K+ stimulation acutely activated 86% of the afferent tested and also promoted in ~65% of the afferents a 3-fold increase in ongoing activity which was delayed by 23.3{+/-}4.1 min and lasted for 22.2{+/-}5.6 min. K+ stimulation did not promote mechanical sensitization. Pretreatment with BIBN4096 suppressed the K+- induced delayed afferent activation, reduced CSD-evoked cortical hyperemia, but had no effect on the enhanced activation or mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferents following CSD.\\n\\nConclusionWhile CGRP-mediated activation of meningeal afferents evoked by cortical efflux of K+ could promote headache, acute activation of CGRP receptors may not play a key role in mediating CSD-evoked headache.\\n\\nPrevious presentation of the research, manuscript, or abstractParts of the manuscript have been presented previously only in an abstract form.",

In the current sequencing age, phylogenomic analysis has proven to be a powerful tool, facilitating the increase in knowledge about diversity within the opsin subclasses and, so far, nine paralogs have been identified.

However, most species of Asteroidea, the starfish, possess true eyes and studying them will shed light on the diversity of opsin usage within echinoderms and help resolve the evolutionary history of opsins. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing, we have sequenced and analyzed the transcriptomes of different Acanthaster planci tissue samples: eyes, radial nerve, tube feet and a mixture of tissues from other organs. At least ten opsins were identified, and eight of them were found significantly differentially expressed in both eyes and radial nerve, providing new important insight into the involvement of opsins in visual and nonvisual photoreception.

Although computational image analysis of cell protrusion has been done extensively, the study on protrusion activities of cryptic lamellipodia is limited due to difficulties in image segmentation. This study seeks to aid in the computational analysis of submarginal cell protrusion in collective cell migration by using deep learning to detect the cryptic lamellipodial edges from fluorescence time-lapse movies. Due to the noisy features within overlapping cells, the conventional image analysis algorithms such as Canny edge detector and intensity thresholding are limited. By combining Canny edge detector, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and local intensity thresholding, we were able to detect cryptic lamellipodial edges of submarginal cells with high accuracy from the fluorescence time-lapse movies of PtK1 cells stained with a plasma membrane marker. We used relatively small effort to prepare the training set to train the CNN to detect the cryptical lamellipodial edges in fluorescence time-lapse movies. This work demonstrates that deep learning can be combined with the conventional image analysis algorithms to facilitate the computational analysis of highly complex time-lapse movies of collective cell migration.",

    "abstract": "As multimodal sensory information proceeds to the cortex, it is intercepted and processed by the nuclei of the thalamus. The main source of inhibition within thalamus is the reticular nucleus (TRN), which collects signals both from thalamocortical relay neurons and from thalamocortical feedback. Within the reticular nucleus, neurons are densely interconnected by connexin36-based gap junctions, known as electrical synapses. Electrical synapses have been shown to coordinate neuronal rhythms, including thalamocortical spindle rhythms, but their role in shaping or modulating transient activity is less understood. We constructed a four-cell model of thalamic relay and TRN neurons, and used it to investigate the impact of electrical synapses on closely timed inputs delivered to thalamic relay cells. We show that the electrical synapses of the TRN assist cortical discrimination of these inputs through effects of truncation, delay or inhibition of thalamic spike trains. We expect that these are principles whereby electrical synapses play similar roles in processing of transient activity in excitatory neurons across the brain.",

    "abstract": "Crop improvement must accelerate to feed an increasing human population in the face of environmental changes. Breeding programs can include anticipated climatic changes and genetic architecture to optimize improvement strategies. We analyzed the genetic architecture underlying the response of Zea mays to combinations of water and nitrogen stresses. Recombinant inbreds were subjected to nine combinations of the two stresses using an optimized response surface design, and their growth was measured. Three-dimensional dose response surfaces were fit globally and to each polymorphic allele to determine which genetic markers were associated with different response surfaces. Three quantitative trait loci that produced nonlinear surfaces were mapped. Alleles that performed better in combinations of mid-range stresses were typically not the alleles that performed best under combinations of extreme stresses. To develop physiologically relevant models for future genetic analyses, we modeled the network that explains the response surfaces. The network contains two components, an elliptical paraboloid and a plane, that each combine the nitrogen and water inputs. The relative weighting of the two components and the inputs is governed by five parameters. We estimated parameter values for the smoothed surfaces from the experimental lines using a set of points that covered the most distinctive regions of the three-dimensional surfaces. Surfaces computed using these values reproduced the smoothed experimental surfaces well, especially in the neighborhood of the peaks, as judged by three different criteria. The parameters exaggerated the amplitudes of the simulated surfaces. Experiments using single stresses could misestimate responses to their combinations and disguise loci that respond nonlinearly. The three-dimensional shape evaluation strategy used here more thoroughly compares nonlinear, nonplanar responses. We encourage the application of our findings and methods to experiments that mix crop protection measures, stresses, or both, on elite and landrace germplasm.",

    "abstract": "Mass cytometry allows high-resolution dissection of the cellular composition of the immune system. However, the high-dimensionality, large size, and non-linear structure of the data poses considerable challenges for data analysis. In particular, dimensionality reduction-based techniques like t-SNE offer single-cell resolution but are limited in the number of cells that can be analysed. Here we introduce Hierarchical Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (HSNE) for the analysis of mass cytometry datasets. HSNE constructs a hierarchy of non-linear similarities that can be interactively explored with a stepwise increase in detail up to the single-cell level. We applied HSNE to a study on gastrointestinal disorders and three other available mass cytometry datasets. We found that HSNE efficiently replicates previous observations and identifies rare cell populations that were previously missed due to downsampling. Thus, HSNE removes the scalability limit of conventional t-SNE analysis, a feature that makes it highly suitable for the analysis of massive high-dimensional datasets.",

    "abstract": "Annexins, a family of highly conserved calcium-and phospholipid-binding proteins, play important roles in a wide range of physiological functions. Among the twelve known annexins in human, Annexin A2 (AnxA2) is one of the most extensively studied and has been implicated in various human diseases. AnxA2 can exist as a monomer or a heterotetrameric complex with S100A10 (P11) and plays a critical role in many cellular processes including exocytosis/endocytosis and membrane organization. At the endothelial cell surface, (AnxA2*P11)2 tetramer, acting as a coreceptor for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), accelerates t-PA dependent activation of the fibrinolytic protease, plasmin, the enzyme responsible for thrombus dissolution and degradation of fibrin. This study shows that exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP isoform 1 (EPAC1) interacts with AnxA2 and regulates its biological functions by modulating its membrane translocation in endothelial cells. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, it is demonstrated that EPAC1, acting through the PLC{varepsilon}-PKC pathway, inhibits AnxA2 surface translocation and plasminogen activation. These results suggest that EPAC1 plays a role in the regulation of fibrinolysis in endothelial cells and may represent a novel therapeutic target for disorders of fibrinolysis.",

Hence, in monkeys performing a saccade countermanding task to earn larger or smaller fluid rewards, we sampled spiking and synaptic activity simultaneously across all layers of the supplementary eye field (SEF), an agranular cortical area contributing to performance monitoring in nonhuman primate and human studies. Laminar-specific synaptic currents with associated spike rate facilitation and suppression represented error production, reward gain or loss feedback, and reward delivery. The latency, polarity and magnitude of current and spike rate modulation were not predicted by the canonical cortical microcircuit. Pronounced synaptic currents in layer 2/3, which are modulated by loss magnitude, will contribute to the error-related negativity (ERN) and feedback-related negativity (FRN). These unprecedented findings reveal critical features of the cortical microcircuitry supporting performance monitoring and demonstrate that SEF can contribute to the error- and feedback-related negativity.\\n\\nSubject termscountermanding, stop signal task, goal selection, response inhibition, executive control, canonical cortical microcircuit, error-related negativity, reinforcement learning, reward prediction error",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory control is an executive function that positively predicts performance in several cognitive tasks and has been considered typical of vertebrates with large and complex nervous systems such as primates. However, evidence is growing that some fish species have evolved complex cognitive abilities in spite of their relatively small brain size. We tested whether fish might also show enhanced inhibitory control by subjecting guppies, Poecilia reticulata, to the motor task used to test warm-blooded vertebrates. Guppies were trained to enter a horizontal opaque cylinder to reach a food reward; then, the cylinder was replaced by a transparent one, and subjects needed to inhibit the response to pass thought the transparency to reach the food. Guppies performed correctly in 58 % of trials, a performance fully comparable to that observed in most birds and mammals. In experiment 2, we tested guppies in a task with a different type of reward, a group of conspecifics. Guppies rapidly learned to detour a transparent barrier to reach the social reward with a performance close to that of experiment 1. Our study suggests that efficient inhibitory control is shown also by fish, and its variation between-species is only partially explained by variation in brain size.",

    "abstract": "The degree of residual structure retained by proteins while passing through biological membranes is a fundamental mechanistic question of protein translocation. Proteins are generally thought to be unfolded while transported through canonical proteinaceous translocons, which has historically been the thought for the translocons of the outer and inner chloroplast envelope membranes (TOC and TIC). Here, we readdressed the issue and found that medium-sized tightly folded proteins such as the 22 kDa dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) can be tolerated by TOC and TIC. Chimeric DHFR fused with RuBisCO small subunit transit peptide (tp22DHFR) was found to be imported into chloroplasts in complex with its stabilizing ligand, methotrexate (MTX), in a folded conformation. Following import, both mature tp22DHFR and MTX were found in the chloroplast stroma. A subsaturating concentration of MTX was used to exclude the possibility that MTX was stripped off tp22DHFR, independently imported into the chloroplasts, and reassociated with imported tp22DHFR. Independent MTX import was further excluded by use of fluorescein conjugated MTX (FMTX), which has very slow membrane transport rates relative to unconjugated MTX. The TOC/TIC pore size was determined by probing the translocons with particles of fixed diameter and found to be greater than 25.6 [A], large enough to support folded DHFR import. The pore size is also larger than those of the mitochondrial protein translocons that have a requirement for protein unfolding.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEThe chloroplast TOC and TIC translocons are responsible for the import of up to 95% of all chloroplast proteins and are therefore essential for plastid biogenesis and photosynthesis. However, the mechanisms of protein import into chloroplasts are not well understood. The TOC/TIC translocons have long been suggested to have a strong unfoldase activity relative to other comparable protein translocons. Here, we present data suggesting that this is not true, and that instead, they possess a relatively large pore size. This identifies TOC and TIC as rather unique protein translocons capable of transporting folded proteins across a double membrane barrier, which has important implications in the mechanisms of TOC/TIC function and biogenesis of photosynthetic proteins.\\n\\nClassification - Biochemistry",

    "abstract": "Over the last century, the anthropogenic production of CO2 has led to warmer (+0.74 {degrees}C) and more acidic (-0.1 pH) oceans1, resulting in increasingly frequent and severe mass bleaching events worldwide that precipitate global coral reef decline2,3. To mitigate this decline, proposals to augment the stress tolerance of corals through genetic and non-genetic means have been gaining traction4. Work on model systems has shown that environmentally induced alterations in DNA methylation can lead to phenotypic acclimatization5,6. While DNA methylation has been observed in corals7-10, its potential role in phenotypic plasticity has not yet been described. Here, we show that, similar to findings in mice11, DNA methylation significantly reduces spurious transcription in the Red Sea coral Stylophora pistillata, suggesting the evolutionary conservation of this essential mechanism in corals. Furthermore, we find that DNA methylation also reduces transcriptional noise by fine-tuning the expression of highly expressed genes. Analysis of DNA methylation patterns of corals subjected to long-term pH stress showed widespread changes in pathways regulating cell cycle and body size. Correspondingly, we found significant increases in cell and polyp sizes that resulted in more porous skeletons, supporting the maintenance of linear extension rates under conditions of reduced calcification. These findings suggest an epigenetic component in phenotypic acclimatization, providing corals with an additional mechanism to cope with climate change.",

    "abstract": "Although increase in temperatures may boost the number of pathogens, a complex process involving the interaction of a susceptible host, a virulent strain, and environmental factors would influence disease virulence in unpredictable ways. Here we explored if the virulence of an environmentally growing opportunistic fish pathogen, Flavobacterium columnare, would be malleable to evolutionary changes via correlated selection on thermal tolerance. Virulence among the strains increased over years, but tolerance to higher temperatures was associated with reduced virulence. Our results suggest that observed increase in frequency of columnaris epidemics over the last decade is most likely associated with increased length of growing season, or other time dependent change in environment, rather than increased regional average temperatures. Our results also indicate that most virulent bacteria had weaker ability to tolerate outside host environments, which suggest trade-off between more obligate pathogen behaviour and ability to grow outside host.",

    "abstract": "Individuals differ in their life courses, but how this diversity is generated, how it has evolved and how maintained is less understood. However, this understanding is crucial to comprehend evolutionary and ecological population dynamics. In structured populations, individual life courses represent sequences of stages that end in death. These sequences can be described by a Markov chain and individuals diversify over the course of their lives by transitioning through diverse discrete stages. The rate at which stage sequences diversify with age can be quantified by the population entropy of a Markov chain. Here, we derive sensitivities of the population entropy of a Markov chain to identify which stage transitions generate--or contribute--most to diversification in stage sequences, i.e. life courses. We then use these sensitivities to reveal potential selective forces on the dynamics of life courses. To do so we correlated the sensitivity of each matrix element (stage transition) with respect to the population entropy, to its sensitivity with respect to fitness {lambda}, the population growth rate. Positive correlation between the two sensitivities would suggest that the stage transitions that selection has acted most strongly on (sensitivities with respect to {lambda}) are also those that contributed most to the diversification of life courses. Using an illustrative example on a seabird population, the Thick-billed Murres on Coats Island, that is structured by reproductive stages, we show that the most influential stage transitions for diversification of life courses are not correlated with the most influential transitions for population growth. Our finding suggests that observed diversification in life courses is neutral rather than adaptive. We are at an early stage of understanding how individual level dynamics shape ecological and evolutionary dynamics, and many discoveries await.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies are a powerful and widely used tool to decipher the genetic control of complex traits. One of the main challenges for hybrid crops, such as maize or sunflower, is to model the hybrid vigor in the linear mixed models, considering the relatedness between individuals. Here, we compared two additive and three non-additive association models for their ability to identify genomic regions associated with flowering time in sunflower hybrids. A panel of 452 sunflower hybrids, corresponding to incomplete crossing between 36 male lines and 36 female lines, was phenotyped in five environments and genotyped for 2,204,423 SNPs. Intra-locus effects were estimated in multi-locus models to detect genomic regions associated with flowering time using the different models. Thirteen quantitative trait loci were identified in total, two with both model categories and one with only non-additive models. A quantitative trait loci on LG09, detected by both the additive and non-additive models, is located near a GAI homolog and is presented in detail. Overall, this study shows the added value of non-additive modeling of allelic effects for identifying genomic regions that control traits of interest and that could participate in the heterosis observed in hybrids.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the role of rare variants is important in elucidating the genetic basis of human diseases and complex traits. It is widely believed that negative selection can cause rare variants to have larger per-allele effect sizes than common variants. Here, we develop a method to estimate the minor allele frequency (MAF) dependence of SNP effect sizes. We use a model in which per-allele effect sizes have variance proportional to [p(1-p)], where p is the MAF and negative values of  imply larger effect sizes for rare variants. We estimate  by maximizing its profile likelihood in a linear mixed model framework using imputed genotypes, including rare variants (MAF >0.07%). We applied this method to 25 UK Biobank diseases and complex traits (N = 113,851). All traits produced negative  estimates with 20 significantly negative, implying larger rare variant effect sizes. The inferred best-fit distribution of true  values across traits had mean -0.38 (s.e. 0.02) and standard deviation 0.08 (s.e. 0.03), with statistically significant heterogeneity across traits (P = 0.0014). Despite larger rare variant effect sizes, we show that for most traits analyzed, rare variants (MAF <1%) explain less than 10% of total SNP-heritability. Using evolutionary modeling and forward simulations, we validated the  model of MAF-dependent trait effects and estimated the level of coupling between fitness effects and trait effects. Based on this analysis an average genome-wide negative selection coefficient on the order of 10-4 or stronger is necessary to explain the  values that we inferred.",

    "abstract": "Expanded CAG/CTG repeats underlie the aetiology of 14 neurological and neuromuscular disorders. The size of the repeat tract determines in large part the severity of these disorders with longer tracts causing more severe phenotypes. Expanded CAG/CTG repeats are also unstable in somatic tissues, which is thought to modify disease progression. Routine molecular biology applications involving these repeats, including quantifying their instability, are plagued by low PCR yields. This leads to the need for setting up more PCRs of the same locus, thereby increasing the risk of carry-over contamination. Here we aimed to reduce this risk by pre-treating the samples with a Uracil N-Glycosylase (Ung) and using dUTP instead of dTTP in PCRs. We successfully applied this method to the PCR amplification of expanded CAG/CTG repeats, their sequencing, and their molecular cloning. In addition, we optimized the gold-standard method for measuring repeat instability, small-pool PCR, such that it can be used together with Ung and dUTP-containing PCRs, without compromising data quality. We expect that the protocols herein to be applicable for molecular diagnostics of expanded repeat disorders and to manipulate other tandem repeats.",

    "abstract": "Action-outcome (A-O) and stimulus-response (S-R) processes that are two forms of instrumental conditioning that are important components of decision making and action selection. The former adapts its response according to the outcome while the latter is insensitive to the outcome. An unsolved question is how these two processes emerge, cooperate and interact inside the brain in order to issue a unique behavioral answer. Here we propose a model of the interaction between the cortex, the basal ganglia and the thalamus based on a dual competition. We hypothesize that the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus, the internal pallidum (GPi), the thalamus, and the cortex are involved in closed feedback loops through the hyperdirect and direct pathways. These loops support a competition process that results in the ability for the basal ganglia to make a cognitive decision followed by a motor decision. Considering lateral cortical interactions (short range excitation, long range inhibition), another competition takes place inside the cortex allowing this latter to make a cognitive and a motor decision. We show how this dual competition endows the model with two regimes. One is oriented towards action-outcome and is driven by reinforcement learning, the other is oriented towards stimulus-response and is driven by Hebbian learning. The final decision is made according to a combination of these two mechanisms with a gradual transfer from the former to the latter. We confirmed these theoretical results on primates using a two-armed bandit task and a reversible bilateral inactivation of the internal part of the globus pallidus.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinsons disease, noradrenergic cells of the locus coeruleus and dopamine cells within the nigrostriatal pathway undergo profound degeneration. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of all catecholamines, including dopamine and noradrenaline, and is selectively expressed in the cells that produce these neurotransmitters. In vitro studies have previously shown that the TH-synthetic system can contribute to the formation of reactive oxygen species. In addition, animal models of dopamine mishandling demonstrated that free dopamine is neurotoxic. To examine how increased TH activity might influence catecholamine systems in vivo, we generated TH-overexpressing mice (TH-HI) with six total copies of the TH murine gene. A commensurate increase in TH mRNA produced a threefold increase in both total TH protein and phosphorylated TH levels. We found an increased rate of dopamine synthesis in both young and adult mice, reflected by the accumulation of L-DOPA following NSD-1015 administration, as well as elevated dopamine tissue content in young mice and an increased presence of dopamine metabolites at both ages. Adult mice show no difference in baseline locomotor behaviour compared to wildtype littermates, but a have potentiated response to amphetamine. In addition to elevated dopamine turnover in the striatum, TH-HI mice show reduced levels of glutathione and increased levels of cysteinylated catechols. These results indicate that a heightened level of active TH can produce oxidative stress, and may represent a source of toxicity that is specific to catecholamine cells, which are most vulnerable to degeneration in Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "Part of the symptomatology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are alterations in arousal and reactivity which could be related to a maladaptive increase in the automated sensory change detection system of the brain. In the current EEG study we investigated whether the brains response to a simple auditory sensory change was altered in patients with PTSD relative to trauma-exposed matched controls who did not develop the disorder. Thirteen male PTSD patients and trauma-exposed controls matched for age and educational level were presented regular auditory pure tones (1000 Hz, 200 ms duration), with 11% of the tones deviating in both duration (50 ms) and frequency (1200 Hz) while watching a silent movie. Relative to the controls, patients who had developed PTSD showed enhanced mismatch negativity (MMN), increased theta power (5-7 Hz), and stronger suppression of upper alpha activity (13-15 Hz) after deviant vs. standard tones. Behaviourally, the alpha suppression in PTSD correlated with decreased spatial working memory performance suggesting it might reflect enhanced stimulus-feature representations in auditory memory. These results taken together suggest that PTSD patients and trauma-exposed controls can be distinguished by enhanced involuntary attention to changes in sensory patterns.",

The frequency of the MEG gamma response monotonically increased with motion velocity whereas power followed a bell-shape.

Intertidal red alga, Kappaphycus alvarezii is exposed to different wavelengths of light in their lives as light quantity and quality changes at different depths in seawater. This investigation aims to study the underlying mechanisms associated with photosynthesis and carbon fixation under specific light qualities and CO2 enrichment. Light regulation of gene expression has not been previously described for red algae. By using next generation sequencing, transcriptome profiling of K. alvarezii generated 76,871 qualified transcripts with a mean length of 979bp and a N50 length of 1,707bp and 55.83% transcripts were annotated on the basis of function. Blue, green and red light all have demonstrated roles in modulating light responses, such as changes in gene expression. Here we analysed the effects of light regulation on four selected photosynthesis aspects (light-harvesting complex, phycobilisomes, photosystems and photoreceptors). We observed that light-regulated gene expression in this species is not a single light response and different light qualities are transduced to regulate the same metabolic pattern. The carbon fixation pathway was analysed and key genes encoding enzymes involved in the carbon fixation pathway such as ppc, pepc, prk, pgk, ppdk, provided that unequivocal molecular evidence that most of the C3 and C4 pathway genes were actively transcribed in K. alvarezii. In addition to this the CO2 induced transcriptome suggested the possibility of shifting carbon metabolism pathway after acclimation to increased level of CO2. Impact of CO2 enrichment on the cultures has provided new insight into the response to rising CO2.",

Further, we postulated a \\\"Genetic remittance\\\" hypothesis where these sRNAs may play important roles. The sRNA_1096 could be involved in tuberculosis through multiple infectious processes, and if transferred to the host, it may activate the TLR8 mediated pro-metastatic inflammatory pathway by acting as a ligand to TLR8 similar to the mir-21 leading to lung tumorigenesis and chemo-resistance. Analogous to SH3GL1, it may also regulate cell cycle. On the other hand, sRNA_1414 is probably involved in survivability and drug response of the pathogen. However, it may be a metastatic factor for lung cancer providing EPS8L1 and SORBS1 like functions upon remittance. Further, all these three non-coding RNAs are predicted to act in rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium.

    "abstract": "Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) are a major component of snake venoms. Some of them cause severe muscle necrosis through a still unknown mechanism. Phospholipid hydrolysis is a possible explanation of their toxic action, but catalytic and toxic properties of PLA2s are not directly connected. In addition, viperid venoms contain PLA2-like proteins, which are very toxic even if they lack catalytic activity due to a critical mutation in position 49. Nucleolin, a main component of the nucleolus, is a disordered protein involved in many protein assembly and phase separation phenomena. In some circumstances nucleolin is exposed on the cell surface from where it is involved in the internalization of many ligands.\\n\\nIn this work we demonstrate that Bothrops asper myotoxin II (Mt-II), a Lys49 PLA2-like toxin, interacts with, and is internalized in cells by nucleolin. The internalization process is functional to the toxicity of the protein, as both an antibody and an aptamer specific for nucleolin protect cells from intoxication. We identified central RRM and the C-terminal R/F-GG domain of nucleolin as the regions involved in the interaction with Mt-II. Finally we observed that Mt-II forms, on the cell surface, amyloid-like assemblies that colocalize with nucleolin and that can be involved in the activation of the internalization process.

Obesity is peculiar to humans, as it is associated with lifestyle and diet, and so difficult to reproduce in animal models.\\n\\nHere we describe a model of human central adiposity based on a 3-tissue system consisting of a series of interconnected fluidic modules. Given the causal link between obesity and systemic inflammation, we focused primarily on pro-inflammatory markers, examining the similarities and differences between the 3-tissue model and evidence from human studies in the literature. When challenged with high levels of adiposity, the in-vitro system manifests cardiovascular stress through expression of E-selectin and von Willebrand factor as well as systemic inflammation (expressing IL-6 and MCP-1) as observed in humans. Interestingly, most of the responses are dependent on the synergic interaction between adiposity and the presence of multiple tissue types. The set-up has the potential to reduce animal experiments in obesity research and may help unravel specific cellular mechanisms which underlie tissue response to nutritional overload.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has revealed that large numbers of promoters in bacteria are located inside genes. In contrast, almost all studies of transcription have focused on promoters upstream of genes. Bacterial promoters are recognized by Sigma factors that associate with initiating RNA polymerase. In Escherichia coli, one Sigma factor recognizes the majority of promoters, and six \\\"alternative\\\" Sigma factors recognize specific subsets of promoters. One of these alternative Sigma factors, FliA ({sigma}28), recognizes promoters upstream of many flagellar genes. We previously showed that most E. coli FliA binding sites are located inside genes. However, it was unclear whether these intragenic binding sites represent active promoters. Here, we construct and assay transcriptional promoter-lacZ fusions for all 52 putative FliA promoters previously identified by ChIP-seq. These experiments, coupled with integrative analysis of published genome-scale transcriptional datasets, reveal that most intragenic FliA binding sites are active promoters that transcribe highly unstable RNAs. Additionally, we show that widespread intragenic FliA-dependent transcription is a conserved phenomenon, but that the specific promoters are not themselves conserved. We conclude that intragenic FliA-dependent promoters and the resulting RNAs are unlikely to have important regulatory functions. Nonetheless, one intragenic FliA promoter is broadly conserved, and constrains evolution of the overlapping protein-coding gene. Thus, our data indicate that intragenic regulatory elements can influence protein evolution in bacteria, and suggest that the impact of intragenic regulatory sequences on genome evolution should be considered more broadly.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYRecent genome-scale studies of bacterial transcription have revealed thousands of promoters inside genes. In a few cases, these promoters have been shown to transcribe functional RNAs. However, it is unclear whether most intragenic promoters have important biological function. Similarly, there are likely to be thousands of intragenic binding sites for transcription factors, but very few have been functionally characterized. Moreover, it is unclear what impact intragenic promoters and transcription factor binding sites have on evolution of the overlapping genes. In this study, we focus on FliA, a broadly conserved Sigma factor that is responsible for initiating transcription of many flagellar genes. We previously showed that FliA directs RNA polymerase to ~50 genomic sites in Escherichia coli. In our current study, we show that while most intragenic FliA promoters are actively transcribed, very few are conserved in other species. This suggests that most FliA promoters are not functional. Nonetheless, one intragenic FliA promoter is highly conserved, and we show that this promoter constrains evolution of the overlapping protein-coding gene. Given the enormous number of regulatory DNA sites within genes, we propose that the evolution of many genes is constrained by these elements.",

Here, we have investigated the regulations targeting the biogenesis of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), the macromolecular assembly mediating nucleocytoplasmic exchanges. Systematic analysis of RNA-binding proteins interactomes, together with in vivo and in vitro assays, revealed that a subset of NPC mRNAs are specifically bound by Hek2, a yeast hnRNP K-like protein. Hek2-dependent NPC mRNAs translational repression and protein turnover are further shown to finely tune the levels of NPC subunits. Strikingly, Hek2 binding to its target mRNAs requires prior desumoylation by the NPC-associated SUMO protease Ulp1. Mutations or physiological perturbations altering NPC integrity lead to a decrease in the levels of active Ulp1 and to the accumulation of sumoylated, inactive forms of Hek2. Our results support the existence of a quality control mechanism involving Ulp1 as a sensor of NPC integrity and Hek2 as a repressor of NPC biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Rodents housed with a running wheel can exhibit attenuated cocaine seeking and cocaine-induced psychomotor activation. However, the longevity of the exercise anti-drug protection and the influence of the developmental stage during which exercise is displayed received little attention. Here, females and males C57BL/6J mice, aged 28 (adolescents) or 77 (young adults) days were housed with (n=56) or without (n=28) a running wheel. After 3 weeks in these conditions, half of the exercised mice were deprived of their wheel (n=28) whereas the other half and the sedentary mice (no wheel) were kept in their respective environments throughout experimentation. After 3 additional weeks, mice were tested for initiation of psychomotor sensitization to 9 once-daily intraperitoneal injections of 8 mg/kg cocaine (following 2 drug-free test sessions). The expression of sensitization was assessed on a single test session 30 days after the last sensitizing cocaine injection. Continuously exercised mice (wheel throughout experimentation) were less responsive to the initiation and the expression of cocaine effects, regardless of the gender and the developmental period during which exercise was introduced. Wheel-running during adolescence attenuated in later life the initiation and the expression of sensitization in females and only its expression in males. In adult females and males, previously-exercised and sedentary mice exhibited indiscernible levels of initiation and expression of sensitization. Thus, the likelihood of the long-term protection of exercise against cocaine vulnerability may depend not only on the gender but also and especially on the period of life in which exercise took place.",

    "abstract": "Azotobacter vinelandii, a Gram-negative aerobic bacterium with an intracellular anaerobic environment that maintains the oxygen-sensitive enzymatic cascades for nitrogen fixation, could be used to express oxygen-sensitive proteins. However, little is known about the properties of A. vinelandii for synthetic biology applications. We therefore first characterized and optimized the conditions for growing and screening BioBrick constructs in A. vinelandii in the presence of 2 antibiotics, ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and then developed two sets of BioBricks for regulated protein expression. The first kit used T7 RNA polymerase, whose expression is under the control of a nitrogen-repressible nifH promoter. The commonly used T7-dependent system in Escherichia coli can then be used in A. vinelandii. Because its intracellular anaerobic environment is favorable for processes such as magnetosome biogenesis, we attempted to migrate the biogenesis machineries from the magnetotactic bacterium Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense to A. vinelandii. During this undertaking, another insertion kit construct was developed to allow protein conjugation onto magnetosomes. The kit consists of mamC, a gene encoding a transmembrane protein on magnetosomes, and multiple restriction sites downstream of mamC for fusing a gene of interest. This insertion kit allows the attachment of any desired protein onto the magnetosome membrane by fusing with the mamC protein. We demonstrated the function of this kit by fusing mamC to a GFP nanobody. This kit will facilitate the conjugation of any target protein onto magnetosomes for downstream applications in the future.\\n\\nFinancial DisclosureWe received sponsorship from the 2012-15 Teaching Development Grants Triennium, Faculty of Engineering and Biochemistry Program, School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

To understand the impact of phosphorylation by Cdk1 microtubule depolymerisation activity, we have investigated the molecular mechanism of the phosphomimic mutant T537E. This mutant significantly impairs microtubule depolymerisation activity and when transfected into cells causes metaphase arrest and misaligned chromosomes. We show that the molecular mechanism underlying the reduced depolymerisation activity of this phosphomimic mutant is an inability to recognise the microtubule end. The microtubule-end residence time is reduced relative to wild-type MCAK, whereas the lattice residence time is unchanged by the phosphomimic mutation. Further, the microtubule-end specific stimulation of ADP dissociation, characteristic of MCAK, is abolished by this mutation. Our data shows that T537E is unable to distinguish between the microtubule end and the microtubule lattice.",

One of the most challenging questions in biology today is how the genomic characteristics of enhancers relate to enhancer activities. This is particularly critical, as several recent studies have linked enhancer sequence motifs to specific functional roles. To date, only a limited number of enhancer sequence characteristics have been investigated, leaving space for exploring the enhancers genomic code in a more systematic way. To address this problem, we developed a novel computational method, TELS, aimed at identifying predictive cell type/tissue specific motif signatures. We used TELS to compile a comprehensive catalog of motif signatures for all known TrEn identified by the FANTOM5 consortium across 112 human primary cells and tissues. Our results confirm that distinct cell type/tissue specific motif signatures characterize TrEn. These signatures allow discriminating successfully a) TrEn from random controls, proxy of non-enhancer activity, and b) cell type/tissue specific TrEn from enhancers expressed and transcribed in different cell types/tissues.

    "abstract": "Bio-macromolecules carry out complicated functions through structural changes. To understand their mechanism of action, the structure of each step has to be characterized. While classical structural biology techniques allow the characterization of a few  structural snapshots along the enzymatic cycle (usually of stable conformations), they do not cover all (and often fast interconverting) structures in the ensemble, where each may play an important functional role. Recently, several groups have demonstrated that structures of different conformations in solution could be solved by measuring multiple distances between different pairs of residues using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and using them as constrains for hybrid/integrative structural modeling. However, this approach is limited in cases where the conformational dynamics is faster than the techniques temporal resolution. In this study, we combine existing tools that elucidate sub-millisecond conformational dynamics together with hybrid/integrative structural modeling to study the conformational states of the transcription bubble in the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP)-promoter open complex (RPo). We measured microsecond alternating laser excitation sALEX)-smFRET of differently labeled lacCONS promoter dsDNA constructs. We used a combination of burst variance analysis (BVA), photon-by-photon hidden Markov modelling (H2MM) and the FRET-restrained positioning and screening (FPS) approach to identify two conformational states for RPo. The experimentally-derived distances of one conformational state match the known crystal structure of bacterial RPo. The experimentally-derived distances of the other conformational state have characteristics of a scrunched RPo. These findings support the hypothesis that sub-millisecond dynamics in the transcription bubble are responsible for transcription start site selection.",

It is not known whether LD biogenesis occurs stochastically in the ER or at subdomains with unique protein and lipid composition. We previously identified ER subdomains in S. cerevisiae that contain Pex30, a reticulon-like ER-resident membrane protein5. There are ~25 Pex30-containing puncta in the ER per cell. These sites are regions where preperoxisomal vesicles (PPVs) are generated5. Here we show that Pex30 subdomains are also the location where most nascent LDs form. Mature LDs remain associated with Pex30 subdomains and the same Pex30 subdomain can simultaneously associate with a LD and a PPV. Pex30 subdomains become highly enriched in diacylglycerol (DAG) during LD biogenesis, indicating they have a unique lipid composition. We find that in higher eukaryotes multiple C2 domain containing transmembrane protein (MCTP2) is the functional homologue of Pex30; MCTP2 resides in ER subdomains where most nascent LD biogenesis occurs and that are often associated with peroxisomes. Together, these findings indicate that most LDs and PPVs form and remain associated with conserved ER subdomains and suggest a link between LD and peroxisome biogenesis.",

Our main focus was the effect of year-to-year variation in larval dispersal on invasion spread rate. We used the green crab, Carcinus maenas, as a case study. This species was first introduced over 200 years ago to the east coast of North America, and once established has maintained a relatively consistent spread rate against the dominant current. We used a stage-structured, integro-difference equation model that couples a demographic matrix for population growth and dispersal kernels for spread of individuals within a season. The kernel describing larval dispersal, the main dispersive stage, was mechanistically modeled to include both drift and settlement rate components. It was parameterized using a 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the Gulf of St Lawrence, which enabled us to incorporate larval behavior, namely vertical swimming. Dispersal heterogeneity was modeled at two temporal scales: within the larval period (months) and over the adult lifespan (years). The kernel models variation within the larval period. To model the variation among years, we allowed the kernel parameters to vary by year. Results indicated that when dispersal parameters vary with time, knowledge of the time-averaged dispersal process is insufficient for determining the upstream spread rate of the population. Rather upstream spread is possible over a number of years when incorporating the yearly variation, even when there are only a few \\\"good years\\\" featured by some upstream dispersal among many \\\"bad years\\\" featured by only downstream dispersal. Accounting for annual variations in dispersal in population models is important to enhance understanding of spatial dynamics and population spread rates. Our developed model also provides a good platform to link the modeling of larval behavior and demography to large-scale hydrodynamic models.",

    "abstract": "Healthy cortical development depends on precise regulation of transcription and translation. However, the dynamics of how proteins are expressed, function and interact across postnatal human cortical development remain poorly understood. We surveyed the proteomic landscape of 69 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples across seven stages of postnatal life and integrated these data with paired transcriptome data. We detected 911 proteins by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 83 were significantly associated with postnatal age (FDR p < 0.05). Network analysis identified three modules of co-regulated proteins correlated with age, including two modules with increasing expression involved in gliogenesis and NADH-metabolism and one neurogenesis-related module with decreasing expression throughout development. Integration with paired transcriptome data revealed that these age-related protein modules overlapped with RNA modules and displayed collinear developmental trajectories. Importantly, RNA expression profiles that are dynamically regulated throughout cortical development display tighter correlations with their respective translated protein expression compared to those RNA profiles that are not. Moreover, the correspondence between RNA and protein expression significantly decreases as a function of cortical aging, especially for genes involved in myelination and cytoskeleton organization. Finally, we used this data resource to elucidate the functional impact of genetic risk loci for intellectual disability, converging on gliogenesis, myelination and ATP-metabolism modules in the proteome and transcriptome. We share all data in an interactive, searchable companion website. Collectively, our findings reveal dynamic aspects of protein regulation and provide new insights into brain development, maturation and disease.",

    "abstract": "There are several functions that hikers can use to predict walking time based on elevation change or slope of the ground. The most commonly used is the Naismith function that was first published over 100 years ago. The availability of GPS devices to record tracks now make it possible to evaluate the performance of walking time functions. Four data sources were used: 98 tracks downloaded from the Wikiloc web site; 55 tracks recorded by the author; 19 tracks recorded by the blogger Iron Hiker; and 20 tracks recorded by the blogger Hiking Guy. The .gpx files were processed to generate segements of ~100m in length, with the associated segment duration and elevation change. The association between walking pace and elevation change was assessed in the Wikiloc data using linear spline regression. The performance of the linear spline function was then compared with the Naismith, Tobler and Laingmuir functions. The linear spline performed the best, but all four performed reasonably well. While the linear spline function could easily be programmed into the software of standard GPS devices, the Naismith function provides a simple-to-use rule-of-thumb for estimating walking time for a typical hike in the mountains.\\n\\nFundingNone\\n\\nAcknowledgementsI thank Chris Hazzard and Keith Wilson for sharing their hiking records and for helpful comments on the manuscript.\\n\\nDisclosure of interestsThe authors have no interest to disclose",
