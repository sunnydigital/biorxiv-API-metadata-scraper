    "abstract": "Confidence in a decision is defined statistically as the probability of that decision being correct. Humans, however, display systematic confidence biases, as has been exposed in various experiments. Here, we show that these biases vanish when taking into account participants' prior expectations, which we measure independently of the confidence report. We use a wagering experiment to show that modeling subjects' choices allows for classifying individuals according to their prior biases, which fully explain from first principles the differences in their later confidence reports. Our parameter-free confidence model predicts two counterintuitive patterns for individuals with different prior beliefs: pessimists should report higher confidence than optimists, and, for the same task difficulty, the confidence of pessimists should increase with the generosity of the task. These findings show how systematic confidence biases can be simply understood as differences in prior expectations.",

    "abstract": "The high-risk pedigree (HRP) design is an established strategy to discover rare, highly-penetrant, Mendelian-like causal variants. Its success, however, in complex traits has been modest, largely due to challenges of genetic heterogeneity and complex inheritance models. We describe a HRP strategy that addresses intra-familial heterogeneity, and identifies inherited segments important for mapping regulatory risk. We apply this new Shared Genomic Segment (SGS) method in 11 extended, Utah, multiple myeloma (MM) HRPs, and subsequent exome sequencing in SGS regions of interest in 1063 MM / MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance - a precursor to MM) cases and 964 controls from a jointly-called collaborative resource, including cases from the initial 11 HRPs. One genome-wide significant 1.8 Mb shared segment was found at 6q16. Exome sequencing in this region revealed predicted deleterious variants in USP45 (p.Gln691*, p.Gln621Glu), a gene known to influence DNA repair through endonuclease regulation. Additionally, a 1.2 Mb segment at 1p36.11 is inherited in two Utah HRPs, with coding variants identified in ARID1A (p.Ser90Gly, p.Met890Val), a key gene in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Our results provide compelling statistical and genetic evidence for segregating risk variants for MM. In addition, we demonstrate a novel strategy to use large HRPs for risk-variant discovery more generally in complex traits.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAlthough family-based studies demonstrate inherited variants play a role in many common and complex diseases, finding the genes responsible remains a challenge. High-risk pedigrees, or families with more disease than expected by chance, have been helpful in the discovery of variants responsible for less complex diseases, but have not reached their potential in complex diseases. Here, we describe a method to utilize high-risk pedigrees to discover risk-genes in complex diseases. Our method is appropriate for complex diseases because it allows for genetic-heterogeneity, or multiple causes of disease, within a pedigree. This method allows us to identify shared segments that likely harbor disease-causing variants in a family. We apply our method in Multiple Myeloma, a heritable and complex cancer of plasma cells. We identified two genes USP45 and ARID1A that fall within shared segments with compelling statistical evidence. Exome sequencing of these genes revealed likely-damaging variants inherited in Myeloma high-risk families, suggesting these genes likely play a role in development of Myeloma. Our Myeloma findings demonstrate our high-risk pedigree method can identify genetic regions of interest in large high-risk pedigrees that are also relevant to smaller nuclear families and overall disease risk. In sum, we offer a strategy, applicable across phenotypes, to revitalize high-risk pedigrees in the discovery of the genetic basis of common and complex disease.",

    "abstract": "Whether intraspecific interactions are facilitative or competitive may change across individual ontogeny. In plant-feeding insects, the direction of this interaction is likely to be mediated by host plant defenses. Here I conducted two experiments looking at the direct effect of a physical seed defense and the role of intraspecific facilitation in reducing the effects of that defense for juveniles. I first demonstrate that juveniles of the red-shouldered soapberry bug (Jadera haematoloma) are severely inhibited by the tough seed coat of their host plant, leading to high mortality early in development. Adults, in contrast, can create holes through which other individuals could potentially feed. I then manipulated whether or not seeds experienced adult feeding on two host plant species: a well-defended native host, balloon vine (Cardiospermum corindum) and a poorly defended introduced golden rain tree species (Koelreuteria elegans). I measured the effect of prior adult feeding on survival, development time, and final body size of soapberry bug juveniles. Survival in the first week of development was dramatically improved by prior adult feeding on both hosts. However, the benefits of prior adult feeding ceased after the first week of development and shifted to having a negative effect on performance. These results indicate that adults breaking through the seedcoat initially facilitate juveniles, but that this facilitation becomes competition as juveniles age.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater aquatic ecosystems provide a wide range of ecosystem services, yet provision of these services is increasingly threatened by human activities. Directly quantifying freshwater biotic assemblages has long been a proxy for assessing changing environmental conditions, yet traditional aquatic biodiversity assessments are often time consuming, expensive, and limited to only certain habitats and certain taxa. Sequencing aquatic environmental DNA via metabarcoding has the potential to remedy these deficiencies. Such an approach could be used to quantify changes in the relative abundances of a broad suite of taxa along environmental gradients, providing data comparable to that obtained using more traditional bioassessment approaches. To determine the utility of metabarcoding for comprehensive aquatic biodiversity assessments, we sampled aquatic environmental DNA at 25 sites that spanned the full length of the Potomac River from its headwaters to the Potomac estuary. We measured dissolved nutrient concentrations and also sequenced amplified marker genes using primer pairs broadly targeting four taxonomic groups. The relative abundances of bacteria, phytoplankton, invertebrate, and vertebrate taxa were distinctly patterned along the river with significant differences in their abundances across headwaters, the main river, and the estuary. Within the main river, changes in the abundances of these broad taxonomic groups reflected either increasing river size or a higher degree of eutrophication. The larger and more eutrophic regions of the river were defined by high total dissolved phosphorus in the water, a unique suite of bacteria, phytoplankton such as species of the diatom Nitzschia, invertebrates like the freshwater snail Physella acuta, and high abundance of fish including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Taxonomic richness of phytoplankton and vertebrates increased downriver while it consistently decreased for bacteria. Given these results, multi-assemblage aquatic environmental DNA assessment of surface water quality is a viable tool for bioassessment. With minimal sampling effort, we were able to construct the equivalent of a freshwater water quality index, differentiate closely-related taxa, sample places where traditional monitoring would be difficult, quantify species that are difficult to detect with traditional techniques, and census taxa that are generally captured with more traditional bioassessment approaches. To realize the full potential of aquatic environmental DNA for bioassessment, research is still needed on primer development, a geographically broad set of reference sites need to be characterized, and reference libraries need to be further developed to improve taxonomic identification.",

    "abstract": "Some phylogenetic datasets omit data matrix positions at which all taxa share the same state. For sequence data this may be because of a focus on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or the use of a technique such as restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) that concentrates attention onto regions of differences. With morphological data, it is common to omit states that show no variation across the data studied. It is already known that failing to correct for the ascertainment bias of omitting constant positions can lead to overestimates of evolutionary divergence, as the lack of constant sites is explained as high divergence rather than as a deliberate data selection technique. Previous approaches to using corrections to the likelihood function in order to avoid ascertainment bias have either required knowledge of the omitted positions, or have modified the likelihood function to reflect the omitted data. In this paper we indicate that the technique used to date for this latter approach is a conditional maximum likelihood (CML) method. An alternative approach -- unconditional maximum likelihood (UML) -- is also possible. We investigate the performance of CML and UML and find them to have almost identical performance in the phylogenetic SNP dataset context. We also make some observations about the nucleotide frequencies observed in SNP datasets, indicating that these can differ systematically from the overall equilibrium base frequencies of the substitution process. This suggests that model parameters representing base frequencies should be estimated by maximum likelihood, and not by empirical (counting) methods.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) senses and adapts to acidic environments during the course of infection. Acidic pH-dependent adaptations include the induction of metabolic genes associated with anaplerosis and growth arrest on specific carbon sources. In this study, reverse and forward genetic studies were undertaken to define new mechanisms underlying pH-dependent adaptations. Here we report that deletion of isocitrate lyase (icl1/2) or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pckA) results in reduced growth at acidic pH and altered metabolite profiles, supporting that remodeling of anaplerotic metabolism is required for pH-dependent adaptation. Mtb cultured at pH 5.7 in minimal medium containing glycerol as a single carbon source exhibits an acid growth arrest phenotype, where the bacterium is non-replicating but viable and metabolically active. The bacterium uptakes and metabolizes glycerol and maintains ATP pools during acid growth arrest and becomes tolerant to detergent stress and the antibiotics isoniazid and rifampin. A forward genetic screen identified mutants that do not arrest their growth at acidic pH, including four enhanced acid growth (eag) mutants with three distinct mutations in the PPE gene MT3221. Overexpression of the MT3221(S211R) variant protein in wild type Mtb results in enhanced acid growth and reduced drug tolerance. Together, these findings provide new evidence for a genetic and physiological basis for acid growth arrest and support that growth arrest is an adaptive process and not simply a physiological limitation associated with acidic pH.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes the disease tuberculosis in humans. During infection Mtb colonizes a variety of environments that have acidic environments and Mtb must adapt to these environments to cause disease. One of these adaptations is that Mtb slows and arrests its growth at acidic pH, and the goal of this study was to examine the genetics and physiology of these pH-dependent adaptations. We found that Mtb modifies its metabolism at acidic pH and that these adaptations are required for optimal growth. We also found that acidic pH and specific nutrient sources can promote the bacterium to enter a state of dormancy, called acid growth arrest, where the bacterium becomes tolerant to antibiotics. Mutants were identified that do not arrest their growth at acidic, revealing that acid growth arrest is a genetically controlled process. Overall, understanding how Mtb adapts to acidic pH has revealed pathway that are required for virulence and drug tolerance and thus may identify new targets for drug development that may function to shorten the course of TB therapy.",

    "abstract": "Seemingly paradoxical characteristics of psychiatric disorders, including moderate to high prevalence, reduced fecundity, and high heritability have motivated explanations for the persistence of common risk alleles for severe psychiatric phenotypes throughout human evolution. Proposed mechanisms include balancing selection, drift, and weak polygenic adaptation acting either directly, or indirectly through selection on correlated traits. While many mechanisms have been proposed, few have been empirically tested. Leveraging publicly available data of unprecedented sample size, we studied twenty-five traits (i.e., ten neuropsychiatric disorders, three personality traits, total intracranial volume, seven subcortical brain structure volume traits, and four complex traits without neuropsychiatric associations) for evidence of several different signatures of selection over a range of evolutionary time scales. Consistent with the largely polygenic architecture of neuropsychiatric traits, we found no enrichment of trait-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in regions of the genome that underwent classical selective sweeps (i.e., events which would have driven selected alleles to near fixation). However, we discovered that SNPs associated with some, but not all, behaviors and brain structure volumes are enriched in genomic regions under selection since divergence from Neanderthals ~600,000 years ago, and show further evidence for signatures of ancient and recent polygenic adaptation. Individual subcortical brain structure volumes demonstrate genome-wide evidence in support of a mosaic theory of brain evolution while total intracranial volume and height appear to share evolutionary constraints consistent with concerted evolution. We further characterized the biological processes potentially targeted by selection, through expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses and found evidence for the role of regulatory functions among selected SNPs in immune and brain tissues. Taken together, our results suggest that alleles associated with neuropsychiatric, behavioral, and brain volume phenotypes have experienced both ancient and recent polygenic adaptation in human evolution, acting through neurodevelopmental and immune-mediated pathways.",
