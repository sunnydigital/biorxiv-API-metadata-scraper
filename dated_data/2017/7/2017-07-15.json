    "abstract": "Perceptual constancy requires neural representations that are selective for object identity, but also tolerant for identity-preserving transformations. How such representations arise in the brain and contribute to perception remains unclear. Here we studied tolerant representations of sound identity in the auditory system by recording multi-unit activity in tonotopic auditory cortex of ferrets discriminating the identity of vowels which co-varied across orthogonal stimulus dimensions (fundamental frequency, sound level, location and voicing). We found that neural decoding of vowel identity was most successful across the same orthogonal dimensions over which animals generalized their behavior. We also decoded orthogonal sound features and behavioral variables including choice and accuracy to show a behaviorally-relevant, multivariate and multiplexed representation of sound, with each variable represented over a distinct time-course. Finally, information content and timing of sound feature encoding was modulated by task-engagement and training, suggesting that tolerant representations during perceptual constancy are attentionally and experience-dependent.",

    "abstract": "Quality control of MRI is essential for excluding problematic acquisitions and avoiding bias in subsequent image processing and analysis. Visual inspection is subjective and impractical for large scale datasets. Although automated quality assessments have been demonstrated on single-site datasets, it is unclear that solutions can generalize to unseen data acquired at new sites. Here, we introduce the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC), a tool for extracting quality measures and fitting a binary (accept/exclude) classifier. Our tool can be run both locally and as a free online service via the OpenNeuro.org portal. The classifier is trained on a publicly available, multi-site dataset (17 sites, N=1102). We perform model selection evaluating different normalization and feature exclusion approaches aimed at maximizing across-site generalization and estimate an accuracy of 76%{+/-}13% on new sites, using leave-one-site-out cross-validation. We confirm that result on a held-out dataset (2 sites, N=265) also obtaining a 76% accuracy. Even though the performance of the trained classifier is statistically above chance, we show that it is susceptible to site effects and unable to account for artifacts specific to new sites. MRIQC performs with high accuracy in intra-site prediction, but performance on unseen sites leaves space for improvement which might require more labeled data and new approaches to the between-site variability. Overcoming these limitations is crucial for a more objective quality assessment of neuroimaging data, and to enable the analysis of extremely large and multi-site samples.",

    "abstract": "The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a major vector for arboviruses including dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus. Combating the spread of these viruses requires a more complete understanding of the mosquito immune system. Recent studies have implicated genomic endogenous viral elements (EVEs) derived from non-retroviral RNA viruses in insect immunity. Because these elements are inserted into repetitive regions of the mosquito genome, their large-scale structure and organization with respect to other genomic elements has been difficult to resolve with short-read sequencing. To better define the origin, diversity and biological role of EVEs, we employed single-molecule, real-time sequencing technology to generate a high quality, long-read assembly of the Ae. aegypti-derived Aag2 cell line genome. We leverage the quality and contiguity of this assembly to characterize the diversity and genomic context of EVEs in the genome of this important model system. We find that EVEs in the Aag2 genome are acquired through recombination by LTR retrotransposons, and organize into larger loci (>50kbp) characterized by high LTR density. These EVE containing loci are associated with increased transcription factor binding sight density and increased production of anti-genomic piRNAs. We also detected piRNA processing corresponding to on-going viral infection. This global view of EVEs and piRNA responses demonstrates the ubiquity and diversity of these heritable elements that define small-RNA mediated antiviral immunity in mosquitoes.",

    "abstract": "Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics have been shown to enhance biofilm formation in multiple bacterial species. While antibiotic exposure has been associated with modulated expression in many biofilm-related genes, the mechanisms of drug-induced biofilm formation remain a focus of ongoing research efforts and may vary significantly across species. In this work, we investigate antibiotic-induced biofilm formation in E. faecalis, a leading cause of nosocomial infections. We show that biofilm formation is enhanced by subinhibitory concentrations of cell wall synthesis inhibitors, but not by inhibitors of protein, DNA, folic acid, or RNA synthesis. Furthermore, enhanced biofilm is associated with increased cell lysis, an increase in extracellular DNA (eDNA), and an increase in the density of living cells in the biofilm. In addition, we observe similar enhancement of biofilm formation when cells are treated with non-antibiotic surfactants that induce cell lysis. These findings suggest that antibiotic-induced biofilm formation is governed by a trade-off between drug toxicity and the beneficial effects of cell lysis. To understand this trade-off, we developed a simple mathematical model that predicts changes to antibiotic-induced biofilm formation due to external perturbations, and we verify these predictions experimentally. Specifically, we demonstrate that perturbations that reduce eDNA (DNase treatment) or decrease the number of living cells in the planktonic phase (a second antibiotic) decrease biofilm induction, while chemical inhibitors of cell lysis increase relative biofilm induction and shift the peak to higher antibiotic concentrations. Overall, our results offer experimental evidence linking cell wall synthesis inhibitors, cell lysis, increased eDNA, and biofilm formation in E. faecalis while also providing a predictive, quantitative model that sheds light on the interplay between cell lysis and antibiotic efficacy in developing biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 (IRF5) plays an important role in limiting pathogenic infection and tumor development. Host protection by IRF5 can occur through a variety of mechanisms including production of type I interferon and cytokines as well as the regulation of cell survival, growth, proliferation, and differentiation. While modulation of these cellular processes is attributed to IRF5 transcription factor function in the nucleus, emerging evidence suggests that IRF5 may also retain non-transcriptional regulatory properties within the cytoplasmic compartment. Consistent with this notion, we report the ability of IRF5 to control gene expression at the level of mRNA translation. Our findings demonstrate that IRF5 interacts with the translation initiation complex in the absence of the m7GTP cap-binding protein, eIF4E. We observed that under nutrient deprivation-induced cell stress, IRF5 promoted mRNA translation of the master integrated stress response (ISR) regulator, Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4). Enhanced ATF4 protein expression correlated with increased levels of downstream target genes including CHOP and GADD34 and was associated with amplification of eIF2 de-phosphorylation and translational de-repression under stress. The novel mechanism we describe broadens our understanding of how IRF5 regulates gene expression and may govern diverse cellular processes in the absence of stimuli that trigger IRF5 nuclear translocation.",

    "abstract": "Eutrema salsugineum is a model species for the study of plant adaptation to abiotic stresses. Two accessions of E. salsugineum, Shandong (SH) and Yukon (YK), exhibit contrasting morphology, biotic, and abiotic stress tolerance. Transcriptome and metabolic profiling from tissue samples collected during the dark period were used to investigate the molecular and metabolic bases of these contrasting phenotypes. RNA sequencing identified 17,888 expressed genes, of which 157 were not in the published reference genome and 65 were detected for the first time. Differential expression was detected for only 31 genes. The RNA sequencing data contained 14,808 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcripts, 3,925 of which are newly identified. Among the differentially expressed genes, there were no obvious candidates for the physiological or morphological differences between SH and YK. Metabolic profiling indicated that YK accumulates free fatty acids and long-chain fatty acid derivatives as compared to SH; whereas sugars are more abundant in SH. Metabolite levels suggest that carbohydrate and respiratory metabolism, including starch degradation, is more active during the first half of the dark period in SH. These metabolic differences may explain the greater biomass accumulation in YK over SH. The accumulation of 56% of the identified metabolites was lower in F1 hybrids than the mid-parent averages and the accumulation of 17% of the metabolites in F1 plants transgressed the level in both parents. Concentrations of several metabolites in F1 hybrids agree with previous studies and suggest a role for primary metabolism in heterosis. The improved annotation of the E. salsugineum genome and newly-identified high-quality SNPs will permit accelerated studies using the standing variation in this species to elucidate the mechanisms of its diverse adaptations to the environment.",

Determining which combinations of the vast array of possibly interacting heterogeneities drive tumor progression presents a major multi-disciplinary challenge in cancer research. To make effective treatment decisions this challenge must be addressed. The practical challenge is assessing cellular heterogeneity in a statistically powerful way with respect to targeted TME characteristics.

Using a platform we term \\\"the drop-patterning chip\\\" thousands of cells are simultaneously transferred from microwells and fully embedded, only using the force of gravity, in precise patterns in 3D. This method allows for throughputs approaching flow-through methods, which lack phenotypic information on cell-matrix interactions, and does not rely on expensive or harsh patterning forces, which often times also result in a proximal stiff surface.",

However, publicly available SNP databases lack robust verification, making analysis of imprinting difficult. In addition, the allele-specific imprinting assays that have been developed employ different mouse strains, making it difficult to systemically analyze these loci. Here, we have generated a resource that will allow the allele-specific analysis of many significant imprinted loci in a single hybrid strain of Mus musculus.

Its expression and activity, along with its intracellular trafficking rates shift the equilibrium between the pro- and anti-inflammatory downstream signaling cascades, leading to either the physiological resolution of the bacterial stimulation or to sepsis. We hypothesize that the initial tlr4 expression in patients diagnosed with sepsis and TLR4 dynamic concentration changes on the cell membrane or intracellularly, dictates how the sepsis syndrome is initiated. Using a set of three differential equations, we defined the TLR4 flux between relevant cell organelles. We obtained three different regions in the phase space: 1. a limit-cycle describing unstimulated physiological oscillations, 2. a fixed-point attractor resulting from moderate LPS stimulation that is resolved and 3. a double-attractor resulting from sustained LPS stimulation that leads to sepsis.

The genomic era has enhanced biosynthetic understanding of these valuable chemical entities and has also provided a window into the diversity and distribution of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters. Antimycin is an inhibitor of mitochondrial cytochrome c reductase and more recently was shown to inhibit Bcl-2/Bcl-XLsrelated anti-apoptotic proteins commonly overproduced by cancerous cells. Here we identify 65 putative antimycin biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in publicly available genome sequences of Actinobacteria and classify them based on the presence or absence of cluster-situated genes antP and antQ, which encode a kynureninase and phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase), respectively. The majority of BGCs possess either both antP and antQ (L-form) or neither (S-form), while a minority of them lack either antP or antQ (IQ or IPform, respectively). We also evaluate the biogeographical distribution and phylogenetic relationships of antimycin producers and BGCs. We show that antimycin BGCs occur on five of the seven continents and are frequently isolated from plants and other higher organisms. We also provide evidence for two distinct phylogenetic clades of antimycin producers and gene clusters, which delineate S-form from L- and I-form BGCs. Finally, our findings suggest that the ancestral antimycin producer harboured an L-form gene cluster which was primarily propagated by vertical transmission and subsequently diversified into S-, IQ and IPform biosynthetic pathways.",

    "abstract": "Cell division, endocytosis, and viral budding would not function without the localization and assembly of protein complexes on membranes. What is poorly appreciated, however, is that by localizing to membranes, proteins search in a reduced space that effectively drives up concentration. Here we derive an accurate and practical analytical theory to quantify the significance of this dimensionality reduction in regulating protein assembly on membranes. We define a simple metric, an effective equilibrium constant, that allows for quantitative comparison of protein-protein interactions with and without membrane present. To test the importance of membrane localization for driving protein assembly, we collected the protein-protein and protein-lipid affinities, protein and lipid concentrations, and volume-to-surface-area ratios for 46 interactions between 37 membrane-targeting proteins in human and yeast cells. We find that many of the protein-protein interactions between pairs of proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human and yeast cells can experience enormous increases in effective protein-protein affinity (10-1000 fold) due to membrane localization. Localization of binding partners thus triggers robust protein complexation, suggesting that it can play an important role in controlling the timing of endocytic protein coat formation. Our analysis shows that several other proteins involved in membrane remodeling at various organelles have similar potential to exploit localization. The theory highlights the master role of phosphoinositide lipid concentration, the volume-to-surface-area ratio, and the ratio of 3D to 2D equilibrium constants in triggering (or preventing) constitutive assembly on membranes. Our simple model provides a novel quantitative framework for interpreting or designing in vitro experiments of protein complexation influenced by membrane binding.",

However, the speed and acuity of tactile edge orientation processing with respect to the fingertips as reported in previous perceptual studies appear inadequate in these respects. Here we directly establish the tactile systems capacity to process edge-orientation information during dexterous manipulation. Participants extracted tactile information about edge orientation very quickly, using it within 200 ms of first touching the object. Participants were also strikingly accurate. With edges spanning the entire fingertip, edge-orientation resolution was better than 3{degrees} in our object manipulation task, which is several times better than reported in previous perceptual studies. Performance remained impressive even with edges as short as 2 mm, consistent with our ability to precisely manipulate very small objects. Taken together, our results radically redefine the spatial processing capacity of the tactile system.",

    "abstract": "Multiple neuropeptides are known to regulate water and ion balance in Drosophila melanogaster. Several of these peptides also have other functions in physiology and behavior. Examples are corticotropin-releasing factor-like diuretic hormone (diuretic hormone 44; DH44) and leucokinin (LK), both of which induce fluid secretion by Malpighian tubules (MTs), but also regulate stress responses, feeding, circadian activity and other behaviors. Here, we investigated the functional relations between the LK and DH44 signaling systems. DH44 and LK peptides are only colocalized in a set of abdominal neurosecretory cells (ABLKs). Targeted knockdown of each of these peptides in ABLKs leads to increased resistance to desiccation, starvation and ionic stress. Food ingestion is diminished by knockdown of DH44, but not LK, and water retention is increased by LK knockdown only. Thus, the two colocalized peptides display similar systemic actions, but differ with respect to regulation of feeding and body water retention. We also demonstrated that DH44 and LK have additive effects on fluid secretion by MTs. It is likely that the colocalized peptides are coreleased from ABLKs into the circulation and act on the tubules where they target different cell types and signaling systems to regulate diuresis and stress tolerance. Additional targets seem to be specific for each of the two peptides and subserve regulation of feeding and water retention. Our data suggest that the ABLKs and hormonal actions are sufficient for many of the known DH44 and LK functions, and that the remaining neurons in the CNS play other functional roles.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe concept of mitochondrial dysfunction in aging muscle is highly controversial. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that reduced muscle oxidative capacity and efficiency underlie the etiology of mobility loss in older adults. Here, we hypothesized that studying well phenotyped older cohorts across a wide range of physical activity would unveil a range of mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle and in turn allow us to more clearly examine the impact of age per se on mitochondrial energetics. This also enabled us to more clearly define the relationships between mitochondrial energetics and muscle lipid content with clinically relevant assessments of muscle and physical function.\\n\\nMethodsThirty-nine volunteers were recruited to the following study groups; Young Active (YA, n=2F/8M, age=31.2{+/-}5.4 yrs.). Older Active (OA, n=2F/8M, age=67.5{+/-}2.7 yrs.) and Older Sedentary (OS, n=8F/11M, age=70.7{+/-}4.7 yrs.). Participants completed a graded exercise test to determine fitness (VO2peak), a submaximal exercise test to determine exercise efficiency, and daily physical activity (PA) was recorded using a tri-axial armband accelerometer. Mitochondrial energetics were determined by 1) 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and 2) respirometry of fiber bundles from vastus lateralis biopsies. Quadriceps function was assessed by isokinetic dynamometry and physical function by the short physical performance battery (SPPB) and stair climb test.\\n\\nResultsDaily PA energy expenditure was significantly lower in OS, compared to YA and OA groups. Despite fitness being higher in YA compared to OA and OS, mitochondrial respiration, ATPMax, P/O ratio and exercise efficiency were similar in YA and OA groups and were significantly lower in OS. P/O ratio was correlated with exercise efficiency. Time to complete the stair climb and repeated chair stand tests was significantly greater for OS. Interestingly, ATPMax was related to muscle contractile performance and physical function.\\n\\nConclusionsOlder adults who maintain a high amount of physical activity have better mitochondrial capacity, similar to highly active younger adults, and this is related to their better muscle quality, exercise efficiency and physical performance. This suggests that mitochondria could be an important therapeutic target for sedentary aging associated conditions including sarcopenia, dynapenia and loss of physical function.",

We use embryonic tissue explants, finite element modeling, and 3D cell patterning techniques to show that a mechanical compaction of the ECM during mesenchymal condensation can drive tissue folding along programmed trajectories. The process requires cell contractility, generates strains at nearby tissue interfaces, and causes specific patterns of collagen alignment around and between condensates. Aligned collagen fibers support elevated tensions that promote the folding of interfaces along paths that can be predicted by finite element modeling. We demonstrate the robustness and versatility of this strategy for sculpting tissue interfaces by directing the morphogenesis of a variety of folded tissue forms from engineered patterns of mesenchymal condensates. These studies provide insight into the active mechanical properties of the embryonic mesenchyme and establish entirely new strategies for more robustly directing tissue morphogenesis ex vivo, without genetic engineering.",

    "abstract": "As trees are long-lived organisms, the impacts of climate change on forest communities may not be apparent on the time scale of years to decades. While lagged responses to environmental change are common in forested systems, potential for abrupt transitions under climate change may occur in environments where alternative vegetation states are influenced by disturbances, such as fire. The Klamath mountains (northern California and southwest Oregon, USA) are currently dominated by carbon rich and hyper-diverse temperate conifer forests, but climate change could disrupt the mechanisms promoting forest stability- regeneration and fire tolerance-- via shifts in the fire regime in conjunction with lower fitness of conifers under a hotter climate. Understanding how this landscape will respond to near-term climate change (before 2100) is critical for predicting potential climate change feedbacks and to developing sound forest conservation and management plans. Using a landscape simulation model, we estimate that 1/3 of the Klamath could transition from conifer forest to shrub/hardwood chaparral, triggered by an enhanced fire activity coupled with lower post-fire conifer establishment. Such shifts were more prevalent under higher climate change forcing (RCP 8.5) but were also simulated under the climate of 1950-2000, reflecting the joint influences of early warming trends and historical forest legacies. Our results demonstrate that there is a large potential for loss of conifer forest dominance--and associated carbon stocks and biodiversity- in the Klamath before the end of the century, and that some losses would likely occur even without the influence of climate change. Thus, in the Klamath and other forested landscapes subject to similar feedback dynamics, major ecosystem shifts should be expected when climate change disrupts key stabilizing feedbacks that maintain the dominance of long-lived, slowly regenerating trees.",

One such example is the production of metal-detoxifying siderophores.

We show that the proportion of siderophore-producing taxa increases along a natural heavy metal gradient. A causal link between metal contamination and siderophore production was subsequently demonstrated in a microcosm experiment in compost, in which we observed changes in community composition towards taxa that produce relatively more siderophores following copper contamination. We confirmed the selective benefit of siderophores by showing that taxa producing large amount of siderophores suffered less growth inhibition in toxic copper. Our results suggest that ecological selection will favour siderophore-mediated decontamination, with important consequences for potential remediation strategies.\\n\\nAuthorshipEH, SOB, AL, DJH, EvV, AB conceived and designed the experiment.

    "abstract": "While studies increasingly document long-term change in community composition, whether long-term change occurs gradually or via rapid reorganization events remains unclear. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and a change-point model to examine the long-term dynamics of a desert rodent community undergoing compositional change over a 38-year span. Our approach detected three rapid reorganization events, where changes in the relative abundances of dominant and rare species occurred, and a separate period of increased variance in the structure of the community. These events coincided with time periods--possibly related to climate events--where the total abundance of rodents was extremely low. There are a variety of processes that could link low abundance events with a higher probability of rapid ecological transitions, including higher importance of stochastic processes (i.e., competitive interactions or priority effects) and the removal of structuring effects of competitive dominants or incumbent species. Continued study of the dynamics of community change will provide important information not only on the processes structuring communities, but will also provide guidance for forecasting how communities will undergo change in the future.",

Because transient species interact differently than non-transients with their biotic and abiotic environment, it is important to characterize the prevalence of these species and how they impact our understanding of ecological systems. We quantified the prevalence and impact of transient species in communities using data on over 17,000 community time series spanning an array of ecosystems, taxonomic groups, and spatial scales. We found that transient species are a general feature of communities regardless of taxa or ecosystem. The proportion of these species decreases with spatial scale leading to a need to control for scale in comparative work. Removing transient species from analyses influences the form of a suite of commonly studied ecological patterns including species-abundance distributions, species-energy relationships, species-area relationships, and temporal turnover. Careful consideration should be given to whether transient species are included in analyses depending on the theoretical and practical relevance of these species for the question being studied.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-catenin acts as a transcriptional co-activator in the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway and a cytoplasmic effector in cadherin-based cell adhesion. These functions are ancient within animals, but the earliest steps in {beta}-catenin evolution remain unresolved due to limited data from key lineages - sponges, ctenophores and placozoans. Previous studies in sponges have characterized {beta}-catenin expression dynamics and used GSK3B antagonists to ectopically activate the Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway; both approaches rely upon untested assumptions about the conservation of {beta}-catenin function and regulation in sponges. Here, we test these assumptions using an antibody raised against {beta}-catenin from the sponge Ephydatia muelleri. We find that cadherin-complex genes co-precipitate with endogenous Em {beta}-catenin from cell lysates, but that Wnt pathway components do not. However, through immunostaining we detect both cell boundary and nuclear populations, and we find evidence that Em {beta}-catenin is a conserved substrate of GSK3B. Collectively, these data support conserved roles for Em {beta}-catenin in both cell adhesion and Wnt signaling. Additionally, we find evidence for an Em {beta}-catenin population associated with the distal ends of F-actin stress fibers in apparent cell-substrate adhesion structures that resemble focal adhesions. This finding suggests a fundamental difference in the adhesion properties of sponge tissues relative to other animals, in which the adhesion functions of {beta}-catenin are typically restricted to cell-cell adhesions.",

    "abstract": "Two datasets, the geologic record and the genetic content of extant organisms, provide complementary insights into the history of how key molecular components have shaped or driven global environmental and macroevolutionary trends. Changes in global physicochemical modes over time are thought to be a consistent feature of this relationship between Earth and life, as life is thought to have been optimizing protein functions for the entirety of its [~]3.8 billion years of history on Earth. Organismal survival depends on how well critical genetic and metabolic components can adapt to their environments, reflecting an ability to optimize efficiently to changing conditions. The geologic record provides an array of biologically independent indicators of macroscale atmospheric and oceanic composition, but provides little in the way of the exact behavior of the molecular components that influenced the compositions of these reservoirs. By reconstructing sequences of proteins that might have been present in ancient organisms, we can identify a subset of possible sequences that may have been optimized to these ancient environmental conditions. How can extant life be used to reconstruct ancestral phenotypes? Configurations of ancient sequences can be inferred from the diversity of extant sequences, and then resurrected in the lab to ascertain their biochemical attributes. One way to augment sequence-based, single-gene methods to obtain a richer and more reliable picture of the deep past, is to resurrect inferred ancestral protein sequences in living organisms, where their phenotypes can be exposed in a complex molecular-systems context, and to then link consequences of those phenotypes to biosignatures that were preserved in the independent historical repository of the geological record. As a first-step beyond single molecule reconstruction to the study of functional molecular systems, we present here the ancestral sequence reconstruction of the beta-carbonic anhydrase protein. We assess how carbonic anhydrase proteins meet our selection criteria for reconstructing ancient biosignatures in the lab, which we term paleophenotype reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Polymorphic phenotypes of mammalian coat color have been important to the study of genetics and evolution, but little is known about the heritability and fitness consequences of variation in complex coat pattern traits in wild populations. Understanding the current evolution of coat patterns requires reliably measuring traits, quantifying heritability of the traits, and identifying the fitness consequences of specific phenotypes. Giraffe coat markings are highly variable and it has been hypothesized that variation in coat patterns most likely affects fitness by camouflaging neonates against predators. We quantified spot pattern traits of wild Masai giraffes using image analysis software, determined whether spot pattern traits were heritable, and assessed whether variation in heritable spot pattern traits was related to fitness as measured by juvenile survival. The methods we described comprise a framework for objective quantification of mammalian coat pattern traits based on photographic coat pattern data. We demonstrated that characteristics of giraffe coat spot shape are heritable. We did not find evidence for juvenile survival consequences of variation in spot traits, suggesting that spot traits are currently not under strong directional, disruptive, or stabilizing selection for neonate camouflage in our study population, but our sample size could not detect small differences in survival. Spot trait variation also may be more relevant to other components of fitness, such as adult survival or fecundity. We hope this case study will inspire further investigations of coat pattern traits.",

    "abstract": "High-affinity antibodies arise within weeks of infection from the evolution of B cell receptors under selection to improve antigen recognition. This rapid adaptation is enabled by the frequency and distribution of highly mutable \\\"hotspotx\\\" motifs in B cell receptor genes. High mutability in antigen binding regions (CDRs) creates variation in binding affinity, whereas low mutability in structurally important regions (FRs) may reduce the frequency of destabilizing mutations. During the response, the loss of mutational hotspots and changes in their distribution across CDRs and FRs are predicted to compromise the adaptability of B cell receptors, yet the contributions of different mechanisms to gains and losses of hotspots remain unclear. We reconstructed changes in anti-HIV B cell receptor sequences and show that mutability losses were about 60% more frequent than gains in both CDRs and FRs, with the higher relative mutability of CDRs maintained throughout the response. At least 34% of the mutability losses were caused by synonymous mutations. However, non-synonymous substitutions caused most of the mutability loss in CDRs. Because CDRs also show strong positive selection, this result suggests positive selection contributed to as much as 66% of the mutability loss in those regions. Although recurrent adaptation to the evolving virus could indirectly select for high mutation rates, we found no evidence of indirect selection to increase or retain hotspots. Our results suggest mutability losses are intrinsic to the neutral and adaptive evolution of B cell populations and might constrain their adaptation to rapidly evolving pathogens such as HIV and influenza.",

    "abstract": "Turnovers of sex-determining systems represent important diversifying forces across eukaryotes. Shifts in sex chromosomes, but conservation of the master sex-determining genes, characterize distantly-related animal lineages. Yet in plants, where separate sexes have evolved repeatedly and sex chromosomes are typically homomorphic, we do not know whether such translocations drive turnovers within closely related groups. This phenomenon can only be demonstrated by identifying sex-associated nucleotide sequences, still largely unknown in plants. The wild North American octoploid strawberries (Fragaria) exhibit separate sexes (dioecy) with homomorphic, female heterogametic (ZW) inheritance, yet sex maps to at least three different chromosomes. To characterize these turnovers, we sequenced the complete genomes of 60 plants of known sex from five Fragaria taxa. We identified 31-mers unique to females and assembled their reads into contigs. Remarkably, a short (13 kb) sequence is observed in nearly all females and never in male-fertile individuals, implicating it as the sex-determining region (SDR). This female-specific \\\"SDR cassette\\\" contains both a gene with a known role in fruit and pollen production and a novel retrogene absent on Z and autosomal chromosomes. Comparing SDR cassettes across taxa reveals a history of repeated translocation, which can be ordered temporally due to the capture of adjacent sequence with each successive move. The accumulation of these \\\"souvenirs\\\" suggests an adaptive basis for the expanding (up to at least 23 kb) hemizygous region. This is the first plant SDR known to be translocated, and it suggests a new mechanism (\\\"move-lock-grow\\\") for expansion and diversification of incipient sex chromosomes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSex chromosomes frequently restructure themselves during organismal evolution, often becoming highly differentiated. This dynamic process is poorly understood for most taxa, especially during the early stages typical of many dioecious plants. In wild strawberries, a sex-determining region of DNA has repeatedly changed its genomic location, each time increasing the size of the hemizygous female-specific sequence. This observation shows for the first time that plant sex regions can \\\"jump\\\", and suggests that this phenomenon may be adaptive by gathering and locking new genes into linkage with sex. This conserved and presumed causal sequence with a variable genomic location presents a unique opportunity to understand how sex chromosomes first begin to differentiate.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive ability is an important predictor of lifelong physical and mental well-being and its impairments are associated with many psychiatric disorders. Higher cognitive ability is also associated with greater educational attainment and increased household income. Understanding neural mechanisms underlying cognitive ability is therefore of crucial importance for determining the nature of these associations. In the current study, we examined the spontaneous activity of the brain at rest to investigate its relationships with not only cognitive ability, but also educational attainment and household income. We used a large sample of resting-state neuroimaging data from UK Biobank (N=3,950). Firstly, analysis at the whole-brain level showed that connections involving the default mode network (DMN), fronto-parietal network (FPN) and cingulo-opercular network (CON) were significantly positively associated with levels of cognitive performance assessed by a verbal-numerical reasoning test (standardised {beta} ranged from 0.054 to 0.097). Connections associated with higher levels of cognitive performance were also significantly positively associated with educational attainment (r=0.48, N=4,160) and household income (r=0.38, N=3,793). Further, analysis on the coupling of functional networks showed that better cognitive performance was associated with more positive DMN-CON connections, decreased cross-hemisphere connections between homotopic network in CON and FPN, and stronger CON-FPN connections (absolute {beta} ranged from 0.034 to 0.063). The present study finds that variation in brain resting state functional connectivity associated with individual differences in cognitive ability, largely involving DMN and lateral prefrontal networks. Additionally, we provide further evidence of shared neural associations of cognitive ability, educational attainment, and household income.",

    "abstract": "Clinical pain is difficult to study using standard Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging because it is often ongoing and, if evoked, it is associated with stimulus-correlated motion. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) offers an attractive alternative. This study used arm repositioning to evoke clinically-relevant musculoskeletal pain in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome. Fifty-five patients were scanned using a multi post-labelling delay pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) sequence, first with both arms along the body and then with the affected arm raised into a painful position. Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned as a control group. Arm repositioning resulted in increased perfusion in brain regions involved in sensory processing and movement integration, such as the contralateral primary motor and primary somatosensory cortex, mid- and posterior cingulate cortex, and, bilaterally, in the insular cortex/operculum, putamen, thalamus, midbrain and cerebellum. Perfusion in the thalamus, midbrain and cerebellum was larger in the patient group. Results of a post hoc analysis suggested that the observed perfusion changes were related to pain rather than arm repositioning. This study showed that ASL can be useful in research on clinical ongoing musculoskeletal pain but the technique is not sensitive enough to detect small differences in perfusion.",
