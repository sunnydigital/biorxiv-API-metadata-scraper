    "abstract": "It is widely known that the sensitivity analysis plays a major role in computing the strength of the influence of involved factors in any phenomena under investigation. When applied to expression profiles of various intra/extracellular factors that form an integral part of a signaling pathway, the variance and density based analysis yields a range of sensitivity indices for individual as well as various combinations of factors. These combinations denote the higher order interactions among the involved factors. Computation of higher order interactions is often time consuming but they give a chance to explore the various combinations that might be of interest in the working mechanism of the pathway. For example, in a range of fourth order combinations among the various factors of the Wnt pathway, it would be easy to assess the influence of the destruction complex formed by APC, AXIN, CSKI and GSK3 interaction. But the effect of these combinations vary over time as measurements of fold changes and deviations in fold changes vary. In this work, after estimating the individual effects of factors for a higher order combination, the individual indices are considered as discriminative features. A combination, then is a multivariate feature set in higher order (>2). With an excessively large number of factors involved in the pathway, it is difficult to search for important combinations in a wide search space over different orders. Exploiting the analogy with the issues of prioritizing webpages using ranking algorithms, for a particular order, a full set of combinations of interactions can then be prioritized based on these features using a powerful ranking algorithm via support vectors. Recording the changing rankings of the combinations over time reveals of how higher order interactions behave within the pathway and when an intervention might be necessary to influence the interaction within the pathway. This could lead to development of time based therapeutic interventions.Code has been made available on Google drive at https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7Kkv8wlhPU-V1Fkd1dMSTd5ak0&usp=sharing",

    "abstract": "Two-photon microscopy of calcium-dependent sensors has enabled unprecedented recordings from vast populations of neurons. While the sensors and microscopes have matured over several generations of development, computational methods to process the resulting movies remain inefficient and can give results that are hard to interpret. Here we introduce Suite2p: a fast, accurate and complete pipeline that registers raw movies, detects active cells, extracts their calcium traces and infers their spike times. Suite2p runs on standard workstations, operates faster than real time, and recovers ~2 times more cells than the previous state-of-the-art method. Its low computational load allows routine detection of ~10,000 cells simultaneously with standard two-photon resonant-scanning microscopes. Recordings at this scale promise to reveal the fine structure of activity in large populations of neurons or large populations of subcellular structures such as synaptic boutons.",

    "abstract": "Identifying large repeat expansions such as those that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Fragile X syndrome is challenging for short-read (100-150 bp) whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. A solution to this problem is an important step towards integrating WGS into precision medicine. We have developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length. We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3,001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Taking the RP-PCR calls as the ground truth, our WGS-based method identified pathogenic repeat expansions with 98.1% sensitivity and 99.7% specificity. Further inspection identified that all 11 conflicts were resolved as errors in the original RP-PCR results. Compared against this updated result, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9% (2,786/2,789) of the wild type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining two identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 144 samples where every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions including examples associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreichs ataxia and Huntingtons disease and correctly flagged all of the known repeat expansions. Finally, we tested the accuracy of our method for short repeats by comparing our genotypes with results from 860 samples sized using fragment length analysis and determined that our calls were >95% accurate. ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions.",

    "abstract": "Seed systems have an important role in the distribution of high quality seed and improved varieties. The structure of seed networks also helps to determine the epidemiological risk for seedborne disease. We present a new method for evaluating the epidemiological role of nodes in seed networks, and apply it to a regional potato farmer consortium (CONPAPA) in Ecuador. We surveyed farmers to estimate the structure of networks of farmer seed tuber and ware potato transactions, and farmer information sources about pest and disease management. Then we simulated pathogen spread through seed transaction networks to identify priority nodes for disease detection. The likelihood of pathogen establishment was weighted based on the quality and/or quantity of information sources about disease management. CONPAPA staff and facilities, a market, and certain farms are priorities for disease management interventions, such as training, monitoring and variety dissemination. Advice from agrochemical store staff was common but assessed as significantly less reliable. Farmer access to information (reported number and quality of sources) was similar for both genders. Women had a smaller amount of the market share for seed-tubers and ware potato, however. Understanding seed system networks provides input for scenario analyses to evaluate potential system improvements.",

    "abstract": "The oncogenic Ras/MAPK pathway is evolutionary conserved across metazoans and is essential for many cellular functions. Mutant screens in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have been invaluable for elucidating Ras/MAPK pathway characteristics and identification of the genes involved. Almost all of these screens have been conducted in a single genetic background. However, phenotypic traits of induced mutations can vary widely depending on the genetic background. At the moment, we lack insight into how different genetic backgrounds modulate Ras/MAPK-signaling and which genetic modifiers are involved.\\n\\nWe previously introduced a gain-of-function mutation in the Ras/MAPK pathway gene let-60 in over 200 recombinant inbred lines (mutant introgressed RILs: miRILs) and detected genetic modifiers affecting this pathway by studying variation in vulval development. In the present study, we investigate how gene expression regulation is affected by the let-60 gain-of-function mutation and the genetic background by mapping eQTL using 33 miRILs. We found that the majority ([~]73%) of the 1516 detected cis-eQTL are not specific for the let-60 mutation, whereas most ([~]76%) of the 898 detected trans-eQTL are associated with the let-60 mutation. We detected 6 eQTL trans-bands that were specific for the interaction between the genetic background and the mutation. One of these eQTL hotspots co-localizes with the previously identified polymorphic Ras/MAPK modifier amx-2. Comparing gene expression profiles between transgenic lines expressing either the N2 or the CB4856 alleles of amx-2 showed the involvement of amx-2 in 79% of the trans-eQTLs for genes mapping to this trans-band.\\n\\nTogether, our results have revealed hidden loci affecting Ras/MAPK signaling using sensitized backgrounds in C. elegans. These loci harbor putative polymorphic modifier genes that would not have been detected using mutant screens in single genetic backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "Social functioning involves learning about the social networks in which we live and interact; knowing not just our friends, but also who is friends with our friends. Here we utilized a novel incidental learning paradigm and representational similarity analysis (RSA), a functional MRI multivariate pattern analysis technique, to examine the relationship between learning social networks and the brain's response to the faces within the networks. We found that accuracy of learning face pair relationships through observation is correlated with neural similarity patterns to those pairs in the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the left fusiform gyrus, and the subcallosal ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), all areas previously implicated in social cognition. This model was also significant in portions of the cerebellum and thalamus. These results show that the similarity of neural patterns represent how accurately we understand the closeness of any two faces within a network, regardless of their true relationship. Our findings indicate that these areas of the brain not only process knowledge and understanding of others, but also support learning relations between individuals in groups.\\n\\nSignificance StatementKnowledge of the relationships between people is an important skill that helps us interact in a highly social world. While much is known about how the human brain represents the identity, goals, and intentions of others, less is known about how we represent knowledge about social relationships between others. In this study, we used functional neuroimaging to demonstrate that patterns in human brain activity represent memory for recently learned social connections.",

    "abstract": "Cancer can be viewed as a set of different diseases with distinctions based on tissue origin, driver mutations, and genetic signatures. Accordingly, each of these distinctions have been used to classify cancer subtypes and to reveal common features. Here, we present a different analysis of cancer based on amino acid mutation signatures. Non-negative Matrix Factorization and principal component analysis of 29 cancers revealed six amino acid mutation signatures, including four signatures that were dominated by either arginine to histidine (Arg>His) or glutamate to lysine (Glu>Lys) mutations. Sample-level analyses reveal that while some cancers are heterogeneous, others are largely dominated by one type of mutation. Using a non-overlapping set of samples from the COSMIC somatic mutation database, we validate five of six mutation signatures, including signatures with prominent arginine to histidine (Arg>His) or glutamate to lysine (Glu>Lys) mutations. This suggests that our classification of cancers based on amino acid mutation patterns may provide avenues of inquiry pertaining to specific protein mutations that may generate novel insights into cancer biology.",

We present here the study of the interactions of these amphiphilic helices with the lipid membranes by combining the all-atom and coarse-grained simulations. In the all-atom simulations, we find that the amphiphilic helices of Epsin and Sar1p have a shallower insertion depth into the membrane compared to the amphiphilic helix of Arf1, but remarkably, the amphiphilic helices of Epsin and Sar1p induce higher asymmetry in the lipid packing between the two monolayers of the membrane. The insertion depth of amphiphilic helix into the membrane is determined not only by the overall hydrophobicity but also by the specific distribution of polar and non-polar residues along the helix. To directly compare their ability of deforming the membrane, we further apply coarse-grained simulations to investigate the membranes deformation under the insertion of multiple helices. Importantly, it is found that the amphiphilic helices of Epsin and Sar1p generate a larger membrane curvature than that of Arf1, in accord with the experimental results qualitatively. These findings enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the protein-driven membrane remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma mobile is a bacterium that uses a unique mechanism to glide on solid surfaces at a velocity of up to 4.5 {micro}m/s. Its gliding machinery comprises hundreds of units that generate the force for gliding based on the energy derived from ATP; the units catch and pull on sialylated oligosaccharides fixed to solid surfaces. In the present study, we measured the stall force of wild-type and mutant strains of M. mobile carrying a bead manipulated using optical tweezers. The strains that had been enhanced for binding exhibited weaker stall forces than the wild-type strain, indicating that stall force is related to force generation rather than to binding. The stall force of the wild-type strain decreased linearly from 113 to 19 pN following the addition of 0-0.5 mM free sialyllactose (a sialylated oligosaccharide), with a decrease in the number of working units. Following the addition of 0.5 mM sialyllactose, the cells carrying a bead loaded using optical tweezers exhibited stepwise movements with force increments. The force increments ranged from 1 to 2 pN. Considering the 70-nm step size, this small unit force may be explained by the large gear ratio involved in the M. mobile gliding machinery.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEMycoplasma is a genus of bacteria that parasitizes animals. Dozens of Mycoplasma species glide over the tissues of their hosts during infection. The gliding machinery of Mycoplasma mobile, the fastest species, includes intracellular motors and hundreds of legs on the cell surface. In the present study, we precisely measured force generation using a highly focused laser beam arrangement (referred to as optical tweezers) under various conditions. The measurements obtained in this study suggest that the rapid gliding exhibited by M. mobile arises from the large gear ratio of its gliding machinery.",

This complexity arises from the rate at which new studies are published and from the terminology that varies widely from study-to-study and even more so from discipline-to-discipline. One way to investigate and manage this problem is to build a \\\"semantic space\\\" that maps the different vocabulary used in functional neuroimaging literature. Such a semantic space will also help identify the primary research domains of neuroimaging and their most commonly reported brain regions. In this work, we analyzed the multivariate semantic structure of abstracts in Neurosynth and found that there are six primary domains of the functional neuroimaging literature each with their own preferred reported brain regions. Our analyses also highlight possible semantic sources of reported brain regions within and across domains because some research topics (e.g., memory disorders, substance use disorder) use heterogeneous terminology. Furthermore, we highlight the growth and decline of the primary domains over time. Finally, we note that our techniques and results form the basis of a \\\"recommendation engine\\\" that could help readers better navigate the neuroimaging literature.",

    "abstract": "One approach to the reconstruction of infectious disease transmission trees from pathogen genomic data has been to use a phylogenetic tree, reconstructed from pathogen sequences, and annotate its internal nodes to provide a reconstruction of which host each lineage was in at each point in time. If only one pathogen lineage can be transmitted to a new host (i.e. the transmission bottleneck is complete), this corresponds to partitioning the nodes of the phylogeny into connected regions, each of which represents evolution in an individual host. These partitions define the possible transmission trees that are consistent with a given phylogenetic tree. However, the mathematical properties of the transmission trees given a phylogeny remain largely unexplored. Here, we describe a procedure to calculate the number of possible transmission trees for a given phylogeny, and we show how to uniformly sample from these transmission trees. The procedure is outlined for situations where one sample is available from each host and trees do not have branch lengths, and we also provide extensions for incomplete sampling, multiple sampling, and the application to time trees in a situation where limits on the period during which each host could have been infected are known. The sampling algorithm is available as an R package (STraTUS).",

We found that a polyglutamine domain in the SNF5 subunit of the yeast SWI/SNF complex, histidines within this sequence, and transient intracellular acidification are required for efficient transcriptional regulation during carbon starvation. We hypothesized that a pH-driven oligomerization of the SNF5 polyglutamine region is required for transcriptional reprogramming. In support of this idea, we found that a synthetic spidroin domain from spider silk, which is soluble at pH 7 but oligomerizes at pH ~ 6.3, could partially complement the function of the SNF5 polyglutamine. These results suggest that the SNF5 polyglutamine domain acts as a pH-driven transcriptional regulator.",

Herein, we demonstrate a direct effect of p110{delta} inactivation via CAL-101 on murine and human CD8+ T cells that promotes a strong undifferentiated memory phenotype (elevated CD62L/CCR7, CD127 and Tcf7). These CAL-101 T cells also persisted longer after transfer and exerted stronger antitumor immunity compared to traditionally expanded CD8+ T cells in two solid tumor models. Thus, this report describes a novel direct enhancement of CD8+ T cell memory by a p110{delta} inhibitor that leads to markedly improved tumor regression. This finding has significant implications to improve outcomes from next generation cancer immunotherapies.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIIn vitro blockade of PI3K p110{delta} with CAL-101 endows antitumor T cells with a stronger memory phenotype than those treated with AKTi\\nC_LIO_LIThe strong memory phenotype of CAL-101 treated cells translates into improved survival of mice bearing aggressive tumors after adoptive transfer of these T cells\\nC_LIO_LIHuman CAR engineered T cells treated with CAL-101 possess an enhanced memory phenotype and robust antitumor efficacy\\nC_LIO_LIThe antitumor efficacy of CAL-101 primed T cells is not mediated by high CD62L or CD127 expression, but is likely driven by their stem memory phenotype\\nC_LI\\n\\neTOC BlurbBowers et al report a novel function of PI3K blockade using the p110{delta} subunit inhibitor CAL-101 to induce memory and antitumor potency in CD8+ T cells.

    "abstract": "Human herpesviruses 6A and 6B (HHV6-A and HHV-6B; species Human herpesvirus 6A and Human herpesvirus 6B) have the capacity to integrate into telomeres, the essential capping structures of chromosomes that play roles in cancer and ageing. About 1% of people worldwide are carriers of chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (ciHHV-6), which is inherited as a genetic trait. Understanding the consequences of integration for the evolution of the viral genome, for the telomere and for the risk of disease associated with carrier status is hampered by a lack of knowledge about ciHHV-6 genomes. Here, we report an analysis of 28 ciHHV-6 genomes and show that they are significantly divergent from the few modern non-integrated HHV-6 strains for which complete sequences are currently available. In addition ciHHV-6B genomes in Europeans are more closely related to each other than to ciHHV-6B genomes from China and Pakistan, suggesting regional variation of the trait. Remarkably, at least one group of European ciHHV-6B carriers has inherited the same ciHHV-6B genome, integrated in the same telomere allele, from a common ancestor estimated to have existed 24,500 {+/-}10,600 years ago. Despite the antiquity of some, and possibly most, germline HHV-6 integrations, the majority of ciHHV-6B (95%) and ciHHV-6A (72%) genomes contain a full set of intact viral genes and therefore appear to have the capacity for viral gene expression and full reactivation.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEInheritance of HHV-6A or HHV-6B integrated into a telomere occurs at a low frequency in most populations studied to date but its characteristics are poorly understood. However, stratification of ciHHV-6 carriers in modern populations due to common ancestry is an important consideration for genome-wide association studies that aim to identify disease risks for these people. Here we present full sequence analysis of 28 ciHHV-6 genomes and show that ciHHV-6B in many carriers with European ancestry most likely originated from ancient integration events in a small number of ancestors. We propose that ancient ancestral origins for ciHHV-6A and ciHHV-6B are also likely in other populations. Moreover, despite their antiquity, all of the ciHHV-6 genomes appear to retain the capacity to express viral genes and most are predicted to be capable of full viral reactivation. These discoveries represent potentially important considerations in immune-compromised patients, in particular in organ transplantation and in stem cell therapy.",

    "abstract": "Developing seeds undergo coordinated physiological and morphological changes crucial for development of the embryo, dormancy and germination. The metabolic changes that occur during seed development are regulated by interconnected network of Transcription Factors (TFs) that regulate gene expression in a spatiotemporal manner. The complexity of these networks is such that the TFs that play key regulatory roles during seed development are largely unknown. In this study, we created a genome-scale regulatory network dedicated to describing regulation of biological processes within various compartments and developmental stages of Arabidopsis seeds. Differential network analysis revealed key TFs that rewire their targeting patterns specifically during seed development, many of which were already known, and a few novel ones that we verified experimentally. Our method shows that a high-resolution tissue-specific transcriptome dataset can be accurately modeled as a functional regulatory network predictive of related TFs. We provide an easy to use webtool using which researchers can upload a newly generated transcriptome and identify key TFs important to their dataset as well as gauge their regulatory effect on phenotypes observed in the experiment. We refer to this network as Seed Active Network (SANe) and made it accessible at https://plantstress-pereira.uark.edu/SANe/. We anticipate SANe will facilitate the discovery of TFs yet unknown for their involvement in seed related metabolic pathways and provide an interface to generate new hypothesis for experimentation.",

    "abstract": "ImportanceThere have been recent concerns about a higher incidence of mortality by suicide in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To our knowledge, no large cohort studies have examined which features of autism may lead to suicidal ideation and behaviour, and whether there are any potential modifiable mechanisms.\\n\\nObjectiveTo examine the hypothesis that ASD diagnosis and traits in childhood are associated with suicidal thoughts, plans and self-harm at 16 years, and that any of the observed associations are explained by depression in adolescence at 12 years.\\n\\nDesign, setting and participantsProspective investigation of associations between ASD diagnosis and autistic traits with suicidal ideation and behaviour and a potential risk pathway via depression in early adolescence in 5,031 members of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.\\n\\nMain outcomes and measuresHistory of self-harm with and without suicidal intent, suicidal thoughts and plans at 16 years assessed using a detailed self-report questionnaire. Exposures were ASD diagnosis and four measures (the coherence subscale of the Childrens Communication Checklist, the Social and Communication Disorders Checklist, a repetitive behaviour measure, and the sociability temperament subscale of the Emotionality, Activity and Sociability scale) dichotomised to represent the autism trait groups. Depressive symptoms in early adolescence were measured by the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire at 12 years.\\n\\nResultsChildren with impaired social communication had a higher risk of self-harm with suicidal intent (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.28, 3.34), suicidal thoughts (1.42 times (95% CI 1.06, 1.91) and suicidal plans (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.09, 3.47) by the age of 16 years as compared to those without. There was no evidence for an association between ASD diagnosis and the outcomes although these analyses were imprecise due to small numbers. There was also no evidence of an association between other autism trait measures and the outcomes. Approximately 32% of the total estimated association between social communication impairment and self-harm was explained by depressive symptoms at age 12 years.\\n\\nConclusionsImpairments in social communication are important in relation to suicidality. Early identification and management of depression may be a preventative mechanism and future research identifying other modifiable mechanisms may lead to preventative action or interventions against suicidal behaviour in this high-risk group.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMathematical modeling has an extensive history in vector-borne disease epidemiology, and is increasingly used for prediction, intervention design, and understanding mechanisms. Many of these studies rely on parameter estimation to link models and data, and to tailor predictions and counterfactuals to specific settings. However, few studies have formally evaluated whether vector-borne disease models can properly estimate the parameters of interest given the constraints of a particular dataset.\\n\\nMethodology/Principle FindingsIdentifiability methods allow us to examine whether model parameters can be estimated uniquely--a lack of consideration of such issues can result in misleading or incorrect parameter estimates and model predictions. Here, we evaluate both structural (theoretical) and practical identifiability of a commonly used compartmental model of mosquitoborne disease, using 2010 dengue epidemic in Taiwan as a case study. We show that while the model is structurally identifiable, it is practically unidentifiable under a range of human and mosquito time series measurement scenarios. In particular, the transmission parameters form a practically identifiable combination and thus cannot be estimated separately, which can lead to incorrect predictions of the effects of interventions. However, in spite of unidentifiability of the individual parameters, the basic reproduction number was successfully estimated across the unidentifiable parameter ranges. These identifiability issues can be resolved by directly measuring several additional human and mosquito life-cycle parameters both experimentally and in the field.\\n\\nConclusionsWhile we only consider the simplest case for the model, without explicit environmental drivers, we show that a commonly used model of vector-borne disease is unidentifiable from human and mosquito incidence data, making it difficult or impossible to estimate parameters or assess intervention strategies. This work illustrates the importance of examining identifiability when linking models with data to make predictions, and particularly highlights the importance of combining experimental, field, and case data if we are to successfully estimate epidemiological and ecological parameters using models.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMathematical models have seen increasing use in understanding transmission processes, developing interventions, and predicting disease incidence and prevalence. Vector-borne diseases in particular present both a challenge and an opportunity for modeling, due to the complex interactions between host and vector species. A key step in many of these studies is connecting transmission models with data to infer parameters and make useful predictions, which requires careful consideration of identifiability and uncertainty of the model parameters. Whether due to intrinsic limitations of the model structure, or practical limitations of the data collected, is common that many different parameter values may yield the same or very similar fits to the data, making it impossible to successfully estimate the parameters. This issue of parameter unidentifiability can have broad implications for our ability to draw conclusions from mechanistic models--in some cases making it difficult or impossible to generate specific predictions, forecasts, or parameter estimates from a given model and data. Here, we evaluate these questions for a commonly-used model of vectorborne disease, examining how parameter uncertainty and unidentifiability can affect intervention predictions, estimation of the basic reproduction number, and other public health conclusions drawn from the model.",

We propose a novel methodology that combines predictions from epidemiological models with phylogenetic and structural analyses to identify such targets. Epidemiological models predict that strong immune selection can cause antigenic variants to exist in non-overlapping combinations. A corollary of this theory is that targets of immunity may be identified by searching for non-overlapping associations among antigenic variants. We applied this concept to the AMA-1 protein of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and found strong signatures of immune selection among certain regions of low variability which could render them ideal vaccine candidates.",

In the slime mold Dictyostelium, previous studies have shown the existence of a DNA methyltransferase (DNMA) belonging to the DNMT2 family, but the extent and function of 5-methyl-cytosine in the genome is unclear. Here we present the whole genome DNA methylation profile of Dictyostelium discoideum using deep coverage, replicate sequencing of bisulfite converted gDNA extracted from post-starvation cells. We find an overall very low level of DNA methylation, occurring at only 462 out of the ~7.5 million (0.006%) cytosines in the genome. Despite this sparse profile, significant methylation can be detected at 51 of these sites in replicate experiments, suggesting they are robust targets for DNA methylation. These 5-methyl-cytosines are associated with a broad range of protein-coding genes, tRNA-encoding genes and retrotransposable elements. Our data provides evidence of a minimal, but functional, methylome in Dictyostelium, thereby making Dictyostelium a candidate model organism to further investigate the evolutionary function of DNA methylation.",

    "abstract": "Many climate change models predict increases in mean temperature, and increases in frequency and magnitude of temperature fluctuations. These potential shifts may impact ectotherms in several ways, including how they are affected by disease. Shifts in temperature may especially affect amphibians, a group with populations that have been challenged by several pathogens. Because amphibian hosts invest more in immunity at warmer than cooler temperatures and parasites may acclimate to temperature shifts faster than hosts (creating lags in optimal host immunity), researchers have hypothesized that a temperature shift from cold-to-warm might result in increased amphibian sensitivity to pathogens, whereas a shift from warm-to-cold might result in decreased sensitivity. Support for components of this climate-variability based hypothesis have been provided by prior studies of the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) that causes the disease chytridiomycosis in amphibians. We experimentally tested whether temperature shifts before Bd exposure alter susceptibility to Bd in the larval stage of two amphibian species - western toads (Anaxyrus boreas) and northern red legged frogs (Rana aurora). Both host species harbored elevated Bd infection intensities under constant cold (15{degrees} C) temperature in comparison to constant warm (20{degrees} C) temperature. Additionally, both species experienced an increase in Bd infection abundance when shifted to 20{degrees} C from 15{degrees} C, compared to a constant 20{degrees} C but they experienced a decrease in Bd when shifted to 15{degrees} C from 20{degrees} C, compared to a constant 15{degrees} C. These results are in contrast to prior studies of adult amphibians that found increased susceptibility to Bd infection after a temperature shift in either direction, highlighting the potential for species and stage differences in the temperature-dependence of chytridiomycosis.",

In addition, each of the transcription factors regulated a different set of extracellular matrix components and signalling molecules, which define local molecular niches important for connective tissue development and function.\\n\\nConclusionsThe established regulatory network identifies common and distinct molecular signatures downstream of five connective tissue-associated transcription factors and provides insight into the signalling pathways governing limb connective tissue differentiation. It also suggests a concept whereby local molecular niches can be created via the expression of specific transcription factors impinging on the specification of microenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Most studies on seasonal influenza A/H3N2 virus adaptation have focused on the main antigenic gene, haemagglutinin. However, there is increasing evidence that the genome-wide genetic background of novel antigenic variants can influence these variants emergence probabilities and impact their patterns of dominance in the population. This suggests that non-antigenic genes may be important in shaping the viral evolutionary dynamics. To better understand the role of selection on non-antigenic genes in the adaptive evolution of seasonal influenza viruses, we here develop a simple population genetic model that considers a virus with one antigenic and one non-antigenic gene segment. By simulating this model under different regimes of selection and reassortment, we find that the empirical patterns of lineage turnover for the antigenic and non-antigenic gene segments are best captured when there is both limited viral coinfection and selection operating on both gene segments. In contrast, under a scenario of only neutral evolution in the non-antigenic gene segment, we see persistence of multiple lineages for long periods of time in that segment, which is not compatible with the observed molecular evolutionary patterns. Further, we find that reassortment, occurring in coinfected individuals, can increase the speed of viral adaptive evolution by primarily reducing selective interference and genetic linkage effects mediated by the non-antigenic gene segment. Together, these findings suggest that, for influenza, with 6 internal or non-antigenic gene segments, the evolutionary dynamics of novel antigenic variants are likely to be influenced by the genome-wide genetic background as a result of linked selection among both beneficial and deleterious mutations.",

    "abstract": "Anthozoa class red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) are frequently used as biological markers, with far-red emitting variants ({lambda}em ~ 600 - 900 nm) sought for whole animal imaging because biological tissues are permeable to light in this range. A barrier to the use of naturally occurring RFP variants as molecular markers is that all are tetrameric, which is not ideal for cell biological applications. Efforts to engineer monomeric RFPs have usually produced dimmer and blue-shifted variants, as the chromophore is sensitive to small structural perturbations. In fact, despite much effort, only four native RFPs have been successfully monomerized, leaving the vast majority of RFP biodiversity untapped in biomarker development. Here we report the generation of monomeric variants of HcRed and mCardinal, both far-red dimers, and describe a comprehensive methodology for the rapid monomerization of novel red-shifted oligomeric RFPs. Among the resultant variants, is mKelly1 (emission maximum: {lambda}em = 656 nm), which along with the recently reported mGarnet2 (1), forms a new class of bright, monomeric, far-red FPs.",

    "abstract": "Differential expression experiments or other analyses often end in a list of genes. Pathway enrichment analysis is one method to discern important biological signals and patterns from noisy expression data. However, pathway enrichment analysis may perform suboptimally in situations where there are multiple implicated pathways - such as in the case of genes that define subtypes of complex diseases. Our simulation study shows that in this setting, standard overrepresentation analysis identifies many false positive pathways along with the true positives. These false positives hamper investigators attempts to glean biological insights from enrichment analysis. We develop and evaluate an approach that combines community detection over functional networks with pathway enrichment to reduce false positives. Our simulation study demonstrates that a large reduction in false positives can be obtained with a small decrease in power. Though we hypothesized that multiple communities might underlie previously described subtypes of high-grade serous ovarian cancer and applied this approach, our results do not support this hypothesis. In summary, applying community detection before enrichment analysis may ease interpretation for complex gene sets that represent multiple distinct pathways.",

    "abstract": "Although driver genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been investigated in various previous genetic studies, prevalence of key driver genes among heterogeneous populations is unknown. Moreover, the phenotypic associations of these driver genes are poorly understood. This report aims to reveal the phenotypic impacts of a group of consensus driver genes in HCC. We used MutSigCV and OncodriveFM modules implemented in the IntOGen pipeline to identify consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts comprising 1,494 samples in total. To access their global impacts, we used TCGA mutations and copy number variations to predict the transcriptomics data, under generalized linear models. We further investigated the associations of the consensus driver genes to patient survival, age, gender, race and risk factors. We identify 10 consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts in total. Integrative analysis of driver mutations, copy number variations and transcriptomic data reveals that these consensus driver mutations and their copy number variations are associated with majority (62.5%) of the mRNA transcriptome, but only a small fraction (8.9%) of miRNAs. Genes associated with TP53, CTNNB1, and ARID1A mutations contribute to the tripod of most densely connected pathway clusters. These driver genes are significantly associated with patients overall survival. Some driver genes are significantly linked to HCC gender (CTNNB1, ALB, TP53 and AXIN1), race (TP53 and CDKN2A), and age (RB1) disparities. This study prioritizes a group of consensus drivers in HCC, which collectively show vast impacts on the phenotypes. These driver genes may warrant as valuable therapeutic targets of HCC.",

These rearrangements can be complex, resulting in fusions of multiple chromosomal fragments and generation of derivative chromosomes. While methods exist for detecting individual fusions, they are generally unable to reconstruct complex chained events. To overcome these limitations, we adopted a new optical mapping approach, allowing for megabase length DNA to be captured, and in turn rearranged genomes to be visualized without loss of integrity. Whole genome mapping (Bionano Genomics) of a well-studied highly rearranged liposarcoma cell line, resulted in 3,338 assembled haploid genome maps, including 101 fusion maps. These fusion maps represent 175 Mb of highly rearranged genomic regions, illuminating the complex architecture of chained fusions, including content, order, orientation, and size. Spanning the junction of 151 chromosomal translocations, we found a total of 32 Mb of novel interspersed sequences that were not detected from short-read sequencing. We demonstrate that optical mapping provides a powerful new approach for capturing a higher level of complex genomic architecture, creating a scaffold for renewed interpretation of sequencing data of particular relevance to human cancer.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease involving the selective death of upper and lower motor neurons in the primary motor cortex and spinal cord. A hallmark of ALS pathology is the accumulation of ubiquitinated protein inclusions within motor neurons. Previous studies suggest the sequestration of ubiquitin (Ub) into inclusions reduces the availability of free Ub, which is essential for cellular function and survival. However, the dynamics of the Ub landscape in ALS have not yet been described. Here we show that Ub homeostasis is altered in a SOD1 cell model of ALS. Utilising fluorescently tagged Ub, we followed the distribution of Ub in living cells expressing SOD1 and show that Ub is present at the earliest stages of SOD1 aggregation. We also report that cells containing aggregates of mutant SOD1 have greater ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) dysfunction as measured by the accumulation of the fluorescent proteasome reporter tdTomatoCL1. Furthermore, SOD1 aggregation is associated with the redistribution of Ub and depletion of the free Ub pool. Ubiquitomics analysis indicates that mutant SOD1 is associated with a shift of Ub to a pool of supersaturated proteins including those associated with oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism, corresponding with altered mitochondrial morphology and function. Taken together, these results suggest misfolded SOD1 contributes to UPS dysfunction and that Ub homeostasis is an important target for monitoring pathological changes in ALS.",

    "abstract": "Ring-forming AAA+ chaperones exert ATP-fueled substrate unfolding by threading through a central pore. This activity is potentially harmful requiring mechanisms for tight repression and substrate-specific activation. The AAA+ chaperone ClpC with the peptidase ClpP forms a bacterial protease essential to virulence and stress resistance. The adaptor MecA activates ClpC by targeting substrates and stimulating ClpC ATPase activity. We show how ClpC is repressed in its ground state by determining ClpC cryo-EM structures with and without MecA. ClpC forms large two-helical assemblies that associate via head-to-head contacts between coiled-coil middle domains (MDs). MecA converts this resting state to an active planar ring structure by binding to MD interaction sites. Loss of ClpC repression in MD mutants causes constitutive activation and severe cellular toxicity. These findings unravel an unexpected regulatory concept executed by coiled-coil MDs to tightly control AAA+ chaperone activity.",

    "abstract": "How did egalitarianism emerge in early human societies? In contrast to dominance hierarchies in non-human primates, human simple forager bands are typically egalitarian, with male hunters often serving as the collective alpha. Here we present a thermodynamics-inspired simple population model, based on stochastic optimization of dominance relationships, in which a dominance hierarchy of individuals with exclusively self-centered characteristics (the desire to dominate, resentment at being dominated) transitions spontaneously to egalitarianism as their capacity for language develops. Language, specifically gossip, allows resentment against being dominated to promote the formation of antidominance coalitions which destabilize the alpha position for individuals, leading to a phase transition in which a coalition of the full population suddenly becomes dominant. Thus, egalitarianism emerges suddenly as the optimal power sharing arrangement in a population of selfish individuals without any inherently altruistic qualities. We speculate that egalitarianism driven by punishment for exhibiting alpha-like behavior may then set the stage for genuinely altruistic traits to propagate as predicted by game theory models. Based on model simulations, we also predict that egalitarianism is a pre-condition for adaptation of tools as weapons. Potential implications for origins of human moral belief systems are discussed.",

We found that cohesin-SA1 drives stacking of cohesin rings at CTCF-bound sites and thereby contributes to the stabilization and preservation of TAD boundaries. In contrast, a more dynamic cohesin-SA2 promotes cell type-specific contacts between enhancers and promoters within TADs independently of CTCF.

Thirdly, when exposing human participants to polarised virtual reality environments, we found that navigation performance is anisotropic, in line with the use of parallax. Eye movements showed that participants preferentially viewed polarising cues, which correlated with navigation performance. Finally, using fMRI we found that the orientation of grid-cell-like representations in entorhinal cortex anchored to the environmental axis of greatest parallax information, orthogonal to the polarisation axis. In sum, we demonstrate a crucial role of the entorhinal grid system in reducing uncertainty in representations of self-location and find evidence for adaptive spatial computations underlying entorhinal representations in service of optimal navigation.",

Pitch discrimination performance is usually measured using two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) procedures in humans and go/no-go tasks in animals, potentially confounding human-to-animal comparisons. We have previously shown that pitch discrimination thresholds of ferrets on a 2AFC task are markedly poorer than those reported for go/no-go tasks in other non-human species (Walker et al., 2009). To better compare the pitch discrimination performance of ferret with other species, here we measure pitch change detection thresholds of ferrets and humans on a common, appetitive go/no-go task design. We found that ferrets pitch thresholds were ~10 times larger than that of humans on the go/no-go task, and were within the range of thresholds reported in other non-human species. Interestingly, ferrets thresholds were 100 times larger than human thresholds on a 2AFC pitch discrimination task using the same stimuli. These results emphasize that sensory discrimination thresholds can differ across tasks, particularly for non-human animals. Performance on our go/no-go task is likely to reflect different neurobiological processes than that on our 2AFC task, as the former required the subjects only to detect a pitch change while the latter required them to label the direction of the pitch change.\\n\\nABBREVIATIONS\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIPitch discrimination thresholds of ferrets were 10 times larger than those of humans on a go/no-go task\\nC_LIO_LIFerrets pitch thresholds are similar to those reported for a range of other mammals\\nC_LIO_LIPitch thresholds of ferrets, but not humans, were drastically better on the go/no-go task than a 2AFC task using the same stimuli\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Armillaria species are both devastating forest pathogens and some of the largest terrestrial organisms on Earth. They forage for hosts and achieve immense colony sizes using rhizomorphs, root-like multicellular structures of clonal dispersal. Here, we sequenced and analyzed genomes of four Armillaria species and performed RNA-Seq and quantitative proteomic analysis on seven invasive and reproductive developmental stages of A. ostoyae. Comparison with 22 related fungi revealed a significant genome expansion in Armillaria, affecting several pathogenicity-related genes, lignocellulose degrading enzymes and lineage-specific genes likely involved in rhizomorph development. Rhizomorphs express an evolutionarily young transcriptome that shares features with the transcriptomes of fruiting bodies and vegetative mycelia. Several genes show concomitant upregulation in rhizomorphs and fruiting bodies and shared cis-regulatory signatures in their promoters, providing genetic and regulatory insights into complex multicellularity in fungi. Our results suggest that the evolution of the unique dispersal and pathogenicity mechanisms of Armillaria might have drawn upon ancestral genetic toolkits for wood-decay, morphogenesis and complex multicellularity.",

    "abstract": "Cospeciation studies aim at investigating whether hosts and symbionts speciate simultaneously or whether the associations diversify through host shifts. This problem is often tackled through reconciliation analyses that map the symbiont phylogeny onto the host phylogeny by mixing different types of diversification events. These reconciliations can be difficult to interpret and not always biologically realistic. Researchers have underlined that the biogeographic histories of both hosts and symbionts influence the probability of cospeciation and host switches, but up to now no reconciliation software integrates geographic data. We present a new functionality in the Mowgli software that bridges this gap. The user can provide geographic information on both the host and symbiont extant and ancestral taxa. Constraints in the reconciliation algorithm have been implemented to generate biologically realistic codiversification scenarios. We apply our method to the fig/fig wasp association and infer diversification scenarios that differ from reconciliations ignoring geographic information. In addition, we updated the reconciliation viewer SylvX in order to visualize ancestral character states on the phylogenetic trees and highlight zones that are geographically inconsistent in reconciliations computed without geographic constraints. We suggest that the comparison of reconciliations obtained with and without constraints can help solving ambiguities in the biogeographic histories of the partners. With the development of robust methods in historical biogeography and the advent of next-generation sequencing that leads to better-resolved trees, a geography aware reconciliation method represents a substantial advance that is likely to be useful to researchers studying the evolution of biotic interactions and biogeography.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has become an indispensible tool for identifying causal mutations obtained from genetic screens. To reduce the number of causal mutation candidates typically uncovered by WGS, C. elegans researchers have developed several strategies. One involves crossing N2-background mutants to the polymorphic strain CB4856, which can be used to simultaneously identify mutant-strain variants and obtain high-density mapping information. This approach, however, is not well suited for uncovering mutations in complex genetic backgrounds, and CB4856 polymorphisms can alter phenotypes. Several other approaches make use of DNA variants introduced by mutagenesis. This information is used to implicate genomic regions with high densities of DNA lesions that persist after mutant backcrossing, but these methods provide lower mapping resolution than use of CB4856. To identify suppressor mutations using WGS, we developed a new approach termed the Sibling Subtraction Method (SSM). This method works by eliminating variants present in both mutants and their non-mutant siblings, thus greatly reducing the number of candidates. We used this method here with two members of the C. elegans NimA-related kinase family, nekl-2 and nekl-3. Combining weak aphenotypic alleles of nekl-2 and nekl-3 leads to penetrant molting defects and larval arrest. We isolated ~50 suppressors of nekl-2; nekl-3 synthetic lethality using F1-clonal screening methods and a toxin-based counter-selection strategy. When applied to five of the identified suppressors, SSM led to only one to four suppressor candidates per strain. Thus SSM is a powerful approach for identifying causal mutations in any genetic background and provides an alternative to current methods.",

A number of published reports suggest that CA populations have been established from multiple independent introductions. Here we report the first population genomics analyses of Ae. aegypti based on individual, field collected whole genome sequences. We analyzed 46 Ae. aegypti genomes to establish genetic relationships among populations from sites in California, Florida and South Africa. We identified 3 major genetic clusters within California; one that includes all sample sites in the southern part of the state (South of Tehachapi mountain range) plus the town of Exeter in central California and two additional clusters in central California. A lack of concordance between mitochondrial and nuclear genealogies suggests that the three founding populations were polymorphic for two main mitochondrial haplotypes prior to being introduced to California. One of these has been lost in the Clovis populations, possibly by a founder effect. Genome-wide comparisons indicate extensive differentiation between genetic clusters. Our observations support recent introductions of Ae. aegypti into California from multiple, genetically diverged source populations. Our data reveal signs of hybridization among diverged populations within CA. Genetic markers identified in this study will be of great value in pursuing classical population genetic studies which require larger sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "Studies of learning mechanisms critically depend on the ability to accurately assess learning outcomes. This assessment can be impeded by the often complex, multidimensional nature of behavior. We present a novel, automated approach to evaluating imitative learning that is founded in information theory. Conceptually, our approach estimates the amount of information present in a reference behavior that is absent from the learned behavior. We validate our approach through examination of songbird vocalizations, complex learned behaviors the study of which has provided many insights into sensory-motor learning in general and vocal learning in particular. Historically, learning has been holistically assessed by human inspection or through comparison of specific song features selected by experimenters (e.g. fundamental frequency, spectral entropy). In contrast, our approach relies on statistical models that broadly capture the structure of each song, and then uses these models to estimate the amount of information in the reference song but absent from the learned song. We show that our information theoretic measure of song learning (contrast entropy) is well correlated with human evaluation of song learning. We then expand the analysis beyond song learning and show that contrast entropy also detects the typical song deterioration that occurs following deafening. More broadly, this approach potentially provides a framework for assessing learning across a broad range of similarly structured behaviors.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMeasuring learning outcomes is a critical objective of research into the neural, molecular, and behavioral mechanisms that support learning. Demonstration that a given manipulation results in better or worse learning outcomes requires an accurate and consistent measurement of learning quality. However, many behaviors (e.g. speech, walking, and reading) are complex and multidimensional, confounding the assessment of learning. One behavior subject to such confounds, vocal learning in Estrildid finches, has emerged as a vital model for sensory motor learning broadly and human speech learning in particular. Here, we demonstrate a new approach, founded in information theory, to the assessment of learning for complex high dimensional behaviors. Conceptually, we determine the amount of information (across many dimensions) present in a reference behavior and then assess how much of that information is present in the resultant learned behavior. We show that this measure provides an accurate, holistic, and automated assessment of vocal learning in Estrildid finches. Potentially, this same approach could be deployed to assess shared content in any multidimensional data, behavioral or otherwise.",

    "abstract": "There is an overwhelming archeological and genetic evidence that modern speech apparatus was acquired by hominins by 600,000 years ago1. On the other hand, artifacts signifying modern imagination, such as (1) composite figurative arts, (2) bone needles with an eye, (3) construction of dwellings, and (4) elaborate burials arose not earlier than 70,000 years ago2. It remains unclear (1) why there was a long gap between acquisition of modern speech apparatus and modern imagination, (2) what triggered the acquisition of modern imagination 70,000 years ago, and (3) what role language might have played in this process. Our research into evolutionary origin of modern imagination has been driven by the observation of a temporal limit for the development of a particular component of imagination. Modern children not exposed to recursive language in early childhood never acquire the type of active constructive imagination called Prefrontal Synthesis (PFS). Unlike vocabulary and grammar acquisition, which can be learned throughout ones lifetime, there is a strong critical period for the development of PFS and individuals not exposed to recursive language in early childhood can never acquire PFS as adults. Their language will always lack understanding of spatial prepositions and recursion that depend on the PFS ability. In a similar manner, early hominins would not have been able to learn recursive language as adults and, therefore, would not be able to teach recursive language to their children. Thus, the existence of a strong critical period for PFS acquisition creates an evolutionary barrier for behavioral modernity. An evolutionary mathematical model suggests that a synergistic confluence of three events (1) a genetic mutation that extended the critical period by slowing down the prefrontal cortex development simultaneously in two or more children, (2) invention of recursive elements of language, such as spatial prepositions, by these children and (3) their dialogic communications using these recursive elements, resulted in concurrent conversion of a non-recursive communication system of their parents to recursive language and acquisition of PFS around 70,000 years ago.",

    "abstract": "The UK Biobank project is a large prospective cohort study of ~500,000 individuals from across the United Kingdom, aged between 40-69 at recruitment. A rich variety of phenotypic and health-related information is available on each participant, making the resource unprecedented in its size and scope. Here we describe the genome-wide genotype data (~805,000 markers) collected on all individuals in the cohort and its quality control procedures. Genotype data on this scale offers novel opportunities for assessing quality issues, although the wide range of ancestries of the individuals in the cohort also creates particular challenges. We also conducted a set of analyses that reveal properties of the genetic data - such as population structure and relatedness - that can be important for downstream analyses. In addition, we phased and imputed genotypes into the dataset, using computationally efficient methods combined with the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) and UK10K haplotype resource. This increases the number of testable variants by over 100-fold to ~96 million variants. We also imputed classical allelic variation at 11 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, and as a quality control check of this imputation, we replicate signals of known associations between HLA alleles and many common diseases. We describe tools that allow efficient genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of multiple traits and fast phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), which work together with a new compressed file format that has been used to distribute the dataset. As a further check of the genotyped and imputed datasets, we performed a test-case genome-wide association scan on a well-studied human trait, standing height.",

    "abstract": "Exercise training creates a number of physical challenges to the body, the overcoming of which drives exercise adaptation. The balance between sufficient stress and recovery is a crucial, but often under-explored, area within exercise training. Genetic variation can also predispose some individuals to a greater need for recovery after exercise. In this pilot study, 18 male soccer players underwent a repeated sprint training session. Countermovement jump (CMJ) heights were recorded immediately pre-and post-training, and at 24-and 48-hours post-training. The reduction in CMJ height was greatest at all post-training time points in subjects with a larger number of gene variants associated with a reduced exercise recovery. This suggests that knowledge of genetic information can be important in individualizing recovery timings and modalities in athletes following training.",

    "abstract": "Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) act as commensals within the mammalian gut, but can induce pathology upon dissemination to other host environments such as the urinary tract and bloodstream. It is thought that ExPEC genomes are shaped in large part by evolutionary forces encountered within the gut where the bacteria spend much of their time, provoking the question of how their extraintestinal virulence traits arose. The principle of coincidental evolution, in which a gene that evolved in one niche happens to be advantageous in another, has been used to argue that ExPEC virulence factors originated in response to selective pressures within the gut ecosystem. As a test of this hypothesis, the fitness of ExPEC mutants lacking canonical virulence factors was assessed within the intact murine gut in the absence of any antibiotic treatment. We found that most of the tested factors--including CNF1, Usp, colibactin, flagella, and the plasmid pUTI89--were dispensable for gut colonization. Deletion of genes encoding the adhesin PapG or the toxin HlyA caused transient defects, but did not affect longer-term persistence. In contrast, a mutant missing the type 1 pilus-associated adhesin FimH displayed reduced persistence within the gut. However, this phenotype was variable, being dependent on the presence of specific competing strains and partially attributable to aberrant flagellin expression by the fimH mutant. These data indicate that FimH and other key ExPEC-associated factors are not strictly required for gut colonization, suggesting that selective pressures within the gut do not drive the development of all extraintestinal virulence traits.",

Here, we employ inter-subject correlations among electroencephalography responses to naturalistic speech in order to assay auditory attention among patients and healthy controls.\\n\\nMethodsElectroencephalographic data were recorded from 20 subjects with disorders of consciousness and 14 healthy controls during of two narrative audio stimuli, presented both forwards and time-reversed. Inter-subject correlation of evoked electroencephalography signals were calculated, comparing responses of both groups to those of the healthy control subjects. This analysis was performed blinded and subsequently compared to the diagnostic status of each patient based on the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised.\\n\\nResultsSubjects with disorders of consciousness exhibit significantly lower inter-subject correlation than healthy controls during narrative speech. Additionally, while healthy subjects had higher inter-subject correlation values in forward vs. backwards presentation, neural responses did not vary significantly with the direction of playback in subjects with disorders of consciousness. Increased inter-subject correlation values in the backward speech condition were noted with improving disorder of consciousness diagnosis, both in cross-sectional analysis and in a subset of patients with longitudinal data.\\n\\nInterpretationInter-subject correlation of neural responses to narrative speech audition differentiates healthy controls from patients and appears to index clinical diagnoses in disorders of consciousness.",

    "abstract": "Since the ancient times, all over the world, the identification of herbal medicines have to be based on empirical knowledge. In this article two species constants of traditional Chinese medicines(TCM) were discovered relying on the maximum information states of Dual index information theory equation, or common heredity and variation information theory. The two species constants, common peak ratios Pg = 61% and Pg = 70%, which corresponding to symmetry and asymmetry variation states, respectively, were used as two absolute quantitative criteria to identify complex biology systems-TCM. Considered the influences of many other factors on components and experiment processes, the practical theoretical identification standards should be established Pg[greater double equals]58~64% and Pg[greater double equals]67~73%, within the relativeerror within -3% and + 3% of information value around the maximum information states. Combining the maximum number of effective sample optimum method with this two theoretical standards, the optimized classification of a TCM sample set can be carried out correctly. 42 samples belonging to four species of combination Chinese medicines were tested. The infrared (IR) fingerprint spectra (FPS) of their powder were measured and analyzed by means of the approach provided above. Among the six pairs of four Chinese medicine species, five of them follow the species constant Pg=61%, one of them obeys the Pg = 70%. The correct recognition ratio of samples was 95.2%, and that of species was 100%.",
