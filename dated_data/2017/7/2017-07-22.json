    "abstract": "In order to analyse large complex stochastic dynamical models such as those studied in systems biology there is currently a great need for both analytical tools and also algorithms for accurate and fast simulation and estimation. We present a new stochastic approximation of biological oscillators that addresses these needs. Our method, called phase-corrected LNA (pcLNA) overcomes the main limitations of the standard Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) to remain uniformly accurate for long times, still maintaining the speed and analytically tractability of the LNA. As part of this, we develop analytical expressions for key probability distributions and associated quantities, such as the Fisher Information Matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence and we introduce a new approach to system-global sensitivity analysis. We also present algorithms for statistical inference and for long-term simulation of oscillating systems that are shown to be as accurate but much faster than leaping algorithms and algorithms for integration of diffusion equations. Stochastic versions of published models of the circadian clock and NF-{kappa}B system are used to illustrate our results.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPiwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are sRNAs that have a distinct biogenesis and molecular function from siRNAs and miRNAs. The piRNA pathway is well-conserved and shown to play an important role in the regulatory capacity of germline cells in Metazoans. Significant subsets of piRNAs are generated from discrete genomic loci referred to as piRNA clusters. Given that the contents of piRNA clusters dictate the target specificity of primary piRNAs, and therefore the generation of secondary piRNAs, they are of great significance when considering transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation on a genomic scale. A quantitative comparison of top piRNA cluster composition can provide further insight into piRNA cluster biogenesis and function.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed software for general use, piClusterBusteR, which performs nested annotation of piRNA cluster contents to ensure high-quality characterization, provides a quantitative representation of piRNA cluster composition by feature, and makes available annotated and unannotated piRNA cluster sequences that can be utilized for downstream analysis. The data necessary to run piClusterBusteR and the skills necessary to execute this software on any species of interest are not overly burdensome for biological researchers.\\n\\npiClusterBusteR has been utilized to compare the composition of top piRNA generating loci amongst 13 Metazoan species. Characterization and quantification of cluster composition allows for comparison within piRNA clusters of the same species and between piRNA clusters of different species.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have developed a tool that accurately, automatically, and efficiently describes the contents of piRNA clusters in any biological system that utilizes the piRNA pathway. The results from piClusterBusteR have provided an in-depth description and comparison of the architecture of top piRNA clusters within and between 13 species, as well as a description of annotated and unannotated sequences from top piRNA cluster loci in these Metazoans.\\n\\npiClusterBusteR is available for download on GitHub: https://github.com/pschreiner/piClusterBuster",

    "abstract": "People have long pondered the evolution of language and the origin of words. Here, we investigate how conventional spoken words might emerge from imitations of environmental sounds. Does the repeated imitation of an environmental sound gradually give rise to more word-like forms? In what ways do these forms resemble the original sounds that motivated them (i.e., exhibit iconicity)? Participants played a version of the childrens game \\\"Telephone\\\". The first generation of participants imitated recognizable environmental sounds (e.g., glass breaking, water splashing). Subsequent generations imitated the previous generation of imitations for a maximum of 8 generations. The results showed that the imitations became more stable and word-like, and later imitations were easier to learn as category labels. At the same time, even after 8 generations, both spoken imitations and their written transcriptions could be matched above chance to the category of environmental sound that motivated them. These results show how repeated imitation can create progressively more word-like forms while continuing to retain a resemblance to the original sound that motivated them, and speak to the possible role of human vocal imitation in explaining the origins of at least some spoken words.",

Most users were able to wear and use the BPAS (n=16/18, 89%), with most of them reporting no negative effects (n=14/16, 87.5%). Two users reported temporary negative effects: eye strain, dizziness, and nasal discomfort. Caregivers observed no negative effects in users (n=16/16, 100%). Most users (77.8%) and caregivers (88.9%) had no design concerns.

    "abstract": "BackgroundPeople with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly experience symptoms related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity. One-third of ASD cases may be complicated by the presence of ADHD. Individuals with dual diagnoses face greater barriers to accessing treatment for ADHD and respond less positively to primary pharmacologic interventions. Nonpharmacologic technology-aided tools for hyperactivity and inattention in people with ASD are being developed, although research into their efficacy and safety remains limited.\\n\\nObjectiveThe objective of this preliminary study was to describe the changes in ADHD-related symptoms in children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD after use of the Empowered Brain system, a behavioral and social communication aid for ASD running on augmented reality smartglasses.\\n\\nMethodsWe recruited 8 children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD (male to female ratio of 7:1, mean age 15 years, range 11.7-20.5 years) through a Web-based research signup form. The baseline score on the hyperactivity subscale of the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC-H), a measure of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity, determined their classification into a high ADHD-related symptom group (n=4, ABC-H [&ge;]13) and a low ADHD-related symptom group (n=4, ABC-H <13). All participants received an intervention with Empowered Brain, where they used smartglasses-based social communication and behavioral modules while interacting with their caregiver. We then calculated caregiver-reported ABC-H scores at 24 and 48 hours after the session.\\n\\nResultsAll 8 participants were able to complete the intervention session. Postintervention ABC-H scores were lower for most participants at 24 hours (n=6, 75%) and for all participants at 48 hours (n=8, 100%). At 24 hours after the session, average participant ABC-H scores decreased by 54.9% in the high ADHD symptom group and by 20% in the low ADHD symptom group. At 48 hours after the session, ABC-H scores compared with baseline decreased by 56.4% in the high ADHD symptom group and by 66.3% in the low ADHD symptom group.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study provides initial evidence for the efficacy of the Empowered Brain system in reducing ADHD-related symptoms, such as hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity, in school-aged children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD. This digital smartglasses intervention can potentially be targeted at a broader array of mental health conditions that exhibit transdiagnostic attentional and social communication deficits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Further research is required to understand the clinical importance of these observed changes and to conduct longitudinal studies on this intervention with larger sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) form both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric ion channels that are activated by extracellular protons and are involved in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including pain and anxiety. ASIC proteins can form both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric ion channels. The ASIC3 subunit has been shown to be of particular importance in the peripheral nervous system with pharmacological and genetic manipulations demonstrating a role in pain. Naked mole-rats, despite having functional ASICs, are insensitive to acid as a noxious stimulus and show diminished avoidance of acidic fumes, ammonia and carbon dioxide. Here we cloned naked mole-rat ASIC3 (nmrASIC3) and used a cell surface biotinylation assay to demonstrate that it traffics to the plasma membrane, but using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology we observed that nmrASIC3 is insensitive to both protons and the non-proton ASIC3 agonist 2-Guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ). However, in line with previous reports of ASIC3 mRNA expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, we found that the ASIC3 antagonist APETx2 reversibly inhibits ASIC-like currents in naked mole-rat DRG neurons. We further show that like the proton-insensitive ASIC2b and ASIC4, nmrASIC3 forms functional, proton sensitive heteromers with other ASIC subunits. An amino acid alignment of ASIC3s between 9 relevant rodent species and human identified unique sequence differences that might underlie the proton insensitivity of nmrASIC3. However, introducing nmrASIC3 differences into rat ASIC3 (rASIC3) produced only minor differences in channel function, and replacing nmrASIC3 sequence with that of rASIC3 did not produce a proton-sensitive ion channel. Our observation that nmrASIC3 forms nonfunctional homomers may reflect a further adaptation of the naked mole-rat to living in an environment with high-carbon dioxide levels.",

Direct RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) can provide quantitative estimates of ASE for genes with transcribed polymorphisms. However, estimating ASE is challenging due to ambiguities in read alignment. Current approaches do not account for the hierarchy of multiple read alignments to genes, isoforms, and alleles. We have developed EMASE (Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression), an integrated approach to estimate total gene expression, ASE, and isoform usage based on hierarchical allocation of multi-mapping reads. In simulations, EMASE outperforms standard ASE estimation methods. We apply EMASE to RNA-Seq data from F1 hybrid mice where we observe widespread ASE associated with cis-acting polymorphisms and a small number of parent-of-origin effects at known imprinted genes.

    "abstract": "Large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) mediate the regulated release of neuropeptides and peptide hormones. They form at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) where their soluble content aggregates to form a dense core, but the mechanisms controlling biogenesis are still not completely understood. Recent studies have implicated the peripheral membrane protein HID-1 in neuropeptide sorting and insulin secretion. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated HID-1 KO rat neuroendocrine cells, and show that the absence of HID-1 results in specific defects in peptide hormone and monoamine storage and regulated secretion. Loss of HID-1 causes a reduction in the number of LDCVs and affects their morphology and biochemical properties due to impaired cargo sorting and dense core formation. HID-1 KO cells also exhibit defects in TGN acidification together with mislocalization of the Golgi-enriched vacuolar H+-ATPase subunit isoform a2. We propose that HID-1 influences early steps in LDCV formation by controlling dense core formation at the TGN.",

    "abstract": "In pregnancy, uterine natural killer cells (uNK) play essential roles in coordinating uterine angiogenesis, blood vessel remodeling, and promoting maternal tolerance to fetal tissue. Deviances from a normal uterine microenvironment are thought to modify uNK function(s), limiting their ability to establish a healthy pregnancy. While maternal obesity has become a major health concern due to associations with adverse effects on fetal and maternal health, our understanding into how obesity contributes to poor pregnancy disorders is essentially unknown. Given the importance of uNK in pregnancy, this study sets out to examine if obesity affects uNK function. Using a cohort of pregnant women, we show that baseline activity of uNK from obese women is elevated, but that enhanced activity does not equate to increased killing potential. Instead, obesity associates with altered uNK production of angiogenic VEGF-A and PlGF. These changes coincide with alterations in NKp46+ and NKG2A+ uNK subsets and elevated expression of KIR2D(L1/S1/S3/S5) receptors. Detailed examination revealed that obesity leads to imbalances in KIR2DL1/S1 expression that together instruct altered responses to HLA-C2 antigen, including increased production of TNF. Together, these findings suggest that maternal obesity modulates uNK function by altering angiokine/cytokine production and the response to HLA-C2 antigen.",

We carried out a genome-wide screen to systematically dissect the regulation of the euchromatic state of ES cells. The results reveal that activity of cellular growth pathways, prominently protein synthesis, perpetuates the euchromatic state and hypertranscription of ES cells. Acute, mild inhibition of translation results in rapid depletion of euchromatic marks in ES cells and blastocysts, concurrent with delocalization of RNA polymerase II and reduction in nascent transcription. Remarkably, reduced translational output leads to rewiring of open chromatin within 3 hours, including decreased accessibility at a subset of active developmental enhancers and increased accessibility at histone genes and transposable elements. Using a proteome-scale analysis, we show that several euchromatin regulators are unstable proteins and thus continuously depend on a high translational output. We propose that this mechanistic interdependence of euchromatin, transcription and translation sets the pace of proliferation at peri-implantation and may be employed generally by stem/progenitor cells.",

Here, we present a re-analysis of neoblast and germline transcriptional signatures in the flatworm M. lignano and combine it with the whole-animal electron microscopy atlas (nanotomy) as a reference platform for ultrastructural studies in M. lignano. We show that germline-enriched genes have a high fraction of flatworm-specific genes and identify Mlig-sperm1 gene as a member of a novel gene family conserved only in free-living flatworms and essential for producing healthy spermatozoa.

    "abstract": "Intraluminal pressure elevation can cause degenerative disorders, such as ileus and hydronephrosis, and the threshold is fairly low and constant, 20-30 cm H2O. We previously devised a novel two-chamber culture system subjecting cells cultured on a semipermeable membrane to increased culture medium height (water pressure up to 60 cm H2O). Here, we cultured several different cell lines using the low static pressure-loadable two-chamber system, and examined cell growth, cell cycle, and cell morphology. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) columnar epithelial cells were growth-suppressed in a manner dependent on static water pressure ranging from 2-50 cm H2O, without cell cycle arrest at any specific phase. Two other types of columnar epithelial cells exhibited similar phenotypes. By contrast, spherical epithelial and mesenchymal cells were not growth-suppressed, even at 50 cm H2O. Phalloidin staining revealed that 50 cm H2O pressure load vertically flattened and laterally widened columnar epithelial cells and made actin fiber distribution sparse, without affecting total phalloidin intensity per cell. When the mucosal protectant irsogladine maleate (100 nM) was added to 50-cm-high culture medium, MDCK cells were reduced in volume and their doubling time shortened. Cell proliferation and morphology are known to be regulated by the Hippo signaling pathway, but a pressure load of 50 cm H2O did not alter the expression levels of Hippo signaling molecules in columnar epithelial cells, suggesting that this pathway was not involved in the pressure-induced phenotypes. RNA sequencing of MDCK cells showed that a 50 cm H2O pressure load upregulated keratin 14, an intermediate filament, 12-fold. This upregulation was confirmed at the protein level by immunofluorescence, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal reinforcement. These results provide evidence that cell morphology and the cytoskeleton are closely linked to cell growth. Pathological intraluminal pressure elevation may cause mucosal degeneration by acting directly on this linkage.\\n\\nSummaryWe provide evidence that columnar epithelial cells are growth-suppressed by pressure loads as low as 30 cm H2O, in association with cell-shape flattening and cytoskeletal alterations.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase RNA contains a template for synthesizing telomeric DNA by reverse transcription and has been proposed to act as a flexible scaffold for holoenzyme protein subunits in the RNP. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the telomerase subunits Est1 and Ku bind to the telomerase RNA, TLC1, and it has been shown that these proteins still function when their binding sites are repositioned within the RNA. TLC1 is also bound by the Sm7 protein complex, which is required for stabilization of the predominant, non-polyadenylated (poly(A)-) TLC1 isoform. Here, we first show that Sm7 can perform this function even when its binding site is repositioned via circular permutation to several different positions within TLC1, further supporting the conclusion that the telomerase holoenzyme is organizationally flexible. Next, we tested the hypothesis that the location of the Sm7-binding site relative to the 3' end is contrastingly important. When we moved the Sm site to locations 5' of its native position, we observed that this stabilized shorter forms of poly(A)- TLC1 in a manner precisely corresponding to how far upstream the Sm site was moved. This provides strong evidence that the location of Sm7 binding to TLC1 controls where the mature poly(A)- 3' end is formed. In summary, our results show that Sm7 and the 3' end of yeast telomerase RNA comprise an organizationally flexible module within the telomerase RNP and provide insights into the mechanistic role of Sm7 in telomerase RNA biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Cognition and behavior depend on synchronized intrinsic brain activity which is organized into functional networks across the brain. Research has investigated how anatomical connectivity both shapes and is shaped by these networks, but not how anatomical connectivity interacts with intra-areal molecular properties to drive functional connectivity. Here, we present a novel linear model to explain functional connectivity in the mouse brain by integrating systematically obtained measurements of axonal connectivity, gene expression, and resting state functional connectivity MRI. The model suggests that functional connectivity arises from synergies between anatomical links and inter-areal similarities in gene expression. By estimating these interactions, we identify anatomical modules in which correlated gene expression and anatomical connectivity cooperatively, versus distinctly, support functional connectivity. Along with providing evidence that not all genes equally contribute to functional connectivity, this research establishes new insights regarding the biological underpinnings of coordinated brain activity measured by BOLD fMRI.",

    "abstract": "Sedolisins are acid proteases that are related to the basic subtilisins. They have been identified in all three superkingdoms but are not ubiquitous, although fungi that secrete acids as part of their lifestyle can have up to six paralogs. Both tripeptidyl peptidase (TPP) and endopeptidase activity have been identified and it has been suggested that these correspond to separate subfamilies.\\n\\nWe studied eukaryotic sedolisins by computational analysis. A maximum likelihood tree shows three major clades of which two contain only fungal sequences. One fungal clade contains all known TPPs whereas the other contains the endosedolisins. We identified four cluster specific inserts (CSIs) in endosedolisins, of which CSIs 1, 3 and 4 appear as solvent exposed according to structure modeling. Part of CSI2 is exposed but a short stretch forms a novel and partially buried -helix that induces a conformational change near the binding pocket. We also identified a total of 12 specificity determining positions (SDPs) divided over three SDP sub-networks. The major SDP network contains eight directly connected SDPs and modeling of virtual mutants suggests a key role for the W307A or F307A substitution. This substitution is accompanied by a group of four SDPs that physically interact at the interface of the catalytic domain and the enzymes prosegment. Modeling of virtual mutants suggests these SDPs are indeed required to compensate the conformational change induced by CSI2 and the A307. The additional major network SDPs as well as the two small SDP networks appear to be linked to this major substitution, all together explaining the hypothesized functional diversification of fungal sedolisins.\\n\\nHighlightsThere are two sedolisin subfamilies in fungi: tripeptidyl peptidases and endopeptidases\\nFunctional Diversification of fungal sedolisins led to a conformational change in the pocket\\nFunctional Diversification centers around buried SDP307\\nSDP307 is aromatic in TPPs and Alanine in endosedolisins\\nAdditional SDPs affect the interaction between core and chaperone-like prosegment",

    "abstract": "The second messenger cAMP and its effector cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) constitute a ubiquitous cell signaling system. In its inactive state PKA is composed of two regulatory subunits that dimerize, and two catalytic subunits that are inhibited by the regulatory subunits. Activation of the catalytic subunits occurs upon binding of two molecules of cAMP to each regulatory subunit. Although many receptor types existing within the same cell may use this signaling system, compartmentation of signaling is thought to occur due to A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs), which act to co-localize PKA with specific substrates. However, the molecular mechanism allowing AKAPs to direct PKA phosphorylation to a particular substrate remained elusive, as prior evidence suggested that the catalytic subunit, which is highly diffusible, is released after cAMP binding to the regulatory subunit. Recent evidence from Smith et al. suggests that in the cell, the catalytic subunit may in fact not be released from the AKAP complex [1, 2]. They further demonstrated that alterations in the structure of the PKA regulatory subunit tether affect substrate phosphorylation. We use a novel computational software based on Langevin dynamics, SpringSaLaD, to simulate the AKAP-PKA complex in order to determine a molecular mechanism for the changes in phosphorylation seen with alteration in tether length and flexibility, and to demonstrate whether or not AKAPs can effectively direct PKA phosphorylation to a particular substrate upon release of the catalytic subunit from the complex. We find that short and flexible tethers contribute to a decrease in the average characteristic time of binding, allowing the catalytic subunit to spend more time in a bound state with the substrate, which yields faster characteristic times of phosphorylation. We further demonstrate that release of the catalytic subunit from the AKAP complex abrogates the effect of tethering, with characteristic times of phosphorylation similar to non-AKAP bound PKA. The data demonstrates that AKAPs likely do not release the catalytic subunit in directing PKA phosphorylation to AKAP bound substrates. In combination with the changes in characteristic time of phosphorylation which are driven by tether structure, this work indicates that the purpose of AKAPs may be to increase the efficiency of phosphorylation of particular AKAP substrates.",

    "abstract": "Surface receptor and transporter protein down-regulation drives cell signaling, quality control and metabolism underlying diverse physiology. After endocytosis, proteins are delivered to endosomes where ESCRTs package them into intralumenal vesicles, which are degraded by acid hydrolases upon fusion with lysosomes. However, reports of ESCRT-independent surface protein degradation are emerging suggesting that alternative, non-canonical pathways exist. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, here we show that in response to substrates, protein misfolding or TOR signaling, some internalized surface transporters (Hxt3, Itr1, Aqr1) bypass ESCRTs en route to the lysosome membrane where they are sorted into an area that is internalized as an intralumenal fragment (ILF) and degraded upon organelle fusion. This ILF pathway also degrades typical ESCRT client proteins (Mup1, Can1, Ste3) when ESCRT function is impaired. As the underlying machinery is conserved, we speculate that the ILF pathway is an important contributor to receptor and transporter down-regulation in all eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Mitosis relies on forces generated in the spindle, a micro-machine composed of microtubules and associated proteins1,2. Forces are required for the congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate and separation of chromatids in anaphase3-6. However, torques may also exist in the spindle, yet they have not been investigated. Here we show that the spindle is chiral. Chirality is evident from the finding that microtubule bundles follow a left-handed helical path, which cannot be explained by forces but rather by torques acting in the bundles. STED super-resolution microscopy, as well as confocal microscopy, of human spindles shows that the bundles have complex curved shapes. The average helicity of the bundles with respect to the spindle axis is 1.2{degrees}/m. Inactivation of kinesin-5 (Eg5/Kif11) abolished the chirality of the spindle, suggesting that this motor generates the helical shape of microtubule bundles. To explain the observed shapes, we introduce a theoretical model for the balance of forces and torques acting in the spindle, and show that torque is required to generate the helical shapes. We conclude that torques generated by motor proteins, in addition to forces, exist in the spindle and determine its architecture.",

    "abstract": "Infection by Candida albicans requires its adaption to physical constraints in the human body, such as low oxygen tension (hypoxia), increased temperature (37{degrees}C) and different carbon sources. Previous studies demonstrated that the genetic variability of C. albicans isolates is an important adaptive mechanism, although little is known about the dynamics of this genetic diversity, and the influence of these environmental conditions on its mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). To test the synergistic effect of these stress conditions on C. albicans genome, reference strain SC5314 was subjected to an in vitro evolution scheme under hypoxia and 37{degrees}C, with two different carbon sources (glycerol and dextrose) for up to 48 weeks (approximately 4,000 generations). Experimental evolution results showed no sequence or copy number changes in the mtDNA, although sequence variants were detected on its nuclear genome by Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). After 12 weeks of experimental evolution, sample GTH12, grown under hypoxia at 37{degrees}C in glycerol, showed inferior growth and respiratory rates as compared to other conditions tested. Although WGS of GTH12 revealed no variants in its mtDNA, WGS with sodium bisulfite showed a significant reduction in mtDNA methylation in GTH12 in both non-coding and coding regions. Our results provide the first whole mitochondrial genome methylation map of C. albicans and show that environmental conditions promote the selective growth of specific variants and affect the methylation patterns of the mtDNA in a strain-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "Marine sediments harbor a vast amount of Earths microbial biomass, yet little is understood regarding how cells subsist in this low-energy, presumably slow-growth environment. Cells in marine sediments may require additional methods for genetic regulation, such as epigenetic modification via DNA methylation. We investigated this potential phenomenon within a shallow estuary sediment core spanning 100 years of age across its depth. Here we provide evidence of dynamic community m5-cytosine methylation within estuarine sediment metagenomes using a methylation-sensitive Illumina assay. The methylation states of individual CpG sites were reconstructed and quantified across three depths within the sediment core. A total of 6254 CpG sites were aligned for direct comparison of methylation states between samples, with 4235 sites mapped to taxa and genes. Our results demonstrate the presence of differential methylation within environmental CpG sites across an age/depth gradient of sediment. We show that epigenetic modification can be detected within complex environmental communities. The change in methylation state of environmentally relevant genes across depths may indicate a dynamic role of DNA methylation in biogeochemical processes.",
