    "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that some genes have originated de novo from previously non-coding genomic sequences. However, the processes underlying de novo gene birth are still enigmatic. In particular, the appearance of a new functional protein seems highly improbable unless there is already a pool of neutrally evolving peptides that can at some point acquire new functions. Here we show for the first time that such peptides do not only exist but that they are prevalent among the translation products of mouse genes that lack homologues in rat and human. The data suggests that the translation of these peptides is due to the chance occurrence of open reading frames with a favorable codon composition. Our approach combines ribosome profiling experiments, proteomics data and non-synonymous and synonymous nucleotide polymorphism analysis. We propose that effectively neutral processes involving the expression of thousands of transcripts all the way down to proteins provide a basis for de novo gene evolution.",

    "abstract": "Neural development is generally marked by an increase in the efficiency and diversity of neural processes. In a large sample (N = 114) of children and adults with ages ranging from 5 -44 years, we investigated the neural responses to naturalistic video stimuli. Videos from both real-life classroom settings and Hollywood feature films were used to probe different aspects of attention and engagement. For all stimuli, older ages were marked by more variable neural responses. Variability was assessed by the inter-subject correlation of evoked electroencephalographic (EEG) responses. Young males also had more variable responses than young females. These results were replicated in an independent cohort (N = 303). When interpreted in the context of neural maturation, we conclude that neural function becomes more variable with maturity, at least in during the passive viewing of real-world stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNaturalistic videos were used to measure how a large sample of children and adults process environmentally meaningful stimuli. As age increased, neural responses were more variable, and females responded more variably than males - a difference that disappeared with age. These results are consistent with developmental theories positing that neural variability increases with maturation, and that neural maturation typically occurs earlier in females. This is the first study to investigate neural variability under naturalistic conditions in a developmental sample.",

    "abstract": "Finding new genetic causes of monogenic diabetes can help to understand development and function of the human pancreas. We aimed to find novel protein-truncating variants causing Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), a subtype of monogenic diabetes. We used a combination of next-generation sequencing of MODY cases with unknown aetiology along with comparisons to the ExAC database to identify new MODY genes. In the discovery cohort of 36 European patients, we identified two probands with novel RFX6 heterozygous nonsense variants. RFX6 protein truncating variants were enriched in the MODY discovery cohort compared to the European control population within ExAC (odds ratio, OR=131, P=lxl0-4). We found similar results in non-Finnish European (n=348, OR=43, P=5xl0-5) and Finnish (n=80, OR=22, P=1xl0-6) replication cohorts. The overall meta-analysis OR was 34 (P=lxl0-16). RFX6 heterozygotes had reduced penetrance of diabetes compared to common HNF1A and HNF4A-MODY mutations (27%, 70% and 55% at 25 years of age, respectively). The hyperglycaemia resulted from beta-cell dysfunction and was associated with lower fasting and stimulated gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) levels. Our study demonstrates that heterozygous RFX6 protein truncating variants are associated with MODY with reduced penetrance.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of complex body plans in land plants has been paralleled by gene duplication and divergence within nuclear auxin-signaling networks. A deep mechanistic understanding of auxin signaling proteins therefore may allow rational engineering of novel plant architectures. Towards that end, we analyzed natural variation in the auxin receptor F-box family of wild accessions of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana and used this information to populate a structure/function map. We employed a synthetic assay to identify natural hypermorphic F-box variants, and then assayed auxin-associated phenotypes in accessions expressing these variants. To more directly measure the impact of the strongest variant in our synthetic assay on auxin sensitivity, we generated transgenic plants expressing this allele. Together, our findings link evolved sequence variation to altered molecular performance and auxin sensitivity. This approach demonstrates the potential for combining synthetic biology approaches with quantitative phenotypes to harness the wealth of available sequence information and guide future engineering efforts of diverse signaling pathways.",

Despite such clear significance, this class of mutation remains an underexploited tool in protein engineering with no available platforms capable of systematically generating or analysing libraries of varying sequence composition and length. We present a novel DNA assembly platform (InDel assembly), based on cycles of endonuclease restriction and ligation of standardised dsDNA building blocks, that can generate libraries exploring both composition and sequence length variation. In addition, we developed a framework to analyse the output of selection from InDel-generated libraries, combining next generation sequencing and alignment-free strategies for sequence analysis. We demonstrate the approach by engineering the well-characterized TEM-1 {beta}-lactamase {Omega}-loop, involved in substrate specificity, identifying multiple novel extended spectrum {beta}-lactamases with loops of modified length and composition areas of the sequence space not previously explored. Together, the InDel assembly and analysis platforms provide an efficient route to engineer protein loops or linkers where sequence length and composition are both essential functional parameters.",

    "abstract": "Plant distributions can be limited by habitat-biased herbivory, but the proximate causes of such biases are rarely known. Distinguishing plant-centric from herbivore-centric mechanisms driving differential herbivory between habitats is difficult without experimental manipulation of both plants and herbivores. Here we tested alternative hypotheses driving habitat-biased herbivory in bittercress (Cardamine cordifolia), which is more abundant under shade of shrubs and trees (shade) than in nearby meadows (sun) where herbivory is intense from the specialist fly Scaptomyza nigrita. This system has served as a textbook example of habitat-biased herbivory driving a plants distribution across an ecotone, but the proximate mechanisms underlying differential herbivory are still unclear. First, we found that higher S. nigrita herbivory in sun habitats contrasts sharply with their preference to attack plants from shade habitats in laboratory choice experiments. Second, S. nigrita strongly preferred leaves in simulated sun over simulated shade habitats, regardless of plant source habitat. Thus, herbivore preference for brighter, warmer habitats overrides their preference for more palatable shade plants. This promotes the sun-biased herbivore pressure that drives the distribution of bittercress into shade habitats.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian cells, distinct replication domains (RDs), corresponding to structural units of chromosomes called topologically-associating domains (TADs), replicate at different times during S-phase1-4. Further, early/late replication of RDs corresponds to active/inactive chromatin interaction compartments5,6. Although replication origins are selected stochastically, such that each cell is using a different cohort of origins to replicate their genomes7-12, replication-timing is regulated independently and upstream of origin selection13 and evidence suggests that replication timing is conserved in consecutive cell cycles14. Hence, quantifying the extent of cell-to-cell variation in replication timing is central to studies of chromosome structure and function. Here we devise a strategy to measure variation in single-cell replication timing using DNA copy number. We find that borders between replicated and un-replicated DNA are highly conserved between cells, demarcating active and inactive compartments of the nucleus. Nonetheless, measurable variation was evident. Surprisingly, we detected a similar degree of variation in replication timing from cell-to-cell, between homologues within cells, and between all domains genome-wide regardless of their replication timing. These results demonstrate that stochastic variation in replication timing is independent of elements that dictate timing or extrinsic environmental variation.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of bacterial genome sequencing has been performed using Illumina short reads. Because of the inherent difficulty of resolving repeated regions with short reads alone, only {approx}10% of sequencing projects have resulted in a closed genome. The most common repeated regions are those coding for ribosomal operons (rDNAs), which occur in a bacterial genome between 1 and 15 times, and are typically used as sequence markers to classify and identify bacteria. Here, we exploit conservation in the genomic context in which rDNAs occur across taxa to improve assembly of these regions relative to de novo sequencing by using the conserved nature of rDNAs across taxa and the uniqueness of their flanking regions within a genome. We describe a method to construct targeted pseudocontigs generated by iteratively assembling reads that map to a reference genomes rDNAs. These pseudocontigs are then used to more accurately assemble the newly-sequenced chromosome. We show that this method, implemented as riboSeed, correctly bridges across adjacent contigs in bacterial genome assembly and, when used in conjunction with other genome polishing tools, can assist in closure of a genome.",

    "abstract": "The sensory drive theory predicts that signals, sensory systems, and signaling behavior should coevolve. Variation in the sensory systems of prey and predators may explain the diversity of color signals, such as color polymorphism. The spider Gasteracantha cancriformis (Araneidae) possesses several conspicuous color morphs. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the color polymorphism of G. cancriformis may be maintained by pressure from multiple signal receivers, such as prey and predators with distinct color vision systems. Although, the multiple receivers world is a more realistic scenario, it has received little attention. In orb-web spiders, the prey attraction hypothesis states that conspicuous colors are prey lures that increase spider foraging success via flower mimicry. However, in highly defended species, conspicuous colors could also be a warning signal to predators. We used color vision modelling to estimate chromatic and achromatic contrast of G. cancriformis morphs as perceived by potential prey and predator taxa. Our results revealed that individual prey and predator taxa perceive the conspicuousness of morphs differently. For instance, the red morph is perceived as quite conspicuous to lepidopteran prey and avian predators, but not by other insects. Therefore, the multiple prey and predator hypotheses may explain the evolution of color polymorphism in G. cancriformis. However, flower mimicry hypothesis was weakly corroborated. Other parameters that are not evaluated by color vision models, such as distance, shape, angle, and pattern geometry could also affect the perception of color morphs by both prey and predators and thereby influence morph survival.",

Species as distant as monkeys and crows exhibit number-selective neuronal activity. How number sense can emerge in the absence of learning or fine tuning is currently unknown. We introduce a random matrix theory of self-organised neural states where numbers are coded by vectors of activation across multiple units, and where the vector codes for successive integers are obtained through multiplication by a fixed but random matrix. This cortical implementation of the \\\"von Mises\\\" algorithm explains many otherwise disconnected observations ranging from neural tuning curves in monkeys to looking times in neonates and cortical numerotopy in adults. The theory clarifies the origin of Weber-Fechners law and yields a novel and empirically validated prediction of multi-peak number neurons.

We have profiled the transcriptome of PGCs lacking the nanos homologues nos-1 and nos-2 iC. elegans. nos-1nos-2 PGCs fail to silence hundreds of genes normally expressed in oocytes and somatic cells, a phenotype reminiscent of PGCs lacking the repressive PRC2 complex. The nos-1nos-2 phenotype depends on LIN-15B, a broadly expressed synMuvB class transcription factor known to antagonize PRC2 activity in somatic cells. LIN-15B is maternally-inherited by all embryonic cells and is down-regulated specifically in PGCs in a nos-1nos-2-dependent manner. Consistent with LIN-15B being a critical target of Nanos regulation, inactivation of maternal LIN-15B restores fertility to nos-1nos-2 mutants. These studies demonstrate a central role for Nanos in reprogramming the transcriptome of PGCs away from an oocyte/somatic fate by down-regulating an antagonist of PRC2 activity.",

TSV3 transcripts were highly expressed in leaves and weak or undetectable in other tissues, suggesting the tissue-specific expression. In tsv3 mutant, the transcriptional levels of certain genes associated with biogenesis of chloroplast ribosomes 50S subunit were severely decreased at the 3-leaf-stage under cold stress, but could be recovered to normal levels at a higher temperature (32{degrees}C).

Such assays are currently constrained by the short length of oligonucleotide (oligo) pools, which limit potential applications. Here we report a simple, low-cost, and scalable method called DropSynth that assembles gene libraries from oligo pools for use in multiplexed functional assays. DropSynth utilizes a library of barcoded beads to isolate and concentrate oligos needed for a genes synthesis in a pooled format. These bead-bound oligos are then emulsified, processed, and assembled into genes within the emulsion droplets. We synthesized ~1000 phylogenetically diverse orthologs of phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) and tested their fitness in a multiplexed functional assay. While the majority of orthologs complement, those that do not are broadly distributed across the phylogenetic tree. Synthetic errors in our assemblies allow us to explore local landscapes around the designed orthologs revealing constrained mutations for complementing orthologs as well as gain-of-function mutations for low-fitness orthologs. This broad mutational scanning approach is complementary to deep mutational scanning and helps us understand proteins by probing evolutionarily divergent sequences that share function.",

HtrA1 activation, although very relevant for drug-targeting this protease, remains poorly characterized. Our work provides a mechanistic step-by-step description of HtrA1 activation and regulation. We report that the HtrA1 trimer is regulated by an allosteric mechanism by which monomers relay the activation signal to each other, in a PDZ-domain independent fashion. Notably, we show that inhibitor binding is precluded if HtrA1 monomers cannot communicate with each other. Our study establishes how HtrA1 oligomerization plays a fundamental role in proteolytic activity. Moreover, it offers a structural explanation for HtrA1-defective pathologies as well as mechanistic insights into the degradation of complex extracellular fibrils such as tubulin, amyloid beta and tau that belong to the repertoire of HtrA1.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMonomeric HtrA1 is activated by a gating mechanism.\\nC_LIO_LITrimeric HtrA1 is regulated by PDZ-independent allosteric monomer cross-talk.\\nC_LIO_LIHtrA1 oligomerization is key for proteolytic activity.\\nC_LIO_LISubstrate-binding is precluded if monomers cannot communicate with each other.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Hybridization capture coupled with high-throughput sequencing can be used to gain information about nuclear sequence variation at hundreds to thousands of loci. A cross-species approach makes use of molecular data of one species to enrich target loci in other (related) species. This is particularly valuable for non-model organisms, for which often no a priori knowledge exists regarding these loci. Here, we have adopted cross-species capture to obtain data for 809 nuclear coding DNA sequences (CDS) in a non-model organism, the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx, using baits designed with the help of the published genome of a related model organism (the domestic cat Felis catus). In this manner, we were able to survey intraspecific variation at hundreds of nuclear loci across the European range of L. lynx. A large set of bi-allelic candidate SNPs was then tested in a high throughput SNP-genotyping platform (Fluidigm), which we reduced to a final 96 SNP-panel based on assay performance and reliability; validation was carried out with additional samples not included in the SNP discovery phase. The 96 SNP-panel developed from CDS performed very successfully in the identification of individuals and in population genetic structure inference (incl. the assignment of individuals to their source population). In keeping with recent studies, our results show that genic SNPs can be valuable for genetic monitoring of wildlife species.",

However, developing targeted assays is tedious and requires the selection, synthesis and mass spectrometric analysis of candidate peptides before the actual samples can be analyzed. The SRMatlas and ProteomeTools projects recently published fragmentation spectra of synthetic peptides covering the entire human proteome4,5. These datasets provide very valuable resources. However, extracting the relevant data for selected proteins of interest is not straightforward. For example, developing scheduled acquisition methods (i.e. analyzing specific peptides in defined elution time windows) is complicated and requires adjustments to specific chromatographic conditions employed. Moreover, the number of peptide candidates to be targeted in parallel often exceeds the analytical abilities of the mass spectrometer. In this case, the key question is which peptides can be omitted without losing too much information. Ideally, a method design tool would automatically select the most informative peptides in each retention time window.

    "abstract": "The ability to precisely edit and modify genome opens endless opportunities to investigate fundamental properties of living systems as well as to advance various medical techniques and bioengineering applications. This possibility is now close to reality due to a recent discovery of the adaptive bacterial immune system, which is based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated proteins (Cas) that utilize RNA to find and cut the double-stranded DNA molecules at specific locations. Here we develop a quantitative theoretical approach to analyze the mechanism of target search on DNA by CRISPR RNA-guided Cas9 proteins, which is followed by a selective cleavage of nucleic acids. It is based on a discrete-state stochastic model that takes into account the most relevant physical-chemical processes in the system. Using a method of first-passage processes, a full dynamic description of the target search is presented. It is found that the location of specific sites on DNA by CRISPR Cas9 proteins is governed by binding first to protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences on DNA, which is followed by reversible transitions into DNA interrogation states. In addition, the search dynamics is strongly influenced by the off-target cutting. Our theoretical calculations allows us to explain the experimental observations and to give experimentally testable predictions. Thus, the presented theoretical model clarifies some molecular aspects of the genome interrogation by CRISPR RNA-guided Cas9 proteins.\\n\\nInsert Received for publication Date and in final form Date.",

Here, we present a highly accurate method to measure methylation using bisulfite sequencing (termed HAM-TBS). This novel method is able to assess DNA methylation in multiple samples with high accuracy in a cost-effective manner. We developed this assay for the FKBP5 locus, an important gene in the regulation of the stress system and previously linked to stress-related disorders, but the method is applicable to any locus of interest.\\n\\nResultsHAM-TBS enables multiplexing of up to 96 samples spanning a region of ~10 kb using the llumina MiSeq. It incorporates a triplicate bisulfite conversion step, pooled target enrichment via PCR, PCR-free library preparation and a minimum coverage of 1,000x. Furthermore, we designed and validated a targeted panel to specifically assess regulatory regions within the FKBP5 locus including the transcription start site, topologically associated domain boundaries, intergenic and proximal enhancers as well as glucocorticoid receptor and CTCF binding sites that are not covered in commercially available DNA methylation arrays.\\n\\nConclusionsHAM-TBS represents a highly accurate, medium-throughput sequencing approach for robust detection of DNA methylation changes in specific target regions.",

    "abstract": "A challenge in the clinical adoption of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) liquid biopsies for cancer care is their high cost compared to potential reimbursement. The most common approach used in liquid biopsies to achieve high specificity detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) among a large background of normal cfDNA is to attach molecular barcodes to each DNA template, amplify it, and then sequence it many times to reach a low-error consensus. In applications where the highest possible specificity is required, error rate can be lowered further by independently detecting the sequences of both strands of the starting cfDNA. While effective in error reduction, the additional sequencing redundancy required by such barcoding methods can increase the cost of sequencing up to 100-fold over standard next-generation sequencing (NGS) of equivalent depth.\\n\\nWe present a novel library construction and analysis method for NGS that achieves comparable performance to the best barcoding methods, but without the increase in sequencing and subsequent sequencing cost. Named Proximity-Sequencing (Pro-Seq), the method merges multiple copies of each template into a single sequencing read by physically linking the molecular copies so they seed a single sequencing cluster. Since multiple DNA copies of the same template are compared for consensus within the same cluster, sequencing accuracy is improved without the use of redundant reads. Additionally, it is possible to represent both senses of the starting duplex in a single cluster. The resulting workflow is simple, and can be completed by a single technician in a work day with minimal hands on time.\\n\\nUsing both cfDNA and cell line DNA, we report the average per-mutation detection threshold and per-base analytical specificity to be 0.003% and >99.9997% respectively, demonstrating that Pro-Seq is among the highest performing liquid biopsy technologies in terms of both sensitivity and specificity, but with greatly reduced sequencing costs compared to existing methods of comparable accuracy.",

Our behavioral paradigm contrasted periods with high emotional and cognitive demands by including a sadness provocation task followed by a spatial working memory task. We hypothesized that this paradigm would enhance the modularity of emotional and cognitive networks and reveal the hub areas that regulate the flow of information between them. By applying graph analysis methods on functional connectivity between 20 regions of interest in 22 participants we identified two main brain network modules, one cognitive and one emotional, and their hub areas: the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the left medial frontal pole (mFP). These hub areas did not modulate their mutual functional connectivity following sadness but they did so through an interposed area, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC). Our results identify dlPFC and mFP as areas regulating interactions between emotional and cognitive networks, and suggest that their modulation by sadness experience is mediated by sACC.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFusion genes play an important role in the tumorigenesis of many cancers. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been successfully applied in fusion gene detection for the last several years, and a number of NGS-based tools have been developed for identifying fusion genes during this period. Most fusion gene detection tools based on RNA-seq data report a large number of candidates (mostly false positives), making it hard to prioritize candidates for experimental validation and further analysis. Selection of reliable fusion genes for downstream analysis becomes very important in cancer research. We therefore developed confFuse, a scoring algorithm to reliably select high-confidence fusion genes which are likely to be biologically relevant.\\n\\nResultsConfFuse takes multiple parameters into account in order to assign each fusion candidate a confidence score, of which score [&ge;]8 indicates high-confidence fusion gene predictions. These parameters were manually curated based on our experience and on certain structural motifs of fusion genes. Compared with alternative tools, based on 96 published RNA-seq samples from different tumor entities, our method can significantly reduce the number of fusion candidates (301 high-confidence from 8,083 total predicted fusion genes) and keep high detection accuracy (recovery rate 85.7%). Validation of 18 novel, high-confidence fusions detected in three breast tumor samples resulted in a 100% validation rate.\\n\\nConclusionsConfFuse is a novel downstream filtering method that allows selection of highly reliable fusion gene candidates for further downstream analysis and experimental validations. confFuse is available at https://github.com/Zhiqin-HUANG/confFuse.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are sentinel cells essential for tissue homeostasis and host defence. Owing to their plasticity, macrophages acquire a range of functional phenotypes in response to microenvironmental stimuli, of which M(IFN-{gamma}) and M(IL-4/IL-13) are well-known for their opposing pro- and anti-inflammatory roles. Enhancers have emerged as regulatory DNA elements crucial for transcriptional activation of gene expression. Using cap analysis of gene expression and epigenetic data, we identify on large-scale transcribed enhancers in mouse macrophages, their time kinetics and target protein-coding genes. We observe an increase in target gene expression, concomitant with increasing numbers of associated enhancers and find that genes associated to many enhancers show a shift towards stronger enrichment for macrophage-specific biological processes. We infer enhancers that drive transcriptional responses of genes upon M(IFN-{gamma}) and M(IL-4/IL-13) macrophage activation and demonstrate stimuli-specificity of regulatory associations. Finally, we show that enhancer regions are enriched for binding sites of inflammation-related transcription factors, suggesting a link between stimuli response and enhancer transcriptional control. Our study provides new insights into genome-wide enhancer-mediated transcriptional control of macrophage genes, including those implicated in macrophage activation, and offers a detailed genome-wide catalogue to further elucidate enhancer regulation in macrophages.",

    "abstract": "It is presently unclear how much individual community members contribute to the overall metabolic output of a gut microbiota. To address this question, we used the honey bee, which harbors a relatively simple and remarkably conserved gut microbiota with striking parallels to the mammalian system and importance for bee health. Using untargeted metabolomics, we profiled metabolic changes in gnotobiotic bees that were colonized with the complete microbiota reconstituted from cultured strains. We then determined the contribution of individual community members in mono-colonized bees, and recapitulated our findings using in vitro cultures. Our results show that the honey bee gut microbiota utilizes a wide range of pollen-derived substrates including flavonoids and outer pollen wall components, suggesting a key role for degradation of recalcitrant secondary plant metabolites and pollen digestion. In turn, multiple species were responsible for the accumulation of organic acids and polyphenol degradation products, and a specific gut symbiont, Bifidobacterium asteroides, stimulated the production of host hormones known to impact bee development. While we found evidence for cross-feeding interactions, [~]80% of the identified metabolic changes were also observed in mono-colonized bees with Lactobacilli being responsible for the largest share of the metabolic output. These results suggest that bacteria in the honey bee gut colonize largely independent metabolic niches, which may be a general characteristic of gut microbiomes. Our study reveals diverse metabolic functions of gut bacteria that are likely to contribute to bee health, and provide fundamental insights into how metabolic functions are partitioned within gut communities.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHoney bees are important pollinators that harbor a simple gut microbiota with striking parallels to the mammalian system. This makes them relevant models to study gut microbiota functions and its impact on host health. We applied untargeted metabolomics to characterize metabolic changes induced by the gut microbiota, and to characterize contributions of the major community members. We find that the gut microbiota digests recalcitrant substrates derived from the bees pollen-diet. Most metabolic changes could be explained by the activity of individual community members suggesting substrate specificity and independent metabolic niches. Our study provides novel insights into the functional understanding of the bee gut microbiota and provides a framework for applying untargeted metabolomics to disentangle metabolic functions of gut bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Our capacity for higher cognitive reasoning has a measureable limit. This limit is thought to arise from the brains capacity to flexibly reconfigure interactions between spatially distributed networks. Recent work, however, has suggested that reconfigurations of task-related networks are modest when compared with intrinsic  resting state network architecture. Here we combined resting state and task-driven functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine how flexible, task-specific reconfigurations associated with increasing reasoning demands are integrated within a stable intrinsic brain topology. Human participants (21 males and 28 females) underwent an initial resting state scan, followed by a cognitive reasoning task involving different levels of complexity, followed by a second resting state scan. The reasoning task required participants to deduce the identity of a missing element in a 4 x 4 matrix, and item difficulty was scaled parametrically as determined by relational complexity theory. Analyses revealed that external task engagement was characterized by a significant change in functional brain modules. Specifically, resting state and null-task demand conditions were associated with more segregated brain network topology, whereas increases in reasoning complexity resulted in merging of resting state modules. Further increments in task complexity did not change the established modular architecture, but impacted selective patterns of connectivity between fronto-parietal, subcortical, cingulo-opercular and default-mode networks. Larger increases in network efficiency within the newly established task modules were associated with higher reasoning accuracy. Our results shed light on the network architectures that underlie external task engagement, and highlight selective changes in brain connectivity supporting increases in task complexity.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHumans have clear limits in their ability to solve complex reasoning problems. It is thought that such limitations arise from flexible, moment-to-moment reconfigurations of functional brain networks. It is less clear how such task-driven adaptive changes in connectivity relate to stable, intrinsic networks of the brain and behavioral performance. We found that increased reasoning demands rely on selective patterns of connectivity within cortical networks that emerged in addition to a more general, task-induced modular architecture. This task-driven architecture reverted to a more segregated resting state architecture both immediately before and after the task. These findings reveal how flexibility in human brain networks is integral to achieving successful reasoning performance across different levels of cognitive demand.",

    "abstract": "We have designed a Virtual Burrow Assay (VBA) to detect the behavioral responses of head-fixed mice to aversive stimuli. We demonstrate its suitability for measuring novelty detection as well as aversion to both conditioned and innately aversive cues. The VBA simulates a scenario in which a mouse, poised at the threshold of its burrow, evaluates whether to remain exposed to potential threats outside or to retreat inside an enclosure. When presented with aversive stimuli, mice exhibit a stereotyped retreat whose onset is determined by measuring the position of a moveable burrow. This withdrawal, which requires no training, is characterized by an abrupt transition that unfolds within milliseconds--a timescale similar to that of neuronal dynamics, permitting direct comparison between the two. The assay is compatible with standard electrophysiological and optical methods for measuring and perturbing neuronal activity.",

    "abstract": "We study how noise in active dendrites affects information transmission. A mismatch of both noise and refractoriness between a dendritic compartment and a somatic compartment is shown to lead to an input-dependent exchange of leadership, where the dendrite entrains the soma for weak stimuli and the soma entrains the dendrite for strong stimuli. Using this simple mechanism, the noise in the dendritic compartment can boost weak signals without affecting the output of the neuron for strong stimuli. We show that these mechanisms give rise to a noise-induced increase of information transmission by neural populations.",

We have purified and characterized distinct forms of tau monomer--inert (Mi) and seed-competent (Ms). Recombinant Ms triggered intracellular tau aggregation, induced tau fibrillization in vitro, and self-assembled. Ms from Alzheimers disease also seeded aggregation and self-assembled in vitro to form seed-competent multimers. We used crosslinking with mass spectrometry to probe structural differences in Mi vs. Ms. Crosslinks informed models of local peptide structure within the repeat domain which suggest relative inaccessibility of residues that drive aggregation (VQIINK/VQIVYK) in Mi, and exposure in Ms. Limited proteolysis supported this idea. Although tau monomer has been considered to be natively unstructured, our findings belie this assumption and suggest that initiation of pathological aggregation could begin with conversion of tau monomer from an inert to a seed-competent form.",

    "abstract": "In microorganisms such as bacteria or yeasts, metabolic rates are tightly coupled to growth rate, and therefore to fitness. Although the topology of central pathways are largely conserved across organisms, the enzyme kinetics and their parameters generally vary. This prevents us to understand and predict (changes in) metabolic dynamics. The analytical treatment of metabolic pathways is generally restricted to small models, containing maybe two to four equations. Since such small core models involve much coarse graining, their biological interpretation is often hampered. In this paper we aim to bridge the gap between analytical, more in-depth treatment of small core models and biologically more realistic and detailed models by developing new methods. We illustrate these methods for a model of glycolysis in Saccharo-myces cerevisiae yeast, arguably the best characterised metabolic pathway in the literature. The model is more involved than in previous studies, and involves both ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD householding.\\n\\nA detailed analysis of the steady state equations sheds new light on two recently studied biological phenomena in yeast glycolysis: whether it is to be expected that fructose-1,6-biphosphate (FBP) parameterises all steady states, and the occurrence of bistability between a regular steady state and imbalanced steady state in which glycolytic intermediates keep accumulating.\\n\\nThis work shows that the special structure of metabolic pathways does allow for more in-depth bifurcation analyses than is currently the norm. We especially emphasise which of the techniques developed here scale to larger pathways, and which do not.",

    "abstract": "Maize lethal necrosis disease (MLN) is an emerging disease in East Africa caused by the introduction of Maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV). Recent activity seeking to limit spread of the disease is reliant on effective diagnostics. Traditional diagnostics applied on samples with typical field symptoms of MLN have often given negative results using ELISA or PCR for MCMV and Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). Samples collected in the field with typical MLN symptoms were examined using next generation sequencing (NGS). SCMV was found to be more prevalent than suggested by targeted diagnostics. Additionally, the panel of samples were found to be infected with a range of other viruses, seven of which are described here for the first time. Although not previously identified in the region, Maize yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) was the most prevalent virus after MCMV. The development of targeted diagnostics for emerging viruses is complicated when the extent of field variation is unknown, something that can be negated by using NGS methods. As a result we explored MinION technology which may be more readily deployable in resource poor settings. The results show that this sequencer can diagnose known viruses and future iterations have the potential to identify novel viruses.",

    "abstract": "Closed loop neuromodulation, where the stimulation is controlled autonomously based on physiological events, has been more effective than open loop techniques. In the few existing closed loop implementations which have a feedback, indirect non-neurophysiological biomarkers have been typically used (e.g. heart rate, stomach distension). Although these biomarkers enable automatic initiation of neural stimulation, they do not enable intelligent control of stimulation dosage. In this paper, we present a novel closed loop neuromodulation platform based on a dual signal mode that is detecting electrical and chemical signatures of neural activity. We demonstrated it on a case of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Vagal chemical (pH) signal is detected and used for initiatisng VNS and vagal compound action potential (CAP) signals are used to determine the stimulation dosage and pattern. Although we used the paradigm of appetite control and neurometabolic therapies, the platform developed here can be utilised for prototyping closed loop neuromodulation systems before adapting the final System-on-Chip (SoC) design.",

    "abstract": "The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is an important model system for understanding the genetics and physiology of touch. Classical assays for C. elegans touch, which involve manually touching the animal with a probe and observing its response, are limited by their low throughput and qualitative nature. We developed a microfluidic device in which several dozen animals are subject to spatially localized mechanical stimuli with variable amplitude. The device contains 64 sinusoidal channels through which worms crawl, and hydraulic valves that deliver touch stimuli to the worms. We used this assay to characterize the behavioral responses to gentle touch stimuli and the less well studied harsh (nociceptive) touch stimuli. First, we measured the relative response thresholds of gentle and harsh touch. Next, we quantified differences in the receptive fields between wild type worms and a mutant with non-functioning posterior touch receptor neurons. We showed that under gentle touch the receptive field of the anterior touch receptor neurons extends into the posterior half of the body. Finally, we found that the behavioral response to gentle touch does not depend on the locomotion of the animal immediately prior to the stimulus, but does depend on the location of the previous touch. Responses to harsh touch, on the other hand, did not depend on either previous velocity or stimulus location. Differences in gentle and harsh touch response characteristics may reflect the different innervation of the respective mechanosensory cells. Our assay will facilitate studies of mechanosensation, sensory adaptation, and nociception.",

    "abstract": "Antigenic diversity is a key factor underlying the complex epidemiology of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Within-host clonal antigenic variation limits host exposure to the parasites antigenic repertoire, while the high degree of diversity at the population-level requires multiple exposures for hosts to acquire anti-disease immunity. This diversity is predominantly generated through mitotic and meiotic recombination between individual genes and multi-gene repertoires and is therefore expected to respond dynamically to changes in transmission and immune selection. We hypothesised that this coupling creates a positive feedback mechanism whereby infection and disease transmission promotes the generation of diversity, which itself facilitates immune evasion and hence further infection and transmission. To investigate the link between diversity and malaria prevalence in more detail we developed an individual-based model in which antigenic diversity emerges as a dynamic property from the underlying transmission processes. We show that the balance between stochastic extinction and the generation of new antigenic variants is intrinsically linked to within-host and between-host immune selection, which in turn determines the level of diversity that can be maintained in a given population. We further show that the transmission-diversity feedback can lead to temporal lags in the response to natural or intervention-induced perturbations in transmission rates. These results will add to our understanding of the epidemiological dynamics of P. falciparum malaria in different transmission settings and will have important implications for monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of disease control efforts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIncreased availability of genome assemblies for non-model organisms has resulted in invaluable biological and genomic insight into numerous vertebrates including teleosts. The sequencing and assembly of the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) genome and the genomes of many of its relatives (Gadiformes) demonstrated a shared loss 100 million years ago of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II genes. The recent publication of an improved version of the Atlantic cod genome assembly reported an extreme density of tandem repeats compared to other vertebrate genome assemblies. Highly contiguous genome assemblies are needed to further investigate the unusual immune system of the Gadiformes, and the high density of tandem repeats in this group.\\n\\nResultsHere, we have sequenced and assembled the genome of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) - a relative of Atlantic cod - using a combination of PacBio and Illumina reads. Comparative analyses uncover that the haddock genome contains an even higher density of tandem repeats outside and within protein coding sequences than Atlantic cod. Further, both species show an elevated number of tandem repeats in genes mainly involved in signal transduction compared to other teleosts. An in-depth characterization of the immune gene repertoire demonstrates a substantial expansion of MCHI in Atlantic cod compared to haddock. In contrast, the Toll-like receptors show a similar pattern of gene losses and expansions. For another gene family associated with the innate immune system, the NOD-like receptors (NLRs), we find a large expansion common to all teleosts, with possible lineage-specific expansions in zebrafish, stickleback and the codfishes.\\n\\nConclusionsThe generation of a highly contiguous genome assembly of haddock revealed that the high density of short tandem repeats as well as expanded immune gene families is not unique to Atlantic cod - but most likely a feature common to all codfishes. A shared expansion of NLR genes in teleosts suggests that the NLRs have a more substantial role in the innate immunity of teleosts than other vertebrates. Moreover, we find that high copy number genes combined with variable genome assembly qualities may impede complete characterization, i.e. the number of NLRs might be underestimates in the different teleost species.",

We conducted several germination assays, exposing P. effusa sporangia to different temperature and lighting conditions. Between 5 and 25{degrees}C under constant darkness, germination of P. effusa sporangia on water agar declined. These results were qualitatively different from a previous study of P. effusa germination that found a bimodal response curve, with increased germination at lower and higher temperatures. Time course studies revealed that sporangia consistently germinated within the first twelve hours of plating, regardless of incubation temperature. Sporangia exposed to blue light had significantly reduced germination when compared with those exposed to red, yellow, or no light. Light intensity and color significantly impacted germination, although the effect of color varied by light intensity.",

    "abstract": "Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics have been shown to enhance biofilm formation in multiple bacterial species. While antibiotic exposure has been associated with modulated expression in many biofilm-related genes, the mechanisms of drug-induced biofilm formation remain a focus of ongoing research efforts and may vary significantly across species. In this work, we investigate antibiotic-induced biofilm formation in E. faecalis, a leading cause of nosocomial infections. We show that biofilm formation is enhanced by subinhibitory concentrations of cell wall synthesis inhibitors, but not by inhibitors of protein, DNA, folic acid, or RNA synthesis. Furthermore, enhanced biofilm is associated with increased cell lysis, an increase in extracellular DNA (eDNA), and an increase in the density of living cells in the biofilm. In addition, we observe similar enhancement of biofilm formation when cells are treated with non-antibiotic surfactants that induce cell lysis. These findings suggest that antibiotic-induced biofilm formation is governed by a trade-off between drug toxicity and the beneficial effects of cell lysis. To understand this trade-off, we developed a simple mathematical model that predicts changes to antibiotic-induced biofilm formation due to external perturbations, and we verify these predictions experimentally. Specifically, we demonstrate that perturbations that reduce eDNA (DNase treatment) or decrease the number of living cells in the planktonic phase (a second antibiotic) decrease biofilm induction, while chemical inhibitors of cell lysis increase relative biofilm induction and shift the peak to higher antibiotic concentrations. Overall, our results offer experimental evidence linking cell wall synthesis inhibitors, cell lysis, increased eDNA, and biofilm formation in E. faecalis while also providing a predictive, quantitative model that sheds light on the interplay between cell lysis and antibiotic efficacy in developing biofilms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe nervous system of higher eukaryotes is composed of numerous types of neurons and glia that together orchestrate complex neuronal responses. However, this complex pool of cells typically poses analytical challenges in investigating gene expression profiles and their epigenetic basis for specific cell types. Here, we developed a novel method that enables cell type-specific analyses of epigenetic modifications using tandem chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (tChIP-Seq).\\n\\nResultsFLAG-tagged histone H2B, a constitutive chromatin component, was first expressed in Camk2a-positive pyramidal cortical neurons and used to purify chromatin in a cell type-specific manner. Subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation using antibodies against H3K4me3--an active promoter mark--allowed us to survey neuron-specific coding and non-coding transcripts. Indeed, tChIP-Seq identified hundreds of genes associated with neuronal functions and genes with unknown functions expressed in cortical neurons.\\n\\nConclusionstChIP-Seq thus provides a versatile approach to investigating the epigenetic modifications of particular cell types in vivo.",
