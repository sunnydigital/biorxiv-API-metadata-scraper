    "abstract": "Inhibitory priority effects, in which early-arriving species exclude competing species from local communities, are thought to enhance regional species diversity via community divergence. Theory suggests, however, that these same priority effects make it difficult for species to coexist in the region unless individuals are continuously supplied from an external species pool, often an unrealistic assumption. Here we develop an eco-evolutionary hypothesis to solve this conundrum. We build a metacommunity model in which local priority effects occur between two species via interspecific interference. Within each species there are two genotypes: one is more resistant to interspecific interference than the other, but pays a fitness cost for its resistance. Because of this trade-off, species evolve to become less resistant as they become regionally more common. Rare species can then invade some local patches and consequently recover in regional frequency. This \\\"eco-evolutionary buffering\\\" enables the regional coexistence of species despite local priority effects, even in the absence of immigration from an external species pool. Our model predicts that eco-evolutionary buffering is particularly effective when local communities are small and connected by infrequent dispersal.",

    "abstract": "In the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), sensory responses are shaped by behavioral factors such as locomotion. These factors are thought to control a disinhibitory circuit, whereby interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (Vip) inhibit those expressing somatostatin (Sst), disinhibiting pyramidal cells (Pyr). We measured the effect of locomotion on these neurons and on interneurons expressing parvalbumin (Pvalb) in layer 2/3 of mouse V1, and found in-consistencies with the disinhibitory model. In the presence of large stimuli, locomotion increased Sst cell responses without suppressing Vip cells. In the presence of small stimuli, locomotion increased Vip cell responses without suppressing Sst cells. A circuit model could reproduce each cell types activity from the measured activity of other cell types, but only if we allowed locomotion to increase feedforward synaptic weights while modulating recurrent weights. These results suggest that locomotion alters cortical function by changing effective synaptic connectivity, rather than only through disinhibition.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal transfer, gene loss, and duplication result in dynamic bacterial genomes shaped by a complex mixture of different modes of evolution. Closely related strains can differ in the presence or absence of many genes, and the total number of distinct genes found in a set of related isolates - the pan-genome - is often many times larger than the genome of individual isolates. We have developed a pipeline that efficiently identifies orthologous gene clusters in the pan-genome. This pipeline is coupled to a powerful yet easy-to-use web-based visualization software for interactive exploration of the pan-genome. The visualization consists of connected components that allow rapid filtering and searching of genes and inspection of their evolutionary history. For each gene cluster, panX displays an alignment, a phylogenetic tree, maps mutations within that cluster to the branches of the tree and infers gain and loss of genes on the core-genome phylogeny. PanX is available at pangenome.de. Custom pan-genomes can be visualized either using a webserver or by serving panX locally as a browser-based application.",

    "abstract": "Monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1/TTK) is a protein kinase essential in mitotic checkpoint signalling, preventing anaphase until all chromosomes are properly attached to spindle microtubules. Mps1 has emerged as a potential target for cancer therapy, and a variety of compounds have been developed to inhibit its kinase activity. Mutations in the catalytic domain of Mps1 that give rise to inhibitor resistance, but retain catalytic activity and do not display cross-resistance to other Mps1 inhibitors, have been described. Here we characterize the interactions of two such mutants, Mps1 C604Y and C604W, which raise resistance to two closely related compounds, NMS-P715 and its derivative Cpd-5, but not to the well-characterised Mps1 inhibitor, reversine. We show that estimates of the IC50 (employing a novel specific and efficient assay that utilizes a fluorescently labelled substrate) and of the binding affinity (KD) indicate that in both mutants, Cpd-5 should be better tolerated than the closely related NMS-P715. To gain further insight, we determined the crystal structure of the Mps1 kinase mutants bound to Cpd-5 and NMS-P715, and compare the binding modes of Cpd-5, NMS-P715 and reversine. The difference in steric hindrance between Tyr/Trp604 and the trifluoromethoxy moiety of NMS-P715, the methoxy moiety of Cpd-5, and complete absence of such a group in reversine, account for differences we observe in vitro. Our analysis enforces the notion that inhibitors targeting Mps1 drug-resistant mutations can emerge as a feasible intervention strategy based on existing scaffolds, if the clinical need arises.\\n\\nSummary statementThe inhibition of specific Mps1 kinase inhibitors towards the wild-type protein and inhibitor-resistant mutants is explained by a novel specific activity assay, biophysical characterisation, and X-ray structures.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Monitoring changes in influenza A virus genomes is crucial to understand its rapid evolution and adaptation to changing conditions e.g. establishment within novel host species. Selective sweeps represent a rapid mode of adaptation and are typically observed in human influenza A viruses. We describe Sweep Dynamics (SD) plots, a computational method combining phylogenetic algorithms with statistical techniques to characterize the molecular adaptation of rapidly evolving viruses from longitudinal sequence data. To our knowledge, it is the first method that identifies selective sweeps, the time periods in which these occurred and associated changes providing a selective advantage to the virus. We studied the past genome-wide adaptation of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A (pH1N1) and seasonal H3N2 influenza A (sH3N2) viruses. The pH1N1 influenza virus showed simultaneous amino acid changes in various proteins, particularly in seasons of high pH1N1 activity. Partially, these changes resulted in functional alterations facilitating sustained human-to-human transmission. In the evolution of sH3N2 influenza viruses, we detected changes characterizing vaccine strains, which were occasionally revealed in selective sweeps one season prior to the WHO recommendation. Taken together, SD plots allow monitoring and characterizing the adaptive evolution of influenza A viruses by identifying selective sweeps and their associated signatures.",

    "abstract": "Concerns regarding reproducibility of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) findings have been raised. Little is known about how to operationally define R-fMRI reproducibility and to what extent it is affected by multiple comparison correction strategies and sample size. We comprehensively assessed two aspects of reproducibility, test-retest reliability and replicability, on widely used R-fMRI metrics in both between-subject contrasts of sex differences and within-subject comparisons of eyes-open and eyes-closed (EOEC) conditions. We noted permutation test with Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE), a strict multiple comparison correction strategy, reached the best balance between family-wise error rate (under 5%) and test-retest reliability / replicability (e.g., 0.68 for test-retest reliability and 0.25 for replicability of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) for between-subject sex differences, 0.49 for replicability of ALFF for within-subject EOEC differences). Although R-fMRI indices attained moderate reliabilities, they replicated poorly in distinct datasets (replicability < 0.3 for between-subject sex differences, < 0.5 for within-subject EOEC differences). By randomly drawing different sample sizes from a single site, we found reliability, sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) rose as sample size increased. Small sample sizes (e.g., < 80 (40 per group)) not only minimized power (sensitivity < 2%), but also decreased the likelihood that significant results reflect \\\"true\\\" effects (PPV < 0.26) in sex differences. Our findings have implications for how to select multiple comparison correction strategies and highlight the importance of sufficiently large sample sizes in R-fMRI studies to enhance reproducibility.",

The MET proto-oncogene (Accid:NG 008996.1, RefSeqGene LRG 662 on chromosome 7, METwithintrons) encodes 21 exons resulting in a 6710 bps MET gene (Accid: NM 001127500.2, METonlyexons). METwithintrons has multiple matches in the RNA-seq derived reads of lung cancer samples (for example: SRR1982756.11853382). Unfortunately, these are non-specific sequences in the intronic regions, matching to multiple genes on different chromosomes with 100% identity (KIF6 on chr6, COL6A6 on chr3, MYO16 on chr13, etc. for SRR1982756.11853382). In contrast, METonlyexons has few matches in the reads, if at all [2]. However, even RNA-seq from healthy donors have similar matches for METwithintrons so the computation behind the over-expression statistic remains obscure, even if METwithintrons was used as the search gene.

Subjects performing visual working memory tasks exhibit interference in their trial-to-trial response correlations: the recalled target location in the current trial is biased in the direction of the target presented on the previous trial. We present modeling work that (a) develops a probabilistic inference model of this history-dependent bias, and (b) links our probabilistic model to computations of a recurrent network wherein short-term facilitation accounts for the dynamics of the observed bias. Network connectivity is reshaped dynamically during each trial, providing a mechanism for generating predictions from prior trial observations. Applying timescale separation methods, we can obtain a low-dimensional description of the trial-to-trial bias based on the history of target locations. The model has response statistics whose mean is centered at the true target location across many trials, typical of such visual working memory tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate task protocols for which the plastic model performs better than a model with static connectivity: repetitively presented targets are better retained in working memory than targets drawn from uncorrelated sequences.",

The TEP-study also mentioned that mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was  accurately distinguished using surrogate TEP mRNA profiles, which is contested here. It is shown that only 10 out of 24 (a smaller sample set, original study has 60) non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) samples here has any expression at all. Even there the number of reads (101 bp) are [1, 4, 1, 14, 9, 1, 2, 19, 21, 6], and do not even add up to one complete EGFR gene (about 6000 bp). EGFR mutations have been painstakingly collated in www.mycancergenome.org/content/disease/lung-cancer/egfr. In stark contrast, the TEP study has no specification of the EGFR mutant used. The TEP study found EGFR mutations in 17/21 (81%), and EGFR wild-type in 4/39 (10%) for NSCLC samples (Table S7, reflected in Fig 3, Panel E in percentages). A major flaw is the assumption that a non \\\"EGFR wild-type\\\" is a \\\"EGFR mutant\\\" since cases zero with EGFR reads (which are almost half of the samples) could be either. The application of the Kappa statistic to this data is erroneous for two reasons. First, the Kappa statistic does not handle \\\"unknowns\\\", as is the case for samples with zero expression. Secondly,  interobserver variation can be measured in any situation in which two or more independent observers are evaluating the same thing [2]. The 90% (Fig 3, Panel E) is just the percentage of samples (35/39) that are not \\\"EGFT WT\\\" in one observation. It is not qualified to be in the Kappa matrix, where it translates to 35, leading to a Kappa=0.707, which implies \\\"substantial agreement\\\" [2]. The other observation (looking for EGFR mutation) is in a different set. To summarize, this work reiterates negligible expression of EGFR reads in NSCLC samples, and finds serious shortcomings in the statistical analysis of subsequent mutational analysis from these reads in the TEP-study.",

These incomplete annotations may be sufficient to derive a model of a core set of well-studied metabolic pathways that support growth in pure culture. However, pathways important for growth on unusual metabolites exchanged in complex microbial communities are often less understood, resulting in missing functional annotations in newly sequenced genomes. Here, we present results on a comprehensive reannotation of 27 bacterial reference genomes, focusing on enzymes with EC numbers annotated by KEGG, RAST, EFICAz, and the BRENDA enzyme database, and on membrane transport annotations by TransportDB, KEGG and RAST. Our analysis shows that annotation using multiple tools can result in a drastically larger metabolic network reconstruction, adding on average 40% more EC numbers, 3-8 times more substrate-specific transporters, and 37% more metabolic genes. These results are even more pronounced for bacterial species that are more phylogenetically distant from well-studied model organisms such as E. coli.",

    "abstract": "Delineating species and epidemic lineages in fungal plant pathogens is critical to our understanding of disease emergence and the structure of fungal biodiversity, and also informs international regulatory decisions. Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae) is a multi-host pathogen that infects multiple grasses and cereals, is responsible for the most damaging rice disease (rice blast), and of growing concern due to the recent introduction of wheat blast to Bangladesh from South America. However, the genetic structure and evolutionary history of M. oryzae, including the possible existence of cryptic phylogenetic species, remain poorly defined. Here, we use whole-genome sequence information for 76 M. oryzae isolates sampled from 12 grass and cereal genera to infer the population structure of M. oryzae, and to reassess the species status of wheat-infecting populations of the fungus. Species recognition based on genealogical concordance, using published data or extracting previously-used loci from genome assemblies, failed to confirm a prior assignment of wheat blast isolates to a new species (Pyricularia graminis tritici). Inference of population subdivisions revealed multiple divergent lineages within M. oryzae, each preferentially associated with one host genus, suggesting incipient speciation following host shift or host range expansion. Analyses of gene flow, taking into account the possibility of incomplete lineage sorting, revealed that genetic exchanges have contributed to the makeup of multiple lineages within M. oryzae. These findings provide greater understanding of the eco-evolutionary factors that underlie the diversification of M. oryzae and highlight the practicality of genomic data for epidemiological surveillance in this important multi-host pathogen.\\n\\nImportanceInfection of novel hosts is a major route for disease emergence by pathogenic micro-organisms. Understanding the evolutionary history of multi-host pathogens is therefore important to better predict the likely spread and emergence of new diseases. Magnaporthe oryzae is a multi-host fungus that causes serious cereal diseases, including the devastating rice blast disease, and wheat blast, a cause of growing concern due to its recent spread from South America to Asia. Using whole genome analysis of 76 fungal strains from different hosts, we have documented the divergence of M. oryzae into numerous lineages, each infecting a limited number of host species. Our analyses provide evidence that inter-lineage gene flow has contributed to the genetic makeup of multiple M. oryzae lineages within the same species.

    "abstract": "Symptoms of schizophrenia may arise from a failure of cortical circuits to filter-out irrelevant inputs. Schizophrenia has also been linked to disruptions to cortical inhibitory interneurons, consistent with the possibility that in the normally functioning brain, these cells are in some part responsible for determining which inputs are relevant and which irrelevant. Here, we develop an abstract but biologically plausible neural network model that demonstrates how the cortex may learn to ignore irrelevant inputs through plasticity processes affecting inhibition. The model is based on the proposal that the amount of excitatory output from a cortical circuit encodes expected magnitude of reward or punishment (\\\"relevance\\\"), which can be trained using a temporal difference learning mechanism acting on feed-forward inputs to inhibitory interneurons. The model exhibits learned irrelevance and blocking, which become impaired following disruptions to inhibitory units. When excitatory units are connected to a competitive-learning output layer, the relevance code is capable of modulating learning and activity. Accordingly, the combined network is capable of recapitulating published experimental data linking inhibition in frontal cortex with fear learning and expression. Finally, the model demonstrates how relevance learning can take place in parallel with other types of learning, through plasticity rules involving inhibitory and excitatory components respectively. Altogether, this work offers a theory of how the cortex learns to selectively inhibit inputs, providing insight into how relevance-assignment problems may emerge in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Closed loop neuromodulation, where the stimulation is controlled autonomously based on physiological events, has been more effective than open loop techniques. In the few existing closed loop implementations which have a feedback, indirect non-neurophysiological biomarkers have been typically used (e.g. heart rate, stomach distension). Although these biomarkers enable automatic initiation of neural stimulation, they do not enable intelligent control of stimulation dosage. In this paper, we present a novel closed loop neuromodulation platform based on a dual signal mode that is detecting electrical and chemical signatures of neural activity. We demonstrated it on a case of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Vagal chemical (pH) signal is detected and used for initiatisng VNS and vagal compound action potential (CAP) signals are used to determine the stimulation dosage and pattern. Although we used the paradigm of appetite control and neurometabolic therapies, the platform developed here can be utilised for prototyping closed loop neuromodulation systems before adapting the final System-on-Chip (SoC) design.",

    "abstract": "Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics have been shown to enhance biofilm formation in multiple bacterial species. While antibiotic exposure has been associated with modulated expression in many biofilm-related genes, the mechanisms of drug-induced biofilm formation remain a focus of ongoing research efforts and may vary significantly across species. In this work, we investigate antibiotic-induced biofilm formation in E. faecalis, a leading cause of nosocomial infections. We show that biofilm formation is enhanced by subinhibitory concentrations of cell wall synthesis inhibitors, but not by inhibitors of protein, DNA, folic acid, or RNA synthesis. Furthermore, enhanced biofilm is associated with increased cell lysis, an increase in extracellular DNA (eDNA), and an increase in the density of living cells in the biofilm. In addition, we observe similar enhancement of biofilm formation when cells are treated with non-antibiotic surfactants that induce cell lysis. These findings suggest that antibiotic-induced biofilm formation is governed by a trade-off between drug toxicity and the beneficial effects of cell lysis. To understand this trade-off, we developed a simple mathematical model that predicts changes to antibiotic-induced biofilm formation due to external perturbations, and we verify these predictions experimentally. Specifically, we demonstrate that perturbations that reduce eDNA (DNase treatment) or decrease the number of living cells in the planktonic phase (a second antibiotic) decrease biofilm induction, while chemical inhibitors of cell lysis increase relative biofilm induction and shift the peak to higher antibiotic concentrations. Overall, our results offer experimental evidence linking cell wall synthesis inhibitors, cell lysis, increased eDNA, and biofilm formation in E. faecalis while also providing a predictive, quantitative model that sheds light on the interplay between cell lysis and antibiotic efficacy in developing biofilms.",

    "abstract": "During non-REM sleep, memory consolidation is driven by a dialogue between hippocampus and cortex involving the reactivation of specific neural activity sequences ( replay). In the hippocampus, replay occurs during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), short bouts of excitatory activity in area CA3 which induce high frequency oscillations in the inhibitory interneurons of area CA1. Despite growing evidence for the functional importance of replay, its neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a novel theoretical model of hippocampal spiking during SWRs. In our model, noise-induced activation of CA3 pyramidal cells triggered an excitatory cascade capable of inducing local ripple events in CA1. Ripples occurred stochastically, with Schaffer Collaterals driving their coordination, so that localized sharp waves in CA3 produced consistently localized CA1 ripples. In agreement with experimental data, the majority of pyramidal cells in the model showed low reactivation probabilities across SWRs. We found, however, that a subpopulation of pyramidal cells had high reactivation probabilities, which derived from fine-tuning of the network connectivity. In particular, the excitatory inputs along synaptic pathway(s) converging onto cells and cell pairs controlled emergent single cell and cell pair reactivation, with inhibitory inputs and intrinsic cell excitability playing differential roles in CA3 vs. CA1. Our model predicts (1) that the hippocampal network structure driving the emergence of SWR is also able to generate and modulate reactivation, (2) inhibition plays a particularly prominent role in CA3 reactivation and (3) CA1 sequence reactivation is reliant on CA3-CA1 interactions rather than an intrinsic CA1 process.",

In testing OPUS-CSF on decoy recognition, it maximally recognized 257 native structures out of 278 targets in 11 commonly used decoy sets, significantly more than other popular all-atom empirical potentials. The average correlation coefficient with TM-score was also comparable with those of other potentials. OPUS-CSF is a highly coarse-grained scoring function, which only requires input of partial mainchain information, and very fast.

About 50% of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas present mutations/amplification of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase. Here we propose to investigate if the hyper activation of that pathway could influence the response to BRAFV600E specific inhibitors.\\n\\nTo test this, we used two mouse models of thyroid cancer. Single mutant (BRAFV600E) mice responded to BRAFV600E-specific inhibition (PLX-4720), while double mutant mice (BRAFV600E; PIK3CAH1047R) showed resistance and even signs of aggravation. This resistance was abrogated by combination with a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor. At the molecular level, we could show that this resistance was concomitant to a paradoxical activation of the MAP-Kinase pathway, which could be overturned by phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibition in vivo in our mouse model and in vitro in human double mutant cell lines.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we reveal a phosphoinositide 3-kinase driven, paradoxical MAP-Kinase pathway activation as mechanism for resistance to BRAFV600E specific inhibitors in a clinically relevant mouse model of thyroid cancer.",

    "abstract": "Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (MEG, EEG) are essential techniques for studying distributed signal dynamics in the human brain. In particular, the functional role of neural oscillations remains to be clarified. Imaging methods need to identify distinct brain regions that concurrently generate oscillatory activity, with adequate separation in space and time. Yet, spatial smearing and inhomogeneous signal-to-noise are challenging factors to source reconstruction from external sensor data. The detection of weak sources in the presence of stronger regional activity nearby is a typical complication of MEG/EEG source imaging. We propose a novel, hypothesis-driven source reconstruction approach to address these methodological challenges1. The imaging with embedded statistics (iES) method is a subspace scanning technique that constrains the mapping problem to the actual experimental design. A major benefit is that, regardless of signal strength, the contributions from all oscillatory sources, which activity is consistent with the tested hypothesis, are equalized in the statistical maps produced. We present extensive evaluations of iES on group MEG data, for mapping 1) induced oscillations using experimental contrasts, 2) ongoing narrow-band oscillations in the resting-state, 3) co-modulation of brain-wide oscillatory power with a seed region, and 4) co-modulation of oscillatory power with peripheral signals (pupil dilation). Along the way, we demonstrate several advantages of iES over standard source imaging approaches. These include the detection of oscillatory coupling without rejection of zero-phase coupling, and detection of ongoing oscillations in deeper brain regions, where signal-to-noise conditions are unfavorable. We also show that iES provides a separate evaluation of oscillatory synchronization and desynchronization in experimental contrasts, which has important statistical advantages. The flexibility of iES allows it to be adjusted to many experimental questions in systems neuroscience.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe oscillatory activity of the brain produces a repertoire of signal dynamics that is rich and complex. Noninvasive recording techniques such as scalp magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (MEG, EEG) are key methods to advance our comprehension of the role played by neural oscillations in brain functions and dysfunctions. Yet, there are methodological challenges in mapping these elusive components of brain activity that have remained unresolved. We introduce a new mapping technique, called imaging with embedded statistics (iES), which alleviates these difficulties. With iES, signal detection is constrained explicitly to the operational hypotheses of the study design. We show, in a variety of experimental contexts, how iES emphasizes the oscillatory components of brain activity, if any, that match the experimental hypotheses, even in deeper brain regions where signal strength is expected to be weak in MEG. Overall, the proposed method is a new imaging tool to respond to a wide range of neuroscience questions concerning the scaffolding of brain dynamics via anatomically-distributed neural oscillations.",

Clustering these more versatile adults, while others are away hunting and gathering, provides a setup for assortative mating. This can lengthen attention span, enhance versatility and, with it, brain size. The rate of enlargement is accelerated by a boom-and-bust cycle in their meat supply, predicting the observed initiation of enlargement at -2.3 myr in the Rift Valley once boom-prone grazers evolved from the mixed feeders. Several months after lightning created a burn scar back in the brush, the new grassland enables a population boom for those grazers that discover it. Several decades later as brush regrows, they are pushed back. Their hominin followers, wicked in from the grasslands shady fringe, boom together with the burn-scar grazers. They then follow their meat supply back to the main population. This creates an amplifying feedback loop, shifting Homo gene frequencies centrally. Brush fires are so frequent that the cosmic ray mutation rate becomes enlargements rate-limiter, consistent with 460 cm3/myr remaining constant during many climate shifts. The apparent tripling of enlargement rate in the last 0.2 myr vanished when the non-ancestors were omitted. Asian Homo erectus enlargement lags the ancestral trend line by 0.5 myr. Neanderthals lag somewhat less but have a late size spurt after the -70 kyr Homo sapiens Out of Africa, suggesting enlargement genes were acquired via interbreeding.",

Here we investigate the role of the chromosome conformation in shaping the search path of transcription factors. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover the main principles of their diffusion on folded chromatin. Chromosome contacts play a conflicting role: at low density they enhance the traffic of transcription factors, but a high density they lower the traffic by volume exclusion. Consistently, we observe that in human cells, highly occupied targets, where protein binding is promiscuous, are found at sites engaged in chromosome loops within uncompact chromatin. In summary, those results provide a theoretical framework to understand the search trajectories of transcription factors and highlight the key contribution of genome conformation.",

We conducted laboratory experiments and analyses of recent extinctions in the amphibian genus Atelopus to show that species from the coldest environments experienced the greatest disease susceptibility and extinction risk when temperatures rapidly warmed, confirming predictions of the thermal mismatch hypothesis.

    "abstract": "Phenology, or the timing of seasonal activities, is shifting with climate change, resulting in disruptions to the timing of migration and breeding and in emerging asynchronies between interacting species1-5. Recent syntheses have concluded that trophic level1, latitude6, and how phenological responses are measured7 are key to determining the strength of phenological responses to climate change. However, despite these insights, researchers still lack a comprehensive framework that can predict responses to climate change globally and across diverse taxa. For example, little is known about whether phenological shifts are driven by different climatic factors across regions or which ecologically important species characteristics (e.g., body size) predict the strength of phenological responses. Here, we address these questions by synthesizing hundreds of published time series of animal phenology from across the planet. We find that temperature drives phenological responses at mid-latitudes, but precipitation is more important at lower latitudes, likely because these climate factors often drive seasonality in each of these regions. Body size is also negatively associated with the strength of phenological shift, suggesting emerging asynchronies between interacting species that differ in size, such as hosts and ectoparasites and predators and prey. Finally, although there are many compelling biological explanations for spring phenological delays, some examples of delays are associated with short annual records prone to sampling error. As climate change intensifies, our findings arm biologists with predictions concerning which climatic variables and organismal traits drive phenological shifts.",

    "abstract": "The long-running debate about the role of selection in maintaining genetic variation has been given new impetus by the discovery of hundreds of seasonally oscillating polymorphisms in wild Drosophila, possibly stabilized by an alternating summer-winter selection regime. Historically there has been skepticism about the potential of temporal variation to balance polymorphism, because selection must be strong to have a meaningful stabilizing effect -- unless dominance also varies over time (\"reversal of dominance\"). Here we develop a simplified model of seasonally variable selection that simultaneously incorporates four different stabilizing mechanisms, including two genetic mechanisms (\"cumulative overdominance\" and reversal of dominance), as well as ecological \"storage\" (\"protection from selection\" and boom-bust demography). We use our model to compare the stabilizing effects of these mechanisms. Although reversal of dominance has by far the greatest stabilizing effect, we argue that the three other mechanisms could also stabilize polymorphism under plausible conditions, particularly when all three are present. With many loci subject to diminishing returns epistasis, reversal of dominance stabilizes many alleles of small effect. This makes the combination of the other three mechanisms, which are incapable of stabilizing small effect alleles, a better candidate for stabilizing the detectable frequency oscillations of large effect alleles.",

    "abstract": "The effect of a mutation on the organism often depends on what other mutations are already present in its genome. Geneticists refer to such mutational interactions as epistasis. Pairwise epistatic effects have been recognized for over a century, and their evolutionary implications have received theoretical attention for nearly as long. However, pairwise epistatic interactions themselves can vary with genomic background. This is called higher-order epistasis, and its consequences for evolution are much less well understood. Here, we assess the influence that higher-order epistasis has on the topography of 16 published, biological fitness landscapes. We find that on average, their effects on fitness landscape declines with order, and suggest that notable exceptions to this trend may deserve experimental scrutiny. We explore whether natural selection may have contributed to this finding, and conclude by highlight opportunities for further work dissecting the influence that epistasis of all orders has on the efficiency of natural selection.",

    "abstract": "The presence of batch effects is a well-known problem in experimental data analysis, and single- cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is no exception. Large-scale scRNA-seq projects that generate data from different laboratories and at different times are rife with batch effects that can fatally compromise integration and interpretation of the data. In such cases, computational batch correction is critical for eliminating uninteresting technical factors and obtaining valid biological conclusions. However, existing methods assume that the composition of cell populations are either known or the same across batches. Here, we present a new strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbours in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on pre-defined or equal population compositions across batches, only requiring that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on a range of simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. We also show how our method can be applied to integrate scRNA-seq data from two separate studies of early embryonic development.",

    "abstract": "Complex sensory suites often underlie critical behaviors, including avoiding predators or locating prey, mates, and shelter. Multisensory systems that control motor behavior even appear in unicellular eukaryotes, such as Chlamydomonas, which are important laboratory models for sensory biology. However, we know of no unicellular opisthokont models that control motor behavior using a multimodal sensory suite. Therefore, existing single-celled models for multimodal sensorimotor integration are very distantly related to animals. Here, we describe a multisensory system that controls the motor function of unicellular, fungal zoospores. We find zoospores of Allomyces arbusculus exhibit both phototaxis and chemotaxis. While swimming, they move towards light and settle on cellulose membranes exuding combinations of amino acids. Furthermore, we report that closely related Allomyces species do not share this multisensory system. Instead, each possesses only one of the two modalities present in A. arbusculus. This diversity of sensory suites within Allomyces provides a rare example of a comparative framework that can be used to examine the evolution of sensory suites. The tractability of Allomyces and related fungi as laboratory organisms will allow detailed mechanistic investigations into how sensory systems may have functioned in early opisthokonts before multicellularity allowed for the evolution of specialized cell types.\\n\\nSummary StatementZoospores ability to detect light or chemical gradients varies within Allomyces. Here, we report a multimodal sensory system controlling behavior in a fungus, and previously unknown variation in zoospore sensory suites.",

    "abstract": "The interrelationships of the four classes of Myriapoda have been an unresolved question in arthropod phylogenetics and an example of conflict between morphology and molecules. Morphology and development provide compelling support for Diplopoda (millipedes) and Pauropoda being closest relatives, and moderate support for Symphyla being more closely related to the diplopod-pauropod group than any of them are to Chilopoda (centipedes). In contrast, several molecular datasets have contradicted the Diplopoda-Pauropoda grouping (named Dignatha). Here we present the first transcriptomic data including a pauropod and both families of symphylans, allowing myriapod interrelationships to be inferred from phylogenomic data from representatives of all main lineages. Phylogenomic analyses consistently recovered Dignatha with strong support. Taxon removal experiments identified outgroup choice as a critical factor affecting myriapod interrelationships. Diversification of millipedes in the Ordovician and centipedes in the Silurian closely approximates fossil evidence whereas the deeper nodes of the myriapod tree date to various depths in the Cambrian-Early Ordovician, roughly coinciding with recent estimates of terrestrialisation in other arthropod lineages, including hexapods and arachnids. We provide a summary state-of-the-art Myriapoda Tree of Life at the ordinal level, the resolution of which has been improved by phylogenomics.",

The catalytically dead variant of Cas9 known as dCas9 can be guided by small RNAs to block transcription of target genes, in a strategy also known as CRISPRi. Here, we reveal that the level of complementarity between the guide RNA and the target controls the rate at which dCas9 successfully blocks the RNA polymerase. We use this mechanism to precisely and robustly reduce gene expression by defined relative amounts. We demonstrate broad applicability of this method to the study of genetic regulation and cellular physiology. First, we characterize feedback strength of a model auto-repressor. Second, we study the impact of copy-number variations of cell-wall synthesizing enzymes on cell morphology. Finally, we demonstrate that this system can be multiplexed to obtain any combination of fractional repression of two genes.",

    "abstract": "mRNA translation is an energetically costly activity required for almost all biological processes. The multiprotein complex eIF4F, which bridges the 5 cap and the polyA tail through eIF4E and eIF4G, respectively, is necessary for efficient translation initiation of most mRNAs and is an important target of translational control. Previous work suggests that cap-proximal nucleotides can modulate eIF4E binding to mRNAs, but the effect of specific cap-proximal nucleotide sequences on eIF4E recruitment and the ultimate consequences for translation remain unknown. Using RNA Bind-n-Seq on a model 5 UTR, we systematically identify eIF4E-intrinsic cap-proximal nucleotide binding preferences. mRNAs with highly-bound motifs are translated well in a cell-free system, whereas those with low-eIF4E-binding motifs are not. However, eIF4E juxtacap motif preferences do not dictate the ribosome occupancy of endogenous mRNAs in cells, suggesting that the effect of juxtacap sequence on eIF4E binding and translation is mRNA-context-dependent. Accordingly, a single downstream point mutation that disrupts a predicted base pair with a preferred juxtacap nucleotide increases translation. The juxtacap sequence is a previously unappreciated determinant of eIF4E recruitment to mRNAs, and we propose that differences in mRNA 5 end accessibility defined by the juxtacap sequence are important for establishing translational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Syntaxin 3 (Stx3), a SNARE protein located and functioning at the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells, is required for epithelial polarity. A fraction of Stx3 is localized to late endosomes / lysosomes though how it traffics there and its function in these organelles is unknown. Here we report that Stx3 undergoes mono - ubiquitination in a conserved polybasic domain. Stx3 present at the basolateral - but not the apical - plasma membrane is rapidly endocytosed, targeted to endosomes, internalized into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) and excreted in exosomes. A non - ubiquitinatable mutant of Stx3 (Stx3 - 5R) fails to enter this pathway and leads to the inability of the apical exosomal cargo protein GPRC5B to enter the ILV / exosomal pathway. This suggests that ubiquitination of Stx3 leads to removal from the basolateral membrane to achieve apical polarity, that Stx3 plays a role in the recruitment of cargo to exosomes, and that the Stx3 - 5R mutant acts as a dominant - negative inhibitor. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) acquires its membrane in an intracellular compartment and we show that Stx3 - 5R strongly reduces the number of excreted infectious viral particles. Altogether these results suggest that Stx3 functions in the transport of specific proteins to apical exosomes and that HCMV exploit this pathway for virion excretion.",

These researchers missed this finding in their data because they never calculated population growth rates for the snail populations before they reached a carrying capacity or crashed. These results demonstrate that both Syngenta-funded and non-Syngenta-funded researchers have provided evidence that ecologically relevant concentrations of atrazine are capable of increasing snail populations.

Recognised internationally for rare migratory birds and important seabird colonies, the flora of Fair Isle has received far less attention. To rectify this, we present the first comprehensive floristic study of the island. A botanical survey was performed for each monad, and habitat information was collated following the NCC Phase 1 habitat survey method. These data were compiled to give a comprehensive checklist of 317 species, classified into 31 orders, 68 families and 191 genera according to APG IV. Of the total number of species, 254 are native to Great Britain and the remaining 63 are aliens. The list includes 10 species under threat, 7 nationally scarce and 1 nationally rare species. Our results reveal that even though Fair Isle is 200 times smaller than the full archipelago of Shetland, it holds a surprising one-third the number of species. The island is also notable for its complex mosaic of habitats, which include a range of communities that are rare or under threat elsewhere in the British Isles. We also provide recommendations for future monitoring to record changes in land-use and the effects of climate change.",

    "abstract": "Solenodons are insectivores living on the Caribbean islands, with few surviving related taxa. The genus occupies one of the most ancient branches among the placental mammals. The history, unique biology and adaptations of these enigmatic venomous species, can be greatly advanced given the availability of genome data, but the whole genome assembly for solenodons has never been previously performed, partially due to the difficulty in obtaining samples from the field. Island isolation has likely resulted in extreme homozygosity within the Hispaniolan solenodon (Solenodon paradoxus), thus we tested the performance of several assembly strategies for performance with genetically impoverished species genomes. The string-graph based assembly strategy seems a better choice compared to the conventional de Brujn graph approach, due to the high levels of homozygosity, which is often a hallmark of endemic or endangered species. A consensus reference genome was assembled from sequences of five individuals from the southern subspecies (S. p. woodi). In addition, we obtained one additional sequence of the northern subspecies (S. p. paradoxus). The resulting genome assemblies were compared to each other, and annotated for genes, with a specific emphasis on the venomous genes, repeats, variable microsatellite loci and other genomic variants. Phylogenetic positioning and selection signatures were inferred based on 4,416 single copy orthologs from 10 other mammals. Patterns of SNP variation allowed us to infer population demography, which indicated a subspecies split within the Hispaniolan solenodon at least 300 Kya.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a transformative tool to discover and define cellular phenotypes. While computational scRNA-seq methods are currently well suited for experiments representing a single condition, technology, or species, analyzing multiple datasets simultaneously raises new challenges. In particular, traditional analytical workflows struggle to align subpopulations that are present across datasets, limiting the possibility for integrated or comparative analysis. Here, we introduce a new computational strategy for scRNA-seq alignment, utilizing common sources of variation to identify shared subpopulations between datasets as part of our R toolkit Seurat. We demonstrate our approach by aligning scRNA-seq datasets of PBMCs under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced across two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell  atlases generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across datasets, and can identify subpopulations that could not be detected by analyzing datasets independently. We anticipate that these methods will serve not only to correct for batch or technology-dependent effects, but also to facilitate general comparisons of scRNA-seq datasets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution.\\n\\nAvailabilityInstallation instructions, documentation, and tutorials are available at http://www.satijalab.org/seurat",

    "abstract": "The multifaceted control of gene expression requires tight coordination of regulatory mechanisms at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Here, we studied the interdependence of transcription, splicing and polyadenylation events on single mRNA molecules by full-length mRNA sequencing. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we found 2,700 genes with interdependent alternative transcription, splicing and polyadenylation events, both in proximal and distant parts of mRNA molecules. The analysis of three human primary tissues revealed similar patterns of interdependency between transcription and mRNA processing events. We predict thousands of novel Open Reading Frames from the sequence of full-length mRNAs and obtained evidence for their translation by shotgun proteomics. The mapping database rescued 358 previously unassigned peptides and improved the assignment of others. By recognizing sample-specific amino-acid changes and novel splicing patterns, full-length mRNA sequencing improved proteogenomics analysis of MCF-7 cells. Our findings demonstrate that our understanding of transcriptome complexity is far from complete and provides a basis to reveal largely unresolved mechanisms that coordinate transcription and mRNA processing.",

    "abstract": "MotivationRegulatory sequences are not solely defined by their nucleic acid sequence but also by their relative distances to genomic landmarks such as transcription start site, exon boundaries, or polyadenylation site. Deep learning has become the approach of choice for modeling regulatory sequences because of its strength to learn complex sequence features. However, modeling relative distances to genomic landmarks in deep neural networks has not been addressed.\\n\\nResultsHere we developed spline transformation, a neural network module based on splines to flexibly and robustly model distances. Modeling distances to various genomic landmarks with spline transformations significantly increased state-of-the-art prediction accuracy of in vivo RNA-binding protein binding sites for 114 out of 123 proteins. We also developed a deep neural network for human splice branchpoint based on spline transformations that outperformed the current best, already distance-based, machine learning model. Compared to piecewise linear transformation, as obtained by composition of rectified linear units, spline transformation yields higher prediction accuracy as well as faster and more robust training. As spline transformation can be applied to further quantities beyond distances, such as methylation or conservation, we foresee it as a versatile component in the genomics deep learning toolbox.\\n\\nAvailabilitySpline transformation is implemented as a Keras layer in the CONCISE python package: https://github.com/gagneurlab/concise.

    "abstract": "Length polymorphisms in genomic short tandem repeats have been implicated in a variety of diseases, most notably human neurodegenerative disorders. Expansions of tandem repeats are also associated with genomic instability in cancer. Our previous study of length-3 tandem repeats uncovered a surprising pattern in the length distribution of certain such repeats in the non-coding regions of the human reference genome: a bias towards repeats of length 3n - 1, (n > 3). That is, the observed frequency of repeats of this length in the human genome is higher than expected by chance based on the frequency of shorter repeats.\\n\\nWe have hypothesized that this pattern may be a general property of genomic DNA. If true, this could have implications with regard to the dynamics of repeat expansion generally. To test this hypothesis, we have analyzed the genomic sequences of a broad range of eukaryotic organisms as well as several complete human genomes and obtained a number of thought provoking results. We establish that this unexpected elevation in frequency of 3n - 1 long repeats is statistically significant. We also expanded this analysis to different classes of genomic regions and tandem repeats of length four and five. The specific pattern was found in 13 of the 20 organisms analyzed, including all chordate and insect genomes tested. The bias pattern, however, was not confined to a single branch of the evolutionary tree. For some genomes, such as Drosophila melanogaster, the repeat bias surprisingly was also identified in exons. The pattern is present in both small and large genomes. A similar pattern was also found in tetranucleotide and pentanucleotide repeats in the human genome. Another surprising property was identified for the flanking GC content for triplet repeats of length 3n. These findings indicate a puzzling new genomic phenomenon with possible evolutionary and disease-related implications.",

Clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques often help in discerning inherent structures. In biological datasets such as microbial community composition or gene expression data, observations can be generated from a continuous process, often unknown. Estimating data points  natural ordering and their corresponding uncertainties can help researchers draw insights about the mechanisms involved.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a Bayesian Unidimensional Scaling (BUDS) technique which extracts dominant sources of variation in high dimensional datasets and produces their visual data summaries, facilitating the exploration of a hidden continuum. The method maps multivariate data points to latent one-dimensional coordinates along their underlying trajectory, and provides estimated uncertainty bounds. By statistically modeling dissimilarities and applying a DiSTATIS registration method to their posterior samples, we are able to incorporate visualizations of uncertainties in the estimated data trajectory across different regions using confidence contours for individual data points. We also illustrate the estimated overall data density across different areas by including density clouds. One-dimensional coordinates recovered by BUDS help researchers discover sample attributes or covariates that are factors driving the main variability in a dataset. We demonstrated usefulness and accuracy of BUDS on a set of published microbiome 16S and RNA-seq and roll call data.\\n\\nConclusionsOur method effectively recovers and visualizes natural orderings present in datasets.

However, reliable annotation of the extensive amounts of small non-coding RNA data produced by high-throughput sequencing is time-consuming and requires robust bioinformatics expertise. Moreover, existing tools have a number of shortcomings including a lack of sensitivity under certain conditions, limited number of supported species or detectable sub-classes of small RNAs.\\n\\nResultsHere we introduce unitas, an out-of-the-box ready software for complete annotation of small RNA sequence datasets, supporting the wide range of species for which non-coding RNA reference sequences are available in the Ensembl databases (currently more than 800). unitas combines high quality annotation and numerous analysis features in a user-friendly manner. A complete annotation can be started with one simple shell command, making unitas particularly useful for researchers not having access to a bioinformatics facility. Noteworthy, the algorithms implemented in unitas are on par or even outperform comparable existing tools for small RNA annotation that base on available ncRNA sequence information.\\n\\nConclusionsunitas brings together annotation and analysis features that hitherto required the installation of numerous different bioinformatics tools which can pose a challenge for the non-expert user. With this, unitas overcomes the problem of read normalization.

    "abstract": "Adverse effects of anthropogenic changes on biodiversity might be mediated by their impacts on the stress response of organisms. To test this hypothesis we crossed exposure to metyrapone, a synthesis inhibitor of the stress hormone corticosterone, with exposure to the herbicide atrazine and the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) to assess whether the effects of these stressors on tadpoles and post-metamorphic frogs were mediated by corticosterone. Metyrapone countered atrazine-and Bd-induced corticosterone elevations. However, atrazine-and Bd-induced reductions in body size were not mediated by corticosterone because they persisted despite metyrapone exposure. Atrazine lowered Bd abundance without metyrapone but increased Bd abundance with metyrapone for tadpoles and frogs. In contrast, atrazine reduced tolerance of Bd infections because frogs exposed to atrazine as tadpoles had reduced growth with Bd compared to solvent controls; this effect was not countered by metyrapone. Our results suggest that the adverse effects of atrazine and Bd on amphibian growth, development, and tolerance of infection are not mediated primarily by corticosterone. Instead, these effects are likely a function of energy lost from atrazine detoxification, defense against Bd, or repair from damage caused by atrazine and Bd. Additional studies are needed to evaluate how often the effects of anthropogenic stressors are mediated by stress hormones.",

    "abstract": "In order to discover specific variants with relatively large effects on the human face we have devised an approach to identifying facial features with high heritability. This is based on using twin data to estimate the additive genetic value of each point on a face, as provided by a 3D camera system. In addition, we have used the ethnic difference between East Asian and European faces as a further source of face genetic variation. We use principal components analysis to provide a fine definition of the surface features of human faces around the eyes and of the profile, and chose upper and lower 10% extremes of the most heritable PCs for looking for genetic associations. Using this strategy for the analysis of 3D images of 1832 unique volunteers from the well characterised People of the British Isles study [1, 2] and 1567 unique twin images from the TwinsUK cohort (www.twinsuk.ac.uk), together with genetic data for 500,000 SNPs, we have identified three specific genetic variants with notable effects on facial profiles and eyes.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe human face is extraordinarily variable and the extreme similarity of the faces of identical twins indicates that most of this variability is genetically determined. This level of genetic variability has probably arisen through natural selection, for example, for recognition of membership of a group or as a consequence of differential mate selection with respect to facial features. We have devised an approach to identifying specific genetic effects on particular facial features. This should enable the understanding, eventually at the molecular level, of the nature of this extraordinary genetic variability, which is such an important feature of our everyday human interactions.\\n\\nAuthor ContributionsWFB conceived the project.

    "abstract": "Animals are proposed to learn the latent rules governing their environment in order to maximize their chances of survival. However, rules may change without notice, forcing animals to keep a memory of which one is currently at work. Rule switching can lead to situations in which the same stimulus/response pairing is positively and negatively rewarded in the long run, depending on variables that are not accessible to the animal. This fact rises questions on how neural systems are capable of reinforcement learning in environments where the reinforcement is inconsistent. Here we address this issue by asking about which aspects of connectivity, neural excitability and synaptic plasticity are key for a very general, stochastic spiking neural network model to solve a task in which rules change without being cued, taking the serial reversal task (SRT) as paradigm. Contrary to what could be expected, we found strong limitations for biologically plausible networks to solve the SRT. Especially, we proved that no network of neurons can learn a SRT if it is a single neural population that integrates stimuli information and at the same time is responsible of choosing the behavioural response. This limitation is independent of the number of neurons, neuronal dynamics or plasticity rules, and arises from the fact that plasticity is locally computed at each synapse, and that synaptic changes and neuronal activity are mutually dependent processes. We propose and characterize a spiking neural network model that solves the SRT, which relies on separating the functions of stimuli integration and response selection. The model suggests that experimental efforts to understand neural function should focus on the characterization of neural circuits according to their connectivity, neural dynamics, and the degree of modulation of synaptic plasticity with reward.",

    "abstract": "In the phenomenon of perceptual filling-in, missing sensory information can be reconstructed via interpolation from adjacent contextual cues by what is necessarily an endogenous, not yet well understood, neural process. In this investigation, sound stimuli were chosen to allow observation of fixed cortical oscillations driven by contextual (but missing) sensory input, thus entirely reflecting endogenous neural activity. The stimulus employed was a 5 Hz frequency-modulated tone, with brief masker probes (noise bursts) occasionally added. For half the probes, the rhythmic frequency modulation was moreover removed. Listeners reported whether the tone masked by each probe was perceived as being rhythmic or not. Time-frequency analysis of neural responses obtained by magnetoencephalography (MEG) shows that for maskers without the underlying acoustic rhythm, trials where rhythm was nonetheless perceived show higher evoked sustained rhythmic power than trials for which no rhythm was reported. The results support a model in which perceptual filling-in is aided by differential co-modulations of cortical activity at rates directly relevant to human speech communication. We propose that the presence of rhythmically-modulated neural dynamics predicts the subjective experience of a rhythmically modulated sound in real time, even when the perceptual experience is not supported by corresponding sensory data.",

To assess capacity for control of voice, we examined how accurately and quickly subjects changed the pitch of their voice within a trial to correct for a transient perturbation of the pitch of their auditory feedback. When compared to sibling controls, 16p11.2 deletion carriers show an over-exaggerated pitch compensation response to unpredictable mid-vocalization pitch perturbations. We also examined sensorimotor adaptation of speech by assessing how subjects learned to adapt their sustained productions of formants (speech spectral peak frequencies important for vowel identity), in response to consistent changes in their auditory feedback during vowel production. Deletion carriers show reduced sensorimotor adaptation to sustained vowel identity changes in auditory feedback. These results together suggest that 16p11.2 deletion carriers have fundamental impairments in the basic mechanisms of speech motor control and these impairments may partially explain the deficits in speech and language in these individuals.",

    "abstract": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-{beta} is synthesized as a proprotein that dimerizes in the endoplasmic reticulum. After processing in the Golgi to cleave the N-terminal prodomain from the C-terminal growth factor (GF) domain in each monomer, pro-TGF-{beta} is secreted and stored in latent complexes. It is unclear which prodomain and GF monomer are linked prior to proprotein convertase (PC) cleavage, and how much conformational change occurs following cleavage. We have determined a structure of pro-TGF-{beta}1 with the PC cleavage site mutated, to mimic the structure of the TGF-{beta}1 proprotein. Our structure demonstrates that the prodomain arm domain in one monomer is linked to the GF that interacts with the arm domain in the other monomer in the dimeric structure, i.e., the prodomain arm domain and GF domain in each monomer are swapped. Swapping has important implications for the mechanism of biosynthesis in the TGF-{beta} family and is relevant to the mechanism for preferential formation of heterodimers over homodimers for some members of the TGF-{beta} family. Our structure also provides comparisons between independent TGF-{beta}1 crystal structures and between human and porcine pro-TGF-{beta}1.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional coordination is a vital process contributing to metabolic homeostasis. As one of the key nodes in the metabolic network, the forkhead transcription factor FOXO has been shown to interact with diverse transcription co-factors and integrate signals from multiple pathways to control metabolism, oxidative stress response, and cell cycle. Recently, insulin/FOXO signaling has been implicated in the regulation of insect development via the interaction with insect hormones, such as ecdysone and juvenile hormone. In this study, we identified an interaction between dFOXO and the zinc finger transcription factor Kruppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1), one of the key players in juvenile hormone signaling in Drosophila. We found that Kr-h1 mutants have reduced triglyceride storage, decreased insulin signaling and delayed larval development. Notably, Kr-h1 physically and genetically interacts with dFOXO in vitro and in vivo to regulate the transcriptional activation of adipose lipase brummer (bmm). The transcriptional co-regulation by Kr-h1 and dFOXO may represent a broad mechanism by which Kruppel-like factors integrate with insulin signaling to maintain metabolic homeostasis and coordinate organism growth.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is becoming an increasingly accessible technique, used widely for both fundamental and disease-oriented research. Library preparation methods benefit from a variety of available kits, polymerases and bisulfite conversion protocols. Although some steps in the procedure, such as PCR amplification, are known to introduce biases, a systematic evaluation of biases in WGBS strategies is missing.\\n\\nResultsWe perform a comparative analysis of several commonly used pre-and post-bisulfite WGBS library preparation protocols for their performance and quality of sequencing outputs. Our results show that bisulfite conversion per se is the main trigger of pronounced sequencing biases, and PCR amplification builds on these underlying artefacts. The majority of standard library preparation methods yield a significantly biased sequence output and overestimate global methylation. Importantly, both absolute and relative methylation levels at specific genomic regions vary substantially between methods, with clear implications for DNA methylation studies.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show that amplification-free library preparation is the least biased approach for WGBS. In protocols with amplification, the choice of BS conversion protocol or polymerase can significantly minimize artefacts. To aid with the quality assessment of existing WGBS datasets, we have integrated a bias diagnostic tool in the Bismark package and offer several approaches for consideration during the preparation and analysis of WGBS datasets.",

    "abstract": "The largest known bacteria, Thiomargarita spp., have yet to be isolated in pure culture, but their large size allows for individual cells to be followed in time course experiments, or to be individually sorted for  omics-based investigations. Here we report a novel application of a tetrazolium-based dye that measures the flux of reductase production from catabolic pathways to investigate the metabolic activity of individual cells of Thiomargarita spp. When coupled to microscopy, staining of the cells with a tetrazolium-formazan dye allows for metabolic responses in Thiomargarita spp. to be to be tracked in the absence of observable cell division. Additionally, the metabolic activity of Thiomargarita spp. cells can be differentiated from the metabolism of other microbes in specimens that contain adherent bacteria. The results of our redox-dye-based assay suggests that Thiomargarita is the most metabolically versatile under anoxic conditions where it appears to express cellular reductase activity in response to the electron donors succinate, acetate, citrate, formate, thiosulfate, H2, and H2S. Under hypoxic conditions, formazan staining results suggest the metabolism of succinate, and likely acetate, citrate, and H2S. Cells incubated under oxic conditions showed the weakest formazan staining response, and then only to H2S, citrate, and perhaps succinate. These results provide experimental validation of recent genomic studies of Ca. Thiomargarita nelsonii that suggest metabolic plasticity and mixotrophic metabolism. The cellular reductase response of bacteria attached to the exteriors of Thiomargarita also supports the possibility of trophic interactions between these largest of known bacteria and attached epibionts.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe metabolic potentials of many microorganisms that cannot be grown in the laboratory are known only from genomic data. Genomes of Thiomargarita spp. suggest that these largest of known bacteria are mixotrophs, combining lithotrophic metabolisms with organic carbon degradation. Our use of a redox-sensitive tetrazolium dye to query the metabolism of these bacteria provides an independent line of evidence that corroborates the apparent metabolic plasticity of Thiomargarita observed in recently produced genomes. Finding new cultivation- independent means of testing genomic results is critical to testing genome-derived hypotheses on the metabolic potentials of uncultivated microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is an urgent need for the early identification of nondemented individuals at the highest risk of progressing to Alzheimers disease (AD) dementia for early therapeutic interventions. Our goal was to evaluate whether a recently validated polygenic hazard score (PHS) can be integrated with known in vivo CSF or PET biomarkers of amyloid or tau pathology to prospectively predict cognitive decline and clinical progression to AD dementia in nondemented older individuals.\\n\\nMethodsWe evaluated 347 cognitive normal (CN) and 599 mild cognitively impaired (MCI) individuals. We first investigated whether PHS can predict CSF or PET amyloid and tau deposition. We evaluated differences in positive and negative predictive values of biomarker status, as a function of PHS risk. Next, we used linear mixed-effects (LME) to examine if PHS and biomarker status in conjunction, best predict longitudinal cognitive and clinical progression. Lastly, we used survival analysis to investigate whether a combination of PHS and biomarker positivity predicts progression to AD dementia better than using PHS or biomarker positivity alone.\\n\\nFindingsIn CN and MCI individuals, we found that amyloid and total tau positivity systematically varies as a function of PHS. For individuals in greater than the 50th percentile PHS, the positive predictive value for amyloid approached 100%. Similarly, for individuals in less than the 25th percentile PHS, the negative predictive value for total tau approached 85%. Beyond APOE, high PHS individuals with amyloid and tau pathology showed the fastest rate of longitudinal cognitive decline and time to AD dementia progression. Among the CN subgroup, we similarly found that PHS was strongly associated with amyloid positivity and the combination of PHS and biomarker status significantly predicted longitudinal clinical progression.\\n\\nInterpretationAmong asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic older individuals, PHS considerably improves the predictive value of CSF or PET amyloid and tau biomarkers. Beyond APOE, PHS may be useful for risk stratification and cohort enrichment for MCI and preclinical AD therapeutic trials.",

    "abstract": "Polyglutamines are known to form aggregates in pathogenic contexts, such as in Huntingtons disease, however little is known about their role in normal biological processes. We found that a polyglutamine domain in the SNF5 subunit of the yeast SWI/SNF complex, histidines within this sequence, and transient intracellular acidification are required for efficient transcriptional regulation during carbon starvation. We hypothesized that a pH-driven oligomerization of the SNF5 polyglutamine region is required for transcriptional reprogramming. In support of this idea, we found that a synthetic spidroin domain from spider silk, which is soluble at pH 7 but oligomerizes at pH ~ 6.3, could partially complement the function of the SNF5 polyglutamine. These results suggest that the SNF5 polyglutamine domain acts as a pH-driven transcriptional regulator.",

In this study, zebrafish embryos/larvae were exposed to TDCPP until 120 hpf, by which time most of the organs of the larvae have completed development. In this study, the effects of TDCPP on HPT axis were examined and the thyroid hormone levels were measured after TDCPP treatment. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were treated with a series concentration of TDCPP (10, 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 g/L) from 1 day post-fertilization (dpf) to 5 dpf. Exposure concentrations of TDCPP were determined based on the survival rates in each group. Total mRNA were isolated, first-strand cDNA were synthesis and qPCR were performed to detect the mRNA expression levels in hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. The mRNA expression levels of genes involved in thyroid hormone homeostasis were increased in the TDCPP-treated larvae. The mRNA levels of genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis were also increased in the embryos treated with TDCPP. Furthermore, exposure to TDCPP led to a dose-dependent effect on zebrafish development, including diminished hatching and survival rates, increased malformation. TDCPP treatment significantly reduced the T4 concentration in the 5 dpf zebrafish larvae, but increased the concentration of T3, suggesting the function of thyroid endocrine were interrupted in the TDCPP-exposed zebrafish. Taken together, these data indicated that TDCPP affected the thyroid hormone levels in the zebrafish larvae and could increased the mRNA expression levels of genes related to HPT axis, which further impaired the endocrine homeostasis and thyroid system.",
