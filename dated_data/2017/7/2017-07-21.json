    "abstract": "Recent studies have uncovered a strong effect of host genetic variation on the composition of host-associated microbiota. Here, we present HOMINID, a computational approach based on Lasso linear regression, that given host genetic variation and microbiome composition data, identifies host SNPs that are correlated with microbial taxa abundances. Using simulated data we show that HOMINID has accuracy in identifying associated SNPs, and performs better compared to existing methods. We also show that HOMINID can accurately identify the microbial taxa that are correlated with associated SNPs. Lastly, by using HOMINID on real data of human genetic variation and microbiome composition, we identified 13 human SNPs in which genetic variation is correlated with microbiome taxonomic composition across body sites. In conclusion, HOMINID is a powerful method to detect host genetic variants linked to microbiome composition, and can facilitate discovery of mechanisms controlling host-microbiome interactions.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationSoftware, code, tutorial, installation and setup details, and synthetic data are available in the project homepage: https://github.com/blekhmanlab/hominid.\\n\\nReal dataset used here is from Blekhman et al.

    "abstract": "An explosion in the number of available genome sequences obtained through metagenomics and single-cell genomics has enabled a new view of the diversity of microbial life, yet we know surprisingly little about how microbes interact with each other or their environment. In fact, the majority of microbial species remain uncultivated, while our perception of their ecological niches is based on reconstruction of their metabolic potential. In this work, we demonstrate how the \\\"seed set framework\\\", which computes the set of compounds that an organism must acquire from its environment (1), enables computational analysis of metabolic reconstructions, while providing new insights into a microbes metabolic capabilities, such as nutrient use and auxotrophies. We apply this framework to members of the ubiquitous freshwater Actinobacterial lineage acI, confirming and extending previous experimental and genomic observations implying that acI bacteria are heterotrophs reliant on peptides and saccharides. We also present the first metatranscriptomic study of the acI lineage, revealing high expression of transport proteins and the light-harvesting protein actinorhodopsin. Putative transport proteins complement predictions of nutrients and essential metabolites while providing additional support to the hypothesis that members of the acI are photoheterotrophs.\\n\\nImportanceThe metabolic activity of uncultivated microorganisms contributes to numerous ecosystem processes, ranging from nutrient cycling in the environment to influencing human health and disease. Advances in sequencing technology have enabled the assembly of genomes for these microorganisms, but our ability to generate reference genomes far outstrips our ability to analyze them. Common approaches to analyzing microbial metabolism require reconstructing the entirety of an organisms metabolic pathways, or performing targeted searches for genes involved in a specific process. This paper presents a third approach, in which draft metabolic reconstructions are used to identify compounds through which an organism may interact with its environment. These compounds can then guide more intensive metabolic reconstruction efforts, and also provide new hypotheses about the specific contributions microbes make to ecosystem-scale metabolic processes.",

    "abstract": "Allelic heterogeneity is a common phenomenon where a gene exhibit different phenotype depending on the nature of its genetic mutations. In the context of genes affecting malaria susceptibility, it allowed us to explore and understand the intricate host-parasite interactions during malaria infections. In this study, we described a gene encoding erythrocytic ankyrin-1 (Ank-1) which exhibits allelic-dependent heterogeneous phenotypes during malaria infections. We conducted an ENU mutagenesis screen on mice and identified two Ank-1 mutations, one resulted in an amino acid substitution (MRI95845), and the other a truncated Ank-1 protein (MRI96570). Both mutations caused hereditary spherocytosis-like phenotypes and confer differing protection against Plasmodium chabaudi infections. Upon further examination, the Ank-1(MRI96570) mutation was found to inhibit intra-erythrocytic parasite maturation, whereas Ank-1(MW95845) caused increased bystander erythrocyte clearance during infection. This is the first description of allelic heterogeneity in ankyrin-1 from the direct comparison between two Ank-1 mutations. Despite the lack of direct evidence from population studies, this data further supported the protective roles of ankyrin-1 mutations in conferring malaria protection. This study also emphasized the importance of such phenomenon to achieve a better understanding of host-parasite interactions, which could be the basis of future studies.",

    "abstract": "Propensities for different amino acids within a protein site change in the course of evolution, so that an amino acid deleterious in a particular species may be acceptable at the same site in a different species. Here, we study the amino acid-changing variants in human mitochondrial genes, and analyze their occurrence in non-human species. We show that substitutions giving rise to the human amino acid variant tend to occur in lineages closely related to human more frequently than in more distantly related lineages, indicating that a human variant is more likely to be deleterious in more distant species. Unexpectedly, amino acids corresponding to pathogenic alleles in humans also more frequently originate at more closely related lineages. Therefore, a pathogenic variant still tends to be more acceptable in human mitochondria than a variant that may only be fit after a substantial perturbation of the protein structure.\\n\\nSignificanceHomologous proteins can carry different amino acids at the same position in different species. These changes can be neutral, or can reflect differences in the pressure of selection on these sites. We hypothesized that amino acids observable in human population appear on average more frequently in close than in distant human relatives. For mitochondrial proteins, we observe this for both frequent and rare human alleles. Unexpectedly, substitutions that would be pathogenic in humans also more frequently appear in species more closely related to humans than in distantly related ones. Therefore, despite their pathogenicity, these variants are on average more acceptable in humans than other amino acids that were observed at this site in distantly related species.",

    "abstract": "Playing a central role in cell signalling, GPCRs have evolved into the largest superfamily of membrane proteins and form the majority of drug targets in humans. How extracellular agonist binding triggers the activation of GPCRs and associated intracellular effector proteins remains, however, poorly understood. High resolution structural studies have recently revealed that inactive class-A GPCRs harbour a conserved binding site for Na+ ions in the centre of their transmembrane domain, accessible from the extracellular space. Here, we show that the opening of a conserved hydrated channel in the activated state receptors allows the Na+ ion to egress from its binding site into the cytosol. Coupled with protonation changes, this ion movement occurs without significant energy barriers, and can be driven by physiological transmembrane ion and voltage gradients. We propose that Na+ ion exchange with the cytosol is a key step in GPCR activation, which locks receptors in long-lived active-state conformations.",

    "abstract": "The ability to parse a complex auditory scene into perceptual objects is facilitated by a hierarchical auditory system. Successive stages in the hierarchy transform an auditory scene of multiple overlapping sources, from peripheral tonotopically-based representations in the auditory nerve, into perceptually distinct auditory-objects based representation in auditory cortex. Here, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from human subjects, both men and women, we investigate how a complex acoustic scene consisting of multiple speech sources is represented in distinct hierarchical stages of auditory cortex. Using systems-theoretic methods of stimulus reconstruction, we show that the primary-like areas in auditory cortex contain dominantly spectro-temporal based representations of the entire auditory scene. Here, both attended and ignored speech streams are represented with almost equal fidelity, and a global representation of the full auditory scene with all its streams is a better candidate neural representation than that of individual streams being represented separately. In contrast, we also show that higher order auditory cortical areas represent the attended stream separately, and with significantly higher fidelity, than unattended streams. Furthermore, the unattended background streams are more faithfully represented as a single unsegregated background object rather than as separated objects. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the progression of the representations and processing of a complex acoustic scene up through the hierarchy of human auditory cortex.\\n\\nSignificance StatementUsing magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from human listeners in a simulated cocktail party environment, we investigate how a complex acoustic scene consisting of multiple speech sources is represented in separate hierarchical stages of auditory cortex.

    "abstract": "Isoprenoid biosynthesis is essential for Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) parasites and contains multiple validated antimalarial drug targets, including a bifunctional farnesyl and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS/GGPPS). We identified MMV019313 as an inhibitor of PfFPPS/GGPPS. Though PfFPPS/GGPPS is also inhibited by a class of bisphosphonate drugs, MMV019313 has significant advantages for antimalarial drug development. MMV019313 has superior physicochemical properties compared to charged bisphosphonates that have poor bioavailability and strong bone affinity. We also show that it is highly selective for PfFPPS/GGPPS and showed no activity against human FPPS or GGPPS. Inhibition of PfFPPS/GGPPS by MMV019313, but not bisphosphonates, was disrupted in an S228T variant, demonstrating that MMV019313 and bisphosphonates have distinct modes-of-inhibition against PfFPPS/GGPPS. Altogether MMV019313 is the first specific, non-bisphosphonate inhibitor of PfFPPS/GGPPS. Our findings uncover a new small molecule binding site in this important antimalarial drug target and provide a promising starting point for development of Plasmodium-specific FPPS/GGPPS inhibitors.",

The LEDs closely match the excitation peaks of bound and free Fura-2 and enables the precise detection of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, which is only limited by the Ca2+ response of Fura-2. Using this illuminator, we have shown that Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (AM) concentrations as low as 250 nM can be used to detect induced Ca2+ events in tsA-201 cells and while utilizing the 150 s switching speeds available, it was possible to image spontaneous Ca2+ transients in hippocampal neurons at a rate of 24.39 Hz that were blunted or absent at typical 0.5 Hz acquisition rates. Overall, the sensitivity and acquisition speeds available using this LED illuminator significantly improves the temporal resolution that can be obtained in comparison to current systems and supports optical imaging of fast Ca2+ events using Fura-2.",

    "abstract": "The genus Stenotrophomonas (Gammaproteobacteria) has a broad environmental distribution. S. maltophilia is its best known species because it is a globally emerging, multidrug-resistant (MDR), opportunistic pathogen. Members of this species are known to display high genetic, ecological and phenotypic diversity, forming the so-called S. maltophilia complex (Smc). Heterogeneous resistance and virulence phenotypes have been reported for environmental Smc isolates of diverse ecological origin. We hypothesized that this heterogeneity could be in part due to the potential lumping of several cryptic species in the Smc. Here we used state-of-the-art phylogenetic and population genetics methods to test this hypothesis based on the multilocus dataset available for the genus at pubmlst.org. It was extended with sequences from complete and draft genome sequences to assemble a comprehensive set of reference sequences. This framework was used to analyze 108 environmental isolates obtained in this study from the sediment and water column of four rivers and streams in Central Mexico, affected by contrasting levels of anthropogenic pollution. The aim of the study was to identify species in this collection, defined as genetically cohesive sequence clusters, and to determine the extent of their genetic, ecological and phenotypic differentiation. The multispecies coalescent, coupled with Bayes factor analysis was used to delimit species borders, together with population genetic structure analyses, recombination and gene flow estimates between sequence clusters.\\n\\nThese analyses consistently revealed that the Smc contains at least 5 significantly differentiated lineages: S. maltophilia and Smc1 to Smc4. Only S. maltophilia was found to be intrinsically MDR, all its members expressing metallo-{beta}-lactamases (MBLs). The other Smc lineages were not MDR and did not express MBLs. We also obtained isolates related to S. acidaminiphila, S. humi and S. terrae. They were significantly more susceptible to antibiotics than S. maltophilia. We demonstrate that the sympatric lineages recovered display significantly differentiated habitat preferences, antibiotic resistance profiles and beta-lactamase expression phenotypes, as shown by diverse multivariate analyses and robust univariate statistical tests. We discuss our data in light of current models of bacterial speciation, which fit these data well, stressing the implications of species delimitation in ecological, evolutionary and clinical research.",

The study of EVEs, coined paleovirology, provides important insights into virus evolution. The Caulimoviridae is the most common group of EVEs in plants, although their presence has often been overlooked in plant genome studies. We have refined methods for the identification of caulimovirid EVEs and interrogated the genomes of a broad diversity of plant taxa, from algae to advanced flowering plants. Evidence is provided that almost every vascular plant (tracheophyte), including the most primitive taxa (clubmosses, ferns and gymnosperms) contains caulimovirid EVEs, many of which represent previously unrecognized evolutionary branches. In angiosperms, EVEs from at least one and as many as five different caulimovirid genera were frequently detected, and florendoviruses were the most widely distributed, followed by petuviruses. From the analysis of the distribution of different caulimovirid genera within different plant species, we propose a working evolutionary scenario in which this family of viruses emerged at latest during Devonian era (approx. 320 million years ago) followed by vertical transmission and by several cross-division host swaps.",

    "abstract": "Cryptic relatedness is inherently a feature of large genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and can give rise to considerable inflation in summary statistics for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with phenotypes. It has proven difficult to disentangle these inflationary effects from true polygenic effects. Here we present results of a model that enables estimation of polygenicity, mean strength of association, and residual inflation in GWAS summary statistics. We show that there is substantial residual inflation in recent large GWAS of height and schizophrenia; correcting for this reduces the number of independent genome-wide significant loci from the reported values of 697 for height and 108 for schizophrenia to 368 and 61, respectively. In contrast, a larger GWAS of educational attainment shows no residual inflation. Additionally, we find that height has a relatively low polygenicity, with approximately 8k SNPs having causal association, more than an order of magnitude less than has been reported. The residual inflation in GWAS summary statistics can be corrected using the standard genomic control procedure with the estimated residual inflation factor.",

The objective of this report was to assess the safety and negative effects of the Brain Power Autism System (BPAS), a novel AR smartglasses-based social communication aid for people with ASD. A sequential series of 18 children and adults aged 4.4 to 21.5 years (mean 12.2 years) with clinically diagnosed ASD of varying severity used the BPAS. Users and caregivers were interviewed about perceived negative effects and design concerns. Most users were able to wear and use the BPAS (n=16/18, 89%), with most of them reporting no negative effects (n=14/16, 87.5%). Two users reported temporary negative effects: eye strain, dizziness, and nasal discomfort. Caregivers observed no negative effects in users (n=16/16, 100%). Most users (77.8%) and caregivers (88.9%) had no design concerns. This report found no major negative effects in using an AR smartglasses-based social communication aid across a wide age and severity range of people with ASD.

    "abstract": "IntroductionAugmented reality smartglasses are an emerging technology that are under investigation as a social communication aid for children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and as a research tool to aid with digital phenotyping. Tolerability of this wearable technology in people with ASD is an important area for research, especially as these individuals may experience sensory, cognitive, and attentional challenges.\\n\\nAimsThe aim of this study was to assess the tolerability and usability of a novel smartglasses system that has been designed as a social communication aid for children and adults with autism (the Brain Power Autism System; BPAS). BPAS runs on Google Glass Explorer Edition and other smartglasses, utilizes both augmented reality and affective artificial intelligence, and helps users learn key social and emotional skills.\\n\\nMethodTwenty-one children and adults with ASD across a spectrum of severity used BPAS for a coaching session. The users tolerability to the smartglasses was determined through caregiver report, and user being able to wear the smartglasses for one-minute (initial tolerability threshold), and for the entire duration of the coaching session (whole session tolerability threshold).\\n\\nResultsNineteen out of 21 users (90.5%) demonstrated tolerability on all three measures. Caregivers reported 21 out of 21 users (100%) as tolerating the experience, while study staff found only 19 out of 21 users managed to demonstrate initial tolerability (90.5%). Of the 19 users who demonstrated initial tolerability, all 19 were able to use the smartglasses for the entire session (whole session tolerability threshold) (n = 19 of 19, 100%). Caregivers reported that 19 out of 21 users (90.5%) successfully used BPAS, and users surpassed their caregivers expectations in 15 of 21 cases (71.4%). Users who could communicate reported BPAS as being comfortable (94.4%).\\n\\nDiscussionThis preliminary report suggests that BPAS is well tolerated and usable to a diverse age- and severity-range of people with ASD. This is encouraging as these devices are being developed as assistive technologies for people with ASD. Further research should focus on improving smartglasses design and exploring their efficacy in helping with social communication in children and adults with ASD.",

    "abstract": "Many climate change models predict increases in mean temperature, and increases in frequency and magnitude of temperature fluctuations. These potential shifts may impact ectotherms in several ways, including how they are affected by disease. Shifts in temperature may especially affect amphibians, a group with populations that have been challenged by several pathogens. Because amphibian hosts invest more in immunity at warmer than cooler temperatures and parasites may acclimate to temperature shifts faster than hosts (creating lags in optimal host immunity), researchers have hypothesized that a temperature shift from cold-to-warm might result in increased amphibian sensitivity to pathogens, whereas a shift from warm-to-cold might result in decreased sensitivity. Support for components of this climate-variability based hypothesis have been provided by prior studies of the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) that causes the disease chytridiomycosis in amphibians. We experimentally tested whether temperature shifts before Bd exposure alter susceptibility to Bd in the larval stage of two amphibian species - western toads (Anaxyrus boreas) and northern red legged frogs (Rana aurora). Both host species harbored elevated Bd infection intensities under constant cold (15{degrees} C) temperature in comparison to constant warm (20{degrees} C) temperature. Additionally, both species experienced an increase in Bd infection abundance when shifted to 20{degrees} C from 15{degrees} C, compared to a constant 20{degrees} C but they experienced a decrease in Bd when shifted to 15{degrees} C from 20{degrees} C, compared to a constant 15{degrees} C. These results are in contrast to prior studies of adult amphibians that found increased susceptibility to Bd infection after a temperature shift in either direction, highlighting the potential for species and stage differences in the temperature-dependence of chytridiomycosis.",

    "abstract": "Most studies on seasonal influenza A/H3N2 virus adaptation have focused on the main antigenic gene, haemagglutinin. However, there is increasing evidence that the genome-wide genetic background of novel antigenic variants can influence these variants emergence probabilities and impact their patterns of dominance in the population. This suggests that non-antigenic genes may be important in shaping the viral evolutionary dynamics. To better understand the role of selection on non-antigenic genes in the adaptive evolution of seasonal influenza viruses, we here develop a simple population genetic model that considers a virus with one antigenic and one non-antigenic gene segment. By simulating this model under different regimes of selection and reassortment, we find that the empirical patterns of lineage turnover for the antigenic and non-antigenic gene segments are best captured when there is both limited viral coinfection and selection operating on both gene segments. In contrast, under a scenario of only neutral evolution in the non-antigenic gene segment, we see persistence of multiple lineages for long periods of time in that segment, which is not compatible with the observed molecular evolutionary patterns. Further, we find that reassortment, occurring in coinfected individuals, can increase the speed of viral adaptive evolution by primarily reducing selective interference and genetic linkage effects mediated by the non-antigenic gene segment. Together, these findings suggest that, for influenza, with 6 internal or non-antigenic gene segments, the evolutionary dynamics of novel antigenic variants are likely to be influenced by the genome-wide genetic background as a result of linked selection among both beneficial and deleterious mutations.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional assays such as yeast two hybrid, split ubiquitin, and Tango that convert transient protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in cells into stable expression of transgenes are powerful tools for PPI discovery, high-throughput screens, and analysis of large cell populations. However, these assays frequently suffer from high background and they lose all information about PPI dynamics. To address these limitations, we developed a light-gated transcriptional assay for PPI detection called PPI-FLARE (PPI-Fast Light- and Activity-Regulated Expression). PPI-FLARE requires both a PPI to deliver TEV protease proximal to its cleavage peptide, and externally-applied blue light to uncage the cleavage peptide, in order to release a membrane-tethered transcription factor (TF) for translocation to the nucleus. We used PPI-FLARE to detect the ligand-induced association of 12 different PPIs in living mammalian cells, with a temporal resolution of 5 minutes and a {+/-}ligand signal ratio up to 37. By systematically shifting the light irradiation window, we could reconstruct PPI time-courses, distinguishing between GPCRs that engage in transient versus sustained interactions with the cytosolic effector arrestin. When combined with FACS, PPI-FLARE enabled >100-fold enrichment of cells experiencing a specific GPCR-arrestin PPI during a short 10-minute light window over cells missing that PPI during the same time window. Due to its high specificity, sensitivity, and generality, PPI-FLARE should be a broadly useful tool for PPI analysis and discovery.",

    "abstract": "Despite being pervasive, the control of programmed grooming is poorly understood. We have addressed this gap in knowledge by developing a high-throughput platform that allows long-term detection of grooming in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Automatic classification of daily behavior shows flies spend 30% of their active time grooming. We show that a large proportion of this behavior is driven by two major internal programs. One of these programs is the circadian clock that modulates rhythms in daily grooming. The second program depends on cycle and clock and regulates the amount of time flies spend grooming. This emerging dual control model of programmed grooming in which one regulator controls the timing and another controls the duration, resembles the well-established two-process regulatory model of fly sleep. Together, our quantitative approach in Drosophila has revealed that grooming is an important internally driven behavior under the control of two regulatory programs.",

Variations in cell-substrate adhesion strengths can be probed through biophysical measurements of cell detachment from substrates upon the application of an external force. Here, we investigate, theoretically and experimentally, the detachment of cells adhered to substrates when these cells are subjected to fluid shear. We present a theoretical framework within which we calculate the fraction of detached cells as a function of shear stress for fast ramps as well as for the decay in the fraction of detached cells at fixed shear stress as a function of time. Using HEK and 3T3 fibroblast cells as experimental model systems, we extract characteristic force scales for cell adhesion as well as characteristic detachment times. We estimate force-scales of ~ 500 pN associated to a single focal contact, and characteristic time-scales of 190 [&le;]{tau} [&le;] 350s representing cell-spread-area dependent mean first passage times to the detached state at intermediate values of the shear stress. Variations in adhesion across cell types are especially prominent when cell detachment is probed by applying a time-varying shear stress.

Employing ex vivo systems analysis of human transcriptome datasets, we observed a significant correlation of ISG15-induced monocyte IL-10 and lymphocyte IFN{gamma} balanced expression. This effect was associated with p38 MAPK and PI3K signalling in healthy volunteers. The specificity and MAPK/PI3K-dependence of ISG15-induced monocyte IL-10 production was confirmed in vitro using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and pharmacological inhibitors. Moreover, this ISG15/IL10 axis was amplified in leprosy but disrupted in human active tuberculosis (TB) patients. Importantly, ISG15 strongly correlated with inflammation and disease severity during active TB. In conclusion, this study identifies a novel anti-inflammatory ISG15/IL-10 myeloid axis that is disrupted in active TB, revealing a potential biomarker for disease severity in this major human disease.",

Second generation cathinones pentedrone and pentylone are distinguished from each other by the 3,4-methylenedioxy structural motif (which distinguishes methamphetamine from 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and each incorporates the -alkyl chain motif contained in the transporter-inhibitor cathinones (3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), -pyrrolidinopentiophenone (-PVP)) but not in the monoamine releasers (mephedrone, methylone). Studies were conducted in male and female Wistar rats to compare locomotor and thermoregulatory effects of pentedrone, pentylone and methylone using an implanted radiotelemetry system. Reinforcing effects were assessed in female Wistar rats trained in the intravenous self-administration (IVSA) procedure and subjected to dose-substitution (0.025-0.3 m/gkg/inf) under a fixed-ratio 1 response contingency. Pentedrone, pentylone and methylone dose-effect curves were contrasted with those for -PVP and -pyrrolidinohexiophenone (-PHP). Dose dependent increases in locomotion were observed after intraperitoneal injection of pentylone (0.5-10.0 mg/kg), pentedrone (0.5-10.0 mg/kg) or mephedrone (0.5-10.0 mg/kg) in male and female rats. The maximum locomotor effect was similar across drugs but lasted longest after pentedrone. Mean body temperature did not vary systematically more than 0.5 {degrees}C after pentedrone or pentylone in either sex. A sustained hyperthermia (0.4-0.8 {degrees}C) was observed for four hours after 10 mg/kg methylone in male rats. More infusions of pentedrone or pentylone were self-administered compared with methylone, but all three were less potent than -PVP or -PHP.

In CHIP-deficient cells, glucose stimulation fails to induce translocation of Glut4 to the plasma membrane. This impairment in Glut4 translocation in CHIP-deficient cells is accompanied by decreased tubulin polymerization associated with decreased phosphorylation of stathmin, a microtubule-associated protein required for polymerization-dependent protein trafficking within the cell. Together, these data describe a novel role for CHIP in regulating microtubule polymerization that assists in glucose transporter translocation, promoting whole-body glucose homeostasis and sensitivity to insulin.",

However, it is unknown if there is a common genetic and molecular basis underlying multiple facets of zinc function. Here we used natural variation in Arabidopsis thaliana to study the role of zinc in regulating growth. We identify allelic variation of the systemic immunity gene AZI1 as a key for determining root growth responses to low zinc conditions. We further demonstrate that this gene is important for modulating root growth depending on the zinc and defence status. Finally, we show that the interaction of the immunity signal azelaic acid and zinc level to regulate root growth is conserved in rice. This work demonstrates that there is a common genetic and molecular basis for multiple zinc dependent processes and that nutrient cues can determine the balance of plant growth and immune responses in plants.",

Recently, we reconstituted the Neurospora crassa xylodextrin transport and consumption system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, enabling growth of yeast on xylodextrins aerobically. However, the consumption rate of xylodextrin requires improvement for industrial applications, including consumption in anaerobic conditions. As a first step in this improvement, we report analysis of orthologues of the N. crassa transporters CDT-1 and CDT-2. Transporter ST16 from Trichoderma virens enables faster aerobic growth of S. cerevisiae on xylodextrins compared to CDT-2. ST16 is a xylodextrin-specific transporter, and the xylobiose transport activity of ST16 is not inhibited by cellobiose. Other transporters identified in the screen also enable growth on xylodextrins including xylotriose. Taken together, these results indicate that multiple transporters might prove useful to improve xylodextrin utilization in S. cerevisiae. Efforts to use directed evolution to improve ST16 from a chromosomally-integrated copy were not successful, due to background growth of yeast on other carbon sources present in the selection medium. Future experiments will require increasing the baseline growth rate of the yeast population on xylodextrins, to ensure that the selective pressure exerted on xylodextrin transport can lead to isolation of improved xylodextrin transporters.",

    "abstract": "Motor imagery-based brain computer interfacing (MI-BCI) as a neuro-rehabilitation tool aims at facilitating motor improvement using mental practice. However, the effectiveness of MI-BCI in producing clinically meaningful functional outcome is debated. Aside from computational shortcomings, a main limiting obstacle seems to be the substantial representational dissimilarity between movement imagination (MI) and movement execution (ME) on the level of engaged neural networks. This dissimilarity renders inducing functionally effective and long lasting changes in motor behavior through MI challenging. Moreover, the quality and intensity of imagination is highly prone to change on a trial-to-trial basis, based on the subject's state of mind and mental fatigue. This leads to an inconsistent profile of neural activity throughout training, limiting learning in a Hebbian sense. To address these issues, we propose a neuroconnectivity-based paradigm, as a systematic priming technique to be utilized pre-BCI training. In the proposed paradigm, ME-idle representational dissimilarity network (RDN) features are used to detect MI in real-time. This means that to drive the virtual environment, an ME-like activation pattern has to be learned and generated in the brain through MI. This contrasts with conventional BCIs which consider a successful MI, one that results in higher than a threshold change in the power of sensorimotor rhythms. Our results show that four out of five participants achieved a consistent session-to-session enhancement in their net MI-ME network-level similarity (mean change rate of 6.16% {+/-} 4.64 per session). We suggest that the proposed paradigm, if utilized as a priming technique pre-BCI training, can potentially enhance the neural and functional effectiveness. This can be achieved through 1- shifting MI towards engaging ME-related networks to a higher extent, and 2- inducing consistency in MI quality by using the ME-related networks as the ground-truth and thus enhancing the robustness of the activity pattern in the brain. This would in turn lend to the clinical acceptability of BCI as a neurorehabilitation tool.",

    "abstract": "1.Electrophysiological recordings of neuronal tissue face particular challenges when attempted during electrical stimulation, both in vivo and in vitro. Electrical stimulation may produce undesired electronic artifacts and thus render the recorded signal only partially useful. A commonly used remedy for these artifacts is to temporarily ground the input during the stimulation pulses. In the following study, we quantify the effects of this method on the spike train count, which is called \\\"blanking\\\". Starting a from theoretical standpoint, we deduce a loss of countable action potentials, depending on: width of the blanking window, Frequency of stimulation and neuronal activity. Calculations are corroborated by actual high SNR single cell recordings. We have to state, for therapeutically relevant frequencies of 130 Hz and realistic blanking windows of 2 ms, up to 27% of actual existing spikes are lost. We strongly advice careful and controlled use of blanking circuits when spike rate quantification is attempted.",

    "abstract": "Animacy is a robust organizing principle amongst object category representations in the human brain. Using multivariate pattern analysis methods (MVPA), it has been shown that distance to the decision boundary of a classifier trained to discriminate neural activation patterns for animate and inanimate objects correlates with observer reaction times for the same animacy categorization task (Carlson, Ritchie, Kriegeskorte, Durvasula, & Ma, 2014; Ritchie, Tovar, & Carlson, 2015). Using MEG decoding, we tested if the same relationship holds when a stimulus manipulation (degradation) increases task difficulty, which we predicted would systematically decrease the distance of activation patterns from the decision boundary, and increase reaction times. In addition, we tested whether distance to the classifier boundary correlates with drift rates in the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (Brown & Heathcote, 2008). We found that distance to the classifier boundary correlated with reaction time, accuracy, and drift rates in an animacy categorization task. Split by animacy, the correlations between brain and behavior were sustained for longer over the time course for animate than for inanimate stimuli. Interestingly, when examining the distance to the classifier boundary during the peak correlation between brain and behavior, we found that only degraded versions of animate, but not inanimate, objects had systematically shifted towards the classifier decision boundary as predicted. Our results support an asymmetry in the representation of animate and inanimate object categories in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "The biogeochemical cycle of sulfur on Earth is driven by microbial sulfate reduction, yet organisms from relatively few lineages have been implicated in this process. Recent studies using functional marker genes have detected abundant, novel dissimilatory sulfite reductases that confer the capacity for microbial sulfate reduction and could do not be affiliated with known organisms. Thus, the identity of a significant fraction of sulfate reducing microbes has remained elusive. Here we report the discovery of the capacity for sulfate reduction in the genomes of organisms from twelve bacterial and archaeal phyla, thereby doubling the number of microbial phyla associated with this process. Eight of the twelve newly identified groups are candidate phyla that lack isolated representatives, a finding only possible given genomes from metagenomes. Two candidate phyla, Candidatus Rokubacteria and Candidatus Hydrothermarchaeota contain the earliest evolved genes. The capacity for sulfate reduction has been laterally transferred in multiple events within some phyla, and a key gene potentially capable of switching sulfur oxidation to sulfate reduction in associated cells has been acquired by putatively symbiotic bacteria. We conclude that functional predictions based on phylogeny will significantly underestimate the extent of sulfate reduction across Earths ecosystems. Understanding the prevalence of this capacity is integral to interpreting the carbon cycle because sulfate reduction is often coupled to turnover of buried organic carbon. Our findings expand the diversity of microbial groups associated with sulfur transformations in the environment and motivate revision of biogeochemical process models based on microbial community composition.",

However, researchers lack a simple way to measure covert representations of spatial attention in the brain and their link to overt eye movement behavior, especially in response to natural scenes. Here, we predict eye movement patterns from spatial priority maps reconstructed from brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). First, we define a computational spatial attention model using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained for scene categorization. Next, we decode CNN unit activity from fMRI activity and reconstruct spatial priority maps by applying our computational spatial attention model to decoded CNN activity. Finally, we predict eye movements in a subsequent behavioral experiment within and between individuals using reconstructed spatial priority maps. These results demonstrate that features represented in CNN unit activity can guide spatial attention and eye movements, providing a crucial link between CNN models, brain activity, and behavior.",

Previous rsfMRI studies mainly focused on spatial characteristics of RSFC, but the temporal relationship between RSFC patterns is still elusive. Particularly, it remains unknown whether separate RSFC patterns temporally fluctuate in a random manner, or transit in specific orders. Here we investigated temporal transitions between characteristic RSFC patterns in awake rats and humans. We found that transitions between RSFC patterns were reproducible and significantly above chance, suggesting that RSFC pattern transitions were nonrandom. The organization of RSFC pattern transitions in rats was analyzed using graph theory. Pivotal RSFC patterns in transitions were identified including hippocampal, thalamic and striatal networks. This study has revealed nonrandom temporal relationship between characteristic RSFC patterns in both rats and humans. It offers new insights into understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of spontaneous activity in the mammalian brain.",

    "abstract": "The musculoskeletal configuration of the mammalian pectoral limb has been heralded as a key anatomical feature leading to the adaptive radiation of mammals, but limb function in the cynodont outgroup remains unresolved. Conflicting reconstructions of abducted and adducted posture are based on mutually-incompatible interpretations of ambiguous osteology. We reconstruct the pectoral limb of the Triassic non-mammalian cynodont Massetognathus pascuali in three dimensions, by combining skeletal morphology from micro-computed tomography with muscle anatomy from an extended extant phylogenetic bracket. Conservative tests of maximum range of motion suggest a degree of girdle mobility, as well as substantial freedom at the shoulder and the elbow joints. The glenoid fossa supports a neutral pose in which the distal end of the humerus points 45{degrees} posterolaterally from the body wall, intermediate between classically \\\"sprawling\\\" and \\\"parasagittal\\\" limb postures. Massetognathus is reconstructed as having a near-mammalian complement of shoulder muscles, including an incipient rotator cuff (m. subscapularis, m. infraspinatus, m. supraspinatus, and m. teres minor). Based on close inspection of the morphology of the glenoid fossa, we hypothesize a posture-driven scenario for the evolution of the therian ball-and-socket shoulder joint. The musculoskeletal reconstruction presented here provides the anatomical scaffolding for more detailed examination of locomotor evolution in the precursors to mammals.",

    "abstract": "The Frank-Starling Law of the heart is a filling-force mechanism, a positive relationship between the distension of a ventricular chamber and its force of ejection. The functioning of the cardiovascular system is usually described by means of two intersecting curves: the cardiac and vascular functions, the former related to the contractility of the heart and the latter related to the after-load imposed to the ventricle. The crossing of these functions is the so-called operation point, and the filling-force mechanism is supposed to play a stabilizing role for the short-term variations in the working of the system. In the present study, we analyze whether the filling-force mechanism is responsible for such a stability within two different settings: one-ventricle, as in fishes, and two-ventricle hearts, as in birds and mammals. Each setting was analyzed under two scenarios: presence of the filling-force mechanism and its absence. To approach the query, we linearized the region around an arbitrary operation point and put forward a dynamical system of differential equations to describe the relationship among volumes of ventricular chambers and volumes of vascular beds in face of blood flows governed by pressure differences between adjacent compartments. Our results show that the filling-force mechanism is not necessary to give stability to an operation point. The results indicate that the role of the filling-force mechanism is related to decrease the controlling effort over the circulatory system, to smooth out perturbations and to guarantee faster transitions among operation points.\\n\\nSummary StatementWe address the role of the Frank-Starling mechanism and show that it has no role in the stability of the circulatory system. Rather, it accounts for decreasing the controlling effort and speeding up changes in cardiac output.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed all published reports of individuals not exposed to syntactic language until puberty: two feral children, who grew up without hearing any language, and eight deaf linguistic isolates, who grew up communicating to their families using homesign or kitchensign, a system of gestures which allows them to communicate simple commands but lacks much in the way of syntax. A common observation in these individuals is the lifelong difficulty understanding syntax and spatial prepositions, even after many years of rehabilitation. This debilitating condition stands in stark contrast to linguistic isolates performance on memory as well as semantic tests: they could easily remember hundreds of newly learned words and identify previously seen objects by name. The lack of syntactic language comprehension in linguistic isolates may stem from inability to understand words and/or grammar or inability to mentally synthesize known objects into novel configurations. We have previously shown that purposeful construction of novel mental images is the function of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) ability to dynamically control posterior cortex neurons 1. Here we have ranked all tests performed on linguistic isolates by their reliance on the LPFC control of the posterior cortex: a) the amount of posterior cortex territory that needs to be recruited by the LPFC and b) the number of disparate objects that have to be combined together by the LPFC in order to answer the test question. According to our analysis, linguistic isolates performed well in all tests that did not involve the LPFC control of the posterior cortex, showed decreasing scores in tests that involved greater recruitment of the posterior cortex by the LPFC, and failed in tests that involved greatest recruitment of posterior cortex necessary for mental synthesis of multiple objects. This pattern is consistent with inadequate frontoposterior connections in linguistic isolates. We discuss implications of these findings for the importance of early syntactic language exposure in formation of frontoposterior connections.",

    "abstract": "X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is established in two waves during mouse development. First, silencing of the paternal X chromosome (Xp) is triggered, with transcriptional repression of most genes and enrichment of epigenetic marks such as H3K27me3 being achieved in all cells by the early blastocyst stage. XCI is then reversed in the inner cell mass (ICM), followed by a second wave of maternal or paternal XCI, in the embryo-proper. Although the role of Xist RNA in triggering XCI is now clear, the mechanisms underlying Xp reactivation in the inner cell mass have remained enigmatic. Here we use in vivo single cell approaches (allele-specific RNAseq, nascent RNA FISH and immunofluorescence) and find that different genes show very different timing of reactivation. We observe that the genes reactivate at different stages and that initial enrichment in H3K27me3 anti-correlates with the speed of reactivation. To define whether this repressive histone mark is lost actively or passively, we investigate embryos mutant for the X-encoded H3K27me3 demethylase, UTX. Xp genes that normally reactivate slowly are retarded in their reactivation in Utx mutants, while those that reactive rapidly are unaffected. Therefore, efficient reprogramming of some X-linked genes in the inner cell mass is very rapid, indicating minimal epigenetic memory and potentially driven by transcription factors, whereas others may require active erasure of chromatin marks such as H3K27me3.",

Although modern solar panels are purposed in producing clean energy, the materials and byproducts of solar cell manufacturing are not eco-friendly. Thus, considering an organic, renewable and energy efficient solar cell model is necessary. Investigations explored multiple highly-photosynthetic algal species which were later integrated into a controlled microbial fuel cell system (MFC). The MFC1 contained algae culture species, including Chlorella Vulgaris, Nannochloropsis, and Spirulina. Parameters, such as periodic lipid yields, algal biomass, and light absorption were assessed throughout the cultivation process while maintaining a controlled environment. After 30 days of cultivation, the culture was transferred to an anode chamber in a closed loop small-scale MFC. Following the first day of algae transfer, microwatt output was analyzed from independent test trials. Statistical comparisons were drawn between electrical energy and light absorption, finding a generally positive correlation. Thus, it is concluded that mid-high algae concentrations significantly increased electrical micro-wattage in highly absorptive algal cultures. The optimal electric levels occurred at 286 A (absorbance) and 35 mW-Nannochloropsis, 123 A-Chlorella (30.2 mW), and 142 A (31 mW)-Spirulina culture. Due to higher absorption rates in the Nannochloropsis culture, this corresponds with the record high voltage levels. The analysis of data indicates that Algae-based MFCs are proven hopeful for alternative high-yield energy production.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi)-related pathways target viruses and transposable element (TE) transcripts in plants, fungi, and ecdysozoans (nematodes and arthropods), giving protection against infection and transmission. In each case, this produces abundant TE and virus-derived 20-30nt small RNAs, which provide a characteristic signature of RNAi-mediated defence. The broad phylogenetic distribution of the Argonaute and Dicer-family genes that mediate these pathways suggests that defensive RNAi is ancient and probably shared by most animal (metazoan) phyla. Indeed, while vertebrates had been thought an exception, it has recently been argued that mammals also possess an antiviral RNAi pathway, although its immunological relevance is currently uncertain and the viral small RNAs are not detectably under natural conditions. Here we use a metagenomic approach to test for the presence of virus-derived small RNAs in five divergent animal phyla (Porifera, Cnidaria, Echinodermata, Mollusca, and Annelida), and in a brown alga--which represents an independent origin of multicellularity from plants, fungi, and animals. We use metagenomic RNA sequencing to identify around 80 virus-like contigs in these lineages, and small RNA sequencing to identify small RNAs derived from those viruses. Contrary to our expectations, we were unable to identify canonical (i.e. Drosophila-, nematode- or plant-like) viral small RNAs in any of these organisms, despite the widespread presence of abundant micro-RNAs, and transposon-derived somatic Piwi-interacting piRNAs in the animals. Instead, we identified a distinctive group of virus-derived small RNAs in the mollusc, which have a piRNA-like length distribution but lack key signatures of piRNA biogenesis, and a group of 21U virus-derived small RNAs in the brown alga. We also identified primary piRNAs derived from putatively endogenous copies of DNA viruses in the cnidarian and the echinoderm, and an endogenous RNA virus in the mollusc. The absence of canonical virus-derived small RNAs from our samples may suggest that the majority of animal phyla lack an antiviral RNAi response. Alternatively, these phyla could possess an antiviral RNAi response resembling that reported for vertebrates, which is not detectable through simple metagenomic sequencing of wild-type individuals. In either case, our findings suggest that the current antiviral RNAi responses of arthropods and nematodes are highly diverged from the ancestral metazoan state, and that antiviral RNAi may even have evolved independently on multiple occasions.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe presence of abundant virus-derived small RNAs in infected plants, fungi, nematodes, and arthropods suggests that Dicer-dependent antiviral RNAi is an ancient and conserved defence. Using metagenomic sequencing from wild-caught organisms we show that antiviral RNAi is highly variable across animals. We identify a distinctive group of virus-derived small RNAs in a mollusc, which have a piRNA-like length distribution but lack key signatures of piRNA biogenesis. We also report a group of 21U virus-derived small RNAs in a brown alga, which represents an origin of multicellularity separate from that of plants, fungi, and animals. The absence of virus-derived small RNAs from our samples may suggest that the majority of animal phyla lack an antiviral RNAi response or that these phyla could possess an antiviral RNAi response resembling that reported for vertebrates, which is not detectable through simple metagenomic sequencing of wild-type individuals. In addition, we report abundant somatic piRNAs across anciently divergent animals suggesting that this is the ancestral state in Bilateria. Our study challenges the widely-held assumption that most invertebrates possess an antiviral RNAi pathway likely similar to that seen in Drosophila, other arthropods, and nematodes.",

    "abstract": "Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) form both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric ion channels that are activated by extracellular protons and are involved in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including pain and anxiety. ASIC proteins can form both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric ion channels. The ASIC3 subunit has been shown to be of particular importance in the peripheral nervous system with pharmacological and genetic manipulations demonstrating a role in pain. Naked mole-rats, despite having functional ASICs, are insensitive to acid as a noxious stimulus and show diminished avoidance of acidic fumes, ammonia and carbon dioxide. Here we cloned naked mole-rat ASIC3 (nmrASIC3) and used a cell surface biotinylation assay to demonstrate that it traffics to the plasma membrane, but using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology we observed that nmrASIC3 is insensitive to both protons and the non-proton ASIC3 agonist 2-Guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ). However, in line with previous reports of ASIC3 mRNA expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, we found that the ASIC3 antagonist APETx2 reversibly inhibits ASIC-like currents in naked mole-rat DRG neurons. We further show that like the proton-insensitive ASIC2b and ASIC4, nmrASIC3 forms functional, proton sensitive heteromers with other ASIC subunits. An amino acid alignment of ASIC3s between 9 relevant rodent species and human identified unique sequence differences that might underlie the proton insensitivity of nmrASIC3. However, introducing nmrASIC3 differences into rat ASIC3 (rASIC3) produced only minor differences in channel function, and replacing nmrASIC3 sequence with that of rASIC3 did not produce a proton-sensitive ion channel. Our observation that nmrASIC3 forms nonfunctional homomers may reflect a further adaptation of the naked mole-rat to living in an environment with high-carbon dioxide levels.",

    "abstract": "The majority of bacterial genomes have high coding efficiencies, but there are some genomes of intracellular bacteria that have low gene density. The genome of the endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius contains almost 50% pseudogenes containing mutations that putatively silence them at the genomic level. We have applied multiple omic strategies, combining: Illumina and Pacific Biosciences Single-Molecule Real Time DNA-sequencing and annotation; stranded RNA-sequencing; and proteome analysis to better understand the transcriptional and translational landscape of Sodalis pseudogenes, and potential mechanisms for their control. Between 53% and 74% of the Sodalis transcriptome remains active in cell-free culture. Mean sense transcription from Coding Domain Sequences (CDS) is four-times greater than that from pseudogenes. Comparative genomic analysis of six Illumina-sequenced Sodalis isolates from different host Glossina species shows pseudogenes make up ~40% of the 2,729 genes in the core genome, suggesting that they are stable and/or Sodalis is a recent introduction across the Glossina genus as a facultative symbiont. These data further shed light on the importance of transcriptional and translational control in deciphering host-microbe interactions, and demonstrate that pseudogenes are more complex than a simple degrading DNA sequence. The combination of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics give a multidimensional perspective for studying prokaryotic genomes with a view to elucidating evolutionary adaptation to novel environmental niches.\\n\\nImportanceBacterial genomes are generally 1Kb in length, organized efficiently (i.e. with few gaps between genes or operons), and few open reading frames (ORFs) lack any predicted function. Intracellular bacteria have been removed from extracellular selection pressures acting on pathways of declining importance to fitness and thus, these bacteria tend to delete redundant genes in favour of smaller functional repertoires - maintaining genome efficiency. In the genomes of endosymbionts with a recent evolutionary relationship with their host, however, this process of genome reduction is not complete; Genes and pathways may be at an intermediate stage, undergoing mutation linked to reduced selection and small population numbers being vertically transmitted from mother to offspring in their hosts, resulting in an increase in abundance of pseudogenes and reduced coding capacities. A greater knowledge of the genomic architecture of persistent pseudogenes, with respect to their DNA structure, mRNA transcription and even putative translation to protein products, will lead to a better understanding of the evolutionary trajectory of endosymbiont genomes, many of which have important roles in arthropod ecology.",

    "abstract": "Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been implicated in navigation, in the control of body movement, and in visually-guided decisions. Seeking to relate these views, we measured activity in populations of PPC neurons while mice performed a virtual navigation task driven by visual decisions. We found that PPC neurons are selective for specific combinations of the animals spatial position and heading angle. This selectivity closely predicted both the activity of individual PPC neurons, and the arrangement of their collective firing patterns in choice-selective sequences. These sequences reflected the influence on PPC of the animals navigation trajectory. An alternative model in which PPC activity encoded position and decision performed more poorly, and a model with all three variables barely outperformed the simple position-heading model. Alternative models based on visual or motor variables were inferior. We conclude that when mice use vision to choose their trajectories, a large fraction of parietal cortex activity can be predicted from simple attributes such as spatial position and heading.",

Combining measurements of the bead displacement with the analysis of induced deformation fields in a continuum mechanics framework, we can quantify tissue material properties and follow their change over time. In particular, we uncover a rapid change in tissue response occurring during Drosophila cellularization, resulting from a softening of the blastoderm and an increase of external friction. Pharmacological treatments reveal that in addition to actomyosin, the microtubule cytoskeleton is a major contributor to epithelial mechanics at that stage. Overall, our method allows for measuring essential mechanical parameters governing tissue-scale deformations and flows occurring during morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "One known attribute of the photosynthetic apparatus is photon capture and generation of metabolic energy. The thermodynamic implications of fluorescence, invariably associated with the photosynthetic components is however poorly understood. In this paper we report a density dependent amplification of such fluorescence which can be interpreted as a thermodynamic strategy of controlled energy release by the cell. We show in support of this hypothesis that prolonged photo-exitation of cell free extract of Rhodobacter capsulatus SB1003 at 395 nm, induces fluorescence emission amplifying with time as long as the fluorophore density is above a critical level. The fact that the amplification disappears at low temperature and at dilute condition, is in accordance with the thermodynamic interpretation that energy is released as per requirement. Live cell imaging is also validation of the phenomenon even at the cellular level. Single cells of Rhodobacter capsulatus SB1003 shows time dependent loss of fluorescence, the process being reversed for cellular clusters. To explain the mechanism of this bistable fluorescence (F) amplification, variation of the scale free kinetic constant k=1/F (dF/dt) is studied at varying temperatures in presence and absence of static magnetic field. The sign of k shifts from positive to negative if T is lowered or if the system is diluted. But at low T, k again switches from negative to positive value, if static magnetic field is applied. The chain of events can be explained by a simple model assuming excretion of a porphyrin by the microbe and possible photon dependent aggregation behavior of such porphyrin complex, differential temperature and magnetic field sensitivity of the monomeric or aggregated forms of porphyrin being reported earlier.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive incurable brain cancer. The cells that fuel the growth of tumours resemble neural stem cells found in the developing and adult mammalian forebrain. These are referred to as GBM stem cells (GSCs). Similar to neural stem cells, GSCs exhibit a variety of phenotypic states: dormant, quiescent, proliferative and differentiating. How environmental cues within the brain influence these distinct states is not well understood. Laboratory models of GBM tumours can be generated using either genetically engineered mouse models, or via intracranial transplantation of cultured tumour initiating cells (mouse or human). Unfortunately, these approaches are expensive, time-consuming, low-throughput and ill-suited for monitoring of live cell behaviours. Here we explored whole adult brain coronal organotypic slices as a complementary strategy to remove the experimental bottleneck. Mouse adult brain slices remain viable in a neural stem cell serum-free basal media for several weeks. GSCs can therefore be easily microinjected into specific anatomical sites ex vivo. We demonstrated distinct responses of engrafted GSCs to different microenvironments in the brain. Within the subependymal zone - one of the adult neural stem cell niches - a subset of injected tumour cells could effectively engraft and respond to endothelial niche signals. GSCs transplanted slices were treated with the anti-mitotic drug temozolomide as proof-of-principle of the utility in modelling responses to existing treatments. Thus, engraftment of mouse or human GSCs onto whole brain coronal organotypic brain slices provides a convenient experimental model for studies of GSC-host interactions and preclinical testing of candidate therapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin remodeling complexes instruct cellular differentiation and lineage specific transcription. The BRG1/BRM associated factor (BAF) complexes are important for several aspects of differentiation. We show that the catalytic subunit Brg1 has a specific role in cardiac precursors (CPs) to initiate cardiac gene expression programs and repress non-cardiac expression. Using immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry (IP-MS), we determined the dynamic composition of BAF complexes during mammalian cardiac differentiation, and identified BAF60c (SMARCD3) and BAF170 (SMARCC2) as subunits enriched in CPs and cardiomyocytes (CM). Baf60c and Baf170 co-regulate gene expression with Brg1 in CPs, but in CMs control different gene expression programs, although still promoting a cardiac-specific gene set. BRG1, BAF60, and BAF170 all modulate chromatin accessibility, to either promote accessibility at activated genes, while closing up chromatin at repressed genes. BAF60c and BAF170 are required for proper BAF complex composition and stoichiometry, and promote BRG1 occupancy in CM. Additionally, BAF170 facilitates expulsion of BRG1-containing complexes in the transition from CP to CM. Thus, dynamic interdependent BAF complex subunit assembly modulates chromatin states and thereby directs temporal gene expression programs in cardiogenesis.\\n\\nSignificance statementBRG1/BRM associated factors (BAF) form multi-subunit protein complexes that reorganize chromatin and regulate transcription. Specific BAF complex subunits have important roles during cell differentiation and development. We systematically identify BAF subunit composition and find temporal enrichment of subunits during cardiomyocyte differentiation. We find the catalytic subunit BRG1 has important contributions in initiating gene expression programs in cardiac progenitors along with cardiac-enriched subunits BAF60c and BAF170. Both these proteins regulated BAF subunit composition and chromatin accessibility and prevent expression of non-cardiac developmental genes during precursor to cardiomyocyte differentiation. Mechanistically, we find BAF170 destabilizes the BRG1 complex and expels BRG1 from cardiomyocyte-specific genes. Thus, our data shows synergies between diverse BAF subunits in facilitating temporal gene expression programs during cardiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Due to the low yield of tanshinones and their analogues in Salvia miltiorrhiza, there are all kinds of stimulation strategies having been applied to improve tanshinones output in plant tissue cultures. Endophytic fungi have formed various different relationships with their host plants withstanding host and environmental factors, including symbiotic, mutualistic, commensalistic, and parasitic. Thus we take the assumption that endophytic fungi may be an emerging microbial tool used to promote secondary metabolism, which will promote the production of active compounds through endophyte-based biology method. Our study therefore aimed to examine the effects of live endophytic fungus Chaetomium globosum D38 and its elicitors on the accumulation of tanshinones in hairy root cultures of Salvia miltiorrhiza. C. globosum D38 mainly colonized in the intercellular gap of xylem parenchyma cells of S. miltiorrhiza hairy root, during long term co-existence without any toxicity against S. miltiorrhiza hairy root. Moreover, both of the live fungus and its mycelia extracts could induce the production of tanshinones, in special dihydrotanshinone I and cryptotanshinone. The effects of mycelia extracts were much stronger than that of the live fungus on tanshinones synthesis, which increased the transcriptional activity of genes with repect to tanshinone biosynthetic pathway obviously. Our results indicated that both of the live C. globosum D38 and its mycelia extracts could be utilized for tanshinones accumulation in S. miltiorrhiza hairy root. Whats more, D38 also could be made into biotic fertilizer applying into S.miltiorrhiza seddlings, which not only promoted host growth but the tanshinones and phenylpropionic acid accumulation. In the soil environment, D38 had formed bitrophic and mutual beneficial relationship with the host and enhanced the primary metabolism on the whole so as to have facilitative effects on phenylpropionic acid accumulation. To sum up, Chaetomium globosum D38 was a highly effective endophytic fungus for S. miltiorrhiza.",

    "abstract": "Animal and plant communities in tropical rainforests are known to have high alpha diversity within forests, but low beta diversity between forests. By contrast, it is unknown if the microbial protists inhabiting the same ecosystems exhibit similar biogeographic patterns. To evaluate the biogeographies of soil protists in three lowland Neotropical rainforests using metabarcoding data, we estimated taxa-area and distance-decay relationships for three large protist taxa and their subtaxa, at both the OTU and phylogenetic levels, with presence-absence and abundance based measures, and compared the estimates to null models. High local alpha and low regional beta diversity patterns were persistently found for both the parasitic Apicomplexa and the free-living Cercozoa and Ciliophora, even though they have different ecological functions and different dispersal modes. In comparison to the null models, both OTU and phylogenetic diversities showed spatial structures between forests, but only phylogenetic diversity showed spatial patterns within forests. These results suggest that the biogeographies of macro-and micro-organismal eukaryotes in lowland Neotropical rainforests are partially structured by the same general processes. As with arthropods, the protists high alpha diversity within forests presents problems for estimating their local diversity, and shows that regional diversity cannot be easily estimated because of low turnover between forests.",

    "abstract": "A recent surge of studies suggested that many novel genes arise de novo from previously non-coding DNA and not by duplication. However, since most studies concentrated on longer evolutionary time scales and rarely considered protein structural properties, it remains unclear how these properties are shaped by evolution, depend on genetic mechanisms and influence gene survival. Here we compare open reading frames (ORFs) from high coverage transcriptomes from mouse and another four mammals covering 160 million years of evolution. We find that novel ORFs pervasively emerge from intergenic and intronic regions but are rapidly lost again while relatively fewer arise from duplications but are retained over much longer times. Surprisingly, disorder and other protein properties of young ORFs do not change with gene age. Only length and nucleotide composition change, probably to avoid aggregation. Thus de novo genes resemble frozen accidents of randomly emerged ORFs which survived initial purging, likely because they are functional.",

    "abstract": "Populations respond to novel environmental challenges either through genetic changes, through adaptive phenotypic plasticity for the traits in question, or by a combination of these factors. Here, we investigated the evolutionary potential of phenotypic plasticity for male mating success, locomotory ability, and heating rate (a physiological performance trait) in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, using isogenic male lines from the Drosophila Reference Genome Panel (DGRP) and hemi-clonal males. We quantified thermal reaction norms of how male mating success changed in relation to a temperate gradient, ranging from cold (18 {degrees}C) via optimal (24 {degrees}C) to hot and stressful environments (either 30 {degrees}C or 36 {degrees}C). We found significant differences in male mating success and locomotory performance between different lines, as well as significant main effects of temperature, but no significant genotype-by-environment interactions (GEI:s). A statistical power analysis revealed that the variance explained by GEI:s for thermal plasticity using this sample size is likely to be modest or very small, and represent only 4% of the total variation in male mating success. The lack of strong GEI:s for these two behavioral traits contrast with the presence of significant GEI:s for male heating rate, as measured by thermal imaging (infrared camera technology). These results suggest that sexual selection through male mating success is not likely to be efficient in mediating evolutionary rescue through changed plasticity in response to changing temperatures.",

Because ESD can directly affect reproduction success, it could influence diversification rate as compared with lineages that have alternative mating systems. Here we test this hypothesis using a solid phylogenetic framework of Neotropical Catasetinae, the angiosperm lineage richest in taxa with ESD. We assess whether gains of ESD are associated with higher diversification rates compared to lineages with alternative systems while considering additional traits known to positively affect diversification rates in orchids. We found that ESD has evolved asynchronously three times during the last ~5 Myr. Lineages with ESD have consistently higher diversification rates than related lineages with other sexual systems. Habitat fragmentation due to mega-wetlands extinction, and climate instability are suggested as the driving forces for ESD evolution.",

    "abstract": "Amongst the echinoderms the class Ophiuroidea is of particular interest for its phylogenetic position, ecological importance, developmental and regenerative biology. However, compared to other echinoderms, notably echinoids (sea urchins), relatively little is known about developmental changes in gene expression in ophiuroids. To address this issue we have generated and assembled a large RNAseq data set of four key stages of development in the brittle star Amphiura filiformis and a de novo reference transcriptome of comparable quality to that of a model echinoderm - the sea urchin Strongyloncentrotus purpuratus. Furthermore, we provide access to the new data via a web interface: http://www.echinonet.eu/shiny/Amphiura_filiformis/. With a focus on skeleton development, we have identified highly conserved genes associated with the development of a biomineralized skeleton. We also identify important class-specific characters, including the independent duplication of the msp130 class of genes in different echinoderm classes and the unique occurrence of spicule matrix (sm) genes in echinoids. Using a new quantification pipeline for our de novo transcriptome, validated with other methodologies, we find major differences between brittle stars and sea urchins in the temporal expression of many transcription factor genes. This divergence in developmental regulatory states is more evident in early stages of development when cell specification begins, than when cells initiate differentiation. Our findings indicate that there has been a high degree of gene regulatory network rewiring in the evolution of echinoderm larval development.\\n\\nData DepositionsAll sequence reads are available at Genbank SRR4436669 - SRR4436674.

    "abstract": "The UAS/GAL4 system is the most used method In Drosophila melanogaster for directing the expression of a gene of interest to a specific tissue. However, the ability to control the temporal activity of GAL4 with this system is very limited. This study constructed and characterized Tet-off GAL80 transgenes designed to allow temporal control of GAL4 activity in aging adults. By placing GAL80 under the control of a Tet-off promoter, GAL4 activity is regulated by the presence or absence of tetracycline in the diet. Almost complete inhibition of the expression of UAS transgenes during the pre-adult stages of the life cycle is obtained by using four copies and two types of Tet-off GAL80 transgenes. Upon treatment of newly emerged adults with tetracycline, induction of GAL4 activity is observed but the level of induction is influenced by the concentration of the inducer, the age, the sex and the anatomical location of the expression. The inhibition of GAL4 activity and the maintenance of induced expression is altered in old animals. This study reveals that the repressive ability of GAL80 is affected by the age and sex of the animal which is a major limitation to regulate gene expression with GAL80 in aged Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) has become the most widely used high-throughput technology for gene expression profiling of individual cells. The potential of being able to measure cell-to-cell variability at a high-dimensional genomic scale opens numerous new lines of investigation in basic and clinical research. For example, by identifying groups of cells with expression profiles unlike those observed in cells with known phenotypes, new cell types may be discovered. Dimension reduction followed by unsupervised clustering are the quantitative approaches typically used to facilitate such discoveries. However, a challenge for this approach is that most scRNA-Seq datasets are sparse, with the percentages of measurements reported as zero ranging from 35% to 99% across cells, and these zeros are partially explained by experimental inefficiencies that lead to censored data. Furthermore, the observed across-cell differences in the percentages of zeros are partly due to technical artifacts rather than biological differences. Unfortunately, standard dimension reduction approaches treat these censored values as true zeros, which leads to the identification of distorted low-dimensional factors. When these factors are used for clustering, the distortion leads to incorrect identification of biological groups. Here, we propose an approach that accounts for cell-specific censoring with a varying-censoring aware matrix factorization (VAMF) model that permits the identification of factors in the presence of the above described systematic bias. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach on published scRNA-Seq data and confirm these on simulated data.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin loops form a basic unit of interphase nuclear organisation, providing contacts between regulatory regions and target promoters, and forming higher level patterns defining self interacting domains. Recent studies have shown that mutations predicted to alter chromatin loops and domains are frequently observed in tumours and can result in the upregulation of oncogenes, but the combinations of selection and mutational bias underlying these observations remains unknown. Here, we explore the unusual mutational landscape associated with chromatin loop anchor points (LAPs), which are located at the base of chromatin loops and form a kinetic trap for cohesin. We show that LAPs are strongly depleted for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in tumours, which is consistent with their relatively early replication timing. However, despite low SNV rates, LAPs emerge as sites of evolutionary innovation showing enrichment for structural variants (SVs). They harbour an excess of SV breakpoints in cancers, are prone to double strand breaks in somatic cells, and are bound by DNA repair complex proteins. Recurrently disrupted LAPs are often associated with genes annotated with functions in cell cycle transitions. An unexpectedly large fraction of LAPs (16%) also overlap known meiotic recombination hotspot (HSs), and are enriched for the core PRDM9 binding motif, suggesting that LAPs have been foci for diversity generated during recent human evolution. We suggest that the unusual chromatin structure at LAPs underlies the elevated SV rates observed, marking LAPs as sites of regulatory importance but also genomic fragility.",

We combine these histone modification profiles into a unified set of chromatin state annotations, and track their activity across developmental time and space. Through integrative analysis we identify dynamic enhancers, reveal key transcriptional regulators, and characterize the role of chromatin-based repression in developmental gene regulation. We also leverage these data to link enhancers to putative target genes, revealing connections between coding and non-coding sequence variation in disease etiology. Our study provides a compendium of resources for biomedical researchers, and achieves the most comprehensive view of embryonic chromatin states to date.",

Despite obtaining high-quality reads, many sequences fail to be classified at the genus or species levels due to their short length. This pitfall can be overcome sequencing the full-length 16S rRNA gene (1,500bp) by 3rd generation sequencers.\\n\\nWe aimed to assess the performance of nanopore sequencing using MinION on characterizing microbiota complex samples. First set-up step was performed using a staggered mock community (HM-783D). Then, we sequenced a pool of several dog skin microbiota samples previously sequenced by Ion Torrent PGM. Sequences obtained for full-length 16S rRNA with degenerated primers retrieved increased richness estimates at high taxonomic level (Bacteria and Archaea) that were missed with short-reads. Besides, we were able to obtain taxonomic assignments down to species level, although it was not always feasible due to: i) incomplete database; ii) primer set chosen; iii) low taxonomic resolution of 16S rRNA gene within some genera; and/or iv) sequencing errors. Nanopore sequencing of the full-length 16S rRNA gene using MinION with 1D sequencing kit allowed us inferring microbiota composition of a complex microbial community to lower taxonomic levels than short-reads from 2nd generation sequencers.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a highly prevalent disease, usually resulting from chronic overeating. Accumulating evidence suggests that increased neural responses during the anticipation of high-calorie food play an important role in overeating. A promising method for counteracting enhanced food anticipation in overeating might be mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). However, the neural mechanisms by which MBIs can affect food reward anticipation are unclear. In this randomized, actively controlled study, the primary objective was to investigate the effect of an 8-week mindful eating intervention on reward anticipation. On the neural level, we hypothesized that mindful eating would decrease striatal reward anticipation responses. Additionally, responses in the midbrain - from which the reward pathways originate - were explored. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested 58 healthy participants with a wide body mass index range (BMI: 19-35 kg/m2), motivated to change their eating behavior. During scanning they performed an incentive delay task, measuring neural reward anticipation responses to caloric and monetary cues before and after 8 weeks of mindful eating or educational cooking (active control). Compared with the educational cooking intervention, mindful eating affected neural reward anticipation responses, with relatively reduced caloric versus monetary reward responses. This effect was, however, not seen in the striatum, but only in the midbrain. The secondary objective was to assess temporary and long-lasting (one year follow-up) intervention effects on self-reported eating behavior and anthropometric measures (BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR)). We did not observe effects of the mindful eating intervention on eating behavior. Instead, the control intervention showed temporary beneficial effects on BMI, waist circumference, and diet quality, but not on WHR or self-reported eating behavior, as well as long-lasting increases in knowledge about healthy eating. These results suggest that an 8-week mindful eating intervention may have decreased the relative salience of food cues by affecting midbrain but not striatal reward responses. However, these exploratory results should be verified in confirmatory research.\n\nThe primary and secondary objectives of the study were registered in the Dutch Trial Register (NTR): NL4923 (NTR5025).",

    "abstract": "Semantic cognition is central to understanding of language and the world and, unlike many cognitive domains, is thought to show little age-related decline. We investigated age-related differences in the neural basis of this critical cognitive domain by performing an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies comparing young and older people. On average, young people outperformed their older counterparts during semantic tasks. Overall, both age groups activated similar left-lateralised regions. However, older adults displayed less activation than young people in some elements of the typical left-hemisphere semantic network, including inferior prefrontal, posterior temporal and inferior parietal cortex. They also showed greater activation in right frontal and parietal regions, particularly those held to be involved in domain-general controlled processing, and principally when they performed more poorly than the young. Thus, semantic processing in later life is associated with a shift from semantic-specific to domain-general neural resources, consistent with the theory of neural dedifferentiation, and a performance-related reduction in prefrontal lateralisation, which may reflect a response to increased task demands.",

    "abstract": "Massive whole-brain blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal modulation (up to 95% of brain voxels) in response to task stimuli has recently been reported in functional MRI investigations. These findings have two implications. First, they highlight inability of a conventional 'top-down' general linear model approach to capture all forms of task-driven brain activity. Second, as opposed to a static 'active' or 'non-active' localization theory of the neural implementation of cognitive processes, functional neuroimaging should develop and pursue dynamical theories of cognition involving the dynamic interactions of all brain networks, in line with psychological constructionist theories of cognition. In this study, we describe a novel exploratory, bottom-up approach that directly estimates task-driven brain activity regardless of whether it follows an a priori reference function. Leveraging the property that task-driven brain activity is associated with reductions in BOLD signal variability, we combine the tools of instantaneous phase synchronization and independent component analysis to characterize whole-brain task-driven activity in terms of group-wise similarity in temporal signal dynamics of brain networks. We applied this novel framework to task fMRI data from a motor, theory of mind and working memory task provided through the Human Connectome Project. We discovered a large number of brain networks that dynamically synchronized to various features of the task scan, some overlapping with areas identified as 'active' in the top-down GLM approach. Using the results provided through this novel approach, we provide a more comprehensive description of cognitive processes whereby task-related brain activity is not restricted to dichotomous 'active' or 'non-active' inferences, but is characterized by the temporal dynamics of brain networks across time.",

    "abstract": "Greater emphasis on the study of intact cellular networks in their physiological environment has led to rapid advances in intravital imaging in the central nervous system, while the peripheral system remains largely unexplored. To assess large networks of sensory neurons we selectively label primary afferents with GCaMP6s and visualise their functional responses in vivo to peripheral stimulation. We show that we are able to monitor simultaneously the activity of hundreds of sensory neurons with sensitivity sufficient to detect, in most cases, single action potentials with a typical rise time of around 200 milliseconds, and an exponential decay with a time constant of approximately 700 milliseconds. Using this sensitive technique we are able to show that large scale recordings demonstrate the recently disputed polymodality of nociceptive primary afferents with between 40-80% of thermally sensitive DRG neurons responding also to noxious mechanical stimulation. We also specifically assess the small population of peripheral cold fibres and demonstrate significant sensitisation to cooling after a model of sterile and persistent inflammation, with significantly increased sensitivity already at decreases of 5{degrees}C when compared to uninflamed responses. This not only reveals interesting new insights into the (patho)physiology of the peripheral nervous system but also demonstrates the sensitivity of this imaging technique to physiological changes in primary afferents.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMost of our functional understanding of the peripheral nervous system has come from single unit recordings. However, the acquisition of such data is labour-intensive and usually  low yield. Moreover, some questions are best addressed by studying populations of neurons. To this end we report on a system that monitors activity in hundreds of single sensory neurons simultaneously, with sufficient sensitivity to detect in most cases single action potentials. We use this technique to characterise nociceptor properties and demonstrate polymodality in the majority of neurons and their sensitization under inflammatory conditions. We therefore believe this approach will be very useful for the studies of the somatosensory system in general and pain in particular.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the efficacies of synapses are thought to be the neurobiological basis of learning and memory. The efficacy of a synapse depends on its current number of neurotransmitter receptors. Recent experiments have shown that these receptors are highly dynamic, moving back and forth between synapses on time scales of seconds and minutes. This suggests spontaneous fluctuations in synaptic efficacies and a competition of nearby synapses for available receptors. Here we propose a mathematical model of this competition of synapses for neurotransmitter receptors from a local dendritic pool. Using minimal assumptions, the model produces a fast multiplicative scaling behavior of synapses. Furthermore, the model explains a transient form of heterosynaptic plasticity and predicts that its amount is inversely related to the size of the local receptor pool. Overall, our model reveals logistical tradeoffs during the induction of synaptic plasticity due to the rapid exchange of neurotransmitter receptors between synapses.",

Zebrafish embryos were treated with different concentrations of progesterone from 12 hours post-fertilization (hpf) to 120 hpf. Total mRNA was extracted and the transcriptional profiles of genes involved in HPT axis were examined using qPCR. The genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism and thyroid hormone synthesis were up-regulated in zebrafish exposed to progesterone. These results indicated that progesterone affected the mRNA expression of genes involved in the HPT axis, which might interrupt the endocrine system in zebrafish.

In addition to environmental constraints, genetic and developmental factors, such as the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, restrict maximal yield. Here we report the peculiar observation that a subset of early flowering Arabidopsis thaliana accessions produced larger shoot rosette diameters when grown in zinc (Zn)-deficient conditions, compared with Zn-sufficient conditions. This was associated with early flowering that restricted the leaf length under Zn sufficiency. Zinc deficiency repressed FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) expression, a major regulator of flowering. Repression or loss of FT increased the rosette diameter by a delay of the transition to flowering, a longer phase of leaf proliferation and increased leaf number. The transition to flowering reduced, but not terminated, the proliferation of established leaves. The size of individual leaf mesophyll cells was not affected by Zn deficiency or loss of FT, indicating that the larger rosette diameter was caused by maintained proliferation of vegetative tissue. As a consequence, early flowering accessions under Zn deficiency grew larger rosette diameters due to a delay of flowering, which explains the unusual increase of vegetative biomass under nutrient deficiency.\\n\\nHighlightAn increase in biomass of some Arabidopsis accessions under Zn-deficiency is caused by retardation of flowering, prolonging vegetative growth.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional profiling is a prevalent and powerful approach for capturing the response of crop plants to environmental stresses, e.g. response of rice to drought. However, functionally interpreting the resulting genome-wide gene expression changes is severely hampered by the large gaps in our genomic knowledge about which genes work together in cellular pathways/processes in rice. Here, we present a new web resource - RECoN - that relies on a network-based approach to go beyond currently limited annotations in delineating functional and regulatory perturbations in new rice stress transcriptome datasets generated by a researcher. To build RECoN, we first enumerated 1,744 stress-specific gene modules covering 28,421 rice genes (>72% of the genes in the genome). Each module contains a group of genes tightly coexpressed across a large number of environmental conditions and, thus, is likely to be functionally coherent. When a user provides a new differential expression profile, RECoN identifies modules substantially perturbed in their experiment and further suggests deregulated functional and regulatory mechanisms based on the enrichment of current annotations within the predefined modules. We demonstrate the utility of this resource by analyzing new drought transcriptomes of rice in three developmental stages, which revealed large-scale insights into the cellular processes and regulatory mechanisms involved in common and stage-specific drought responses. RECoN enables biologists to functionally explore new data from all abiotic stresses on a genome-scale and to uncover gene candidates, including those that are currently functionally uncharacterized, for engineering stress tolerance.",

We predicted 3D chromatin interactions including enhancer-promoter interactions in 12 tissues across 8 developmental stages, which facilitates linking TFs to their target genes for constructing genetic networks. To identify driver TFs particularly those not necessarily differentially expressed ones, we developed a new algorithm, dubbed as Taiji, to assess the global importance of TFs in development. Through comparative analysis across tissues and developmental stages, we systematically uncovered TFs that are critical for lineage-specific and stage-dependent tissue specification. Most interestingly, we have identified TF combinations that function in spatiotemporal order to form transcriptional waves regulating developmental progress and differentiation. Not only does our analysis provide the first comprehensive map of transcriptional regulatory circuits during mouse embryonic development, the identified novel regulators and the predicted 3D chromatin interactions also provide a valuable resource to guide further mechanistic studies.",

Here, we used dynamical models of scaffold signaling to investigate the impact scaffolds have on network behavior. We considered two paradigms of scaffold assembly: as either the nucleation point for assembly of discrete multi-subunit proteins (the machine paradigm) or a platform upon which kinases independently associate (the ensemble paradigm). We found that several well-accepted hypotheses regarding the role of scaffolds in regulating signal response either do not hold or depend critically on the assembly paradigm employed.

    "abstract": "Growth rate is a near-universal selective pressure across microbial species. High growth rates require hundreds of metabolic enzymes, each with different nonlinear kinetics, to be precisely tuned within the bounds set by physicochemical constraints. Yet, the metabolic behaviour of many species is characterized by simple relations between growth rate, enzyme expression levels and metabolic rates. We asked if this simplicity could be the outcome of optimisation by evolution. Indeed, when the growth rate is maximized -in a static environment under mass-conservation and enzyme expression constraints- we prove mathematically that the resulting optimal metabolic flux distribution is described by a limited number of subnetworks, known as Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs). We show that, because EFMs are the minimal subnetworks leading to growth, a small active number automatically leads to the simple relations that are measured. We find that the maximal number of flux-carrying EFMs is determined only by the number of imposed constraints on enzyme expression, not by the size, kinetics or topology of the network. This minimal-EFM extremum principle is illustrated in a graphical framework, which explains qualitative changes in microbial behaviours, such as overflow metabolism and co-consumption, and provides a method for identification of the enzyme expression constraints that limit growth under the prevalent conditions. The extremum principle applies to all microorganisms that are selected for maximal growth rates under protein concentration constraints, for example the solvent capacities of cytosol, membrane or periplasmic space.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe microbial genome encodes for a large network of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The reaction rates depend on concentrations of enzymes and metabolites, which in turn depend on those rates. Cells face a number of biophysical constraints on enzyme expression, for example due to a limited membrane area or cytosolic volume. Considering this complexity and nonlinearity of metabolism, how is it possible, that experimental data can often be described by simple linear models? We show that it is evolution itself that selects for simplicity. When reproductive rate is maximised, the number of active independent metabolic pathways is bounded by the number of growth-limiting enzyme constraints, which is typically small. A small number of pathways automatically generates the measured simple relations. We identify the importance of growth-limiting constraints in shaping microbial behaviour, by focussing on their mechanistic nature. We demonstrate that overflow metabolism - an important phenomenon in bacteria, yeasts, and cancer cells - is caused by two constraints on enzyme expression. We derive experimental guidelines for constraint identification in microorganisms. Knowing these constraints leads to increased understanding of metabolism, and thereby to better predictions and more effective manipulations.",
