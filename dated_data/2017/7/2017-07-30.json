    "abstract": "Evolutionary changes in functional traits represent one possible reason why exotic species spread to become invasive, but empirical studies of the mechanisms driving phenotypic differentiation between populations of invasive species are rare. This study tested whether differences in distal spine length among populations of the invasive cladoceran, Bythotrephes longimanus, could be explained by local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity. We collected Bythotrephes from six lakes and found that distal spine lengths and natural selection on distal spine length differed among populations, but were unrelated to the gape-limitation of the dominant fish predator in the lake from which they were collected. A common garden experiment revealed significant genetic and maternal variation for distal spine length, but phenotypic differences among populations were not genetically based. Phenotypic differences among lakes in this ecologically important trait are, therefore, the result of plasticity and not local adaptation, despite spatially variable selection on this heritable trait. The ability of Bythotrephes to plastically adjust distal spine length may explain the success of this species at invading lake ecosystems with diverse biotic environments.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to human-induced environmental change has the potential to profoundly influence the genomic architecture of affected species. This is particularly true in agricultural ecosystems, where anthropogenic selection pressure is strong. Heliothis virescens feeds on cotton in its larval stages and US populations have been declining since the widespread planting of transgenic cotton, which endogenously express proteins derived Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). No physiological adaptation to Bt toxin has been found in the field, so adaptation to this altered environment could involve: 1) shifts in host plant selection mechanisms to avoid cotton, 2) changes in detoxification mechanisms required for cotton-feeding versus feeding on other host plants, or 3) loss of resistance to previously used management practices including insecticides. Here we begin to address the question of whether such changes occurred in H. virescens populations between the years 1997 and 2012. As part of our study, we produced an H. virescens genome assembly and used this in concert with a ddRAD-seq enabled genome scan to identify loci with significant allele frequency changes over the 15 year period after Bt crops became widespread in the agricultural landscape. Confirmation that a known genetic change at a previously described H. virescens target of selection was detectable in our genome scan increased our confidence in this methodology. We quantified the strength of selection required to elicit the observed allele frequency changes at loci under selection. Potential contributions of genes near the loci under selection to adaptive phenotypes in the H. virescens cotton system are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome-wide screens of peripheral blood during the onset and development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) indicate widespread immune dysregulation. However, little is known as to whether biological sex and the type of traumatic event influence shared or distinct biological pathways in PTSD. We performed a combined analysis of five independent PTSD blood transcriptome studies covering seven types of trauma in 229 PTSD and 311 comparison individuals to synthesize the extant data. Analyses by trauma type revealed a clear pattern of PTSD gene expression signatures distinguishing interpersonal (IP)-related traumas from combat-related traumas. Co-expression network analyses integrated all data and identified distinct gene expression perturbations across sex and modes of trauma in PTSD, including one wound-healing module down-regulated in men exposed to combat traumas, one IL12-mediated signaling module up-regulated in men exposed to IP-related traumas, and two modules associated with lipid metabolism and MAPK-activity up-regulated in women exposed to IP-related traumas. Remarkably, a high degree of sharing of transcriptional dysregulation across sex and modes of trauma in PTSD was also observed converging on common signaling cascades, including cytokine, innate immune and type I interferon pathways. Collectively, these findings provide a broad view of immune dysregulation in PTSD and demonstrate inflammatory pathways of molecular convergence and specificity, which may inform mechanisms and diagnostic biomarkers for the disorder.",

Here, I highlight that this cell holds information in two distinct forms: in the linear DNA sequence that is replicated during cell divisions, and in the three-dimensional arrangement of molecules that can change during development but that is recreated at the start of each generation. These two interdependent stores of information - one replicating with each cell division and the other cycling with a period of one generation - coevolve while perpetuating an organism. Unlike the genome, the cycling arrangement of molecules, which could include RNAs, proteins, sugars, lipids, etc., is not well understood. Because this arrangement and the genome are together transmitted from one generation to the next, analysis of both is necessary to understand evolution, origins of inherited diseases, and consequences of genome engineering. Recent developments suggest that tools are in place to examine how all the information to build an organism is encoded within a single cell, and how this cell code is reproduced in every generation.",

    "abstract": "Scandinavia was one of the last geographic areas in Europe to become habitable for humans after the last glaciation. However, the origin(s) of the first colonizers and their migration routes remain unclear. We sequenced the genomes, up to 57x coverage, of seven hunter-gatherers excavated across Scandinavia and dated to 9,500-6,000 years before present. Surprisingly, among the Scandinavian Mesolithic individuals, the genetic data display an east-west genetic gradient that opposes the pattern seen in other parts of Mesolithic Europe. This result suggests that Scandinavia was initially colonized following two different routes: one from the south, the other from the northeast. The latter followed the ice-free Norwegian north Atlantic coast, along which novel and advanced pressure-blade stone-tool techniques may have spread. These two groups met and mixed in Scandinavia, creating a genetically diverse population, which shows patterns of genetic adaptation to high latitude environments. These adaptations include high frequencies of low pigmentation variants and a gene-region associated with physical performance, which shows strong continuity into modern-day northern Europeans.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila neuroblasts are an excellent model for investigating how neuronal diversity is generated. Most brain neuroblasts generate a series of ganglion mother cells (GMCs) that each make two neurons (type I lineage), but sixteen brain neuroblasts generate a series of intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) that each produce 4-6 GMCs and 8-12 neurons (type II lineage). Thus, type II lineages are similar to primate cortical lineages, and may serve as models for understanding cortical expansion. Yet the origin of type II neuroblasts remains mysterious: do they form in the embryo or larva? If they form in the embryo, do their progeny populate the adult central complex, as do the larval type II neuroblast progeny? Here we present molecular and clonal data showing that all type II neuroblasts form in the embryo, produce INPs, and express known temporal transcription factors. Embryonic type II neuroblasts and INPs undergo quiescence, and produce embryonic-born progeny that contribute to the adult central complex. Our results provide a foundation for investigating the development of the central complex, and tools for characterizing early-born neurons in central complex function.",

Their mechanism of action based on the base pairing binding to their cognate targets, have helped the development of many computer applications for the prediction of miRNA target recognition. More recently, many other computer applications have appeared with the objective of studying miRNA roles in many contexts, trying to dissect and predict their functions in a specific biological process. Learning about miRNA function needs a practical training in the use of specific computer and web-based applications that are complementary to the wet-lab studies. In the last seven years we have been involved in the organization of advanced training courses about the in silico functional analysis of miRNAs and non-coding RNAs, for students ranging from the postgraduate to the post-doctoral level. In order to guide the learning process about miRNAs, we have created miRNAtools (http://mirnatools.eu), a web repository of miRNA tools and tutorials. This page is a compilation of tools to analyze miRNAs and their regulatory action that intends to collect and organize the information that is dispersed in the web. The miRNAtools webpage is completed by a collection of tutorials that can be used by students and tutors engaged in advanced training courses. The tutorials follow the rationale of the analysis of the function of selected miRNAs, starting from their nomenclature and genomic localization and finishing by assessing their involvement in specific cellular functions.\\n\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE AUTHORFrancisco J.

    "abstract": "Laboratory assays evaluating the effect of DNA sequence variants on BRCA1 mRNA splicing may contribute to classification by providing molecular evidence. However, our knowledge of normal and aberrant BRCA1 splicing events to date has been limited to data derived from assays targeting partial transcript sequences. For the first time, we resolve the exon structure of whole BRCA1 transcripts using MinION nanopore sequencing of long-range PCR amplicons. Our study identified 32 BRCA1 isoforms, including 18 novel isoforms which comprised skipping of multiple contiguous and/or non-contiguous exons. Furthermore, we show that known BRCA1 exon skipping events, such as {Delta}(9,10) and {Delta}21, can co-occur in a single transcript, with some isoforms containing four or more alternative splice junctions. Our results highlight complexity in BRCA1 transcript structure that has not previously been described. This finding has key implications for predicting translation frame of splicing transcripts, important for interpreting the clinical significance of spliceogenic variants. Future research is warranted to quantitatively assess full length BRCA1 transcript levels, and to assess the application of nanopore sequencing for routine evaluation of potential spliceogenic variants.",

    "abstract": "Longitudinal studies of development and disease in the human brain have motivated the acquisition of large neuroimaging data sets and the concomitant development of robust methodological and statistical tools for quantifying neurostructural changes. Longitudinal-specific strategies for acquisition and processing have potentially significant benefits including more consistent estimates of intra-subject measurements while retaining predictive power. In this work, we introduce the open-source Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) registration-based cortical thickness longitudinal processing pipeline and its application to the first phase of the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) comprising over 600 subjects with multiple time points from baseline to 36 months. We demonstrate in these data that the single-subject template construction and same orientation processing results in a simultaneous minimization of residual variability and maximization of between-subject variability immediately estimable from a longitudinal mixed-effects modeling strategy. It is known from the statistical literature that optimizing these dual criteria leads to greater scientific interpretability in terms of tighter confidence intervals in calculated mean trends, smaller prediction intervals, and narrower confidence intervals for determining cross-sectional effects. This strategy is evaluated over the entire cortex, as defined by the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville labeling protocol, where comparisons are made with the cross-sectional and longitudinal FreeSurfer processing streams. Subsequent linear mixed effects modeling for identifying diagnostic groupings within the ADNI cohort is provided as supporting evidence for the utility of the proposed ANTs longitudinal framework which provides unbiased structural neuroimage processing and competitive to superior power for longitudinal structural change detection.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSynchronization of neuronal spike activity is thought to play a key role in the transmission of information for sensory processing in the brain, and this synchronization is influenced by oscillatory population activity occurring in multiple frequency ranges at multiple stages of sensory pathways. In the neocortex, gamma frequency oscillations appear to play an important role in synchronizing neuronal ensembles and allowing for selective communication between regions, yet relatively little is known about whether gamma oscillations facilitate transmission of sensory information from thalamus to cortex. Here, we investigate the role of gamma oscillations in promoting synchronous spike activity between the visual thalamus (dLGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) in awake mice, a model sensory system with prominent gamma oscillations that are modulated by visual input. We demonstrate that transmission of visual information to cortex involves phase-synchronized oscillations in the high gamma range (50-90Hz), with concomitant millisecond-scale synchronization of thalamic and cortical spike activity. Transition from a full-field gray image to a high-contrast checkerboard image caused gamma activity to rapidly increase in amplitude, frequency, and bandwidth, yet the gamma oscillations in dLGN and V1 maintained a consistent phase relationship. High contrast stimulation also caused an increase in amplitude of oscillations in the beta and low gamma range, but those were not associated with synchronous thalamic activity. These results indicate a role for high gamma oscillations in mediating the functional connectivity between thalamic and cortical neurons in the visual pathway, a similar role to beta oscillations in primates.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe mechanisms by which neurons selectively communicate are essential to our understanding of how the brain processes information. Abundant evidence suggests that cortical sensory processing involves the synchronization of high frequency electric field oscillations known as gamma oscillations, which allow groups of neurons to synchronize their spike activity in order to collaboratively process sensory input. Here, we show that oscillations and spikes in the visual thalamocortical pathway of the mouse exhibit synchrony across a broad high gamma frequency range (50-90Hz), suggesting these oscillations play an important role in the relay of visual information to the cortex. This is substantially different from oscillations observed in monkeys, in which gamma is absent in thalamus and beta oscillations support thalamocortical relay.",

    "abstract": "Can evolutionarily  hardwired fear responses, e.g. for spiders and snakes, be reprogramed unconsciously in the human brain? Currently, exposure therapy is amongst the most effective treatments for anxiety disorders1, but this intervention is subjectively aversive to patients, and rates of premature attrition from treatment have been reported to be as high as 70%2. Here we introduce a novel method to bypass the subjective unpleasantness in conscious exposure, by directly pairing monetary reward with unconscious occurrences of decoded representations of naturally feared objects in the brain. The typical way to identify multivoxel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) representations for feared objects involves repeated presentations of the relevant images explicitly to subjects. However, for our potential treatment method to be effective in actual clinical settings, we need to decode fear representations without triggering excessively aversive reactions which may cause patients to dropout from treatments prematurely. Here we overcome this challenge by capitalizing on recent advancements in fMRI decoding techniques: We employed a method called hyperalignment3,4 to infer the relevant representations of feared objects for a designated participant based on data from other  surrogate participants. This way the procedure completely bypasses the need for the conscious encountering of feared objects. We demonstrate that our method can lead to reliable reductions in physiological fear responses measured by skin conductance as well as amygdala hemodynamic activity. Not only do these results raise the intriguing possibility that naturally occurring fear can be  re-programmed outside of conscious awareness, importantly they also created the rare opportunity for a psychological intervention of this nature to be tested rigorously in a double-blind placebo-controlled fashion. This may pave the way for a novel treatment method, combining the appealing rationale and proven efficacy of conventional psychotherapy with the rigor and leverage of clinical neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "The 3 untranslated regions (3UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNA) are non-coding sequences that regulate several aspects of mRNA metabolism, including intracellular localisation and translation. Here, we show that in sympathetic neuron axons, the 3UTRs of many transcripts undergo cleavage, generating both translatable isoforms expressing a shorter 3UTR, and 3UTR fragments. 3end RNA sequencing indicated that 3UTR cleavage is a potentially widespread event in axons, which is mediated by a protein complex containing the endonuclease Ago2 and the RNA binding protein HuD. Analysis of the Inositol monophosphatase 1 (Impa1) mRNA revealed that a stem loop structure within the 3UTR is necessary for Ago2 cleavage. Thus, remodeling of the 3UTR provides an alternative mechanism that simultaneously regulates local protein synthesis and generates a new class of 3UTR RNAs with yet unknown functions.",

    "abstract": "Single cell expression profiling reveals the molecular states of individual cells with unprecedented detail. However, because these methods destroy cells in the process of analysis, they cannot measure how gene expression changes over time. But some information on dynamics is present in the data: the continuum of molecular states in the population can reflect the trajectory of a typical cell. Many methods for extracting single cell dynamics from population data have been proposed. However, all such attempts face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cell states, there are multiple dynamics that could give rise to it, and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we describe the aspects of gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static snapshot alone and identify assumptions necessary to constrain a unique solution for cell dynamics from static snapshots. We translate these constraints into a practical algorithmic approach, Population Balance Analysis (PBA), which makes use of a method from spectral graph theory to solve a class of high dimensional differential equations. We use simulations to show the strengths and limitations of PBA, and then apply it to single-cell profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Cell state predictions from this analysis agree with HPC fate assays reported in several papers over the past two decades. By highlighting the fundamental limits on dynamic inference faced by any method, our framework provides a rigorous basis for dynamic interpretation of a gene expression continuum and clarifies best experimental designs for trajectory reconstruction from static snapshot measurements.\\n\\nSignificanceSeeing a snapshot of individuals at different stages of a process can reveal what the process would look like for a single individual over time. Biologists apply this principle to infer temporal sequences of gene expression states in cells from measurements made at a single moment in time. However, these inferences are fundamentally under-determined. Using a conservation law, we enumerate reasons that there is no unique dynamics associated with a single snapshot, limiting our ability to infer gene regulatory mechanisms. We then propose a method for dynamic inference that provides a unique dynamic solution under defined approximations and apply it to data from bone marrow stem cells. Overall, this study introduces formal biophysical approaches to single cell bioinformatics.\\n\\nClassificationBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES / Systems Biology",

Nevertheless, people can learn from the experiences of individuals with similar tastes who have already evaluated the available options--a potential harnessed by recommender systems. We mapped recommender system algorithms to models of human judgment and decision making about \\\"matters of fact\\\" and recast the latter as social learning strategies for \\\"matters of taste.\\\" Using computer simulations on a large-scale, empirical dataset, we studied how people could leverage the experiences of others to make better decisions. Our simulation showed that experienced individuals can benefit from relying mostly on the opinions of seemingly similar people; inexperienced individuals, in contrast, cannot reliably estimate similarity and are better off picking the mainstream option despite differences in taste. Crucially, the level of experience beyond which people should switch to similarity-heavy strategies varies substantially across individuals and depends on (i) how mainstream (or alternative) an individuals tastes are and (ii) the level of dispersion in taste similarity with the other people in the group.",

We compared the ability of chitin and chitosan oligomers and polymers (chitin oligomers with degree of polymerization 3 to 8; chitosan oligomers with degree of acetylation 0% to 35% and degree of polymerization 3 to 15; chitosan polymers with degree of acetylation 1% to 60% and degree of polymerization ~1300) to elicit an oxidative burst indicative of induced defense reactions in A. thaliana seedlings. Fully deacetylated chitosans were not able to trigger a response; elicitor activity increased with increasing degree of acetylation of chitosan polymers. Partially acetylated chitosan oligomers required a minimum degree of polymerization of 6 and at least four N-acetyl groups to trigger a response. Invariably, elicitation of an oxidative burst required the presence of the chitin receptor AtCERK1. Our results as well as previously published studies on chitin and chitosan perception in plants are best explained by a new general model of LysM-containing receptor complexes where two partners form a long, but off-set chitin-binding groove and are, thus, dimerized by one chitin or chitosan molecule, sharing a central GlcNAc unit with which both LysM domains interact. To verify this model and to distinguish it from earlier models, we assayed elicitor and inhibitor activities of selected partially acetylated chitosan oligomers with fully defined structures. In contrast to the initial \\\"continuous groove\\\", the original \\\"sandwich\\\", or the current \\\"sliding mode\\\" models for the chitin/chitosan receptor, the here proposed \\\"slipped sandwich\\\" model - which builds on these earlier models and represents a consensus combination of these - is in agreement with all experimental observations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHaplotype assembly is the process of assigning the different alleles of the variants covered by mapped sequencing reads to the two haplotypes of the genome of a human individual. Long reads, which are nowadays cheaper to produce and more widely available than ever before, have been used to reduce the fragmentation of the assembled haplotypes since their ability to span several variants along the genome. These long reads are also characterized by a high error rate, an issue which may be mitigated, however, with larger sets of reads, when this error rate is uniform across genome positions. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art dynamic programming approaches designed for long reads deal only with limited coverages.\\n\\nResultsHere, we propose a new method for assembling haplotypes which combines and extends the features of previous approaches to deal with long reads and higher coverages. In particular, our algorithm is able to dynamically adapt the estimated number of errors at each variant site, while minimizing the total number of error corrections necessary for finding a feasible solution. This allows our method to significantly reduce the required computational resources, allowing to consider datasets composed of higher coverages. The algorithm has been implemented in a freely available tool, HapCHAT: Haplotype Assembly Coverage Handling by Adapting Thresholds. An experimental analysis on sequencing reads with up to 60x coverage reveals improvements in accuracy and recall achieved by considering a higher coverage with lower runtimes.\\n\\nConclusionsOur method leverages the long-range information of sequencing reads that allows to obtain assembled haplotypes fragmented in a lower number of unphased haplotype blocks. At the same time, our method is also able to deal with higher coverages to better correct the errors in the original reads and to obtain more accurate haplotypes as a result.\\n\\nAvailabilityHapCHAT is available at http://hapchat.algolab.eu under the GPL license.",

Here, we describe a single-molecule force spectroscopy approach to quantify membrane binding of C2 domains in Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) and Extended Synaptotagmin-2 (E-Syt2). Syts and E-Syts bind the plasma membrane via multiple C2 domains, bridging the plasma membrane with synaptic vesicles or endoplasmic reticulum to regulate membrane fusion or lipid exchange, respectively. In our approach single proteins attached to membranes supported on silica beads are pulled by optical tweezers, allowing membrane binding and unbinding transitions to be measured with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. C2 domains from either protein resisted unbinding forces of 2-7 pN and had binding energies of 4-14 kBT per C2 domain.

    "abstract": "Statin is one of the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide. Besides reduction of cardiovascular risks, statins have been proposed for the prevention or treatment of other disorders, but results from clinical studies are mixed. There are also controversies concerning the adverse effects caused by statins.\\n\\nIn this study we employed a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach across a wide range of complex traits to explore repositioning opportunities and side-effects of statins. MR is analogous to a \\\"naturalistic\\\" randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is much less susceptible to confounding and reverse causation as compared to observational studies.\\n\\nWe employed two genetic instruments (rs12916 and rs17238484) in the HMGCR gene which have been shown to provide reliable estimates of the risk of statins on type 2 diabetes and weight gain. We observed in the single- and joint-SNP analysis that low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction from HMG-CoA reductase inhibition results in increased depressive symptoms. This finding appeared to be supported by nominally significant results of raised major depression risk in single-SNP MR analysis of rs17238484, and analyses using LDL-C as the exposure. Several other outcomes also reached nominal significance (p < 0.05) in single- or joint-SNP analyses; for example, we observed causal associations of LDL-C lowering from HMG-CoA reductase inhibition with reduced risks of schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, as well as increased forearm bone mineral density, sleep duration and extreme longevity (highest q-value = 0.289). We also found evidence of casual relationships of LDL-C levels with schizophrenia, anorexia, sleep duration and longevity, following the same association directions as in analyses of HMGCR variants. These findings were at least partially supported by previous clinical studies. We did not observe associations with cognitive test profiles, renal outcomes, autoimmune diseases or cancers. While MR has its limitations and our findings remain to be confirmed in further studies, this work demonstrates the potential of a phenome-wide approach to reveal novel therapeutic indications and unknown drug side-effects.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and malignant brain tumor with a high mortality rate. The presence of a large population of macrophages (M{varphi}) in the tumor microenvironment is a prominent feature of GBM and these so-called tumor-associated M{varphi} (TAM) closely interact with the GBM cells to promote the survival, progression and therapy resistance of the GBM. Various therapeutic strategies have been devised either targeting the GBM cells or the TAM but few have addressed the cross-talks between the two cell populations. The present study was carried out to explore the possibility of exploiting the cross-talks between the GBM cells (GC) and TAM for modulation of the GBM microenvironment through using Nano-DOX, a drug composite based on nanodiamonds bearing doxorubicin. In the in vitro work on human cell models, Nano-DOX-loaded TAM were first shown to be viable and able to infiltrate three-dimensional GC spheroids and release cargo drug therein. GC were then demonstrated to encourage Nano-DOX-loaded TAM to unload Nano-DOX back into GC which consequently emitted damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are powerful immunostimulatory agents as well as indicators of cell damage. Nano-DOX was next proven to be a more potent inducer of GC DAMPs emission than doxorubicin. As a result, Nano-DOX-damaged GC exhibited an enhanced ability to attract both TAM and Nano-DOX-loaded TAM. Most remarkably, Nano-DOX-damaged GC reprogrammed the TAM from a pro-GBM phenotype to an anti-GBM phenotype that suppressed GC growth. Finally, the in vivo relevance of the in vitro findings was tested in animal study. Mice bearing orthotopic human GBM xenografts were intravenously injected with Nano-DOX-loaded mouse TAM which were found releasing drug in the GBM xenografts 24 h after injection. GC damage was evidenced by the induction of DAMPs emission within the xenografts and a shift of TAM phenotype was detected as well. Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel way with therapeutic potential to harness the cross-talk between GBM cells and TAM for modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment.\\n\\nAbbreviationsATP, adenosine triphosphate; BBB, blood-brain barrier; BCA, bicinchoninic acid; BMDM, bone marrow derived macrophages; CD, cluster of differentiation; CFSE, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester; CM, conditioned culture medium; CNS, central nervous system; CRT, calreticulin; DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns; DAB, diaminobenzidine; DOX, doxorubicin; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HMGB1, high mobility group protein B1; HSP90, heat shock protein 90; FACS, flow cytometry; GBM, glioblastoma; Guanylate Binding Protein 5 (GBP5); GC, glioblastoma cells; IHC, immunohistochemical; IL, interleukin; M{varphi}, macrophages; mBMDM, mouse BMDM; mBMDM2, Type-2 mBMDM; M1, Type-1 Mo; M2, Type-2 Mo; Nano-DOX, ND-PG-RGD-DOX; ND, nanodiamonds; Nano-DOX-mBMDM, Nano-DOX-loaded mouse BMDM; NGCM, Nano-DOX-treated-GC-conditioned medium; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; PG, polyglycerol; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PVDF, polyvinylidene fluoride; RGD, tripeptide of L-arginine, glycine and L-aspartic acid; RM, regular culture medium; SD, standard deviation; TAM, tumor-associated M{varphi}; TBST, Tris Buffered Saline with Tween(R) 20.\\n\\nGraphic abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=153 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/170282_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (111K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@180aea2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14922f7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@96a696org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@92f050_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Effects of crop growth and physiological activity to drought and irrigation regimes have been extensively studied; however, the responses of plant growth, morphological and photosynthetic behaviors to drought episodes and thereafter rewatering receive a less attention. This field experiment was carried out directly in situ at an agricultural ecosystem research station during 2015-2016, in a northeastern China, on the renowned northeastern maize production belt, where is being threatened by severe drought. A field automatic rain-shelter was used, and five irrigation regimes including control, four drought episodes, and rewatering treatments were established. The chlorophyll contents (SPAD values), light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Asat), and photosystem II actual quantum yield ({Phi}PSII), maximum quantum yield (Fv'/Fm') decreased at lower leaf positions and with plant development. Episodic drought effects on plant growth, leaf morphological traits and photosynthetic processes at both vegetative and reproductive stages were severely remarked, particularly at late development stage and with longer drought duration. The recovery of leaf functional traits of the plants experienced historical-drought following re-irrigating was not fully restored to the level of the plants subjected to ample and normal water status; and the strength of recovery was proportional to the persistence of pre-drought episodes. The relationship of Asat with SPAD depends on water status and plant development. A principal component analysis can well denote the change patterns in responses to water status treatments with plant development. The results may give an insight into how to understand the maize traits responses to drought episode and rewatering, and this also might assist the drought-stricken crops to cope with future climatic change.",

To determine whether late heterochronic shifts underlie derived floral morphologies within Jaltomata (Solanaceae) - a genus whose species have extensive and recently evolved floral diversity - we compared floral development of four diverse species (including an ambiguously ancestral or secondarily derived rotate, two putatively independently evolved campanulate, and a tubular morph) to the ancestral rotate floral form, as well as to an outgroup that shares this ancestral floral morphology.\\n\\nResultsWe determined that early floral development (<1 mm bud diameter, corresponding to completion of organ whorl initiation) is very similar among all species, but that different mature floral forms are distinguishable by mid-development (>1 mm diameters) due to differential growth acceleration of corolla traits. Floral ontogeny among similar mature rotate forms remains comparable until late stages, while somewhat different patterns of organ growth are found between species with similar campanulate forms.\\n\\nConclusionsOur data suggest shared floral patterning during early-stage development, but that different heterochronic shifts during mid- and late-stage development contributes to divergent floral traits. Heterochrony thus appears to have been important in the rapid and repeated diversification of Jaltomata flowers.",
