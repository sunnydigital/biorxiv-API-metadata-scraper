    "abstract": "Human genes exhibit different effects on fitness in cancer and normal cells. Here, we present an evolutionary approach to measure the selection pressure on human genes, using the well-known ratio of the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate in both cancer genomes (CN/CS) and normal populations (pN/pS). A new mutation-profile-based method that adopts sample-specific mutation rate profiles instead of conventional substitution models was developed. We found that cancer-specific selection pressure is quite different from the selection pressure at the species and population levels. Both the relaxation of purifying selection on passenger mutations and the positive selection of driver mutations may contribute to the increased CN/CS values of human genes in cancer genomes compared with the pN/pS values in human populations. The CN/CS values also contribute to the improved classification of cancer genes and a better understanding of the onco-functionalization of cancer genes during oncogenesis. The use of our computational pipeline to identify cancer-specific positively and negatively selected genes may provide useful information for understanding the evolution of cancers and identifying possible targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Mechanics plays a key role in the development of higher organisms. However, working towards an understanding of this relationship is complicated by the fact that it has proven difficult to model the link between local forces generated at the subcellular level, and tissue deformation at the whole-embryo level. Here we propose an approach first developed for lipid bilayers and cell membranes, in which force-generation at the cytoskeletal level only enters the shape mechanics calculation in the form of local changes in preferred tissue curvature. This allows us to formulate the continuum mechanics problem purely in terms of tissue strains. Relaxing the system by lowering its mechanical energy yields global morphogenetic predictions that accommodate the tendency towards this local preferred curvature, without explicitly modeling force-generating mechanisms at the molecular level. Our computational framework, which we call SPHARMMECH, extends a three-dimensional spherical harmonics parameterization known as SPHARM to combine this level of abstraction with a sparse shape representation. The integration of these two principles allows computer simulations to be performed in three dimensions, on highly complex shapes, gene expression patterns, and mechanical constraints.\\n\\nWe demonstrate our approach by modeling mesoderm invagination in the fruit-fly embryo, where local forces generated by the acto-myosin meshwork in the region of the future mesoderm lead to formation of a ventral tissue fold. The process is accompanied by substantial changes in cell shape and long-range cell movements. Applying SPHARM-MECH to whole-embryo live imaging data acquired with light-sheet microscopy reveals significant correlation between calculated and observed tissue movements. Our analysis predicts the observed cell shape anisotropy on the ventral side of the embryo and suggests an active mechanical role of mesoderm invagination in supporting the onset of germ-band extension.",

However, estimating R2 for (generalized) linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called R2GLMM for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families.\\nC_LIO_LISimilarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients ICC (also known as repeatability in the field of ecology and evolution) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. ICC is related to R2 because they are both ratios of variance components.\\nC_LIO_LIIn this article we expand our method to additional non-Gaussian distributions, namely quasi-Poisson, negative binomial and gamma GLMMs. However, in theory, our extension could be applied to any distribution and we include an explanatory calculation for the Tweedie distribution.\\nC_LIO_LIWhile expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts, Jensens inequality and the delta method, both of which help in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensens inequality has important implications for the interpretation GLMMs while the delta method allows a general derivation of distribution-specific variances. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data.\\nC_LIO_LIWe illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples in the R environment.

    "abstract": "Bacteria and their viral pathogens face constant pressure for augmented immune and infective capabilities, respectively. Under this reciprocally imposed selective regime, we expect to see a runaway evolutionary arms race, ultimately leading to the extinction of one species. Despite this prediction, in many systems host and pathogen coexist with minimal coevolution even when well-mixed. Previous work explained this puzzling phenomenon by invoking fitness tradeoffs, which can diminish an arms race dynamic. Here we propose that the regular loss of immunity by the bacterial host can also produce host-phage coexistence. We pair a general model of immunity with an experimental and theoretical case study of the CRISPR-Cas immune system to contrast the behavior of tradeoff and loss mechanisms in well-mixed systems. We find that, while both mechanisms can produce stable coexistence, only immune loss does so robustly within realistic parameter ranges.",

    "abstract": "Abstract.If protein sequences are recoded with a binary alphabet derived from a division of the 20 amino acids into two subsets, a protein can be identified from its subsequences by searching through a recoded sequence database. A binary-coded primary sequence can be obtained for an unbroken protein molecule from current blockades in a nanopore. Only two (instead of 20) blockade levels need to be recognized to identify a residues subset; a hard or soft detector can do this with two current thresholds. Computations were done on the complete proteome of Helicobacter pylori (http://www.uniprot.org; database id UP000000210, 1553 sequences) using a binary alphabet based on published data for residue volumes in the range [~]0.06 nm3 to [~]0.225 nm3. Assuming normally distributed volumes, more than 93% of binary subsequences of length 20 from the primary sequences of H. pylori are correct with a confidence level of 90-95%; they can uniquely identify over 98% of the proteins. Recently published work shows that a 0.7 nm diameter nanopore can measure residue volume with a resolution of [~]0.07 nm3; this makes the procedure described here both feasible and practical.

    "abstract": "Long-range alignment ordering of fibroblasts have been observed in the vicinity of cancerous tumors and can be recapitulated with in vitro experiments. However, the mechanisms driving their ordering are not understood. Here we show that local collision-driven nematic alignment interactions among fibroblasts are insufficient to explain observed long-range alignment. One possibility is that there exists another orientation field co-evolving with the cells and reinforcing their alignment. We propose that this field reflects the mechanical cross-talk between the fibroblasts and the underlying fibrous material on which they move. We demonstrate that this new long-range interaction can give rise to high nematic order and to the observed patterning of the cancer microenvironment.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLong-range alignment patterns of fibroblasts have been observed both in vivo and in vitro. However, there has not been much understanding of the underlying mechanism. In this work, we demonstrate that these patterns cannot be simply explained by their steric interaction with one another during collisions. Instead, we propose that fibroblasts may collectively align through non-local interactions arising from their modification of an underlying extracellular matrix. The proposed mechanism explains the observed co-alignment between fibroblasts and collagen fibers around tumors and can be be tested in future experiments that can image the dynamics of this pattern formation in vivo or in vitro",

However, it is unclear what proportion of transcriptional activity is reflecting such organisation, how much can be informed by RNA expression alone, and how this impacts disease. Here, we develop a transcriptional decomposition approach separating the proportion of expression associated with genome organisation from independent effects not directly related to genomic positioning.\\n\\nWe show that positionally attributable expression accounts for a considerable proportion of total levels and is highly informative of topological associating domain activities and organisation, revealing boundaries and chromatin compartments. Furthermore, expression data alone accurately predicts individual enhancer-promoter interactions, drawing features from expression strength, stabilities, insulation and distance. We further characterise commonalities and differences across predictions in 76 human cell types, observing extensive sharing of domains, yet highly cell-type specific enhancer-promoter interactions and strong enrichments in relevant trait-associated variants. Our work demonstrates a close relationship between transcription and chromatin architecture, presenting a novel strategy and an unprecedented resource for investigating regulatory organisations and interpretations of disease associated genetic variants across cell types.",

    "abstract": "Most infections by human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are  acute, that is non-persistent. Yet, for HPVs, as for many other oncoviruses, there is a striking gap between our detailed understanding of chronic infections and our limited data on the early stages of infection. Here we argue that studying HPV acute infections is necessary and timely. Focusing on early interactions will help explain why certain infections are cleared while others become chronic or latent. From a molecular perspective, descriptions of immune effectors and pro-inflammatory pathways during the initial stages of infections have the potential to lead to novel treatments or to improved handling algorithms. From a dynamical perspective, adopting concepts from spatial ecology, such as meta-populations or meta-communities, can help explain why HPV acute infections sometimes last for years. Furthermore, cervical cancer screening and vaccines impose novel iatrogenic pressures on HPVs, implying that anticipating any viral evolutionary response remain essential. Finally, hints at the associations between HPV acute infections and fertility deserve further investigation given their high worldwide prevalence. Overall, understanding asymptomatic and benign infections may be instrumental in reducing HPV virulence.",

    "abstract": "Background: Among the four bases, guanine is the most susceptible to damage from oxidative stress. Replication of DNA containing damaged guanines result in G to T mutations. Therefore, the mutations resulting from oxidative DNA damage are generally expected to predominantly consist of G to T (and C to A when the damaged guanine is not in the reference strand) and result in decreased GC content. However, the opposite pattern was reported 16 years ago in a study of prokaryotic genomes. Although that result has been widely cited and confirmed by nine later studies with similar methods, the omission of the effect of shared ancestry requires a re-examination of the reliability of the results.\\n\\nResults: We retrieved 70 aerobe-anaerobe pairs of prokaryotes, and members of each pair were adjacent on the phylogenetic tree. Pairwise comparisons of either whole-genome GC content or the GC content at 4-fold degenerate sites of orthologous genes among these 70 pairs did not show significant differences between aerobes and anaerobes. The signature of guanine oxidation on GC content evolution has not been detected even after extensive controlling of other influencing factors. Furthermore, the anaerobes were not different from the aerobes in the rate of either G to T, C to A, or other directions of substitutions. The presence of the enzymes responsible for guanine oxidation in anaerobic prokaryotes provided additional evidence that guanine oxidation might be prevalent in anaerobic prokaryotes. In either aerobes or anaerobes, the rates of G:C to T:A mutations were not significantly higher than the reverse mutations.\\n\\nConclusions: The previous counterintuitive results on the relationship between oxygen requirement and GC content should be attributed to the methodological artefact resulting from phylogenetically non-independence among the analysed samples. Our results showed that aerobiosis does not increase or decrease GC content in evolution. Furthermore, our study challenged the widespread belief that abundant G:C to T:A transversions are the signature of oxidative stress in prokaryotic evolution.",

    "abstract": "One approach to the reconstruction of infectious disease transmission trees from pathogen genomic data has been to use a phylogenetic tree, reconstructed from pathogen sequences, and annotate its internal nodes to provide a reconstruction of which host each lineage was in at each point in time. If only one pathogen lineage can be transmitted to a new host (i.e. the transmission bottleneck is complete), this corresponds to partitioning the nodes of the phylogeny into connected regions, each of which represents evolution in an individual host. These partitions define the possible transmission trees that are consistent with a given phylogenetic tree. However, the mathematical properties of the transmission trees given a phylogeny remain largely unexplored. Here, we describe a procedure to calculate the number of possible transmission trees for a given phylogeny, and we show how to uniformly sample from these transmission trees. The procedure is outlined for situations where one sample is available from each host and trees do not have branch lengths, and we also provide extensions for incomplete sampling, multiple sampling, and the application to time trees in a situation where limits on the period during which each host could have been infected are known. The sampling algorithm is available as an R package (STraTUS).",

    "abstract": "Decoding the spatial organizations of chromosomes has crucial implications for studying eukaryotic gene regulation. Recently, Chromosomal conformation capture based technologies, such as Hi-C, have been widely used to uncover the interaction frequencies of genomic loci in high-throughput and genome-wide manner and provide new insights into the folding of three-dimensional (3D) genome structure. In this paper, we develop a novel manifold learning framework, called GEM (Genomic organization reconstructor based on conformational Energy and Manifold learning), to elucidate the underlying 3D spatial organizations of chromosomes from Hi-C data. Unlike previous chromatin structure reconstruction methods, which explicitly assume specific relationships between Hi-C interaction frequencies and spatial distances between distal genomic loci, GEM is able to reconstruct an ensemble of chromatin conformations by directly embedding the neigh-boring affinities from Hi-C space into 3D Euclidean space based on a manifold learning strategy that considers both the fitness of Hi-C data and the biophysical feasibility of the modeled structures, which are measured by the conformational energy derived from our current biophysical knowledge about the 3D polymer model. Extensive validation tests on both simulated interaction frequency data and experimental Hi-C data of yeast and human demonstrated that GEM not only greatly outperformed other state-of-art modeling methods but also reconstructed accurate chromatin structures that agreed well with the hold-out or independent Hi-C data and sparse geometric restraints derived from the previous fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies. In addition, as GEM can generate accurate spatial organizations of chromosomes by integrating both experimentally-derived spatial contacts and conformational energy, we for the first time extended our modeling method to recover long-range genomic interactions that are missing from the original Hi-C data. All these results indicated that GEM can provide a physically and physiologically valid 3D representations of the organizations of chromosomes and thus serve as an effective and useful genome structure reconstructor.",

    "abstract": "The grand ambition of theorists studying ecology and evolution is to discover the logical and mathematical rules driving the worlds biodiversity at every level from genetic diversity within species to differences between populations, communities, and ecosystems. This ambition has been difficult to realize in great part because of the complexity of biodiversity. Theoretical work has led to a complex web of theories, each having non-obvious consequences for other theories. Case in point, the recent realization that genetic diversity involves a great deal of temporal and spatial stochasticity forces theoretical population genetics to consider abiotic and biotic factors generally reserved to ecosystem ecology. This interconnectedness may require theoretical scientists to adopt new techniques adapted to reason about large sets of theories. Mathematicians have solved this problem by using formal languages based on logic to manage theorems. However, theories in ecology and evolution are not mathematical theorems, they involve uncertainty. Recent work in Artificial Intelligence in bridging logic and probability theory offers the opportunity to build rich knowledge bases that combine logics ability to represent complex mathematical ideas with probability theorys ability to model uncertainty. We describe these hybrid languages and explore how they could be used to build a unified knowledge base of theories for ecology and evolution.\\n\\ncase study you explore using the Salix tritrophic system.",

    "abstract": "PA28{gamma} is a nuclear activator of the 20S proteasome involved in the regulation of several essential cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, nuclear dynamics and cellular stress response. Unlike the 19S regulator of the proteasome, which specifically recognizes ubiquitylated proteins, PA28{gamma} promotes the degradation of several substrates by the proteasome in an ATP- and ubiquitin-independent manner. However its exact mechanisms of action are unclear and likely to involve additional partners that remain to be identified. Here we report the identification of the first cofactor of PA28{gamma}, PIP30/FAM192A. PIP30 binds directly and specifically via its C-terminal end and in an interaction stabilized by casein kinase 2 phosphorylation to both free and 20S proteasome-associated PA28{gamma}. Its recruitment to proteasome-containing complexes depends on PA28{gamma} and its expression increases the association of PA28{gamma} with the 20S proteasome in cells. Further dissection of its possible roles shows that PIP30 alters PA28{gamma}-dependent activation of peptide degradation by the 20S proteasome in vitro and negatively controls in cells the presence of PA28{gamma} in Cajal Bodies by inhibition of its association with the key Cajal body component coilin. Altogether, our data show that PIP30 deeply affects PA28{gamma} interactions with cellular proteins, including 20S proteasome, demonstrating that it is an important regulator of PA28{gamma} in cells and thus a new player in the control of the multiple functions of the proteasome within the nucleus.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe 20S proteasome is a key actor of the control of protein levels and integrity in cells. To perform its multiple functions, it works with a series of regulators, among which a nuclear complex called PA28{gamma}. In particular, PA28{gamma} participates in the regulation of cell proliferation and nuclear dynamics. We describe here the characterization of a novel protein, PIP30/FAM192A, which binds tightly to PA28{gamma} and favors its interaction with the 20S proteasome while inhibiting its association with coilin, a central component of nuclear Cajal bodies. Thus PIP30/FAM192A critically controls the interactome and consequently the functions of PA28{gamma}, and appears to be a new player in the fine regulation of intracellular proteostasis in the cell nucleus.",

Here, we examine Drosophila Pericentrin-like- protein (PLP) function in vivo, in tissues that form both centrosomes and cilia. PLP mutant centrioles exhibit four major defects: (1) They are too short and have subtle structural defects; (2) They separate prematurely, and so overduplicate; (3) They organise fewer MTs during interphase; (4) They fail to establish and/or maintain a proper connection to the plasma membrane-- although, surprisingly, mutant centrioles can still form an axoneme and recruit transition zone (TZ) proteins. We show that PLP helps to form \\\" pericentriolar clouds\\\" of electron-dense material that emanate from the central cartwheel spokes and spread outward to surround the mother centriole.

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism leading to parent-of-origin dependent gene expression. So far, the precise number of imprinted genes in humans is uncertain. In this study, we leveraged genome-wide DNA methylation in whole blood measured longitudinally at 3 time points (birth, childhood and adolescence) and GWAS data in 740 Mother-Child duos from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to systematically identify imprinted loci. We reasoned that cis-meQTLs at genomic regions that were imprinted would show strong evidence of parent-of-origin associations with DNA methylation, enabling the detection of imprinted regions. Using this approach, we identified genome-wide significant cis-meQTLs that exhibited parent-of-origin effects (POEs) at 35 novel and 50 known imprinted regions (10-10< P <10-300). Among the novel loci, we observed signals near genes implicated in cardiovascular disease (PCSK9), and Alzheimers disease (CR1), amongst others. Most of the significant regions exhibited imprinting patterns consistent with uniparental expression, with the exception of twelve loci (including the IGF2, IGF1R, and IGF2R genes), where we observed a bipolar-dominance pattern. POEs were remarkably consistent across time points and were so strong at some loci that methylation levels enabled good discrimination of parental transmissions at these and surrounding genomic regions. The implication is that parental allelic transmissions could be modelled at many imprinted (and linked) loci and hence POEs detected in GWAS of unrelated individuals given a combination of genetic and methylation data. Our results indicate that modelling POEs on DNA methylation is effective to identify loci that may be affected by imprinting.",

To rectify these limitations, we developed a VR system (ratCAVE) that provides realistic and low-latency visual feedback directly to head movements of completely unrestrained rodents. Immersed in this VR system, rats displayed naturalistic behavior by spontaneously interacting with and hugging virtual walls, exploring virtual objects, and avoiding virtual cliffs. We further illustrate the effect of ratCAVE-VR manipulation on hippocampal place fields.

    "abstract": "Insecticides allow control of agricultural pests and disease vectors and are vital for global food security and health. The evolution of resistance to insecticides, such as organophosphates (OPs), is a serious and growing concern. OP resistance often involves sequestration or hydrolysis of OPs by carboxylesterases. Inhibiting carboxylesterases could therefore restore the effectiveness of OPs for which resistance has evolved. Here, we use covalent computational design to produce nano/pico-molar boronic acid inhibitors of the carboxylesterase E7 from the agricultural pest Lucilia cuprina, as well as a common Gly137Asp E7 mutant that confers OP resistance. These inhibitors, with high selectivity against human acetylcholinesterase, and low to no toxicity in human cells and mice, act synergistically with the OPs diazinon and malathion to reduce the amount of OP required to kill L. cuprina by up to 16-fold, and abolish resistance. The compounds exhibit broad utility in significantly potentiating another OP, chlorpyrifos against the common pest, the peach-potato aphid (Myzus persicae). These compounds represent a solution to OP resistance as well as to environmental concerns regarding overuse of OPs, allowing significant reduction of use without compromising efficacy.",

Drawing sound inferences from such experiments relies on appropriate mathematical methods to model the distribution of reads along the genome, which has been challenging due to the scale and nature of these data.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a new framework (SRSFseq) based on Square Root Slope Functions shape analysis to analyse Illumina sequencing data. In the new approach the basic unit of information is the density of mapped reads over region of interest located on the known reference genome. The densities are interpreted as shapes and a new shape analysis model is proposed. An equivalent of a Fisher test is used to quantify the significance of shape differences in read distribution patterns between groups of density functions in different experimental conditions. We evaluated the performance of this new framework to analyze RNA-seq data at the exon level, which enabled the detection of variation in read distributions and abundances between experimental conditions not detected by other methods. Thus, the method is a suitable supplement to the state of the are count based techniques. The variety of density representations and flexibility of mathematical design allow the model to be easily adapted to other data types or problems in which the distribution of reads is to be tested. The functional interpretation and SRSF phase-amplitude separation technique gives an efficient noise reduction procedure improving the sensitivity and specificity of the method.",

    "abstract": "It is believed that eukaryotes arise from prokaryotes, which means that organelles can form in the latter. Such events, however, had not been observed previously. Here, we report the biogenesis of organelles in the endosymbiotic cyanobacterium TDX16 that escaped from its senescent/necrotic host cell of green alga Haematococcus pluvialis. In brief, organelle biogenesis in TDX16 initiated with cytoplasm compartmentalization, followed by de-compartmentalization, DNA allocation, and re-compartmentalization, as such two composite organelles-the primitive chloroplast and primitive nucleus sequestering minor and major fractions of cellular DNA respectively were formed. Thereafter, the eukaryotic cytoplasmic matrix was built up from the matrix extruded from the primitive nucleus; mitochondria were assembled in and segregated from the primitive chloroplast, whereby the primitive nucleus and primitive chloroplast matured into nucleus and chloroplast respectively; while most mitochondria turned into double-membraned vacuoles after matrix degradation. Results of pigment analyses, 16S rRNA and genome sequencing revealed that TDX16 is a phycocyanin-containing cyanobacterium resembling Chroococcidiopsis thermalis, which had acquired 9,017,401bp DNAs with 10301 genes form its host. Therefore, organelle biogenesis in TDX16 was achieved by hybridizing the acquired eukaryotic DNAs with its own ones and expressing the hybrid genome.\\n\\nOrganelle biogenesis in TDX16 results in its transition into a new eukaryotic alga TDX16-DE, which provides a reference to re-understand the development, structure, function and association of organelles in eukaryotes and the reasons behind them, and has implications on other sections of biology, particularly cancer biology and evolutionary biology: (1) the formation and maturation of the small organelle-less nascent cancer cells share striking similarities with TDX16 development and transition, so, it is most likely that cancer cells arise from bacteria; (2) organelle biogenesis in TDX16 uncovers a way of new organelle and new single-celled eukaryote formation, and in light of which, the ancestral organelles were likely formed in rather than transformed form the endosymbiotic prokaryotes that had acquired their hosts DNAs.",

    "abstract": "Endocrine disrupting chemicals are a threat to natural fish populations in the aquatic environment. Their toxicity is usually discussed relative to concentrations in the water the fish are exposed to. In the case of the synthetic compound 17-alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), a common and persistent estrogen, concentrations around 1 ng/L have repeatedly been found to induce toxic effects in fish. Here, we used brown trout (Salmo trutta) from a natural population to study EE2 take up and how it affects early life-history. We collected adults during the spawning season, produced 730 families in vitro (to control for potential maternal and paternal effects on embryo stress tolerance), and singly raised 7,300 embryos (in a 2 mL static system) that were either exposed to one dose of EE2 at 1 ng/L (i.e., 2 pg/embryo) or sham-treated. We found that EE2 concentration did not significantly change over a period of 3 months in control containers without embryos. Embryos took up most of the 2 pg EE2 within about 4 weeks at 4.6{degrees}C. EE2 treated embryos experienced higher mortality, delayed hatching of the survivors, and had reduced size at hatching. Our findings suggest that the toxicity of EE2 is often underestimated when discussed at the level of concentrations in water only.",

    "abstract": "The brown macroalgae of the genus Cystoseira are important habitat forming species along the rocky coasts all over the Mediterranean Sea. However, their decline at basin and local scale has been documented in many studies. We have characterized malacofauna associated with Cystoseira amentacea, C. compressa and C. crinita along the coasts of Ischia Island (Gulf of Naples). Samples were collected by snorkeling in the infralittoral belt. The surface within 20 x 20 cm frames was scraped off and collected in three replicates each sites. The diversity and structure of community were described by number of species, the exponential Shannon and the reciprocal Simpsons indexes of diversity. The patterns of diversity at spatial scale were assessed by alpha, beta and gamma diversity. A total of 53 species of molluscs were identified in those associations. Gastropoda were the most species-rich class followed by Bivalvia and Polyplacophora. Bivalves were dominant in terms of number of individuals because of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. The species M. galloprovincialis was the most frequent and top dominant one inhabiting Cystoseira associations along the coasts of Ischia Island (96.6 % of the total abundance). Most of the identified molluscs species belonged to two feeding guilds: micrograzers and filter feeders (29 and 13 species respectively). Only juveniles were found providing the importance of Cystoseira associations as nursery for molluscs recruitment. Differences in composition and structure of molluscs assemblages were found within the three algal associations and seem to correspond both to different morphology and habitat in which these algal species live.",

    "abstract": "Most tropical bird species have narrow elevational ranges, likely reflecting climatic specialization. This is consistent with Janzens Rule, the tendency for mountain passes to be effectively  higher in the tropics. Hence, those few tropical species that occur across broad elevational gradients raise questions. Are they being sundered by diversifying selection along the gradient? Does elevational movement cause them to resist diversification or specialization? Have they recently expanded, suggesting that elevational generalism is short-lived in geological time? Here we tested for differentiation, movement, and expansion in four elevational generalist songbird species on the Andean west slope. We used morphology and mtDNA to test for genetic differentiation between high- and low-elevation populations. Morphology differed for House Wren (Troglodytes aedon) and Hooded Siskin (Spinus magellanicus), but not for Cinereous Conebill (Conirostrum cinereum) and Rufous-collared Sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), respectively. mtDNA was structured by elevation only in Z. capensis. To test for elevational movements, we measured hydrogen isotope ({delta}2H) values of metabolically inert feathers and metabolically active liver. {delta}2H data indicated elevational movements by two tree- and shrub-foraging species with moderate-to-high vagility (C. cinereum and S. magellanicus), and sedentary behavior by two terrestrial-foraging species with low-to-moderate vagility (T. aedon and Z. capensis). In S. magellanicus, elevational movements and lack of mtDNA structure contrast with striking morphological divergence, suggesting strong diversifying selection on body proportions across the [~]50 km gradient. All species except C. cinereum exhibited mtDNA-haplotype variation consistent with recent population expansion across the elevational gradient.In sum,three out of four elevational generalist species underwent genetic divergence despite gene flow, two of four make seasonal elevational movements, and three of four have recently expanded. In different ways, each species defies the tendency for tropical birds to have long-term stable distributions and sedentary habits. We conclude that tropical elevational generalism is rare due to evolutionary instability.",

Canonical CRC somatic gene mutations with high prevalence (>10%) have been verified, including TP53, APC, KRAS, SMAD4, FBXW7 and PIK3CA. PEG3 is identified as a novel frequently mutated gene (10.6%). APC and Wnt signaling exhibit significantly lower mutation frequencies than those in TCGA data.

APC gene and Wnt signaling are considered as the key molecule and pathway for colorectal cancer initiation, and these findings greatly undermine their importance in tumor progression for Chinese patients.

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause persistant and life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. Carbapenems are the first-line agents to treat P. aeruginosa infections; therefore, the emergence of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains has greatly challenged effective antibiotic therapy. In this study, we characterised the full-length genomes of two carbapenem resistant P. aeruginosa clinical isolates that produce the carbapebemase New Delhi metallo-{beta}-lactamase-1 (NDM-1). We found that the blaNDM-1 gene is encoded by a novel intergrative and conjugative element (ICE) ICETn43716385, which also carries the macrolide resistance gene msr(E) and the florfenicol resistance gene floR. The msr(E) gene has rarely been described in P. aeruginosa genomes. To investigate the functional roles of msr(E) in P. aeruginosa, we exogeneously expressed this gene in P. aeruginosa laboratory strains and found that the acquisition of msr(E) could abolish the azithromycin-mediated quorum sensing inhibition in vitro and the anti-Pseudomonas effect of azithromycin in vivo. In addition, the expression of msr(E) almost completely restored the azithromycin-affected P. aeruginosa transcriptome, as shown by our RNA sequencing analysis. We present the first evidence of blaNDM-1 to be carried by intergrative and conjugative elements, and the first evidence of co-transfer of carbapenem resistance and the resistance to macrolide-mediated quorum sensing inhibition into P. aeruginosa genomes.\\n\\nImportanceCarbapenem resistant P. aeruginosa has recently been listed as the top three most dangerous superbugs by World Health Organisation. The transmission of blaNDM-1 gene into P. aeruginosa can cause extreme resistance to carbapenems and fourth generation cephalosporins, which greatly compromises the effectiveness of these antibiotics against Pseudomonas infections. However, the lack of complete genome sequence of NDM-1-producing P. aeruginosa has limited our understanding of the transmisibility of blaNDM-1 in this organism. Here we showed the co-transfer of blaNDM-1 and msr(E) into P. aeruginosa genome by a novel integrative and conjugative element (ICE). The acquisition of these two genes confers P. aeruginosa with resistance to carbapenem and macrolide-mediated quorum sensing inhibition, both of which are important treatment stretagies for P. aeruginosa infections. Our findings highlight the potential of ICEs in transmitting carbapenem resistance, and that the anti-virulence treatment of P. aeruginosa infections by macrolides can be challenged by horizontal gene transfer.",

We examined how Zea mays leaf microbial community structure changed with plant age. Ribosomal spacer length (ARISA) and scanning electron microscopic (size trait) imaging strategies were used to assess microbial community composition across maize plant ages, using a novel staggered experimental design. Significant changes in community composition were observed for both molecular and imaging analyses, and the two analysis methods provided complementary information about bacterial community structure within each leaf developmental stage.

    "abstract": "Delineating species and epidemic lineages in fungal plant pathogens is critical to our understanding of disease emergence and the structure of fungal biodiversity, and also informs international regulatory decisions. Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae) is a multi-host pathogen that infects multiple grasses and cereals, is responsible for the most damaging rice disease (rice blast), and of growing concern due to the recent introduction of wheat blast to Bangladesh from South America. However, the genetic structure and evolutionary history of M. oryzae, including the possible existence of cryptic phylogenetic species, remain poorly defined. Here, we use whole-genome sequence information for 76 M. oryzae isolates sampled from 12 grass and cereal genera to infer the population structure of M. oryzae, and to reassess the species status of wheat-infecting populations of the fungus. Species recognition based on genealogical concordance, using published data or extracting previously-used loci from genome assemblies, failed to confirm a prior assignment of wheat blast isolates to a new species (Pyricularia graminis tritici). Inference of population subdivisions revealed multiple divergent lineages within M. oryzae, each preferentially associated with one host genus, suggesting incipient speciation following host shift or host range expansion. Analyses of gene flow, taking into account the possibility of incomplete lineage sorting, revealed that genetic exchanges have contributed to the makeup of multiple lineages within M. oryzae. These findings provide greater understanding of the eco-evolutionary factors that underlie the diversification of M. oryzae and highlight the practicality of genomic data for epidemiological surveillance in this important multi-host pathogen.\\n\\nImportanceInfection of novel hosts is a major route for disease emergence by pathogenic micro-organisms. Understanding the evolutionary history of multi-host pathogens is therefore important to better predict the likely spread and emergence of new diseases. Magnaporthe oryzae is a multi-host fungus that causes serious cereal diseases, including the devastating rice blast disease, and wheat blast, a cause of growing concern due to its recent spread from South America to Asia. Using whole genome analysis of 76 fungal strains from different hosts, we have documented the divergence of M. oryzae into numerous lineages, each infecting a limited number of host species. Our analyses provide evidence that inter-lineage gene flow has contributed to the genetic makeup of multiple M. oryzae lineages within the same species. Plant health surveillance is therefore warranted to safeguard against disease emergence in regions where multiple lineages of the fungus are in contact with one another.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal brain resting-state functional connectivity has been consistently observed in patients affected by Schizophrenia (SCZ) using functional MRI and other neuroimaging methods. Graph theoretical methods provide a framework to investigate these defective functional interactions and their effects on the modular organization of brain connectivity networks. A few studies have shown abnormal distribution of connectivity within and between functional modules, an indication of imbalanced functional segregation ad integration in SCZ patients. However, no major alterations in the modular structure of functional connectivity networks in patients have been reported, and unambiguous identification of the neural substrates involved remains elusive. Recently, it has been demonstrated that current modularity analysis methods suffer from a fundamental and severe resolution limit, as they fail to detect features that are smaller than a scale determined by the size of the entire connectivity network. This resolution limit is likely to have hampered the ability to resolve differences between patients and controls in previous cross-sectional studies. Here, we apply a novel, resolution limit-free approach to study the modular organization of resting state functional connectivity networks in a large cohort of SCZ patients, and in matched healthy controls. Leveraging these important methodological advances, we find new evidence of substantial fragmentation and reorganization involving primary sensory, auditory and visual areas in SCZ patients. Conversely, frontal and prefrontal areas, typically associated with higher cognitive functions, appear to be largely unaffected, with changes selectively involving language and speech processing areas. Our findings provide support to the hypothesis that cognitive dysfunction in SCZ may arise from deficits occurring already at early stages of sensory processing.",

    "abstract": "Symptoms of schizophrenia may arise from a failure of cortical circuits to filter-out irrelevant inputs. Schizophrenia has also been linked to disruptions to cortical inhibitory interneurons, consistent with the possibility that in the normally functioning brain, these cells are in some part responsible for determining which inputs are relevant and which irrelevant. Here, we develop an abstract but biologically plausible neural network model that demonstrates how the cortex may learn to ignore irrelevant inputs through plasticity processes affecting inhibition. The model is based on the proposal that the amount of excitatory output from a cortical circuit encodes expected magnitude of reward or punishment (\\\"relevance\\\"), which can be trained using a temporal difference learning mechanism acting on feed-forward inputs to inhibitory interneurons. The model exhibits learned irrelevance and blocking, which become impaired following disruptions to inhibitory units. When excitatory units are connected to a competitive-learning output layer, the relevance code is capable of modulating learning and activity. Accordingly, the combined network is capable of recapitulating published experimental data linking inhibition in frontal cortex with fear learning and expression. Finally, the model demonstrates how relevance learning can take place in parallel with other types of learning, through plasticity rules involving inhibitory and excitatory components respectively. Altogether, this work offers a theory of how the cortex learns to selectively inhibit inputs, providing insight into how relevance-assignment problems may emerge in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Mendelian randomization is the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of risk factors on outcomes. The total causal effect of a risk factor is the change in the outcome resulting from intervening on the risk factor. This total causal effect may potentially encompass multiple mediating mechanisms. For a proposed mediator, the direct effect of the risk factor is the change in the outcome resulting from a change in the risk factor keeping the mediator constant. A difference between the total effect and the direct effect indicates that the causal pathway from the risk factor to the outcome acts at least in part via the mediator (an indirect effect). Here, we show that Mendelian randomization estimates of total and direct effects can be obtained using summarized data on genetic associations with the risk factor, mediator, and outcome, potentially from different data sources. We perform simulations to test the validity of this approach when there is unmeasured confounding and/or bidirectional effects between the risk factor and mediator. We illustrate this method using the relationship between age at menarche and risk of breast cancer, with body mass index (BMI) as a potential mediator. We show an inverse direct causal effect of age at menarche on risk of breast cancer (independent of BMI) and a positive indirect effect via BMI. In conclusion, multivariable Mendelian randomization using summarized genetic data provides a rapid and accessible analytic strategy that can be undertaken using publicly-available data to better understand causal mechanisms.",

Sequence evolution follows an hourglass model, but the evolution of phyletic age and of duplicability follow an early conservation model. Further analyses indicate that stronger purifying selection on sequences in the middle development are driven by temporal pleiotropy of these genes. In addition, we report evidence that expression in late development is enriched with retrogenes, which usually lack efficient regulatory elements. This implies that expression in late development could facilitate transcription of new genes, and provide opportunities for acquisition of function. Finally, in C. elegans, we suggest that dosage imbalance could be one of the main factors that cause depleted expression of high duplicability genes in early development.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized gene editing both on single genes and in multiplexed loss-of-function screens, enabling precise genome-scale identification of genes essential to proliferation and survival of cancer cells. However, previous studies reported that an anti-proliferative effect of Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage confounds such measurement of genetic dependency, particularly in the setting of copy number gain1-4. We performed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screens on 342 cancer cell lines and found that this effect is common to all lines, leading to false positive results when targeting genes in copy number amplified regions. We developed CERES, a computational method to estimate gene dependency levels from CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screens while accounting for the copy-number-specific effect, as well as variable sgRNA activity. We applied CERES to sets of screens performed with different sgRNA libraries and found that it reduces false positive results and provides meaningful estimates of sgRNA activity. As a result, the application of CERES improves confidence in the interpretation of genetic dependency data from CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screens of cancer cell lines.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe protean chemical properties of mercury have long made it attractive for diverse applications, but its toxicity requires great care in its use, disposal, and recycling. Mercury occurs in multiple chemical forms, and the molecular basis for the distinct toxicity of its various forms is only partly understood. Global transcriptomics applied over time can reveal how a cell recognizes a toxicant and what cellular subsystems it marshals to repair and recover from the damage. The longitudinal effects on the transcriptome of exponential phase E. coli were compared during sub-acute exposure to mercuric chloride (HgCl2) or to phenylmercuric acetate (PMA) using RNA-Seq.\\n\\nResultsDifferential gene expression revealed common and distinct responses to the mercurials throughout recovery. Cultures exhibited growth stasis immediately after each mercurial exposure but returned to normal growth more quickly after PMA exposure than after HgCl2 exposure. Correspondingly, PMA rapidly elicited up-regulation of a large number of genes which continued for 30 min, whereas fewer genes were up-regulated early after HgCl2 exposure only some of which overlapped with PMA up-regulated genes. By 60 min gene expression in PMA-exposed cells was almost indistinguishable from unexposed cells, but HgCl2 exposed cells still had many differentially expressed genes. Relative expression of energy production and most metabolite uptake pathways declined with both compounds, but nearly all stress response systems were up-regulated by one or the other mercurial during recovery.\\n\\nConclusionsSub-acute exposure influenced expression of ~45% of all genes with many distinct responses for each compound, reflecting differential biochemical damage by each mercurial and the corresponding resources available for repair. This study is the first global, high-resolution view of the transcriptional responses to any common toxicant in a prokaryotic model system from exposure to recovery of active growth. The responses provoked by these two mercurials in this model bacterium also provide insights about how higher organisms may respond to these ubiquitous metal toxicants.",

    "abstract": "Acute flaccid myelitis /acute flaccid paralysis (AFM/AFP) is a rare but serious illness of the nervous system, specifically affecting the grey matter of the spinal cord, motor controlling regions of the brain and the cranial nerve. Most cases of AFM/AFP are pathogen associated, typically with poliovirus and enterovirus infections, and occur in children under the age of 6 years old. Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was first isolated from children with pneumonia in 1962, but an association with AFM/AFP was not observed until the 2014 outbreak. Organotypic mouse brain slice cultures generated from postnatal day 1 to 10 mice were used to determine if neurotropism of EV-D68 is shared among virus isolates. Six of the seven EV-D68 isolates examined, including two from 1962 and four from the 2014 outbreak, replicated in neurons, and all replicated in astrocytes. Furthermore, a putative viral receptor, sialic acid, is not required for neurotropism of EV-D68, as both sialic acid dependent and independent viruses replicated within neurons. These observations demonstrate that EV-D68 is neurotropic independent of its genetic lineage, can infect both neurons and astrocytes, and that neurotropism is not a recently acquired characteristic as has been suggested.\\n\\nSignificanceRecently there has been an increase in the number of children infected with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). Most infections are associated with mild flu-like symptoms, but neurological dysfunction may develop in a small number of children. How the biochemical and genetic differences among EV-D68 isolates relates to development of neurological disease remains an unanswered question. Assessing infection of multiple viral isolates in organotypic brain slice cultures from postnatal day 1 to 10 mice revealed that multiple isolates are neurotropic. Both neuraminidase sensitive and resistant viruses infected neurons, indicating that sialic acid binding does not play a role in EV-D68 neuropathogenesis. Establishment of a genetically and pharmacologically amenable system using organotypic brain slice cultures will provide insight into how EV-D68 neuropathologies develop.",

    "abstract": "The timescales of the dynamics of a system depend on the combination of the timescales of its components and of its transmission delays. Parkinsons disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons and the emergence of strong {beta}-band (15-35Hz) oscillations throughout the basal ganglia nuclei. Here we combine experimental stimulation data from ten studies, that reveal the timing of excitatory and inhibitory events in the basal ganglia circuit, to estimate its set of transmission delays. In doing so, we reveal possible inconsistencies in the existing data, calling for replications, and we propose two possible sets of transmission delays.\n\nWe then integrate these delays in a model of the primate basal ganglia, that does not rely on direct and indirect pathways segregation, and show that, while much attention has been given to the role of the striatal dopaminergic receptors in Parkinsons disease symptoms, extrastriatal dopaminergic depletion in the external part of the globus pallidus and in the subthalamic nucleus is sufficient to generate {beta}-band oscillations in the high part of the band. More specifically, we show that that D2 and D5 dopamine receptors in these nuclei play opposing roles in the emergence of {beta}-band oscillations, thereby explaining how completely deactivating D5 receptors in the subthalamic nucleus can, paradoxically, cancel oscillations.",

    "abstract": "Socio-affective touch communication conveys a vast amount of information about emotions and intentions in social contexts. In spite of the complexity of the socio-affective touch expressions we use daily, previous studies addressed only a few aspects of social touch mainly focusing on hedonics, such as stroking, leaving a wide range of social touch behaviour unexplored. To overcome this limit, we present the Socio-Affective Touch Expression Database (SATED), which includes a large range of dynamic interpersonal socio-affective touch events varying in valence and arousal. The original database contained 26 different social touch expressions each performed by three actor pairs. To validate each touch expression, we conducted two behavioural experiments investigating perceived naturalness and affective values. Based on the rated naturalness, 13 socio-affective touch expressions along with 12 corresponding non-social touch events were selected as a complete set, achieving 75 video clips in total. Moreover, we quantified motion energy for each touch expression to investigate its intrinsic correlations with perceived affective values and its similarity among actor-and action-pairs. As a result, the touch expression database is not only systematically defined and well-controlled, but also spontaneous and natural, while eliciting clear affective responses. This database will allow a fine-grained investigation of complex interpersonal socio-affective touch in the realm of social psychology and neuroscience along with potential application areas in affective computing and neighbouring fields.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater ecosystems are a major source of methane (CH4), contributing 0.65 Pg (in CO2 equivalents) yr-1 towards global carbon (C) emissions and thereby offsetting [~]25% of the terrestrial carbon sink. Most CH4 emissions come from littoral sediments, where large quantities of plant material are decomposed. As climate change is predicted to shift plant community composition, and thus change the quality of inputs into detrital food webs, this can affect CH4 production and have far-reaching consequences for global C emissions. Here we find that variation in polyphenol availability from decomposing organic matter underlies large differences in CH4 production in lake sediments. Production was at least 400-times higher from sediments composed of macrophyte litter compared to terrestrial sources (coniferous and deciduous), which we link to the inhibition of methanogenesis by polyphenol leachates. Applying our estimates to projected northward advances in the distribution of Typha latifolia, a widespread and dominant macrophyte, we find that CH4 production could increase by at least 73% in the lake-rich Boreal Shield ecozone solely due to increases in this one macrophyte species. Our results now suggest that earth system models and carbon budgets should consider the effects of plant communities on sediment chemistry and ultimately CH4 emissions at a global scale.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryProduction of methane from lakes is at least 400-times lower when 24 sediments receive forest- as opposed to macrophyte-derived (Typha latifolia) litterfall.",

Here we have tested Darwins \\\"selection opportunity\\\" hypothesis, according to which high evolutionary divergence in late development is due to strong positive selection. We contrasted it to a \\\"developmental constraint\\\" hypothesis, according to which late development is under relaxed negative selection. Indeed, the highest divergence between species, both at the morphological and molecular levels, is observed late in embryogenesis and post-embryonically. To distinguish between adaptation and relaxation hypotheses, we investigated the evidence of positive selection on protein-coding genes in relation to their expression over development, in fly Drosohila melanogaster, zebrafish Danio rerio, and mouse Mus musculus. First, we found that genes specifically expressed in late development have stronger signals of positive selection. Second, over the full transcriptome, genes with evidence for positive selection trend to be expressed in late development. Finally, genes involved in pathways with cumulative evidence of positive selection have higher expression in late development. Overall, there is a consistent signal that positive selection mainly affects genes and pathways expressed in late embryonic development and in adult. Our results imply that the evolution of embryogenesis is mostly conservative, with most adaptive evolution affecting some stages of post-embryonic gene expression, and thus post-embryonic phenotypes. This is consistent with the diversity of environmental challenges to which juveniles and adults are exposed.",

    "abstract": "Diverging semi-isolated lineages either meet in narrow clinal hybrid zones, or have a mosaic distribution associated with environmental variation. Intrinsic reproductive isolation is often emphasized in the former and local adaptation in the latter, although both can contribute to isolation. Rarely these two patterns of spatial distribution are reported in the same study system. Here we report that the long-snouted seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus is subdivided into discrete panmictic entities by both types of hybrid zones. Along the European Atlantic coasts, a northern and a southern lineage meet in the southwest of France where they coexist in sympatry with little hybridization. In the Mediterranean Sea, two lineages have a mosaic distribution, associated with lagoon-like and marine habitats. A fifth lineage was identified in the Black Sea. Genetic homogeneity over large spatial scales contrasts with isolation maintained in sympatry or close parapatry at a fine scale. A high variation in locus-specific introgression rates provides additional evidence that partial reproductive isolation must be maintaining the divergence. Surprisingly, fixed differences between lagoon and marine populations in the Mediterranean Sea belong to the most differentiated SNPs between the two Atlantic lineages, against the genome-wide pattern of structure. These parallel outlier SNPs cluster on a single chromosome-wide island of differentiation. Since Atlantic lineages do not match the lagoon-sea habitat variation, genetic parallelism at the genomic island suggests a shared genetic barrier contributes to reproductive isolation in contrasting contexts -i.e. spatial vs. ecological. We discuss how a genomic hotspot of parallel differentiation could have evolved and become associated either with space or with a patchy environment in a single study system.",

    "abstract": "Significance statementFunctional topography is present throughout the cerebral cortex, often in the form of columns or clusters of neurons with similar functional properties within identified cortical regions. Most of the evidence for these structures comes from work with non-human species. Using high-field strength magnetic resonance imaging in living human cortex, the search for this structure is frustrated by the presence of a background of local spatial correlations in the signal across the cortical surface. This structured background, which we term  neural dust, is a form of noise that imposes a fundamental limit on the detection of clustering and topography. We apply a novel analysis approach that quantifies the background of spatial correlations, so that we achieve reliable identification of high-signal clusters of activation in the human cortex at a scale previously only visible with invasive optical imaging in animals. We searched specifically in visual cortex for correlates of binocular stereoscopic depth. We show both that signals for stereoscopic depth are clustered into specific zones within the cortex and that these signals occur within spatially extended cortical domains, which have similar preferences for the stereoscopic depth. The revealed structures are reliably identified in all subjects tested and in repeated testing of individual subjects. Our methods provide an objective approach for defining the size and locations of clusters of activation within functional images of neural activity.\\n\\nAbstractA characteristic principle of the organization of cerebral neocortex is the presence of clusters or columns of neurons with similar functional properties. Animals with forward-facing eyes exploit slight differences between the images in the two eyes to determine binocular depth using stereopsis. Evidence for an organized structure in human visual cortex for the representation of stereoscopic depth has proved elusive. Using 7-tesla functional MRI, with gradient-echo echo-planar imaging at 0.75 mm isotropic resolution and a novel analytical approach based on geospatial mapping methods, we find that clustered responses for disparity-defined depth can be clearly segregated from a background of spatially correlated signals in all subjects tested. High-signal clusters are associated with cortical domains as large as 12-15mm across the cortical surface, in which nearby points in the cortical map tend to respond to the same stereoscopic depth. These domains are found predominantly within visual cortical area V3A.",

The role of hippocampal epigenomic changes with aging in these processes is unknown as no genome-wide analyses of age-related methylation changes have considered the factor of sex in a controlled animal model. High-depth, genome-wide bisulfite sequencing of young (3 month) and old (24 month) male and female mouse hippocampus revealed that while total genomic methylation amounts did not change with aging, specific sites in CG and non-CG (CH) contexts demonstrated age-related increases or decreases in methylation that were predominantly sexually divergent. Differential methylation with age for both CG and CH sites was enriched in intergenic, and intronic regions and under-represented in promoters, CG islands and specific enhancer regions in both sexes suggesting that certain genomic elements are especially labile with aging, even if the exact genomic loci altered are predominantly sex-specific. Life-long sex differences in autosomal methylation at CG and CH sites were also observed. The lack of genome-wide hypomethylation, sexually divergent aging response, and autosomal sex differences at CG sites were confirmed in human data. These data reveal sex as a previously unappreciated central factor of hippocampal epigenomic changes with aging. In total, these data demonstrate an intricate regulation of DNA methylation with aging by sex, cytosine context, genomic location, and methylation level.",

    "abstract": "The association between cigarette use and Parkinsons disease (PD) has been well known in the literature since more than 50 years ago. Large population studies showed that smokers developed PD less often than non-smokers and that the duration of smoking was inversely proportional to PD risk. There are two primary hypotheses for this association in the literature. First, long-standing hypothesis, is that smoking cigarettes is neuroprotective. The second, recent hypothesis, is that there exists biological predisposition to PD, which also manifests in decreased stimulus seeking behavior, hence lesser likelihood to smoke or use nicotine (reverse causation). The objective of this article is to summarize the evidence available in the literature and evaluate the causality of the association between Parkinsons disease and smoking cigarettes or nicotine ingestion. It is found that the first, directly causal hypothesis is a stronger contributor to the effect, although the reversely causal mechanism could play a role. It is found that smokeless tobacco use decreases the risk of PD stronger than smoking cigarettes does, suggesting that nicotine is more important in neuroprotection than other cigarette smoke constituents.",

The relative risks for RSV-related hospitalization associated with a prior diagnosis of asthma in age groups under 5y ranged between 3.1(2.1,4.7) (age <1y) to 6.7(4.2,11.8) (age 2y); the corresponding risks for influenza-related hospitalization ranged from 2.8(2.1,4) (age <1y) to 4.9(3.8,6.4) (age 3y).\n\nConclusionsRSV-associated hospitalization rates in young children are high and decline rapidly with age. Young children with an asthma diagnosis should be target groups for RSV and influenza-related mitigation efforts, possibly including RSV prophylaxis for the youngest children.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDiabetes prevalence is already high in middle income countries, particularly among older people. Current evidence on diabetes as a risk factor for dementia is limited to cohort studies in high income countries. Few studies carried out fasting glucose assessments to identify undiagnosed cases, and assess diabetes control. We aimed to determine the association between both diagnosed diabetes and total diabetes (including undiagnosed cases) and incident dementia, examining also the impact of glycaemic control on dementia risk.\\n\\nMethodsPopulation-based cohort studies of those aged 65 years and over in sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Peru, Venezuela, and Mexico. Diagnosed diabetes was assessed through self-reported diagnosis, and undiagnosed diabetes through fasting blood samples (glucose >= 7mmol/L). Blood pressure, smoking, underactivity and waist circumference were assessed from questionnaires and physical examination. Incident 10/66 dementia (and subtypes), and mortality, were ascertained three to five years later.\\n\\nResults12,297 interviews were completed at baseline, with 80-95% responding by site. The  at risk cohort comprised 10,945 dementia-free individuals, of whom 8,171 (75%) provided blood samples. Mean age varied from 72.0 to 75.1 years by site. Total diabetes prevalence was 43.5% in Puerto Rico, ranging from 11.5% to 27.0% in other sites. Most diabetes cases (50.2% to 68.4%) were not controlled (fasting glucose >7.0 mmol/L). 7,000 participants were followed up for 26,423 person-years with 659 incident dementia cases, and 905 dementia free deaths. Total diabetes was associated with incident 10/66 dementia (pooled meta-analysed adjusted sub-hazard ratio [pASHR] 1.25, 95% CI, 1.05-1.49, I2=48.6%), with a stronger association for uncontrolled (pASHR 1.47, 95% CI 1.19-1.81, I2=49.6%) than controlled cases (pASHR 1.29, 95% CI 0.95-1.74, I2=13.3%). Total diabetes was strongly associated with the incidence of vascular dementia (pASHR 2.25, 95% CI 1.24-4.08, I2=23.7%), but not Alzheimers Disease (pASHR 0.99, 95% CI 0.70-1.42, I2=49.0%).\\n\\nConclusionsDiabetes, particularly when poorly controlled, may increase dementia risk. There is considerable scope for improved detection and control of diabetes among older people in these settings, and hence an opportunity to carry out proof of concept prevention trials. Overlapping epidemics of these age dependent disorders will challenge poorly-resourced health systems in the future.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology has created oscillators, latches, logic gates, logarithmically linear circuits, and load drivers that have electronic analogs in living cells. The ubiquitous operational amplifier, which allows circuits to operate robustly and precisely has not been built with bio-molecular parts. As in electronics, a biological operational-amplifier could greatly improve the predictability of circuits despite noise and variability, a problem that all cellular circuits face. Here, we show how to create a synthetic 3-stage inducer-input operational amplifier with a differential transcription-factor stage, a CRISPR-based push-pull stage, and an enzymatic output stage with just 5 proteins including dCas9. Our  Bio-OpAmp expands the toolkit of fundamental circuits available to bioengineers or biologists, and may shed insight into biological systems that require robust and precise molecular homeostasis and regulation.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryA synthetic bio-molecular operational amplifier that can enable robust, precise, and programmable homeostasis and regulation in living cells with just 5 protein parts is described.",

Recombinant lentiviral particles were produced by co-transfection of pMD2.G, psPAX2 and pGFP-C-shLenti plasmid in 293T packaging cells. Calu-6 cells were transduced by recombinant lentiviruses using polybrene.
