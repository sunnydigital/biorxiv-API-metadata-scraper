    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) can be developed by computational approaches that infer regulator-target gene interactions from transcriptional assays. Successful algorithms that generate predictive, accurate TRNs enable the identification of regulator-target relationships in conditions where experimentally determining regulatory interactions is a challenge. Improving the ability of TRNs to successfully predict known regulator-target relationships in model species will enhance confidence in applying these approaches to determine regulator-target interactions in non-model species where experimental validation is challenging. Many transcriptional profiling experiments are performed across multiple time points; therefore we sought to improve regulator-target predictions by adjusting how time is incorporated into the network. We created ExRANGES, which incorporates Expression in a Rate-Normalized GEne Specific manner that adjusts how expression data is provided to the network algorithm. We tested this on a two different network construction approaches and found that ExRANGES prioritizes targets differently than traditional expression and improves the ability of these networks to accurately predict known regulator targets. ExRANGES improved the ability to correctly identify targets of transcription factors in large data sets in four different model systems: mouse, human, Arabidopsis, and yeast. Finally, we examined the performance of ExRANGES on a small data set from field-grown Oryza sativa and found that it also improved the ability to identify known targets even with a limited data set.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTo understand how organisms can turn a collection of genes into a physiological response, we need to understand how certain genes are turned on and off. In model organisms, the ability to identify direct targets of transcription factors via ChIP-Seq in a high-throughput manner has advanced our understanding of transcriptional regulatory networks and how organisms regulate gene expression. However, for non-model organisms, it remains a challenge to identify TF-target relationships through experimental approaches such as ChIP-Seq. Without this information, the ability to understand regulatory control is limited. Computational approaches to identify regulator-target relationships in silico from easily attainable transcriptional data offer a solution. Several approaches exist for identifying gene regulatory networks, including many that take advantage of time series data. Most of these approaches weigh the relationship between regulators and putative targets at all time points equally. However, many regulators may control a single target in response to different inputs. In our approach, we focus on the association between regulators and targets primarily at times when there is a significant change in expression. ExRANGES essentially weights the expression value of each time point by the slope change after that time point so that relationships between regulators and targets are emphasized at the time points when the transcript levels are changing. This change in input into network identification algorithms improves the ability to predict regulator-target interactions and could be applied to many different algorithms We hope this improvement will increase the ability to identify regulators of interest in non-model species.",

    "abstract": "The adult mammalian kidney has a complex, highly-branched collecting duct epithelium that arises as a ureteric bud sidebranch from an epithelial tube known as the nephric duct. Subsequent branching of the ureteric bud to form the collecting duct tree is regulated by subcellular interactions between the epithelium and a population of mesenchymal cells that surround the tips of outgrowing branches. The mesenchymal cells produce glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), that binds with RET receptors on the surface of the epithelial cells to stimulate several subcellular pathways in the epithelium. Such interactions are known to be a prerequisite for normal branching development, although competing theories exist for their role in morphogenesis. Here we introduce the first agent-based model of ex vivo kidney uretic branching. Through comparison with experimental data, we show that growth factor-regulated growth mechanisms can explain early epithelial cell branching, but only if epithelial cell division depends in a switch-like way on the local growth factor concentration; cell division occurring only if the driving growth factor level exceeds a threshold. We also show how a recently-developed method, \\\"Approximate Approximate Bayesian Computation\\\", can be used to infer key model parameters, and reveal the dependency between the parameters controlling a growth factor-dependent growth switch. These results are consistent with a requirement for signals controlling proliferation and chemotaxis, both of which are previously identified roles for GDNF.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA number of important congenital disorders arise due to incomplete development of the mammalian kidney. Elucidating the cause of these conditions requires an understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to kidney morphogenesis. Whilst experimental work has suggested several candidate mechanisms, their importance is still not well understood. Here we develop a computational model of kidney morphogenesis at the individual cell level to compare these different hypotheses. Guided by existing experimental evidence we propose that a generic growth factor, that we term \\\"GDNF\\\", produced from the mesenchyme surrounding the epithelium, can drive a number of cellular responses. Simulations of our agent-based model reveal that diffusion of GDNF, coupled with GDNF-stimulated epithelial cell division, can generate the branching patterns seen in ex vivo kidney explant experiments. We also find that branching depends on the sensitivity of cell proliferation to changes in GDNF levels. In particular our model only generates realistic branching when there is significant variation in GDNF levels along the boundary of the epithelium, and most cells divide only if the local concentration of GDNF exceeds a threshold value. We conclude that feedback between mesenchymal cells that produce GDNF, and epithelial cells that consume it, is vital for normal kidney organogenesis.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe majority of the human genome is composed of non-coding regions containing regulatory elements such as enhancers, which are crucial for controlling gene expression. Many variants associated with complex traits are in these regions, and may disrupt gene regulatory sequences. Consequently, it is important to not only identify true enhancers but also to test if a variant within an enhancer affects gene regulation. Recently, allele-specific analysis in high-throughput reporter assays, such as massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA), have been used to functionally validate non-coding variants. However, we are still missing high-quality and robust data analysis tools for these datasets.\\n\\nResultsWe have further developed our method for allele-specific analysis QuASAR (quantitative allele-specific analysis of reads) to analyze allele-specific signals in barcoded read counts data from MPRA. Using this approach, we can take into account the uncertainty on the original plasmid proportions, over-dispersion, and sequencing errors. The provided allelic skew estimate and its standard error also simplifies meta-analysis of replicate experiments. Additionally, we show that a beta-binomial distribution better models the variability present in the allelic imbalance of these synthetic reporters and results in a test that is statistically well calibrated under the null. Applying this approach to the MPRA data by Tewhey et al. (2016), we found 602 SNPs with significant (FDR 10%) allele-specific regulatory function in LCLs. We also show that we can combine MPRA with QuASAR estimates to validate existing experimental and computational annotations of regulatory variants. Our study shows that with appropriate data analysis tools, we can improve the power to detect allelic effects in high throughput reporter assays.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://github.com/piquelab/QuASAR/tree/master/mpra\\n\\nContactfluca@wayne.edu; rpique@wayne.edu",

    "abstract": "The bud tip epithelium of the branching mouse and human lung contains multipotent progenitors that are able to self-renew and give rise to all mature lung epithelial cell types. The current study aimed to understand the developmental signaling cues that regulate bud tip progenitor cells in the human fetal lung, which are present during branching morphogenesis, and to use this information to induce a bud tip progenitor-like population from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in vitro. We identified that FGF7, CHIR-99021 and RA maintained isolated human fetal lung epithelial bud tip progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state in vitro, and led to the induction of a 3-dimensional lung-like epithelium from hPSCs. 3-dimensional hPSC-derived lung tissue was initially patterned, with airway-like interior domains and bud tip-like progenitor domains at the periphery. Epithelial bud tip-like domains could be isolated, expanded and maintained as a nearly homogeneous population by serial passaging. Comparisons between human fetal lung epithelial bud tip cells and hPSC-derived bud tip-like cells were carried out using immunostaining, in situ hybridization and transcriptome-wide analysis, and revealed that in vitro derived tissue was highly similar to native lung. hPSC-derived epithelial bud tip-like structures survived in vitro for over 16 weeks, could be easily frozen and thawed and maintained multi-lineage potential. Furthermore, hPSC-derived epithelial bud tip progenitors successfully engrafted in the proximal airways of injured immunocompromised NSG mouse lungs, where they persisted for up to 6 weeks and gave rise to several lung epithelial lineages.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae is a natural resident of the aquatic environment, where a common nutrient is the chitinous exoskeletons of microscopic crustaceans. Chitin utilization requires chitinases, which degrade this insoluble polymer into soluble chitin oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides also serve as an inducing cue for natural transformation in Vibrio species. There are 7 predicted endochitinase-like genes in the V. cholerae genome. Here, we systematically dissect the contribution of each gene to growth on chitin as well as induction of natural transformation. Specifically, we created a strain that lacks all 7 putative chitinases and from this strain, generated a panel of strains where each expresses a single chitinase. We also generated expression plasmids to ectopically express all 7 chitinases in our chitinase deficient strain. Through this analysis, we found that low levels of chitinase activity are sufficient for natural transformation, while growth on insoluble chitin as a sole carbon source requires more robust and concerted chitinase activity. We also assessed the role that the three uptake systems for the chitin degradation products GlcNAc, (GlcNAc)2, and (GlcN)2, play in chitin utilization and competence induction. Cumulatively, this study provides mechanistic details for how this pathogen utilizes chitin to thrive and evolve in its environmental reservoir.\\n\\nORIGINALITY-SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTVibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera, interacts with the chitinous shells of crustacean zooplankton in the aquatic environment, which serves as an environmental reservoir for this pathogen. It degrades and utilizes chitin-derived products as a source of carbon and nitrogen. Also, chitin serves as an inducing cue for natural transformation - an important mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in this species. Here, we systematically dissect the genes required for chitin degradation and uptake, and characterize the role of these genes for growth on chitin as a nutrient and during chitininduced natural transformation. Thus, this study provides mechanistic details for how this pathogen utilizes chitin to thrive and evolve in its environmental reservoir.",

    "abstract": "Cells in culture display diverse motility behaviors that may reflect differences in cell state and function, providing motivation to discriminate between different motility behaviors. Current methods to do so rely upon manual feature engineering. However, the types of features necessary to distinguish between motility behaviors can vary greatly depending on the biological context, and it is not always clear which features may be most predictive in each setting for distinguishing particular cell types or disease states. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are machine learning models allowing for relevant features to be learned directly from spatial data. Similarly, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of models capable of learning long term temporal dependencies. Given that cell motility is inherently spacio-temporal data, we present an approach utilizing both convolutional and long- short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network units to analyze cell motility data. These RNN models provide accurate classification of simulated motility and experimentally measured motility from multiple cell types, comparable to results achieved with hand-engineered features. The variety of cell motility differences we can detect suggests that the algorithm is generally applicable to additional cell types not analyzed here. RNN autoencoders based on the same architecture are capable of learning motility features in an unsupervised manner and capturing variation between myogenic cells in the latent space. Adapting these RNN models to motility prediction, RNNs are capable of predicting muscle stem cell motility from past tracking data with performance superior to standard motion prediction models. This advance in cell motility prediction may be of practical utility in cell tracking applications.",

    "abstract": "Developmental constraints on genome evolution have been suggested to follow either an early conservation model or an \\\"hourglass\\\" model. Both models agree that late development strongly diverges between species, but debate on which developmental period is the most conserved. Here, based on a modified \\\"Transcriptome Age Index\\\" approach, i.e. weighting trait measures by expression level, we analyzed the constraints acting on three evolutionary traits of protein coding genes (strength of purifying selection on protein sequences, phyletic age, and duplicability) in four species: nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, fly Drosophila melanogaster, zebrafish Danio rerio, and mouse Mus musculus. In general, we found that both models can be supported by different genomic properties. Sequence evolution follows an hourglass model, but the evolution of phyletic age and of duplicability follow an early conservation model. Further analyses indicate that stronger purifying selection on sequences in the middle development are driven by temporal pleiotropy of these genes. In addition, we report evidence that expression in late development is enriched with retrogenes, which usually lack efficient regulatory elements. This implies that expression in late development could facilitate transcription of new genes, and provide opportunities for acquisition of function. Finally, in C. elegans, we suggest that dosage imbalance could be one of the main factors that cause depleted expression of high duplicability genes in early development.",

    "abstract": "A driving hypothesis of Evo-Devo is that animal morphological diversity is shaped both by adaptation and by developmental constraints. Here we have tested Darwins \\\"selection opportunity\\\" hypothesis, according to which high evolutionary divergence in late development is due to strong positive selection. We contrasted it to a \\\"developmental constraint\\\" hypothesis, according to which late development is under relaxed negative selection. Indeed, the highest divergence between species, both at the morphological and molecular levels, is observed late in embryogenesis and post-embryonically. To distinguish between adaptation and relaxation hypotheses, we investigated the evidence of positive selection on protein-coding genes in relation to their expression over development, in fly Drosohila melanogaster, zebrafish Danio rerio, and mouse Mus musculus. First, we found that genes specifically expressed in late development have stronger signals of positive selection. Second, over the full transcriptome, genes with evidence for positive selection trend to be expressed in late development. Finally, genes involved in pathways with cumulative evidence of positive selection have higher expression in late development. Overall, there is a consistent signal that positive selection mainly affects genes and pathways expressed in late embryonic development and in adult. Our results imply that the evolution of embryogenesis is mostly conservative, with most adaptive evolution affecting some stages of post-embryonic gene expression, and thus post-embryonic phenotypes. This is consistent with the diversity of environmental challenges to which juveniles and adults are exposed.",

The assignment of model structures to the experimental CCSs remains an ambiguous task, where one of several methods may be used to obtain a CCS from a given set of coordinates. The most reliable of the commonly used techniques, the Trajectory Method, starts with atomic coordinates which can be accompanied by partial atomic charges, obtained using ab initio methods. Here, we use lithiated - and {beta}-glucose ions as exemplar molecules to detect the effect conformational modification and changes to the partial charge distribution have on computed collision cross sections.

Our findings indicate that molecular conformation makes a significant contribution to fluctuations of partial charges in Electrostatic Potential (ESP) and Mulliken charge scheme; Partial charges derived using Natural Population Analysis (NPA) and ESP methods are largely independent of functional and basis set selection; and both selection of the charge scheme and functional/basis set combination play a large role in the resultant CCS, often causing few percent fluctuations in the computed values.",

Most importantly, the simplicity, biocompatibility and sensitivity of the proposed assay will open new doors for instrument free naked eye visual detection of H2O2, glucose and lactate detection.",

    "abstract": "Near field optics and optical tunneling light-matter interaction in the superstructure of chiral nanostructures and semiconductor quantum dots exhibit strong optical rotation activity that may open a new window for chiral-based bioanalytes detection. Herein we report an ultrasensitive, chiro-immunosensor using superstructure of chiral gold nanohybrids (CAu NPs) and quantum dots (QDs). Self-assembling techniques were employed to create asymmetric plasmonic chiral nanostructures for extending the spectral range of circular dichroism (CD) response for obtaining superior plasmonic resonant coupling with the QDs excitonic state; this may help to achieve lower the limit of detection (LOD) values. As a result, the designed probe exhibited avian influenza A (H5N1) viral concentration at picomolar level, a significant improvement in sensitivity in comparison to a non-assembled CAu NPs based chiroassay. The practicability of the proposed sensing system was successfully demonstrated on several virus cultures including, avian influenza A (H4N6) virus, fowl adenovirus and coronavirus in blood samples. The results of our study highlights that exciton-plasmon interaction changes chirality and the self-assembled nanostructures are an efficient strategy for enhancing the sensitivity of plasmonic nanosensors.",

    "abstract": "Noroviruses (NoV) are the leading cause of outbreak of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. A substantial effort has been made in the development of analytical devices for rapid and sensitive food safety monitoring via the detection of foodborne bacteria, viruses and parasites. Conventional analytical approaches for noroviruses suffer from some critical weaknesses: labor-intensive, time-consuming, and relatively low sensitivity. In this study, we developed a rapid and highly sensitive biosensor towards point-of-care device for noroviruses based on 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) labeled aptamer and nanomaterials, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene oxide (GO). In an assay, the fluorescence of 6-FAM labeled aptamer was quenched by MWCNTs or GO via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). In the presence of norovirus, the fluorescence would be recovered due to the release of the 6-FAM labeled aptamer from MWCNTs or GO. An easy-to-make paper-based microfluidic platform made by nitrocellulose membrane was used to conduct the assay. The quantitative detection of norovirus virus-like particles (NoV VLPs) was successfully performed. A linear range of 0-12.9 g/mL with a detection limit of 40 pM and 30 pM was achieved for the MWCNTs and GO based paper sensors, respectively. The results suggested the developed paper-based microfluidic device is simple, cost-effective and holds the potential of rapid in situ visual determination for noroviruses with remarkable sensitivity and specificity, which provides a new way for early identification of NoV and thereby an early intervention for preventing the spread of an outbreak.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, environmental drivers of community change have been associated with changes in biodiversity from local to global scales. Here we evaluate the role of anthropogenic drivers in marine ecosystems as drivers of change in local species richness with a meta-analysis of a novel dataset of temporal change in species richness. We paired biodiversity data from 144 sites with large-scale drivers derived from geospatial databases: human cumulative impact scores, sea surface temperature change, nutrient loading, and invasion potential. Three specific drivers (nutrient inputs, rate of linear temperature change, and non-native species invasion potential) explained patterns in local marine species richness change. We show that these drivers have opposing effects on biodiversity trends. In some cases, variability in drivers can create contrasting directions of change yielding observations of no net change when localities are pooled in an attempt to find a global average. Further, long-term studies reveal different effects of drivers that are not observed in short-term studies. These findings begin to explain high variability observed in species diversity trends at local scales. Formally attributing local species diversity change to human drivers is essential to understanding global patterns of local species diversity change and their consequences.",

    "abstract": "The ultimatum game (UG) is widely used in economic and anthropological research to investigate fairness by how one player proposes to divide a resource with a second player who can reject the offer. In these contexts, fairness is understood as offers that are more generous than predicted by the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE). A surprising and robust result of UG experiments is that proposers offer much more than the SPNE. These results have spawned many models aimed at explaining why players do not conform to the SPNE by showing how Nash equilibrium strategies can evolve far from the SPNE. However, empirical data from UG experiments indicate that players do not use Nash equilibrium strategies, but rather make generous offers while rejecting only very low offers. To better understand why people behave this way, we developed an agent-based model to investigate how generous strategies could evolve in the UG. Using agents with generic biological properties, we found that fair offers can readily evolve in structured populations even while rejection thresholds remain relatively low. We explain the evolution of fairness as a problem of the efficient conversion of resources into the production of offspring at the level of the group.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHuman generosity is widespread and far exceeds that of other social animals. Generosity is often studied experimentally with the ultimatum game, in which a proposer offers a split and a responder can either accept it or cancel the whole deal. A surprising result of ultimatum game experiments is that players are much more generous than predicted while only rejecting very low offers. This has presented a theoretical puzzle, since mathematical models have generally relied on high rejection levels--just below offer levels--to maintain generosity. Using evolutionary simulations, we explain both generous offers and the rejection of only low offers as a solution to the problem of how groups can efficiently convert resources into the production of offspring.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the development of a recently-identified white matter pathway, the frontal aslant tract (FAT) and its association to executive function and externalizing behaviors in a sample of 129 neurotypical children ranging in age from 7 months to 19-years. We found that the FAT could be tracked in 92% of those children, and that the pathway showed age-related differences into adulthood. The change in white matter microstructure was very rapid until about 6-years, and then plateaued, only to show age-related increases again after the age of 11-years. In a subset of those children (5-18-years; n = 70), left laterality of the microstructural properties of the FAT was associated with greater attention problems as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). However, this relationship was fully mediated by higher executive dysfunction as measured by the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). This relationship was specific to the FAT--we found no relationship between laterality of the white matter of the brain in general and attention problems, or executive function. These findings suggest that the degree to which the developing brain favors a right lateralized structural dominance of the FAT is directly associated with executive function and attention. This novel finding provides a new potential structural biomarker to assess attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and associated executive dysfunction during development.\\n\\nSignificance StatementTo investigate the function of a recently-identified white matter fiber pathway, the frontal aslant tract (FAT), we tracked the pathway in 129 typically developing children using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI). We then examined whether laterality of the tract is associated with attention problems and executive function. We found that reduced right laterality of the tract was associated with greater executive dysfunction, which predicted increased reports of attention problems.

    "abstract": "Hierarchically organized brains communicate through feedforward and feedback pathways. In mammals, feedforward and feedback are mediated by higher and lower frequencies during wakefulness. Feedback is preferentially impaired by general anesthetics. This suggests feedback serves critical functions in waking brains. The brain of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) is also hierarchically organized, but the presence of feedback in these brains is not established. Here we studied feedback in the fruit fly brain, by simultaneously recording local field potentials (LFPs) from low-order peripheral structures and higher-order central structures. Directed connectivity analysis revealed that low frequencies (0.1-5Hz) mediated feedback from the center to the periphery, while higher frequencies (10-45Hz) mediated feedforward in the opposite direction. Further, isoflurane anesthesia preferentially reduced feedback. Our results imply that similar spectral characteristics of feedforward and feedback may be a signature of hierarchically organized brains and that general anesthetics may induce unresponsiveness by targeting the mechanisms that support feedback.",

Here we demonstrate a novel and robust method to rapidly isolate well-preserved yeast nuclei. The method can be easily adapted to multiple preparation scales depending on experimental need and it can readily be performed on multiple samples by a single researcher in one day. We show that the nuclei fraction is strongly enriched and that the resulting nuclei are free from contaminating endoplasmatic reticulum and other cell debris. EM studies show that preservation of nuclear morphology is exquisite, making it possible to study peripheral nuclear pore components such as the cytoplasmic filaments and the basket, whose structure is generally difficult to maintain ex vivo. In addition, incubation of isolated nuclei with bulk transport substrates of different sizes and with import cargo indicates that the nuclear envelope is intact and nuclear pores retain their capacity to bind transport substrates. Our results suggest that this preparation procedure will greatly facilitate studies of the yeast nucleus which have been difficult to establish and to multiplex to date.",

    "abstract": "Ecosystem stability and its link with biodiversity have been mainly studied at the local scale. Here we present a simple theoretical model to address the joint dependence of diversity and stability on spatial scale, from local to continental. The notion of stability we use is based on the temporal variability of an ecosystem-level property, such as primary productivity. In this way, our model integrates the well-known species-area relationship (SAR) with a recent proposal to quantify the spatial scaling of stability, called the invariability-area relationship (IAR). To explore the possible links between the two relationships, we contrast two assumptions about the spatial decay of correlations. In case species differences determine spatial decorrelation, the IAR is a duplicate of the SAR; in case decorrelation is directly determined by spatial separation, the IAR is unrelated to the SAR. We apply the two model variants to explore the effects of species loss and habitat destruction on stability, and find a rich variety of multi-scale spatial dependencies. Our work emphasizes the importance of studying diversity and stability across spatial scales, and provides a point of reference for mechanistic models and data analyses.",

Our results show that these methods produce reliable estimates when the substitution rate is high, rate variation is low, and samples of similar ages are not phylogenetically clustered. The interaction of these factors is particularly important for Bayesian estimation of evolutionary rates. We also inferred rates for time-structured mitogenomic data sets from six vertebrate species. Root-to-tip regression estimated a different rate from least-squares dating and Bayesian inference for mitogenomes from the horse, which has high levels of among-lineage rate variation. We recommend using multiple methods of inference and testing data for temporal signal, among-lineage rate variation, and phylo-temporal clustering.",

Identification of shared attributes in germline variation could aid discrimination of high-risk from likely benign mutations and narrow the search space for new cancer predisposing genes. Extraordinary progress made in analysis of common variation with GWAS methodology does not provide sufficient resolution to understand rare variation. To fulfil missing classification for rare germline variation we assembled datasets of whole exome sequences from >2,000 patients with different types of cancers: breast cancer, colon cancer and cutaneous and ocular melanomas matched to more than 7,000 non-cancer controls and analyzed germline variation in known cancer predisposing genes to identify common properties of disease associated mutations and new candidate cancer susceptibility genes. Lists of all cancer predisposing genes were divided into subclasses according to the mode of inheritance of the related cancer syndrome or contribution to known major cancer pathways. Out of all subclasses only genes linked to dominant syndromes presented significant rare germline variants enrichment in cases. Separate analysis of protein-truncating and missense variation in this subclass of genes confirmed significant prevalence of protein-truncating variants in cases only in loss-of-function tolerant genes (pLI<0.1), while ultra-rare missense mutations were significantly overrepresented in cases only in constrained genes (pLI>0.9).

    "abstract": "Nuclear organization has an important role in determining genome function; however, it is not clear how spatiotemporal organization of the genome relates to functionality. To elucidate this relationship, a high-throughput method for tracking any locus of interest is desirable. Here, we report an efficient and scalable method named SHACKTeR (Short Homology and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Knock-in of a TetO Repeat) for live cell imaging of specific chromosomal regions. Compared to alternatives, our method does not require a nearby repetitive sequence and it requires only two modifications to the genome: CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of an optimized TetO repeat and its visualization by TetR-EGFP expression. Our simplified knock-in protocol, utilizing short homology arms integrated by PCR, was successful at labeling 9 different loci in HCT116 cells with up to 20% efficiency. These loci included both nuclear speckle-associated, euchromatin regions and nuclear lamina-associated, heterochromatin regions. We anticipate the general applicability and scalability of our method will enhance causative analyses between gene function and compartmentalization in a high-throughput manner.",

We find extensive diversity, including 62 haplogroups not reported previously from this region.

    "abstract": "BackgroundSustainable Development Goals set a challenge for the elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection as a public health concern by the year 2030. Deployment of a robust prophylactic vaccine and enhanced interventions for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) are cornerstones of elimination strategy. However, in light of the estimated global burden of 290 million cases, enhanced efforts are required to underpin optimisation of public health strategy. Robust analysis of population epidemiology is particularly crucial for populations in Africa made vulnerable by HIV co-infection, poverty, stigma and poor access to prevention, diagnosis and treatment.\\n\\nMethodsWe here set out to evaluate the current and future role of HBV vaccination and PMTCT as tools for elimination. We first investigated the current impact of paediatric vaccination in a cohort of children with and without HIV infection in Kimberley, South Africa. Second, we used these data to inform a new model to simulate the ongoing impact of preventive interventions. By applying these two approaches in parallel, we are able to determine both the current impact of interventions, and the future projected outcome of ongoing preventive strategies over time.\\n\\nResultsExisting efforts have been successful in reducing paediatric prevalence of HBV infection in this setting to <1%, demonstrating the success of the existing vaccine campaign. Our model predicts that, if consistently deployed, combination efforts of vaccination and PMTCT can significantly reduce population prevalence (HBsAg) by 2030, such that a major public health impact is possible even without achieving elimination. However, the prevalence of HBV e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive carriers will decline more slowly, representing a persistent population reservoir. We show that HIV co-infection significantly reduces titres of vaccine-mediated antibody, but has a relatively minor role in influencing the projected time to elimination. Our model can also be applied to other settings in order to predict time to elimination based on specific interventions.\\n\\nConclusionsThrough extensive deployment of preventive strategies for HBV, significant positive public health impact is possible, although time to HBV elimination as a public health concern is likely to be substantially longer than that proposed by current goals.",

Here we study the joint dynamics of two cortical columns described by Jansen-Rit neural mass models, and show that coupling between the columns gives rise to stochastic initiations of sustained collective activity, which can be interpreted as epileptic events. For large enough coupling strengths, termination of these events results mainly from the emergence of synchronization between the columns, and thus is controlled by coupling instead of noise. Stochastic triggering and noise-independent durations are characteristic of excitable dynamics, and thus we interpret our results in terms of collective excitability.",

    "abstract": "Working memory is the function by which we temporarily maintain information to achieve current task goals. Models of working memory typically debate where this information is stored, rather than how it is stored. Here we ask instead what neural mechanisms are involved in storage, and how these mechanisms change as a function of task goals. Participants either had to reproduce the orientation of a memorized bar (continuous recall task), or identify the memorized bar in a search array (visual search task). The sensory input and retention interval were identical in both tasks. Next, we used decoding and forward modeling on multivariate electroencephalogram (EEG) and time-frequency decomposed EEG to investigate which neural signals carry more informational content during the retention interval. In the continuous recall task, working memory content was preferentially carried by induced oscillatory alpha-band power, while in the visual search task it was more strongly carried by the distribution of evoked (consistently elevated and non-oscillatory) EEG activity. To show the independence of these two signals, we were able to remove informational content from one signal without affecting informational content in the other. Finally, we show that the tuning characteristics of both signals change in opposite directions depending on the current task goal. We propose that these signals reflect oscillatory and elevated firing-rate mechanisms that respectively support location-based and object-based maintenance. Together, these data challenge current models of working memory that place storage in particular regions, but rather emphasize the importance of different distributed maintenance signals depending on task goals.\\n\\nSignificance statement (120 words)Without realizing, we are constantly moving things in and out of our minds eye, an ability also referred to as  working memory. Where did I put my screwdriver? Do we still have milk in the fridge? A central question in working memory research is how the brain maintains this information temporarily. Here we show that different neural mechanisms are involved in working memory depending on what the memory is used for. For example, remembering what a bottle of milk looks like invokes a different neural mechanism from remembering how much milk it contains: the first one primarily involved in being able to find the object, and the other one involving spatial position, such as the milk level in the bottle.",

    "abstract": "How animals evolved from their single-celled ancestors over 600 million years ago is poorly understood. Comparisons of genomes from animals and their closest relatives - choanoflagellates, filastereans and ichthyosporeans - have recently revealed the genomic landscape of animal origins. However, the cell and developmental biology of the first animals have been less well examined. Using principles from evolutionary cell biology, we reason that the last common ancestor of animals and choanoflagellates (the  Urchoanozoan) used a collar complex - a flagellum surrounded by a microvillar collar - to capture bacterial prey. The origin of animal multicellularity likely occurred through the modification of pre-existing mechanisms for extracellular matrix synthesis and regulation of cytokinesis. The progenitors of animals likely developed clonally through serial division of flagellated cells, giving rise to sheets of cells that folded into spheres by a morphogenetic process comparable to that seen in modern choanoflagellate rosettes and calcareous sponge embryos. Finally, we infer that cell differentiation evolved in the animal stem-lineage by a combination of three mechanisms: division of labor from ancient plurifunctional cell types, conversion of temporally segregated phenotypes into spatially segregated cell types, and functional innovation.",

    "abstract": "It is widely accepted that cAMP regulates gene transcription principally by activating the protein kinase A (PKA)-targeted transcription factors. Here, we show that cAMP enhances the generation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in multiple cell types. 5hmC is converted from 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by Tet methylcytosine dioxygenases, for which Fe(II) is an essential cofactor. The promotion of 5hmC was mediated by a prompt increase of the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool (LIP). cAMP enhanced the acidification of endosomes for Fe(II) release to the LIP likely through RapGEF2. The effect of cAMP on Fe(II) and 5hmC was confirmed by adenylate cyclase activators, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and most notably by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The transcriptomic changes caused by cAMP occurred in concert with 5hmC elevation in differentially transcribed genes. Collectively, these data show a previously unrecognized regulation of gene transcription by GPCR-cAMP signaling through augmentation of the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool and DNA demethylation.",

    "abstract": "Efforts are underway to construct several recoded genomes anticipated to exhibit multi-virus resistance, enhanced non-standard amino acid (NSAA) incorporation, and capability for synthetic biocontainment. Though we succeeded in pioneering the first genomically recoded organism (Escherichia coli strain C321.{Delta}A), its fitness is far lower than that of its non-recoded ancestor, particularly in defined media. This fitness deficit severely limits its utility for NSAA-linked applications requiring defined media such as live cell imaging, metabolic engineering, and industrial-scale protein production. Here, we report adaptive evolution of C321.{Delta}A for more than 1,000 generations in independent replicate populations grown in glucose minimal media. Evolved recoded populations significantly exceed the growth rates of both the ancestral C321.{Delta}A and non-recoded strains, permitting use of the recoded chassis in several new contexts. We use next-generation sequencing to identify genes mutated in multiple independent populations, and we reconstruct individual alleles in ancestral strains via multiplex automatable genome engineering (MAGE) to quantify their effects on fitness. Several selective mutations occur only in recoded evolved populations, some of which are associated with altering the translation apparatus in response to recoding, whereas others are not apparently associated with recoding, but instead correct for off-target mutations that occurred during initial genome engineering. This report demonstrates that laboratory evolution can be applied after engineering of recoded genomes to streamline fitness recovery compared to application of additional targeted engineering strategies that may introduce further unintended mutations. In doing so, we provide the most comprehensive insight to date into the physiology of the commonly used C321.{Delta}A strain.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAfter demonstrating construction of an organism with an altered genetic code, we sought to evolve this organism for many generations to improve its fitness and learn what unique changes natural selection would bestow upon it. Although this organism initially had impaired fitness, we observed that adaptive laboratory evolution resulted in several selective mutations that corrected for insufficient translation termination and for unintended mutations that occurred when originally altering the genetic code. This work further bolsters our understanding of the pliability of the genetic code, it will help guide ongoing and future efforts seeking to recode genomes, and it results in a useful strain for non-standard amino acid incorporation in numerous contexts relevant for research and industry.",

We found that fork-resection is a two-step process coordinated by the non-homologous end joining factor Ku. An initial resection mediated by MRN/Ctp1 removes Ku from terminally-arrested forks, generating ~ 110 bp sized gaps obligatory for subsequent Exo1-mediated long-range resection and replication restart. The lack of Ku results in slower fork restart, excessive resection, and impaired RPA recruitment.

Starvation activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an evolutionarily conserved indicator of cellular energy status, in a cascade which modulates ATP production and consumption. We investigated the role of energetic status on anoxia tolerance in Drosophila and discovered that starvation or AMPK activation increases the speed of locomotor recovery from an anoxic coma. Using temporal and spatial genetic targeting we found that AMPK in the fat body contributes to starvation-induced fast locomotor recovery, whereas, under fed conditions, disrupting AMPK in oenocytes prolongs recovery. By evaluating spreading depolarization in the fly brain during anoxia we show that AMPK activation reduces the severity of ionic disruption and prolongs recovery of electrical activity. Further genetic targeting indicates that glial, but not neuronal, AMPK affects locomotor recovery. Together, these findings support a model in which AMPK is neuroprotective in Drosophila.",

Using this method, ro-bust and highly active bacterial cell lysates can be produced without specialized equipment at a wide range of scales, making cell-free gene expression easily and broadly accessible. More-over, live autolysis strain can be freeze-dried directly and subsequently lysed upon rehydration to produce active lysate. We demonstrate the utility of autolysates for synthetic biology by reg-ulating protein production and degradation, implementing quorum sensing, and showing quan-titative protection of linear DNA templates by GamS protein. To allow versatile and sensitive {beta}-galactosidase (LacZ) based readout we produce autolysates with no detectable background LacZ activity and use them to produce sensitive mercury(II) biosensors with LacZ-mediated colorimetric and fluorescent outputs.

    "abstract": "Identifying similarities between datasets is a fundamental task in data mining and has become an integral part of modern scientific investigation. Whether the task is to identify co-expressed genes in large-scale expression surveys or to predict combinations of gene knockouts which would elicit a similar phenotype, the underlying computational task is often a multi-dimensional similarity test. As datasets continue to grow, improvements to the efficiency, sensitivity or specificity of such computation will have broad impacts as it allows scientists to more completely explore the wealth of scientific data. A significant practical drawback of large-scale data mining is that the vast majority of pairwise comparisons are unlikely to be relevant, meaning that they do not share a signature of interest. It is therefore essential to efficiently identify these unproductive comparisons as rapidly as possible and exclude them from more time-intensive similarity calculations. The Blazing Signature Filter (BSF) is a highly efficient pairwise similarity algorithm which enables extensive data mining within a reasonable amount of time. The algorithm transforms datasets into binary metrics, allowing it to utilize the computationally efficient bit operators and provide a coarse measure of similarity. As a result, the BSF can scale to high dimensionality and rapidly filter unproductive pairwise comparison. Two bioinformatics applications of the tool are presented to demonstrate the ability to scale to billions of pairwise comparisons and the usefulness of this approach.",

    "abstract": "Transcripts are frequently modified by structural variations, which leads to a fused transcript of either multiple genes (known as a fusion gene) or a gene and a previously non-transcribing sequence. Detecting these modifications (called transcriptomic structural variations, or TSVs), especially in cancer tumor sequencing, is an important and challenging computational problem. We introduce SQUID, a novel algorithm to accurately predict both fusion-gene and non-fusion-gene TSVs from RNA-seq alignments. SQUID unifies both concordant and discordant read alignments into one model, and doubles the accuracy on simulation data compared to other approaches. With SQUID, we identified novel non-fusion-gene TSVs on TCGA samples.",

    "abstract": "1Although vaccines against seasonal influenza are designed to protect against circulating strains, by affecting the emergence and transmission of antigenically divergent strains, they might also change the rate of antigenic evolution. Vaccination might slow antigenic evolution by increasing immunity, reducing the chance that even antigenically diverged strains can survive. Vaccination also reduces prevalence, decreasing the supply of potentially beneficial mutations and increasing the probability of stochastic extinction. But vaccination might accelerate antigenic evolution by increasing the transmission advantage of more antigenically diverged strains relative to less diverged strains (i.e., by positive selection). Such evolutionary effects could affect vaccinations direct benefits to individuals and indirect benefits to the host population (i.e., the private and social benefits). To investigate these potential impacts, we simulated the dynamics of an influenza-like pathogen with seasonal vaccination. On average, more vaccination decreased the rate of viral antigenic evolution and the incidence of disease. Notably, this decrease was driven partly by a vaccine-induced decline in the rate of antigenic evolution. To understand how the evolutionary effects of vaccines might affect their social and private benefits, we fitted linear panel models to simulated data. By slowing evolution, vaccination increased the social benefit and decreased the private benefit. Thus, in the long term, vaccinations potential social and private benefits may differ from current theory, which omits evolutionary effects. These results suggest that conventional seasonal vaccines against influenza, if protective against transmission and given to the appropriate populations, could further reduce disease burden by slowing antigenic evolution.",

    "abstract": "Rapid pathogen diagnosis and characterization performed by metagenomic DNA sequencing may permit physicians to better target therapies in order to improve patient outcomes. To this end, a novel sample-to-answer workflow was assembled to enable rapid clinical detection of causative pathogens of bacteremia in whole blood utilizing metagenomic sequence data captured by the MinION. Rapid lysis, nucleic acid purification, host depletion, and genomic DNA library preparation permitted the detection of multiple bacterial and fungal agents spiked into whole blood, with sequencing commencing within 40 minutes of sample receipt. A hybrid detection strategy utilizing targeted PCR detection of specific pathogens of concern was adopted to improve overall sensitivity. As a proof of concept, primers for relatively long amplicons (~ 1800 bp) were selected to enable the specific detection of Yersinia pestis. The resulting amplicon library was spiked onto the same sequencing flow cell used to perform genomic sequencing, permitting simultaneous pathogen detection via both targeted and untargeted sequencing workflows. Sensitivities on the order of 1x10^6 cells/mL and 1x10^5 cells/mL were achieved for untargeted and targeted detection, respectively, of Y. pestis genomes spiked into whole blood. Bacterial and fungal species present in the ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standard were also detected when spiked at similar levels. Variable quality of sequence reads was observed between the transposase-based and ligation-based library preparation methods, demonstrating that the more time consuming ligation-based approach may be more appropriate for the workflow described herein. Overall, this approach provides a foundation from which future point of care platforms could be developed to permit characterization of bacteremia within hours of admittance into a clinical environment.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCases of bacteremia in the U.S. present a significant clinical challenge, especially due to rising rates of antimicrobial resistant strains. Rapid diagnosis of the etiologic pathogen and underlying drug resistance genetic signatures between the first and second antibiotic dose should improve patient outcomes and may permit physicians to better target antibiotic therapies without turning to broad spectrum antibiotics, which may further propagate resistant strains. The methods described herein have been developed to enhance the real time nature of the MinION sequencer. DNA sequencing and real time analysis begin within 40 minutes of sample receipt (as opposed to hours or days for common clinical nucleic acid extraction or blood culture techniques). The incorporation of sensitivity enhancements, such as methylation-based pulldown of human DNA or PCR targeted for pathogens of interest, ensures that this assay can detect bacterial blood infections at clinically relevant levels. The pathogen-agnostic aspect of the assay could one day allow clinicians to identify any unknown bacterial, fungal, or viral DNA in a sample. Ultimately, this study serves as an important step toward establishing a pipeline to rapidly detect and characterize pathogens present in whole blood.",

The chimeric receptor, nectin-2Pvr(c'c\\\"d), rendered transformed L cells susceptible to infection with poliovirus P1/Mahoney, but not with polioviruses P2/Lansing and P3/Leon, due to lack of binding. Twenty-four variants of P2/Lansing were selected that replicate in nectin-2Pvr(c'c\\\"d) producing cell lines. Sequence analysis revealed 30 amino acid changes at 28 capsid residues. One change, K1103R, is found in nearly all isolates and is located at one end of the VP1 BC loop. Other alterations are located on the canyon surface, at the protomer interface, and along the perimeter of the canyon south wall. Unlike poliovirus-Pvr binding, the VP1 BC loop is required for infection of cells producing nectin-2Pvr(c'c\\\"d).",

The rumen microbiome presents an underexplored resource for the discovery of novel microbial enzymes and metabolites, including AMPs. Using functional screening and computational approaches, we identified 181 potentially novel AMPs from a rumen bacterial metagenome. Here, we show that three of the selected AMPs (Lynronne-1, 2 and 3) were effective against numerous bacterial pathogens, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). No decrease in MRSA susceptibility was observed after 25 days of sub-lethal exposure to these AMPs. The AMPs bound preferentially to bacterial membrane lipids and induced membrane permeability leading to cytoplasmic leakage. Topical administration of Lynronne-1 (10% w/v) to a mouse model of MRSA wound infection elicited a significant reduction in bacterial counts, which was comparable to treatment with 2% mupirocin ointment. Our findings indicate that the rumen microbiome may provide viable alternative antimicrobials for future therapeutic application.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONVarious computational methods for gene expression-based subtyping of high-grade serous (HGS) ovarian cancer have been proposed. This resulted in the identification of molecular subtypes that are based on different datasets and were differentially validated, making it difficult to achieve consensus on which definitions to use in follow-up studies. We assess three major subtype classifiers for their robustness and association to outcome by a meta-analysis of publicly available expression data, and provide a classifier that represents their consensus.\\n\\nMETHODSWe use a compendium of 15 microarray datasets consisting of 1,774 HGS ovarian tumors to assess 1) concordance between published subtyping algorithms, 2) robustness of those algorithms to re-clustering across datasets, and 3) association of subtypes with overall survival. A consensus classifier is trained on concordantly classified samples, and validated by leave-one-dataset-out validation.\\n\\nRESULTSEach subtyping classifier identified subsets significantly differing in overall survival, but were not robust to re-fitting in independent datasets and grouped only approximately one third of patients concordantly into four subtypes. We propose a consensus classifier to identify the minority of unambiguously classifiable tumors across multiple gene expression platforms, using a 100-gene signature. The resulting consensus subtypes correlate with patient age, survival, tumor purity, and lymphocyte infiltration.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSOur analysis demonstrates that most HGS ovarian cancers are not able to be subtyped. A minority of tumors can be classified and our proposed consensus classifier consolidates and improves on the robustness of three previously proposed subtype classifiers. It provides reliable stratification of patients with HGS ovarian tumors of clearly defined subtype, and will assist in studying the role of polyclonality in the majority of tumors that are not robustly classifiable.",
