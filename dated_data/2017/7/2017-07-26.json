    "abstract": "Complement is an important pathway in innate immunity, inflammation, and many disease processes. However, despite its importance, there are few validated mathematical models of complement activation. In this study, we developed an ensemble of experimentally validated reduced order complement models. We combined ordinary differential equations with logical rules to produce a compact yet predictive model of complement activation. The model, which described the lectin and alternative pathways, was an order of magnitude smaller than comparable models in the literature. We estimated an ensemble of model parameters from in vitro dynamic measurements of the C3a and C5a complement proteins. Subsequently, we validated the model on unseen C3a and C5a measurements not used for model training. Despite its small size, the model was surprisingly predictive. Global sensitivity and robustness analysis suggested complement was robust to any single therapeutic intervention. Only the simultaneous knockdown of both C3 and C5 consistently reduced C3a and C5a formation from all pathways. Taken together, we developed a validated mathematical model of complement activation that was computationally inexpensive, and could easily be incorporated into pre-existing or new pharmacokinetic models of immune system function. The model described experimental data, and predicted the need for multiple points of therapeutic intervention to fully disrupt complement activation.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to human-induced environmental change has the potential to profoundly influence the genomic architecture of affected species. This is particularly true in agricultural ecosystems, where anthropogenic selection pressure is strong. Heliothis virescens feeds on cotton in its larval stages and US populations have been declining since the widespread planting of transgenic cotton, which endogenously express proteins derived Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). No physiological adaptation to Bt toxin has been found in the field, so adaptation to this altered environment could involve: 1) shifts in host plant selection mechanisms to avoid cotton, 2) changes in detoxification mechanisms required for cotton-feeding versus feeding on other host plants, or 3) loss of resistance to previously used management practices including insecticides. Here we begin to address the question of whether such changes occurred in H. virescens populations between the years 1997 and 2012. As part of our study, we produced an H. virescens genome assembly and used this in concert with a ddRAD-seq enabled genome scan to identify loci with significant allele frequency changes over the 15 year period after Bt crops became widespread in the agricultural landscape. Confirmation that a known genetic change at a previously described H. virescens target of selection was detectable in our genome scan increased our confidence in this methodology. We quantified the strength of selection required to elicit the observed allele frequency changes at loci under selection. Potential contributions of genes near the loci under selection to adaptive phenotypes in the H. virescens cotton system are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The gradual heterogeneity of climatic factors pose varying selection pressures across geographic distances that leave signatures of clinal variation in the genome. Separating signatures of clinal adaptation from signatures of other evolutionary forces, such as demographic processes, genetic drift, and adaptation to non-clinal conditions of the immediate local environment is a major challenge. Here, we examine climate adaptation in five natural populations of the harlequin fly Chironomus riparius sampled along a climatic gradient across Europe. Our study integrates experimental data, individual genome resequencing, Pool-Seq data, and population genetic modelling. Common-garden experiments revealed a positive correlation of population growth rates corresponding to the population origin along the climate gradient, suggesting thermal adaptation on the phenotypic level. Based on a population genomic analysis, we derived empirical estimates of historical demography and migration. We used an FST outlier approach to infer positive selection across the climate gradient, in combination with an environmental association analysis. In total we identified 162 candidate genes as genomic basis of climate adaptation. Enriched functions among these candidate genes involved the apoptotic process and molecular response to heat, as well as functions identified in other studies of climate adaptation in other insects. Our results show that local climate conditions impose strong selection pressures and lead to genomic adaptation despite strong gene flow. Moreover, these results imply that selection to different climatic conditions seems to converge on a functional level, at least between different insect species.",

    "abstract": "Mutual information-based network inference algorithms are an important tool in the reverse-engineering of transcriptional regulatory networks, but all rely on estimates of the mutual information between the expression of pairs of genes. Various methods exist to compute estimates of the mutual information, but none have been firmly established as optimal for network inference. The performance of 9 mutual information estimation methods are compared using three popular network inference algorithms: CLR, MRNET and ARACNE. The performance of the estimators is compared on one synthetic and two real datasets. For estimators that discretise data, the effect of discretisation parameters are also studied in detail. Implementations of 5 estimators are provided in parallelised C++ with an R interface. These are faster than alternative implementations, with reductions in computation time up to a factor of 3,500.\\n\\nResultsThe B-spline estimator consistently performs well on real and synthetic datasets. CLR was found to be the best performing inference algorithm, corroborating previous results indicating that it is the state of the art mutual inference algorithm. It is also found to be robust to the mutual information estimation method and their parameters. Furthermore, when using an estimator that discretises expression data, using N1/3 bins for N samples gives the most accurate inferred network. This contradicts previous findings that suggested using N 1/2 bins.",

    "abstract": "Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is a rapidly growing, high-biomass crop prized for abiotic stress tolerance. However, measuring genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions remains a progress bottleneck. Here we describe strategies for identifying shape, color and ionomic indicators of plant nitrogen use efficiency. We subjected a panel of 30 genetically diverse sorghum genotypes to a spectrum of nitrogen deprivation and measured responses using high-throughput phenotyping technology followed by ionomic profiling. Responses were quantified using shape (16 measurable outputs), color (hue and intensity) and ionome (18 elements). We measured the speed at which specific genotypes respond to environmental conditions, both in terms of biomass and color changes, and identified individual genotypes that perform most favorably. With this analysis we present a novel approach to quantifying color-based stress indicators over time. Additionally, ionomic profiling was conducted as an independent, low cost and high throughput option for characterizing G x E, identifying the elements most affected by either genotype or treatment and suggesting signaling that occurs in response to the environment. This entire dataset and associated scripts are made available through an open access, user-friendly, web-based interface. In summary, this work provides analysis tools for visualizing and quantifying plant abiotic stress responses over time. These methods can be deployed as a time-efficient method of dissecting the genetic mechanisms used by sorghum to respond to the environment to accelerate crop improvement.",

To expand this toolset, we have developed a screening strategy for the direct engineering of self-complementing split FPs. Via this strategy, we have generated a yellow-green split-mNeonGreen21-10/11 that improves the ratio of complemented signal to the background of FP1-10-expressing cells compared to the commonly used split-GFP1-10/11, as well as a 10-fold brighter red-colored split-sfCherry21-10/11. Based on split-sfCherry2, we have engineered a photoactivatable variant that enables single-molecule localization-based super-resolution microscopy. We have demonstrated dual-color endogenous protein tagging with sfCherry211 and GFP11, revealing that endoplasmic reticulum translocon complex Sec61B has reduced abundance in certain peripheral tubules. These new split FPs not only offer multiple colors for imaging interaction networks of endogenous proteins, but also hold the potential to provide orthogonal handles for biochemical isolation of native protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "Many researchers want to report an R2 to measure the variance explained by a model. When the model includes correlation among data, such as phylogenetic models and mixed models, defining an R2 faces two conceptual problems. (i) It is unclear how to measure the variance explained by predictor (independent) variables when the model contains covariances. (ii) Researchers may want the R2 to include the variance explained by the covariances by asking questions such as \\\"How much of the variance is explained by phylogeny?\\\" Here, I investigate three R2s for phylogenetic and mixed models. A least-squares R2ls is an extension of the ordinary least-squares R2 that weights residuals by variances and covariances estimated by the model; it is closely related to R2glmm proposed by Nakagawa & Schielzeth (2013). The conditional expectation R2ce is based on \\\"predicting\\\" each residual from the remaining residuals of the fitted model. The likelihood ratio R2lr was first used by Cragg & Uhler (1970) for logistic regression, and here is used with the standardization proposed by Nagelkerke (1991). These three R2s are formulated as partial R2s, making it possible to compare the contributions of mean components (regression coefficients in phylogenetic models and fixed effects in mixed models) and variance components (phylogenetic correlations and random effects) to the fit of models. The properties of the R2s for phylogenetic models were assessed using simulations for continuous and binary response data (phylogenetic generalized least squares and phylogenetic logistic regression). Because the R2s are designed broadly for any model for correlated data, the R2s were also compared for LMMs and GLMMs. R2ls, R2ce, and R2lr all have good performance, and each has advantages and disadvantages for different applications. These R2s are computed in the R package rr2 (https://github.com/arives/rr2). [Binomial regression, coefficient of determination, non-independent residuals, phylogenetic model, pseudo-likelihood]",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments typically analyze hundreds or thousands of cells after amplification of the cDNA. The high throughput is made possible by the early introduction of sample-specific barcodes (BCs) and the amplification bias is alleviated by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Thus the ideal analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq data needs to efficiently tabulate reads according to both BC and UMI. zUMIs is such a pipeline, it can handle both known and random BCs and also efficiently collapses UMIs, either just for Exon mapping reads or for both Exon and Intron mapping reads. Another unique feature of zUMIs is the adaptive downsampling function, that facilitates dealing with hugely varying library sizes, but also allows to evaluate whether the library has been sequenced to saturation. zUMIs flexibility allows to accommodate data generated with any of the major scRNA-seq protocols that use BCs and UMIs. To illustrate the utility of zUMIs, we analysed a single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset and show that more than 35% of all reads map to Introns. We furthermore show that these intronic reads are informative about expression levels, significantly increasing the number of detected genes and improving the cluster resolution.

This process is limited by hemocytes through phagocytosis. We have previously shown that the PA14 quorum-sensing regulator RhlR is required for these bacteria to elude the cellular immune response. RhlI synthesizes the auto-inducer signal that activates RhlR. Here, we compare the null mutant phenotypes of rhlR and rhlI in a variety of infection assays in Drosophila and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Surprisingly, in Drosophila, unlike{Delta} rhlR mutants,{Delta} rhlI mutants are only modestly attenuated for virulence and are poorly phagocytosed and opsonized in a Thioester-containing Protein4-dependent manner. Likewise, {Delta}rhlI but not {Delta}rhlR mutants colonize the digestive tract of C. elegans and kill it as efficiently as wild-type PA14. Thus, RhlR has an RhlI-independent function in eluding detection or counter-acting the action of the immune system. In contrast to the intestinal infection model, Tep4 mutant flies are more resistant to PA14 in a septic injury model, which also depends on rhlR. Thus, the Tep4 putative opsonin can either be protective or detrimental to host defense depending on the infection route.",

    "abstract": "Although driver genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been investigated in various previous genetic studies, prevalence of key driver genes among heterogeneous populations is unknown. Moreover, the phenotypic associations of these driver genes are poorly understood. This report aims to reveal the phenotypic impacts of a group of consensus driver genes in HCC. We used MutSigCV and OncodriveFM modules implemented in the IntOGen pipeline to identify consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts comprising 1,494 samples in total. To access their global impacts, we used TCGA mutations and copy number variations to predict the transcriptomics data, under generalized linear models. We further investigated the associations of the consensus driver genes to patient survival, age, gender, race and risk factors. We identify 10 consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts in total. Integrative analysis of driver mutations, copy number variations and transcriptomic data reveals that these consensus driver mutations and their copy number variations are associated with majority (62.5%) of the mRNA transcriptome, but only a small fraction (8.9%) of miRNAs. Genes associated with TP53, CTNNB1, and ARID1A mutations contribute to the tripod of most densely connected pathway clusters. These driver genes are significantly associated with patients overall survival. Some driver genes are significantly linked to HCC gender (CTNNB1, ALB, TP53 and AXIN1), race (TP53 and CDKN2A), and age (RB1) disparities. This study prioritizes a group of consensus drivers in HCC, which collectively show vast impacts on the phenotypes. These driver genes may warrant as valuable therapeutic targets of HCC.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental characteristic of spontaneous brain activity is coherent oscillations covering a wide range of frequencies. Interestingly, these temporal oscillations are highly correlated among spatially distributed cortical areas forming structured correlation patterns known as the resting state networks, although the brain is never truly at  rest. Here, we introduce the concept of \\\"harmonic brain modes\\\" - fundamental building blocks of complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. We define these elementary harmonic brain modes as harmonic modes of structural connectivity; i.e. connectome harmonics, yielding fully synchronous neural activity patterns with different frequency oscillations emerging on and constrained by the particular structure of the brain. Hence, this particular definition implicitly links the hitherto poorly understood dimensions of space and time in brain dynamics and its underlying anatomy. Further we show how harmonic brain modes can explain the relationship between neurophysiological, temporal and network-level changes in the brain across different mental states; (wakefulness, sleep, anaesthesia, psychedelic). Notably, when decoded as activation of connectome harmonics, spatial and temporal characteristics of neural activity naturally emerge from the interplay between excitation and inhibition and this critical relation fits the spatial, temporal and neurophysiological changes associated with different mental states. Thus, the introduced framework of harmonic brain modes not only establishes a relation between the spatial structure of correlation patterns and temporal oscillations (linking space and time in brain dynamics), but also enables a new dimension of tools for understanding fundamental principles underlying brain dynamics in different states of consciousness.",

I show that this approach is able to extract many correct associations and provide proof-of-concept that these can provide plausible explanations for comorbidities observed in Swedish and Danish health registry data.",

    "abstract": "Fruit flies recognize hundreds of ecologically relevant odors and respond appropriately to them. The complexity, redundancy and interconnectedness of the olfactory machinery complicate efforts to pinpoint the functional contributions of any component neuron or receptor to behavior. Some contributions can only be elucidated in flies that carry multiple mutations and transgenes, but the production of such flies is currently labor-intensive and time-consuming. Here, we describe a set of transgenic flies that express the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL80 in specific olfactory sensory neurons (OrX-GAL80s). The GAL80s effectively and specifically subtract the activities of GAL4-driven transgenes that impart anatomical and physiological phenotypes. OrX-GAL80s can allow researchers to efficiently activate only one or a few types of functional neurons in an otherwise nonfunctional olfactory background. Such experiments will improve our understanding of the mechanistic connections between odorant inputs and behavioral outputs at the resolution of only a few functional neurons.",

    "abstract": "Cell populations display heterogeneous phenotypic states at multiple scales. Similar to molecular features commonly used to explore cell heterogeneity, cell behavior is a rich phenotypic space that may allow for identification of relevant cell states. Inference of cell state from cell behavior across a time course may enable the investigation of dynamics of transitions between heterogeneous cell states, a task difficult to perform with destructive molecular observations. Cell motility is one such easily observed cell behavior with known biomedical relevance. To investigate cell heterogeneity through the lens of cell behavior, we developed Heteromotility, a software tool to extract quantitative motility features from timelapse cell images. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), myoblasts, and muscle stem cells (MuSCs), Heteromotility analysis identifies multiple motility phenotypes within the population. In all three systems, the motility state identity of individual cells is dynamic. Quantification of state transitions reveals that MuSCs undergoing activation transition through progressive motility states toward the myoblast phenotype. By probability flux analysis, we find that this MuSC motility state system breaks detailed balance, while the MEF and myoblast systems do not. Our data indicate that the system regulating cell behavior can be decomposed into a set of attractor states which depend on the identity of the cell, together with a set of transitions between states governed by inputs from signaling pathways such as oncogenes and growth factors. Within one state, equilibrium formalisms can capture variation in behavior, while switching between states violates equilibrium conditions and would require an external driving force. These results support a conceptual view of the cell as a non-deterministic state automaton, responding to inputs from signaling pathways and generating outputs in the form of observable motile behaviors.",

    "abstract": "General transcription factor TFIID is a key component of RNA polymerase II transcription initiation. Human TFIID is a megadalton-sized complex comprising TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). TBP binds to core promoter DNA, recognizing the TATA-box. We identified a ternary complex formed by TBP and the histone fold (HF) domain-containing TFIID subunits TAF11 and TAF13. We demonstrate that TAF11/TAF13 competes for TBP binding with TATA-box DNA, and also with the N-terminal domain of TAF1 previously implicated in TATA-box mimicry. In an integrative approach combining crystal coordinates, biochemical analyses and data from cross-linking mass-spectrometry (CLMS), we determine the architecture of the TAF11/TAF13/TBP complex, revealing TAF11/TAF13 interaction with the DNA binding surface of TBP. We identify a highly conserved C-terminal TBP-binding domain (CTID) in TAF13 which is essential for supporting cell growth. Our results thus have implications for cellular TFIID assembly and suggest a novel regulatory state for TFIID function.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence has shown that the EBV oncogene LMP1 is not expressed at high levels early after EBV-infection of primary B cells, despite its being essential for the long-term outgrowth of immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). In this study, we found that expression of LMP1 increased fifty-fold between seven days post infection and the LCL state. Metabolic labeling of nascently transcribed mRNA indicated this was primarily a transcription-mediated event. EBNA2, the key viral transcription factor regulating LMP1, and CTCF, an important chromatin insulator, were recruited to the LMP1 locus similarly early and late after infection. However, the activating histone H3K9Ac mark was enriched at the LMP1 promoter in LCLs relative to early-infected B cells. We found that high c-Myc activity in EBV-infected lymphoma cells as well as overexpression of c-Myc in an LCL model system repressed LMP1 transcription. Finally, we found that chemical inhibition of c-Myc expression both in LCLs and early after primary B-cell infection increased LMP1 expression. These data support a model in which high levels of endogenous c-Myc activity induced early after primary B-cell infection directly represses LMP1 transcription.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEEBV is a highly successful pathogen that latently infects greater than 90% of adults worldwide and is also causally associated with a number of B-cell malignancies. EBV expresses a set of viral oncoproteins and non-coding RNAs during the latent life cycle with the potential to promote cancer. Critical among these is the viral latent membrane protein, LMP1. Prior work suggests that LMP1 is essential for EBV to immortalize B cells, but our recent work indicates that LMP1 is not produced at high levels during the first few weeks after infection. Here, we show that the transcription of LMP1 can be negatively regulated by a host transcription factor, c-Myc. Ultimately, understanding the regulation of EBV-encoded oncogenes will allow us to better treat cancers that rely on these viral products for survival.",

This has important implications for enzyme kinetics, thermoadaptation and evolution, but the physical basis of these heat capacity changes is unknown. Here we show by a combination of experiment and simulation, for two quite distinct enzymes (dimeric ketosteroid isomerase and monomeric alpha-glucosidase), that the activation heat capacity change for the catalysed reaction can be predicted through atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations reveal subtle and surprising underlying dynamical changes: tightening of loops around the active site is observed as expected, but crucially, changes in energetic fluctuations are evident across the whole enzyme including important contributions from oligomeric neighbours and domains distal to the active site. This has general implications for understanding enzyme catalysis and demonstrating a direct connection between functionally important microscopic dynamics and macroscopically measurable quantities.",

However, their generation relies on immunizations, which is only amenable to robust proteins and impedes selections in the presence of non-covalent or toxic ligands. To overcome these key limitations, we developed a novel in vitro selection platform, which builds on synthetic nanobodies called sybodies. Inspired by the shape diversity of natural nanobodies, three sybody libraries exhibiting different randomized surface shapes were engineered for high thermal stability. Using ribosome display, exceptionally large libraries were pre-enriched against membrane protein targets and subsequently funneled into a robust phage display process, thereby reducing selection bias. We successfully generated conformation-selective, high affinity sybodies against the human glycine transporter GlyT1, the human equilibrative nucleotide transporter ENT1 and a bacterial ABC transporter. Our platform builds exclusively on commercially available reagents and enables non-specialized labs to generate conformation-specific binders against previously intractable protein targets.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between different tumors within the same organism have major clinical implications, especially in the context of surgery and metastatic disease. Three main explanatory theories (competition, angiogenesis inhibition and proliferation inhibition) have been proposed but precise determinants of the phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here we formalized these theories into mathematical models and performed biological experiments to test them with empirical data. In syngeneic mice bearing two simultaneously implanted tumors, growth of only one of the tumors was significantly suppressed (61% size reduction at day 15, p<0.05). The competition model had to be rejected while the angiogenesis inhibition and proliferation inhibition models were able to describe the data. Additional models including a theory based on distant cytotoxic log-kill effects were unable to fit the data. The proliferation inhibition model was identifiable and minimal (4 parameters), and its descriptive power was validated against the data, including consistency in predictions of single tumor growth when no secondary tumor was present. This theory may also shed new light on single cancer growth insofar as it offers a biologically translatable picture of how local and global action may combine to control local tumor growth, and in particular, the role of tumor-tumor inhibition. This model offers a depiction of concomitant resistance that provides an improved theoretical basis for tumor growth control and may also find utility in therapeutic planning to avoid post-surgery metastatic acceleration.",

Ancient familial links were identified between graves up to 1500 km apart, as well as paternal clans.

Two fundamentally different models have been proposed for the function of microRNAs in gene regulation.

In the second model, in contrast, the role of microRNAs is not to reduce protein concentrations per se but to reduce fluctuations in these concentrations. Here we present genome-wide evidence that mammalian microRNAs frequently function as noise controllers rather than repressors. Moreover, we show that post-transcriptional noise control has been widely adopted across species from bacteria to animals, with microRNAs specifically employed to reduce noise in regulatory and context-specific processes in animals.

We demonstrated the toxic response is tp53-dependent and the toxic effect of tp53 severely reduces the efficiency of precise genome-engineering in hPSCs.

    "abstract": "Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is associated to peripheral fluid homeostasis and cardiovascular function, but recent evidence has also drawn its functional role in the brain. RAS has been described to regulate physiological and behavioral parameters related to stress response, including depressive symptoms. Apparently, RAS can modulate levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TRKB, which are important to neurobiology of depression and antidepressant action. However, interaction between BDNF/TRKB system and RAS in models predictive of antidepressant effect has not been investigated before. Accordingly, in the forced swimming test, we observed an antidepressant-like effect of systemic losartan but not with captopril or enalapril treament. Moreover, infusion of losartan into ventral hippocampus (vHC) and prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) mimicked the consequences of systemically injected losartan, whereas K252a, a blocker of TRK, infused into these brain areas impaired such effect. PD123319, an antagonist of AT2 receptor (AGTR2), infused into PL but not into vHC, also prevented systemic losartan effect. Cultured cortical cells of rat embryos indicate that angiotensin II (ANG2), possibly through AGTR2, increases the surface levels of TRKB, and favors its coupling to FYN, a SRC family kinase. The higher levels of agtr2 in cortical cells were decreased after insult with glutamate, and under this condition an interaction between losartan and ANG2 was achieved. Occurrence of TRKB/AGTR2 heterodimers was also observed, in MG87 cells GFP-tagged AGTR2 co-immunoprecipitated with TRKB. Therefore, antidepressant-like effect of losartan is proposed to occur through a shift of ANG2 binding towards AGTR2, followed by coupling of TRK/FYN and putative TRKB transactivation. Thus, AGTR1 show therapeutic potential as novel antidepressant therapy.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY PARAGRAPHExtracting high-degree interactions and dependences between variables (pairs, triplets, ... k-tuples) is a challenge posed by all omics approaches1, 2. Here we used multivariate mutual information (Ik) analysis3 on single-cell retro-transcription quantitative PCR (sc-RTqPCR) data obtained from midbrain neurons to estimate the k-dimensional topology of their gene expression profiles. 41 mRNAs were quantified and statistical dependences in gene expression levels could be fully described for 21 genes: Ik analysis revealed a complex combinatorial structure including modules of pairs, triplets (up to 6-tuples) sharing strong positive, negative or zero Ik, corresponding to co-varying, clustering and independent sets of genes, respectively. Therefore, Ik analysis simultaneously identified heterogeneity (negative Ik) of the cell population under study and regulatory principles conserved across the population (homogeneity, positive Ik). Moreover, maximum information paths enabled to determine the size and stability of such transcriptional modules. Ik analysis represents a new topological and statistical method of data analysis.",

    "abstract": "The use of single-cell transcriptomics has become a major approach to delineate cell subpopulations and the transitions between them. While various computational tools using different mathematical methods have been developed to infer clusters, marker genes, and cell lineage, none yet integrate these within a mathematical framework to perform multiple tasks coherently. Such coherence is critical for the inference of cell-cell communication, a major remaining challenge. Here we present similarity matrix-based optimization for single-cell data analysis (SoptSC), in which unsupervised clustering, pseudotemporal ordering, lineage inference, and marker gene identification are inferred via a structured cell-to-cell similarity matrix. SoptSC then predicts cell-cell communication networks, enabling reconstruction of complex cell lineages that include feedback or feedforward interactions. Application of SoptSC to early embryonic development, epidermal regeneration, and hematopoiesis demonstrates robust identification of subpopulations, lineage relationships, and pseudotime, and prediction of pathway-specific cell communication patterns regulating processes of development and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The traditional view of cancer evolution states that a cancer genome accumulates a sequential ordering of mutations over a long period of time. However, in recent years it has been suggested that a cancer genome may instead undergo a one-time catastrophic event, such as chromothripsis, where a large number of mutations instead occur simultaneously. A number of potential signatures of chromothripsis have been proposed. In this work we provide a rigorous formulation and analysis of the \\\"ability to walk the derivative chromosome\\\" signature originally proposed by Korbel and Campbell (2013). In particular, we show that this signature, as originally envisioned, may not always be present in a chromothripsis genome and we provide a precise quantification of under what circumstances it would be present. We also propose a variation on this signature, the H/T alternating fraction, which allows us to overcome some of the limitations of the original signature. We apply our measure to both simulated data and a previously analyzed real cancer dataset and find that the H/T alternating fraction may provide useful signal for distinguishing genomes having acquired mutations simultaneously from those acquired in a sequential fashion. An implementation of the H/T alternating fraction is available at https://bitbucket.org/oesperlab/ht-altfrac.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes is tightly regulated to ensure proper chromosome segregation. Each chromosome pair typically undergoes at least one crossover event (crossover assurance) but these exchanges are also strictly limited in number and widely spaced along chromosomes (crossover interference). This has implied the existence of chromosome-wide signals that regulate crossovers, but their molecular basis remains mysterious. Here we characterize a family of four related RING finger proteins in C. elegans. These proteins are recruited to the synaptonemal complex between paired homologs, where they act as two heterodimeric complexes, likely as E3 ubiquitin ligases. Genetic and cytological analysis reveals that they act with additional components to create a self-extinguishing circuit that controls crossover designation and maturation. These proteins also act at the top of a hierarchical chromosome remodeling process that enables crossovers to direct stepwise segregation. Work in diverse phyla indicates that related mechanisms mediate crossover control across eukaryotes.",

Recently, Leuenberger et al. developed an elegant experimental approach to measure protein thermal stability at the proteome scale. The collected data allow us to rigorously test the predictions of the misfolding avoidance hypothesis that highly expressed proteins have evolved to be more stable, and that maintaining thermodynamic stability significantly constrains their evolution. Notably, careful re-analysis of the Leuenberger et al. data across four different organisms reveals no substantial correlation between protein stability and protein abundance. Therefore, the key predictions of the misfolding toxicity and related hypotheses are not supported by available empirical data. The data also suggest that, regardless of protein expression, protein stability does not substantially affect the protein molecular clock across organisms.",

Cytokinins are adenine-based signaling molecules in plants that have never been shown to participate in signal transduction in other kingdoms of life. Here, we show that cytokinins induce the strong expression of the M. tuberculosis gene, Rv0077c. We found that a TetR-like transcriptional regulator, Rv0078, directly repressed expression of the Rv0077c gene. Strikingly, cytokinin-induced expression of Rv0077c resulted in a loss of acid-fast staining of M. tuberculosis. Although acid-fast staining is thought to be associated with changes in the bacterial cell envelope and virulence, Rv0077c-induced loss of acid-fastness did not affect antibiotic susceptibility or attenuate bacterial growth in mice. Collectively, these findings show cytokinins signal transcriptional changes that affect the M. tuberculosis cell envelope, and that cytokinin signaling is no longer limited to the kingdom plantae.",

We found that the NC-GRN triggers up-regulation of pfkfb4 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 4) during this late specification phase. As shown in previous studies, PFKFB4 controls AKT signaling in gastrulas and glycolysis rate in adult cells. Here, we focus on PFKFB4 function in NC during and after neurulation, using time-controlled or hypomorph depletions in vivo. We find that PFKFB4 is essential both for specification of functional premigratory NC and for its migration. PFKFB4-depleted embryos fail activating n-cadherin and late NC specifiers, exhibit severe migration defects, resulting in craniofacial defects. AKT signaling mediates PFKFB4 function in NC late specification, while both AKT signaling and glycolysis regulate migration. These findings highlight novel and critical roles of PFKFB4 activity in later stages of NC development, wired into the NC-GRN.",

It has been proposed that the articulatory motor system would be recruited especially in difficult listening conditions. However, it remains unknown how signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and semantic context affect the recruitment of the articulatory motor system when listening to continuous speech. The aim of the present study was to address the hypothesis that involvement of the articulatory motor cortex increases when the intelligibility and clarity of the spoken sentences decreases, because of noise and the lack of semantic context. We applied Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to the lip and hand representations in the primary motor cortex and measured motor evoked potentials from the lip and hand muscles, respectively, to evaluate motor excitability when young adults listened to sentences. In Experiment 1, we found that the excitability of the lip motor cortex was facilitated during listening to both semantically anomalous and coherent sentences in noise, but neither SNR nor semantic context modulated the facilitation. In Experiment 2, we replicated these findings and found no difference in the excitability of the lip motor cortex between sentences in noise and clear sentences without noise. Thus, our results show that the articulatory motor cortex is involved in speech processing even in optimal and ecologically valid listening conditions and that its involvement is not modulated by the intelligibility and clarity of speech.",

    "abstract": "Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) catalyze the ubiquitylation of substrates many of which are degraded by the 26S proteasome. Their modular architecture enables recognition of numerous substrates via exchangeable substrate receptors that competitively bind to a cullin scaffold with high affinity. Due to the plasticity of these interactions there is ongoing uncertainty how cells maintain a flexible CRL repertoire in view of changing substrate loads. Based on a series of in vivo and in vitro studies, different groups proposed that the exchange of substrate receptors is mediated by a protein exchange factor named cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (Cand1). Here, we have performed quantitative mathematical modeling to support this hypothesis. To this end we first show that the exchange activity of Cand1 necessarily leads to a trade-off between high ligase activity and fast receptor exchange. Supported by previous in vivo studies we argue that this trade-off yields an optimal Cand1 concentration where the time scale for substrate degradation becomes minimal. In a second step we show through simulations that (i) substrates bias the CRL repertoire leading to preferential assembly of ligases for which substrates are available and (ii) differences in binding affinities create a temporal hierarchy for the degradation of substrates. Together, our results provide general constraints for the operating regimes of molecular exchange systems and suggest that Cand1 endows the CRL network with the properties of an \\\"on demand\\\" system allowing cells to dynamically adjust their CRL repertoire to fluctuating substrate abundances.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) are multisubunit protein complexes where exchangeable substrate receptors (SRs) assemble on a cullin scaffold to mediate ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of a large variety of substrates. In humans there are hundreds of different CRLs having potentially thousands of substrates. Due to the high affinity of cullin-SR interactions, it has long been a mystery how cells would maintain flexibility to sample the entire SR repertoire in order to match fluctuating substrate loads. Recent experiments indicate that the exchange of different SRs is mediated by a novel protein exchange factor (Cand1). However, the proposed biochemical function of Cand1 as a promoter of CRL activity remained difficult to reconcile with previous reports of Cand1 acting as an inhibitor of CRL activity in vitro. Here we show that these two findings are not contradictory, but that the exchange activity of Cand1 necessarily leads to a trade-off between high ligase activity and fast receptor exchange which leads us to predict an optimal Cand1 concentration and a temporal hierarchy for substrate degradation. Our results support the view that Cand1 endows the CRL network with the flexibility of an \\\"on demand\\\" system where relative CRL abundances are dictated by substrate availability.",

    "abstract": "In network science, usually there is a critical step known as centrality analysis. This is an important step, since by using centrality measures, a large number of vertices with low priority are set aside and only a few ones remain to be used for further inferential outcomes. In the other words, these measures help us to sieve our large network and distinguish coarse vertices. By that, important decisions could be made based on the circumstances of these vertices on the overall behavior of networks. These vertices are potentially assumed as central or essential nodes. However, the centrality analysis has always been accompanied by a series of ambiguities, since there are a large number of well-known centrality measures, with different algorithms pointing to these essential nodes and there is no well-defined preference. Which measure explore more information in a given network about node essentiality according to the topological features? While here, we tried to provide a pipeline to have a comparison among all proper centrality measures regarding the network structure and choose the most informative one according to dimensional reduction methods. Central Informative Nodes in Network Analysis (CINNA) package is prepared to gather all required function for centrality analysis in the weighted/unweighted and directed/undirected networks.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationCINNA is available in CRAN, including a tutorial.

    "abstract": "Health risk factors such as body mass index (BMI), serum cholesterol and blood pressure are associated with many common diseases. It often remains unclear whether the risk factors are cause or consequence of disease, or whether the associations are the result of confounding. Genetic methods are useful to infer causality because genetic variants are present from birth and therefore unlikely to be confounded with environmental factors. We develop and apply a method (GSMR) that performs a multi-SNP Mendelian Randomization analysis using summary-level data from large genome-wide association studies (sample sizes of up to 405,072) to test the causal associations of BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, serum cholesterols, blood pressures, height and years of schooling (EduYears) with a range of common diseases. We identify a number of causal associations including a protective effect of LDL-cholesterol against type-2 diabetes (T2D) that might explain the side effects of statins on T2D, a protective effect of EduYears against Alzheimers disease, and bidirectional associations with opposite effects (e.g. higher BMI increases the risk of T2D but the effect T2D of BMI is negative). HDL-cholesterol has a significant risk effect on age-related macular degeneration, and the effect size remains significant accounting for the other risk factors. Our study develops powerful tools to integrate summary data from large studies to infer causality, and provides important candidates to be prioritized for further studies in medical research and for drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Deep-sequencing of virus isolates using short-read sequencing technologies is problematic since viruses are often present in complexes sharing a high-degree of sequence identity. The full-length genomes of such highly-similar viruses cannot be assembled accurately from short sequencing reads. We present a new method, CIDER-Seq (Circular DNA Enrichment Sequencing) which successfully generates accurate full-length virus genomes from individual sequencing reads with no sequence assembly required. CIDER-Seq operates by combining a PCR-free, circular DNA enrichment protocol with Single Molecule Real Time sequencing and a new sequence deconcatenation algorithm. We apply our technique to produce more than 1,200 full-length, highly accurate geminivirus genomes from RNAi-transgenic and control plants in a field trial in Kenya. Using CIDER-Seq we can demonstrate for the first time that the expression of antiviral doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) in transgenic plants causes a consistent shift in virus populations towards species sharing low homology to the transgene derived dsRNA. Our results show that CIDER-seq is a powerful, cost-effective tool for accurately sequencing circular DNA viruses, with future applications in deep-sequencing other forms of circular DNA such as transposons and plasmids.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDi) has revealed fundamental properties of neocortical processing at macroscopic scales. Since for each pixel VSDi signals report the average membrane potential over hundreds of neurons, it seems natural to use a mean-field formalism to model such signals. Here, we present a mean-field model of networks of Adaptive Exponential (AdEx) integrate-and-fire neurons, with conductance-based synaptic interactions. We study here a network of regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons and fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons. We use a Master Equation formalism, together with a semi-analytic approach to the transfer function of AdEx neurons to describe the average dynamics of the coupled populations. We compare the predictions of this mean-field model to simulated networks of RS-FS cells, first at the level of the spontaneous activity of the network, which is well predicted by the analytical description. Second, we investigate the response of the network to time-varying external input, and show that the mean-field model predicts the response time course of the population. Finally, to model VSDi signals, we consider a one-dimensional ring model made of interconnected RS-FS mean-field units. We found that this model can reproduce the spatio-temporal patterns seen in VSDi of awake monkey visual cortex as a response to local and transient visual stimuli. Conversely, we show that the model allows one to infer physiological parameters from the experimentally-recorded spatio-temporal patterns.",

    "abstract": "Stabilization of the central carbohydrate and energy metabolism plays a key role in plant stress response. As the primary photosynthetic products, carbohydrates are substrate for numerous metabolic and stress-protective reactions. Further, they have been shown to be involved in diverse signalling processes finally affecting and regulating plant stress response on a whole plant level. Sucrose metabolism is known to be central to many stress-related processes and enzymes catalysing its biosynthesis, transport and degradation have been shown to significantly impact stress resistance and acclimation output. However, due to the cyclic structure of sucrose metabolism involving sucrose cleavage in multiple compartments as well as energy-demanding re-synthesis via hexose phosphorylation, it is challenging to derive an unambiguous picture of its contribution to stress reactions. In the present study, a combined stress experiment comprising cold and high-light identified metabolism of sucrose and fumaric acid to significantly separate the stress response of a cold susceptible and a tolerant natural accession of Arabidopsis thaliana. Kinetic modelling and simulation of subcellular rates of invertase-driven sucrose cleavage revealed a contrasting picture between the susceptible and the tolerant accession pointing to an important role of vacuolar invertase during initial stress response. Using a T-DNA insertion mutant with a dramatically reduced invertase activity provided evidence for a central role of the enzyme in stabilizing photosynthesis and the central energy metabolism during freezing and high-light stress. Reducing vacuolar invertase activity to about 3% of the wild type resulted in a strong increase of ADP and ATP levels indicating a severe effect on cytosolic and plastidial energy balance. Together with a significant decrease of maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) these results suggest that vacuolar invertase activity stabilizes cytosolic energy metabolism by supplying hexose equivalents being phosphorylated in the cytosol. Finally, the accompanying ATP consumption is essential for cytosolic phosphate balance which directly affects photosynthetic performance by the supply of ADP being crucial for photosynthetic ATP production.",

    "abstract": "We employ a reporter assay and Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-seq) to study translational regulation by RNA-binding proteins, in bacteria. We designed 82 constructs, each with a single hairpin based on the binding sites of the RNA-binding coat proteins of phages MS2, PP7, GA, and Q{beta}, at various positions within the N-terminus of a reporter gene. In the absence of RNA-binding proteins, the translation level depends on hairpin location, and exhibits a three-nucleotide periodicity. For hairpin positions within the initiation region, we observe strong translational repression in the presence of its cognate RNA-binding protein. In vivo SHAPE-seq results for a representative construct indicate that the repression phenomenon correlates with a wide-swath of protection, including the hairpin and extending past the ribosome binding site. Consequently, our data suggest that the protection provided by the RBP-hairpin complex inhibits ribosomal initiation. Finally, utilizing the repression phenomenon for quantifying protein-RNA binding affinity in vivo, we both observe partially contrasting results to previous in vitro and in situ studies, and additionally, show that this method can be used in a high-throughput assay for a quantitative study of protein-RNA binding in vivo.",
