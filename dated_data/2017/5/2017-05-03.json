    "abstract": "In the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-1 infection is no longer tantamount to early death. Yet the benefits of treatment are available only to those who can access, afford, and tolerate taking daily pills. True cure is challenged by HIV latency, the ability of chromosomally integrated virus to persist within memory CD4+ T cells in a non-replicative state and activate when ART is discontinued. Using a mathematical model of HIV dynamics, we demonstrate that treatment strategies offering modest but continual enhancement of reservoir clearance rates result in faster cure than abrupt, one-time reductions in reservoir size. We frame this concept in terms of compounding interest: small changes in interest rate drastically improve returns over time. On ART, latent cell proliferation rates are orders of magnitude larger than activation and new infection rates. Contingent on subtypes of cells that may make up the reservoir and their respective proliferation rates, our model predicts that coupling clinically available, anti-proliferative therapies with ART could result in functional cure within 2-10 years rather than several decades on ART alone.",

    "abstract": "The relation between DNA methylation and chromatin structure is still largely unknown. By analyzing a large set of sequencing data, we observed a long-range power law correlation of DNA methylation with cell-class-specific scaling exponents in the range of thousands to millions of base pairs. We showed such cell-class-specific scaling exponents are caused by different patchiness of DNA methylation in different cells. By modeling the chromatin structure using Hi-C data and mapping the methylation level onto the modeled structure, we demonstrated the patchiness of DNA methylation is related to chromatin structure. The scaling exponents of the power law correlation is thus a display of the spatial organization of chromatin. Besides, the local correlation of DNA methylation is associated with nucleosome positioning and different between partially-methylated-domain and non-partially-methylated-domain, suggesting their different chromatin structures at several nucleosomes level. Our study provides a novel view of the spatial organization of chromatin structure from a perspective of DNA methylation, in which both long-range and local correlations of DNA methylation along the genome reflect the spatial organization of chromatin.",

    "abstract": "SummaryPerceptual decisions require the transformation of raw sensory inputs into cortical representations suitable for stimulus discrimination. One of the best-known examples of this transformation involves the middle temporal area (MT) of the primate visual cortex. Area MT provides a robust representation of stimulus motion, and previous work has shown that it contributes causally to performance on motion discrimination tasks. Here we report that the strength of this contribution can be highly plastic: Depending on the recent training history, pharmacological inactivation of MT can severely impair motion discrimination, or it can have little detectable influence. Similarly, depending on training, microstimulation can bias motion perception or simply introduce noise. Further analysis of neural and behavioral data suggests that training shifts the readout of motion information between MT and lower-level cortical areas. These results show that the contribution of individual brain regions to conscious perception can shift flexibly depending on sensory experience.",

    "abstract": "The defining feature of the mycobacterial outer membrane (OM) is the presence of mycolic acids (MAs), which in part render the bilayer extremely hydrophobic and impermeable to external insults, including many antibiotics. While the biosynthetic pathway of MAs is well studied, the mechanism(s) by which these lipids are transported across the cell envelope is(are) much less known. MmpL3, an essential inner membrane (IM) protein, is implicated in MA transport, but its exact function has not been elucidated. It is believed to be the cellular target of several anti-mycobacterial compounds; however, evidence for direct inhibition of MmpL3 activity is also lacking. Here, we establish that MmpL3 is the MA flippase at the IM of mycobacteria, and is the molecular target of BM212, a 1,5-diarylpyrrole compound. We develop assays that selectively access mycolates on the surface of Mycobacterium smegmatis spheroplasts, allowing us to monitor flipping of MAs across the IM. Using these assays, we establish the mechanism-of-action of BM212 as a potent MmpL3 inhibitor, and employ it as a molecular probe to demonstrate the requirement for functional MmpL3 in the transport of MAs across the IM. Finally, we show that BM212 binds MmpL3 directly and inhibits its activity. Our work provides fundamental insights into OM biogenesis and MA transport in mycobacteria. Furthermore, our assays serve as an important platform for accelerating the validation of small molecules that target MmpL3, and their development as future anti-tuberculosis drugs.",

    "abstract": "Pattern separation is a process that minimizes overlap between patterns of neuronal activity representing similar experiences. Theoretical work suggests that the dentate gyrus (DG) performs this role for memory processing but a direct demonstration is lacking. One limitation is the difficulty to measure DG inputs and outputs simultaneously. To rigorously assess pattern separation by DG circuitry, we used mouse brain slices to stimulate DG afferents and simultaneously record DG granule cells (GCs) and interneurons. Output spiketrains of GCs are more dissimilar than their input spiketrains, demonstrating for the first time temporal pattern separation at the level of single neurons in the DG. Pattern separation is larger in GCs than in fast-spiking interneurons and hilar mossy cells, and is amplified in CA3 pyramidal cells. Analysis of the neural noise and computational modelling suggest that this form of pattern separation is not explained by simple randomness and arises from specific presynaptic dynamics. Overall, by reframing the concept of pattern separation in dynamic terms and by connecting it to the physiology of different types of neurons, our study offers a new window of understanding in how hippocampal networks might support episodic memory.",

    "abstract": "Divergence time estimation -- the calibration of a phylogeny to geological time -- is a integral first step in modelling the tempo of biological evolution (traits and lineages). However, despite increasingly sophisticated methods to infer divergence times from molecular genetic sequences, the estimated age of many nodes across the tree of life contrast significantly and consistently with timeframes conveyed by the fossil record. This is perhaps best exemplified by crown angiosperms, where molecular clock (Triassic) estimates predate the oldest (Early Cretaceous) undisputed angiosperm fossils by tens of millions of years or more. While the incompleteness of the fossil record is a common concern, issues of data limitation and model inadequacy are viable (if underexplored) alternative explanations. In this vein, Beaulieu et al. (2015) convincingly demonstrated how methods of divergence time inference can be misled by both (i) extreme state-dependent molecular substitution rate heterogeneity and (ii) biased sampling of representative major lineages. While these (essentially model-violation) results are robust (and probably common in empirical data sets), we note a further alternative: that the configuration of the statistical inference problem alone (i.e., the parameters, their relationships, and associated priors) precluded the reconstruction of the paleontological timeframe for the crown age of angiosperms. We demonstrate, through sampling from the joint prior (formed by combining the tree (diversification) prior with the various calibration densities specified for fossil-calibrated nodes), that with no data present at all, an Early Cretaceous crown angiosperms is rejected (i.e., has essentially zero probability). More worrisome, however, is that for the 24 nodes calibrated by fossils, almost all have indistinguishable marginal prior and posterior age distributions, indicating an absence of relevant information in the data. Given that these calibrated nodes are strategically placed in disparate regions of the tree, they essentially anchor the tree scaffold, and so the posterior inference for the tree as a whole is largely determined by the pseudo-data present in the (often arbitrary) calibration densities. We recommend, as for any Bayesian analysis, that marginal prior and posterior distributions be carefully compared, especially for parameters of direct interest. Finally, we note that the results presented here do not refute the biological modelling concerns identified by Beaulieu et al. (2015). Both sets of issues remain apposite to the goals of accurate divergence time estimation, and only by considering them in tandem can we move forward more confidently.

    "abstract": "Recent calls for a revision of standard evolutionary theory (SET) are based in part on arguments about the reciprocal causation. Reciprocal causation means that cause-effect relationships are obscured, as a cause could later become an effect and vice versa. Such dynamic cause-effect relationships raise questions about the distinction between proximate and ultimate causes, as originally formulated by Ernst Mayr. They have also motivated some biologists and philosophers to argue for an Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES). The EES will supposedly expand the scope of the Modern Synthesis (MS) and Standard Evolutionary Theory (SET), which has been characterized as gene-centred, relying primarily on natural selection and largely neglecting reciprocal causation. I critically examine these claims, with a special focus on the last conjecture and conclude - on the contrary- that reciprocal causation has long been recognized as important both in SET and in the MS tradition, although it remains underexplored. Numerous empirical examples of reciprocal causation in the form of positive and negative feedbacks are now well known from both natural and laboratory systems. Reciprocal causation have also been explicitly incorporated in mathematical models of coevolutionary arms races, frequency-dependent selection, eco-evolutionary dynamics and sexual selection. Such dynamic feedbacks were already recognized by Richard Levins and Richard Lewontin, well before the recent call for an EES. Reciprocal causation and dynamic feedbacks is one of the few contributions of dialectical thinking and Marxist philosophy in evolutionary theory, and should be recognized as such. I discuss some promising empirical and analytical tools to study reciprocal causation and the implications for the EES. While reciprocal causation have helped us to understand many evolutionary processes, I caution against uncritical extension of dialectics towards heredity and constructive development, particularly if such extensions involves attempts to restore Lamarckian or \\\"soft inheritance\\\".",

    "abstract": "The distribution of deleterious genetic variation across human populations is a key issue in evolutionary biology and medical genetics. However, the impact of different modes of subsistence on recent changes in population size, patterns of gene flow, and deleterious mutational load remains unclear. Here, we report high-coverage exome sequencing data from various populations of rainforest hunter-gatherers and farmers from central Africa. We find that the recent demographic histories of hunter-gatherers and farmers differed considerably, with population collapses for hunter-gatherers and expansions for farmers, accompanied by increased gene flow. We show that purifying selection against deleterious alleles is of similar efficiency across African populations, in contrast with Europeans where we detect weaker purifying selection. Furthermore, the per-individual mutation load of rainforest hunter-gatherers is similar to that of farmers, under both additive and recessive models. Our results indicate that differences in the cultural practices and demographic regimes of African populations have not resulted in large differences in mutational burden, and highlight the beneficial role of gene flow in reshaping the distribution of deleterious genetic variation across human populations.",

Here we perform in vivo single molecule imaging in early Drosophila melanogaster embryos of the transcription factor Bicoid that forms a gradient and initiates patterning along the anteroposterior axis. We observe that Bicoid binds to DNA with a rapid off-rate, such that its average occupancy at target loci is on-rate dependent, a property required for concentration-sensitive regulation. Surprisingly, we also observe abundant specific DNA binding in posterior nuclei, where Bicoid levels are vanishingly low. Live embryo imaging reveals spatiotemporal \\\"hubs\\\" of local high Bicoid concentration that are dependent on the ubiquitous maternal factor Zelda.

    "abstract": "In situ hybridization is a widely employed technique allowing spatial visualization of gene expression in fixed specimens. It has proven to be essential to our understanding of biological processes, including developmental regulation. In situ protocols are today routine in numerous laboratories, and although details might change, they all include a hybridization step, where specific antisense RNA or DNA probes anneal to the target nucleic acids strand. This step, in general, is carried out at high temperatures and in a denaturing solution, the hybridization buffer, commonly containing 50% (v/v) formamide. An important drawback is that hot formamide poses a significant health risk and so must be handled with great care.\\n\\nWe were prompted to test alternative hybridization solutions for in situ detection of gene expression in the medusa of the hydrozoan Clytia hemisphaerica, where traditional protocols caused extensive deterioration of the morphology and texture during hybridization, hindering observation and interpretation of results. Inspired by optimized protocols for Northern and Southern blot analysis, we substituted the 50% formamide with an equal volume of 8 M urea solution in the hybridization buffer. The new protocol yielded better morphologies and consistency of tissues, and also notably improved the resolution of the signal, allowing more precise localization of gene expression, as well as reduced staining at non-specific sites. Given the improved results using a less toxic hybridization solution, we tested the urea protocol on a number of other metazoans: two brachiopod species (Novocrania anomala and Terebratalia transversa) and the worm Priapulus caudatus, obtaining a similar reduction of aspecific probe binding. Overall, substitution of formamide by urea in in situ hybridization offers safer alternative protocols, potentially useful in research, medical and teaching contexts. We encourage other workers to test this approach on their study organisms, and hope that they will also obtain better sample preservation, more precise expression patterns and fewer problems due to aspecific staining, as we report here for Clytia medusae and Novocrania and Terebratalia developing larvae.",

To address this, High speed atomic force microscopy was used for direct visualization of the spontaneous dynamics of CENP-A nucleosomes at the sub-second time scale. We report that CENP-A nucleosomes change conformation spontaneously and reversibly, utilizing two major pathways: unwrapping, and looping of the DNA; enabling core transfer between neighboring DNA substrates.

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are essential organelles, found within eukaryotic cells, which contain their own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has traditionally been used in population genetic and biogeographic studies as a maternally-inherited and evolutionary-neutral genetic marker. However, it is now clear that polymorphisms within the mtDNA sequence are routinely non-neutral, and furthermore several studies have suggested that such mtDNA polymorphisms are also sensitive to thermal selection. These observations led to the formulation of the \\\"mitochondrial climatic adaptation\\\" hypothesis, for which all published evidence to date is correlational. Here, we use laboratory-based experimental evolution in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to test whether thermal selection can shift population frequencies of two mtDNA haplogroups whose natural frequencies exhibit clinal associations with latitude along the Australian east-coast. We present experimental evidence that the thermal regime in which the laboratory populations were maintained, drove changes in haplogroup frequencies across generations. Our results strengthen the emerging view that intra-specific mtDNA variants are sensitive to selection, and suggest spatial distributions of mtDNA variants in natural populations of metazoans might reflect adaptation to climatic environments rather than within-population coalescence and diffusion of selectively-neutral haplotypes across populations.\\n\\nImpact SummaryWe applied experimental laboratory evolution to provide the first direct test of the \\\"mitochondrial climatic hypothesis,\\\" which predicts that the variation of mitochondrial genomes across natural distributions of metazoans can be shaped by thermal selection. Our design is the first of its kind when it comes to inferring the role of thermal selection in shaping mtDNA frequencies in nature. We harness two naturally occurring mtDNA haplotypes of Drosophila melanogaster that segregate along the east coast of Australia. One of these haplotypes predominates at sub-tropical northern latitudes and the other in the temperate and cooler south of the country. We then compete these haplotypes against each other in replicated experimental fly populations submitted to one of four different thermal regimes, in either the presence or absence of infection by Wolbachia, a coevolved endosymbiont that also exhibits maternal transmission.\\n\\nWe confirm that when evolving in the laboratory under warmer conditions, a haplotype naturally predominating in subtropical conditions outcompetes a haplotype that predominates at cooler Australian latitudes in the wild. We see this effect on haplotype frequencies in females in populations where latent Wolbachia infections had been purged.\\n\\nOur results also suggest that sex-specificity of mtDNA effects, and co-occurrence of other maternally-inherited microbiotic entities - of which Wolbachia is just one example - are likely to shape the trajectories of mitochondrial genome evolution in the wild.",

    "abstract": "As whole-genome sequencing technologies improve and accurate maps of the entire genome are assembled, short open-reading frames (sORFs) are garnering interest as functionally important regions that were previously overlooked. However, there is a paucity of tools available to investigate variants in sORF regions of the genome. Here we investigate the performance of commonly used tools for variant calling and variant prioritisation in these regions, and present a framework for optimising these processes. First, the performance of four widely used germline variant calling algorithms is systematically compared. Haplotype Caller is found to perform best across the whole genome, but FreeBayes is shown to produce the most accurate variant set in sORF regions. An accurate set of variants is found by taking the intersection of called variants. The potential deleteriousness of each variant is then predicted using a pathogenicity scoring algorithm developed here, called sORF-c. This algorithm uses supervised machine-learning to predict the pathogenicity of each variant, based on a holistic range of functional, conservation-based and region-based scores defined for each variant. By training on a dataset of over 130,000 variants, sORF-c outperforms other comparable pathogenicity scoring algorithms on a test set of variants in sORF regions of the human genome.\\n\\nList of Abbreviations",

    "abstract": "De Bruijn graphs are a common assembly data structure for large sequencing datasets. But with the advances in sequencing technologies, assembling high coverage datasets has become a computational challenge. Read normalization, which removes redundancy in large datasets, is widely applied to reduce resource requirements. Current normalization algorithms, though efficient, provide no guarantee to preserve important k-mers that form connections between regions in the graph. Here, normalization is phrased as a set multi-cover problem on reads and a heuristic algorithm, ORNA, is proposed. ORNA normalizes to the minimum number of reads required to retain all k-mers and their relative kmer abundances from the original dataset. Hence, all connections and coverage information from the original graph are preserved. ORNA was tested on various RNA-seq datasets with different coverage values. It was compared to the current normalization algorithms and was found to be performing better. It is shown that combining read error correction and normalization allows more accurate and resource efficient RNA assemblies compared to the original dataset. Further, an application was proposed in which multiple datasets were combined and normalized to predict novel transcripts that would have been missed otherwise. Finally, ORNA is a general purpose normalization algorithm that is fast and significantly reduces datasets with little loss of assembly quality.\\n\\nORNA can be found under https://github.com/SchulzLab/ORNA",

    "abstract": "Many cellular processes require sub-cellular positioning of proteins. This can be due to passive mechanisms such as recruitment by existing landmarks or curvature sensing. However, in bacteria active self-positioning is likely to play a role in multiple processes, including the positioning of the future division site and cytoplasmic protein clusters. How can such dynamic clusters be formed and positioned? Here, we present a model for the self-organization and positioning of dynamic protein clusters into regularly repeating patterns based on a phase-locked Turing pattern. A single peak in the concentration is always positioned at mid-domain (mid-cell) while two peaks are positioned one at each quarter-position etc. Furthermore, domain growth results in peak-splitting and pattern doubling. We argue that the model may explain the regular positioning of the highly conserved Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes on the bacterial nucleoid and provides an attractive mechanism for the self-positioning of dynamic protein clusters in other systems.",

    "abstract": "Most cases of breast cancer (BC) are estrogen receptor -positive (ER+) at diagnosis. The presence of ER drives the therapeutic approach for this disease, which often consists of endocrine therapy (ET). 4OH-Tamoxifen and faslodex (i.e., fulvestrant - ICI182,780) are two ETs that render tumor cells insensitive to 17{beta}-estradiol (E2)-dependent proliferative stimuli and prevent BC progression. However, ET has limitations and serious failures in different tissues and organs. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel drugs to fight BC in the clinic. Re-positioning of old drugs for new clinical purposes is an attractive alternative for drug discovery. For this analysis, we focused on the modulation of intracellular ER levels in BC cells as target for the screening of about 900 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved compounds that would hinder E2:ER signaling and inhibit BC cell proliferation. We found that carfilzomib induces ER degradation and prevents E2 signaling and cell proliferation in two ER+ BC cell lines. Remarkably, the analysis of carfilzomib effects on a cell model system with an acquired resistance to 4OH-tamoxifen revealed that this drug has an antiproliferative effect superior to faslodex in BC cells. Therefore, our results identify carfilzomib as a drug preventing E2:ER signaling and cell proliferation in BC cells and suggest its possible re-position for the treatment of ER+ BC as well as for those diseases that have acquired resistance to 4OH-tamoxifen.",

    "abstract": "Precise execution of recombination during meiosis is essential for forming chromosomally balanced gametes. Meiotic recombination initiates with the formation and resection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Binding of replication protein A (RPA) at resected DSBs fosters association of RAD51 and DMC1, the primary effectors of homology search. It is well appreciated that cellular responses to meiotic DSBs are critical for efficient repair and quality control, but molecular features of these responses remain poorly understood, particularly in mammals. Here we provide evidence that the DNA damage response protein kinase ATR is crucial for meiotic recombination and completion of meiotic prophase in mice. Using a hypomorphic Atr mutation and pharmacological inhibition of ATR in vivo and in cultured spermatocytes, we show that ATR, through its effector kinase CHK1, promotes efficient RAD51 and DMC1 assembly at RPA-coated DSB sites and establishment of interhomolog connections during meiosis. Furthermore, our findings suggest that ATR promotes local accumulation of recombination markers on unsynapsed axes during meiotic prophase to favor homologous chromosome synapsis. These data reveal that ATR plays multiple roles in mammalian meiotic recombination.",

    "abstract": "Singular regions of the globe harbour a disproportionally large fraction of extant biodiversity. Spatial biodiversity gradients are frequently associated to extant ecological conditions using statistical models, but more rarely to paleo-environmental conditions, especially beyond the Quaternary. On one hand the role of plate tectonics in shaping the extant diversity of lineages is supported by numerous phylogenetic and fossil evidences, and on the other hand the spatial variation of biodiversity across the globe is rarely associated to geodynamic variables. In this study, we propose that plate tectonics explain the current location of hotspots of endemic richness across the globe. As an illustration, we used paleogeographies in a model, which quantifies through time and for each cell the potential dispersal across disconnected habitat patches. Rare events of dispersal across dynamic straits of unsuitable habitats allows species colonisation and that a subsequent absence of gene flow could lead to in-situ speciation. We evaluated whether this process could pinpoint the locations of hotspots of endemic richness computed from the ranges of 181,603 species across 14 taxonomic groups. The significant congruence between the regions highlighted by the model and the endemic richness provides evidences of the contribution of plate tectonics in shaping global biodiversity gradients. Places with high tectonic complexity, predominantly located at the confluence of major lithospheric plates such as the Mediterranean basin, Central America, Madagascar and South East Asia likely provided favourable circumstances for allopatric speciation and the emergence of new species across straits. While our illustration supports the role of plate tectonics, accounting for deep time geological events in spatial models of extant biodiversity is not straightforward. Future research should develop quantitative spatial models of biodiversity including the dynamic of ancient habitats.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia (Alphaproteobacteria, Rickettsiales) is the most common, and arguably one of the most important inherited symbionts. Molecular differentiation of Wolbachia strains is routinely performed with a set of five multilocus sequence typing (MLST) markers. However, since its inception in 2006, the performance of MLST in Wolbachia strain typing has not been assessed objectively. Here, we evaluate the properties of Wolbachia MLST markers and compare it to 252 other single copy loci present in the genome of most Wolbachia strains. Specifically, we investigated how well MLST performs at strain differentiation, at reflecting genetic diversity of strains, and as phylogenetic marker. We find that MLST loci are outperformed by other loci at all tasks they are currently employed for, and thus that they do not reflect the properties of a Wolbachia strain very well. We argue that whole genome typing approaches should be used for Wolbachia typing in the future. Alternatively, if few-loci-approaches are necessary, we provide a characterization of 252 single copy loci for a number a criteria, which may assist in designing specific typing systems or phylogenetic studies.",

However, most evidence assumes that mutation rate is constant. It has been suggested that heterozygosity is mutagenic (5-8). If so, an alternative explanation of the data becomes possible. Instead of non-Africans sharing relatively more bases with Neanderthals due to interbreeding, Africans could appear unexpectedly divergent due to their mutation rate not having been lowered when diversity was lost during the out of Africa bottleneck. I therefore tested a series of predictions aimed at distinguishing mutation slowdown from inter-breeding. Predictions from mutation slowdown are generally better supported. For example, the signal used to infer inter-breeding remains even when Neanderthal sequences are excluded. I conclude that, while some inter-breeding probably did occur, an appreciable component of the signal seems better explained by mutation slowdown.",

    "abstract": "Following the suggestion that a command encoding the expected here-and-now target location feeds the oculomotor system during interceptive saccades, we tested whether this command originates in the deep superior colliculus (SC). Monkeys generated saccades to targets that were static or moving along the preferred axis, away from (outward) or toward a fixated target (inward) with a constant speed (20{degrees}/s). Vertical and horizontal motions were also tested. Extracellular activity of 57 saccade-related neurons was recorded in 3 monkeys. The movement field (MF) parameters (boundaries, center and firing rate) were estimated after spline fitting the relation between the saccade amplitude and the average firing rate of the motor burst. During radial motion, the inner MF boundary shifted in the same direction as the target motion for some neurons, not all. During vertical motion, both lower and upper boundaries were shifted upward during upward motion whereas the upper boundary only shifted during downward motions. For horizontal motions, the medial boundaries were not changed. The MF center was shifted only for outward motion. Regardless of the motion direction, the average firing rate was consistently reduced during interceptive saccades. Our study shows an involvement of the saccade-related burst of SC neurons in steering the gaze toward a moving target. When observed, the shifts of MF boundary in the direction of target motion correspond to commands related to antecedent target locations. The absence of shift in the opposite direction shows that SC activity does not issue predictive commands related to the future target location.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBy comparing the movement field (MF) of saccade-related neurons between saccades toward static and moving targets, we show that the motor burst issued by neurons in the superior colliculus does not convey commands related to the future location of a moving target. During interceptive saccades, the active population consists of a continuum of neurons, ranging from cells exhibiting a shift in the center or boundary of their MF to cells which exhibit no change. The shifts correspond to residual activity related to the fact that the active population does not change as fast as the target in the visual field. By contrast, the absence of shift indicates commands related to the current target location, as if it were static.",

In the current study, we investigated neural substrates that interact with task-evoked functional connectivity during cognitive control. We conducted a human fMRI study where participants selectively attended to a category of visual stimuli in the presence of competing distractors from another stimulus category. To study flexible interactions between brain regions, we performed a dynamic functional connectivity analysis to estimate temporal changes in connectivity strength between brain regions under different levels of cognitive control. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we found that cognitive control selectively enhances functional connectivity for prioritizing the processing of task-relevant information. By regressing temporal changes in connectivity strength against activity patterns elsewhere in the brain, we localized frontal and parietal regions that potentially provide top-down biasing signals for influencing, or reading information out from, task-evoked functional connectivity. Our results suggest that in addition to modulating local activity, fronto-parietal regions could also exert top-down biasing signals to influence functional connectivity between distributed brain regions.",

MADS-domain proteins bind as dimers to AT-rich sequences termed  CArG-boxes which share the consensus 5-CC(A/T)6GG-3. Since only a fraction of the abundant CArG-boxes in the Arabidopsis genome are bound by SEPALLATA3, more elaborate principles have to be discovered to better understand which features turn CArG-box sequences into genuine recognition sites. Here, we investigated to which extent the shape of the DNA contributes to the DNA-binding specificity of SEPALLATA3. We determined in vitro binding affinities of SEPALLATA3 to a variety of DNA probes which all contain the CArG-box motif, but differ in their DNA shape characteristics. We found that binding affinity correlates well with certain DNA shape features associated with  A-tracts. Analysis of SEPALLATA3 proteins with single amino acid substitutions in the DNA-binding MADS-domain further revealed that a highly conserved arginine residue, which is expected to contact the DNA minor groove, contributes significantly to the shape readout. Our studies show that the specific recognition of cis-regulatory elements by plant MADS-domain transcription factors heavily depend on shape readout mechanisms and that the absence of a critical arginine residue in the MADS-domain impairs binding specificity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIndels, though differing in allele sequence and position, are biologically equivalent when they lead to the same altered sequences. Storing biologically equivalent indels as distinct entries in databases causes data redundancy, and may mislead downstream analysis and interpretations. About 10% of the human indels stored in dbSNP are redundant. It is thus desirable to have a unified system for identifying and representing equivalent indels in publically available databases. Moreover, a unified system is also desirable to compare the indel calling results produced by different tools. This paper describes UPS-indel, a utility tool that creates a universal positioning system for indels so that equivalent indels can be uniquely determined by their coordinates in the new system, which also can be used to compare indel calling results produced by different tools.\\n\\nResultsUPS-indel identifies nearly 15% indels in dbSNP (version 142) as redundant across all human chromosomes, higher than previously reported. When applied to COSMIC coding and noncoding indel datasets, UPS-indel identifies nearly 29% and 13% indels as redundant, respectively. Comparing the performance of UPS-indel with existing variant normalization tools vt normalize, BCFtools, and GATK LeftAlignAndTrimVariants shows that UPS-indel is able to identify 456,352 more redundant indels in dbSNP; 2,118 more in COSMIC coding, and 553 more in COSMIC noncoding indel dataset in addition to the ones reported jointly by these tools. Moreover, comparing UPS-indel to other state-of-the-art approaches for indel call set comparison demonstrates that UPS-indel is clearly superior to other approaches in finding indels in common among call sets.\\n\\nConclusionsUPS-indel is theoretically proven to find all equivalent indels, and is thus exhaustive.

    "abstract": "Triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells (TREM2) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is expressed in macrophages, dendritic cells, microglia, and osteoclasts. TREM2 plays a role in phagocytosis, regulates release of cytokine, contributes to microglia maintenance, and its ectodomain is shed from the cell surface. Using both pharmacological and genetic approaches we report here that the main protease contributing to the release of TREM2 ectodomain is ADAM17, (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain containing protein, also called TACE, TNF converting enzyme) while ADAM10 plays a minor role. Using mutational analysis, we demonstrate that the main cleavage site of the sheddases is located within the stalk region of TREM2 proximal to the plasma membrane. Complementary biochemical experiments reveal that cleavage occurs between histidine 157 and serine 158. Shedding is not altered for the R47H-mutated TREM2 protein that confers an increased risk for the development of Alzheimers disease. O-glycosylation is detected within the stalk region, but distant to the cleavage site. These findings reveal a link between shedding of TREM2 and its regulation during inflammatory conditions or chronic neurodegenerative disease like AD in which activity or expression of sheddases might be altered.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory inputs are organized in an array of parallel functional units (glomeruli), each relaying information from sensory neurons that express a given odorant receptor to a small population of output neurons, mitral/tufted (MT) cells. MT cells have complex temporal responses to odorants, but how these diverse responses relate to stimulus features is not known. We recorded in awake mice responses from \\\"sister\\\" MT cells that receive input from a functionally-characterized, genetically identified glomerulus, corresponding to a specific receptor (M72). Despite receiving similar inputs, sister MT cells exhibited temporally diverse, concentration variant, excitatory and inhibitory responses to most M72 ligands. In contrast, the strongest known ligand for M72 elicited temporally-stereotyped, early excitatory responses in all sister MT cells that persisted across all odor concentrations. Our data demonstrate that information about ligand affinity is encoded in the collective stereotypy or diversity of activity among sister MT cells within a glomerular functional unit in concentration-independent manner.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe COPI coat forms transport vesicles from the Golgi complex and plays a poorly defined role in endocytic trafficking. Here we show that COPI mediates delivery of a budding yeast SNARE (Snc1) from early endosomes to the Golgi complex through recognition of a polyubiquitin sorting signal. Snc1 is a v-SNARE that drives fusion of exocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane, and then recycles through early endosomes back to the Golgi for reuse. Removal of ubiquitin from Snc1, or deletion of a {beta}-COP subunit propeller domain that binds K63-linked polyubiquitin, causes aberrant accumulation of Snc1 in early endosomes. Moreover, replacement of the {beta}-COP propeller domain with unrelated ubiquitin-binding domains restores Snc1 recycling. These results indicate that ubiquitination, a modification well known to target membrane proteins to the lysosome or vacuole for degradation, can also function as recycling signal to sort a SNARE into COPI vesicles at early endosomes for Golgi delivery.",

Here we have tested whether RamA over-production can enhance acquired {beta}-lactam resistance mechanisms in K. pneumoniae and have defined the envelope protein abundance changes seen upon RamA overproduction during growth in low and high osmolarity media.\\n\\nMETHODSEnvelope permeability was estimated using a fluorescent dye accumulation assay. Antibiotic susceptibility was measured using disc testing. Total envelope protein production was quantified using LC-MS/MS proteomics and transcript levels quantified by Real Time RT-PCR.\\n\\nRESULTSRamA overproduction enhanced {beta}-lactamase mediated {beta}-lactam resistance, in some cases dramatically, without altering {beta}-lactamase production. It increased production of efflux pumps and decreased OmpK35 porin production, though micF over-expression showed that OmpK35 reduction has little impact on envelope permeability. A survey of K. pneumoniae bloodstream isolates revealed ramA hyperexpression in 3 out of 4 carbapenemase producers, 1/21 CTX-M producers and 2/19 strains not carrying CTX-M or carbapenemases.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSWhilst RamA is not a key mediator of antibiotic resistance in K. pneumoniae on its own, it is potentially important for enhancing the spectrum of acquired {beta}-lactamase mediated {beta}-lactam resistance.

    "abstract": "Previous work demonstrated a direct correspondence between the hierarchy of the human visual areas and layers of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) trained on visual object recognition. We used DCNNs to investigate which frequency bands correlate with feature transformations of increasing complexity along the ventral visual pathway. By capitalizing on intracranial depth recordings from 100 patients and 11293 electrodes we assessed the alignment between the DCNN and signals at different frequency bands in different time windows. We found that gamma activity, especially in the low gamma-band (30 - 70 Hz), matched the increasing complexity of visual feature representations in the DCNN. These findings show that the activity of the DCNN captures the essential characteristics of biological object recognition not only in space and time, but also in the frequency domain. These results also demonstrate the potential that modern artificial intelligence algorithms have in advancing our understanding of the brain.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRecent advances in the field of artificial intelligence have revealed principles about neural processing, in particular about vision. Previous works have demonstrated a direct correspondence between the hierarchy of human visual areas and layers of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), suggesting that DCNN is a good model of visual object recognition in primate brain. Studying intracranial depth recordings allowed us to extend previous works by assessing when and at which frequency bands the activity of the visual system corresponds to the DCNN. Our key finding is that signals in gamma frequencies along the ventral visual pathway are aligned with the layers of DCNN. Gamma frequencies play a major role in transforming visual input to coherent object representations.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex (M1) can excite both cortico-cortical and cortico-spinal axons resulting in TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), respectively. Despite this remarkable difference with other cortical areas, the influence of motor output and its amplitude on TEPs is largely unknown. Here we studied TEPs resulting from M1 stimulation and assessed whether their waveform and spectral features depend on the MEP amplitude. To this aim, we performed two separate experiments. In experiment 1, single-pulse TMS was applied at the same supra-threshold intensity on primary motor, prefrontal, premotor and parietal cortices and the corresponding TEPs were compared by means of local mean field power and time-frequency spectral analysis. In experiment 2 we stimulated M1 at resting motor threshold in order to elicit MEPs characterized by a wide range of amplitudes. TEPs computed from high-MEP and low-MEP trials were then compared using the same methods applied in experiment 1. In line with previous studies, TMS of M1 produced larger TEPs compared to other cortical stimulations. Notably, we found that only TEPs produced by M1 stimulation were accompanied by a late ([~]300 ms after TMS) event-related desynchronization (ERD), whose magnitude was strongly dependent on the amplitude of MEPs. Overall, these results suggest that M1 produces peculiar responses to TMS possibly reflecting specific anatomo-functional properties, such as the re-entry of proprioceptive feedback associated with target muscle activation.",

Here, we describe a rapid and robust method for the differentiation of highly pure populations of replicative astrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), via a neural progenitor cell (NPC) intermediate. Using this method, we generated hiPSC-derived astrocyte populations (hiPSC-astrocytes) from 42 NPC lines (derived from 30 individuals) with an average of [~]90% S100{beta}-positive cells. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the hiPSC-astrocytes are highly similar to primary human fetal astrocytes and characteristic of a non-reactive state. hiPSC-astrocytes respond to inflammatory stimulants, display phagocytic capacity and enhance microglial phagocytosis. hiPSC-astrocytes also possess spontaneous calcium transient activity. Our novel protocol is a reproducible, straightforward (single media) and rapid (<30 days) method to generate homogenous populations of hiPSC-astrocytes that can be used for neuron-astrocyte and microglia-astrocyte co-cultures for the study of neuropsychiatric disorders.\\n\\nABBREVIATIONS",

    "abstract": "BackgroundKwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, has among the highest burden of XDR-TB worldwide with the majority of cases occurring due to transmission. Poor access to health facilities can be a barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment of TB, which can contribute to ongoing transmission. We sought to determine the geographic distribution of XDR-TB patients and proximity to health facilities in KwaZulu-Natal.\\n\\nMethodsWe recruited adults and children with XDR-TB diagnosed in KwaZulu-Natal. We calculated distance and time from participants home to the closest hospital or clinic, as well as to the actual facility that diagnosed XDR-TB, using tools within ArcGIS Network analyst. Speed of travel was assigned to road classes based on Department of Transport regulations. Results were compared to guidelines for the provision of social facilities in South Africa: 5km to a clinic and 30km to a hospital.\\n\\nResultsDuring 2011-2014, 1027 new XDR-TB cases were diagnosed throughout all 11 districts of KwaZulu-Natal, of whom 404 (39%) were enrolled and had geospatial data collected. Participants would have had to travel a mean distance of 2.9 km (CI 95%: 1.8-4.1) to the nearest clinic and 17.6 km (CI 95%: 11.4-23.8) to the nearest hospital. Actual distances that participants travelled to the health facility that diagnosed XDR-TB ranged from <10 km (n=143, 36%) to >50 km (n=109, 27%). The majority (77%) of participants travelled farther than the recommended distance to a clinic (5 km) and 39% travelled farther than the recommended distance to a hospital (30 km). Nearly half (46%) of participants were diagnosed at a health facility in eThekwini district, of whom, 36% resided outside the Durban metropolitan area.\\n\\nConclusionsXDR-TB cases are widely distributed throughout KwaZulu-Natal province with a denser focus in eThekwini district. Patients travelled long distances to the health facility where they were diagnosed with XDR-TB, suggesting a potential role for migration or transportation in the XDR-TB epidemic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTransmission in epidemics of infectious diseases is characterized by a high level of subject-specific elements. These include heterogeneous infection conditions, time-dependent transmission potential, and age-dependent contact structure. These insights are often lost in epidemic models using population data. Here we submit an approach that can capture these details, paving the way for studying epidemics in a more mechanistic and realistic way.\\n\\nMethodsUsing experimental data, we formulated mathematical models of a pathogen infection dynamics from which we can simulate its transmission potential mechanistically. The models were then embedded in our implement of an age-specific contact network structure that allows to express all elements relevant to the transmission process. This approach is illustrated here with an example of Ebola virus (EBOV).\\n\\nResultsThe results showed that within-host infection dynamics can capture EBOVs transmission parameters as good as approaches using population data. Population age-structure, contact distribution and patterns can also be captured with our network generating algorithm. This framework opens vast opportunities for the investigations of each element involved in the epidemic process. Here, estimating EBOVs reproduction number revealed a heterogeneous pattern among age-groups, prompting questions on current estimates which are not adjusted for this factor. Assessments of mass vaccination strategies showed that a time window from five months before to one week after the start of an epidemic appeared to be effective. Noticeably, compared to a non-intervention scenario, a low vaccination coverage of 33% could reduce number of cases by ten to hundred times as well as lessen the case-fatality rate.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first effort coupling directly within-host infection model into an age-structured epidemic network model, adding more realistic elements in simulating epidemic processes. Experimental data at the within-host infection are shown able to capture upfront key parameters of a pathogen; the applications of this approach will give us more time to prepare for potential epidemics. Population of interest in epidemic assessments could be modeled with an age-specific contact network without exhaustive amount of data. Further assessments and adaptations for different pathogens and scenarios are underway to explore multilevel aspects in infectious diseases epidemics.",

Of 121 VDR SNPs examined, 10 were significantly associated (p<0.01) with rate of sputum conversion in multivariable analyses. Each additional risk allele on SNP rs74085240 delayed culture conversion significantly (adjusted hazard ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.14-0.67).\\n\\nConclusionsPolymorphisms in the VDR gene were associated with rate of sputum culture conversion in MDR TB patients in this high HIV prevalence setting in South Africa.\\n\\nAuthor contributionsMJM, YVS, JCMB, SS, and NRG conceived and designed the study and drafted the initial manuscript.

    "abstract": "Sea urchins exhibit among their many species remarkable diversity in skeleton form (e.g., from spheroid to discoid shapes). However, we still do not understand how some related species show distinct morphologies despite inherent similarities at the genetic level. For this, we use theoretical morphology to disentangle the ontogenic processes that play a role in skeletal growth and form. We developed a model that simulates these processes involved and predicted trajectory obtaining 94% and 77% accuracies. We then use the model to understand how morphologies evolved by exploring the individual effects of three structures (ambulacral column, plate number, and polar regions). These structures have changed over evolutionary time and trends indicate they may influence skeleton shape, specifically height-to-diameter ratio, h:d. Our simulations confirm the trend observed but also show how changes in the attributes affect shape; we show that widening the ambulacral column or increasing plate number in columns produces a decrease in h:d (flattening); whereas increasing apical system radius to column length ratio produces an increase in h:d (gloublar shape). Computer simulated h:d matched h:d measured from real specimens. Our findings provide the first explanation of how small changes in these structures can create the diversity in skeletal morphologies.",

    "abstract": "At any given moment, we experience a perceptual scene as a single whole and yet we may distinguish a variety of objects within it. This phenomenon instantiates two properties of conscious perception: integration and differentiation. Integration to experience a collection of objects as a unitary percept, and differentiation to experience these objects as distinct from each other. Here we evaluated the neural information dynamics underlying integration and differentiation of perceptual contents during bistable perception. Participants listened to a sequence of tones (auditory bistable stimuli) experienced either as a single stream (perceptual integration) or as two parallel streams (perceptual differentiation) of sounds. We computed neurophysiological indices of information integration and information differentiation with electroencephalographic and intracranial recordings. When perceptual alternations were endogenously driven, the integrated percept was associated with an increase in neural information-integration and a decrease in neural differentiation across frontoparietal regions, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for the differentiated percept. However, when perception was exogenously driven by a change in the sound stream (no bistability) neural oscillatory power distinguished between percepts but information measures did not. We demonstrate that perceptual integration and differentiation can be mapped to theoretically-motivated neural information signatures, suggesting a direct relationship between phenomenology and neurophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular iron homeostasis is regulated by a proteolytic switch whereby the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXL5 targets iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) for ubiquitin-dependent degradation in iron-replete conditions while it is itself degraded during iron deficiency allowing IRPs to accumulate and regulate their downstream RNA targets. The cellular pathways that control FBXL5 degradation in low iron conditions are not well understood. Here, we report the identification of the STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase (SPAK) as a novel regulator of FBXL5 stability. We find that SPAK, a kinase previously implicated in osmotic stress regulation, regulates intracellular iron homeostasis through its physical association with FBXL5. This role is dependent on its kinase activity as overexpression of constitutively active SPAK increases FBXL5 poly-ubiquitination and degradation. Through this work, we have discovered a novel role for SPAK that extends beyond its well-established function in salt homeostasis and raises the possibility for signaling crosstalk between iron homeostatic and osmotic regulatory pathways.",

Differential expression is usually quantified as a continuous score--fold-change, test-statistic, p-value--comparing biological classes. Unlike existing approaches, our de novo strategy, termed SArKS, applies nonparametric kernel smoothing to uncover promoter motifs that correlate with elevated differential expression scores. SArKS detects motifs by smoothing sequence scores over sequence similarity. A second round of smoothing over spatial proximity reveals multi-motif domains (MMDs). Discovered motifs can then be merged or extended based on adjacency within MMDs. False positive rates are estimated and controlled by permutation testing.\\n\\nResultsWe applied SArKS to published gene expression data representing distinct neocortical neuron classes in M. musculus and interneuron developmental states in H. sapiens.

    "abstract": "Recent research has identified late-latency, long-lasting neural activity as a robust correlate of conscious perception. Yet, the dynamical nature of this activity is poorly understood, and the mechanisms governing its presence or absence and the associated conscious perception remain elusive. We applied dynamic-pattern analysis to whole-brain slow cortical dynamics recorded by magnetoencephalography (MEG) in human subjects performing a threshold-level visual perception task. Up to 1 second before stimulus onset, brain activity pattern across widespread cortices significantly predicted whether a threshold-level visual stimulus was later consciously perceived. This initial state of brain activity interacts nonlinearly with stimulus input to shape the evolving cortical activity trajectory, with seen and unseen trials following well separated trajectories. Furthermore, cortical activity trajectories during conscious perception are fast evolving and robust to small variations in the initial state. These results suggest that brain dynamics underlying conscious visual perception belongs to the class of initial-state-dependent, robust, transient neural dynamics.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYWhat brain mechanisms underlie conscious perception? A commonly adopted paradigm for studying this question is to present human subjects with threshold-level stimuli. When shown repeatedly, the same stimulus is sometimes consciously perceived, sometimes not. Using magnetoencephalography, we shed light on the neural mechanisms governing whether the stimulus is consciously perceived in a given trial. We observed that depending on the initial brain state defined by widespread activity pattern in the slow cortical potential (<5 Hz) range, a physically identical, brief (30 - 60 ms) stimulus input triggers distinct sequences of activity pattern evolution over time that correspond to either consciously perceiving the stimulus or not. Such activity pattern evolution forms a \\\"trajectory\\\" in the state space and affords significant single-trial decoding of perceptual outcome from 1 sec before to 3 sec after stimulus onset. While previous theories on conscious perception have emphasized sustained, high-level activity, we found that brain dynamics underlying conscious perception exhibit fast-changing activity patterns. These results significantly further our understanding on the neural mechanisms governing conscious access of a stimulus and the dynamical nature of neural activity underlying conscious perception.",

Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), Wang and Mendel (WM), Dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS), Hybrid neural Fuzzy Inference System (HyFIS), genetic for lateral tuning and rule selection of linguistic fuzzy system (GFS.LT.RS) and subtractive clustering and fuzzy c-means (SBC) algorithms are applied for data. Among these algorithms, ANFIS and GFS.LT.RS models have better performance. On the other hand, ANFIS and GFS.LT.RS algorithms can be used to predict the spike discharge dynamics as a function of first spike latency and frequency with a higher accuracy compared to other algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Model-averaged partial regression coefficients have been criticized for averaging over a set of models with coefficients that have different meanings from model to model. This criticism arises because statisticians since Fisher believe that the meaning of a coefficient in a regression model arises from probabilistic conditioning (P (Y |X)) and that coefficients are mere descriptors of conditional association (or \\\"differences in conditional means\\\"). Because this association parameter is conditional on a specific set of covariates, the parameter for a predictor varies from model to model. The coefficients in many applied regression models, however, take their meaning from causal conditioning (P (Y |do(X))) and these coefficients estimate causal effect parameters (or simply, causal effects or Average Treatment Effects). Causal effect parameters are also differences in conditional expectations, but the event conditioned on is not the set of covariates in a regression model but a hypothetical intervention. Because an effect parameter for a predictor takes its meaning from causal and not probabilistic conditioning, it is the same from model to model, and an averaged coefficient has a straightforward interpretation as an estimate of a causal effect. But, because the effect parameter is the same from model to model, the estimates of the parameter will generally be biased. By contrast, with probabilistic conditioning, the coefficients are consistent estimates of their parameter in every model. Confounding and omitted variable bias, which are central to explanatory modeling, are meaningless in regression modeling as mere description.",

Combination of site specific mutagenesis of the three DHHC6 palmitoylation sites, experimental determination of kinetic parameters and data-driven mathematical modelling allowed us to obtain detailed information on the 8 differentially palmitoylated DHHC6 species. We found that species rapidly interconvert through the action of DHHC16 and the Acyl Protein Thioesterase APT2, that each species varies in terms of turnover rate and activity, altogether allowing the cell to robustly tune its DHHC6 activity.",
