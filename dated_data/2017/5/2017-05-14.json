    "abstract": "We estimated home range and core area size for jaguar (Panthera onca) in western Paraguay in the Dry Chaco, Humid Chaco and Pantanal using an autocorrelated kernel density estimator. Mean home range size was 818 km2 (95% CI:425-1981) in the Dry Chaco and 237 km2 (95% CI:90-427) in the Humid Chaco/Pantanal. Core areas, defined as the home range area where use was equal to expected use, was consistent across sexes and systems represented on average by the 59% utility distribution isopleth (range:56-64%). Males had a higher probability of larger home ranges and more directional and greater daily movements than females collectively and within systems. The large home ranges in the Dry Chaco are attributable to the relatively low productivity of that semi-arid ecosystem and high heterogeneity in resource distribution while larger than expected home ranges in the Humid Chaco/Pantanal compared to home range estimates from the Brazilian Pantanal may be due to differences in geomorphology and hydrological cycle. The large home ranges of jaguars in western Paraguay and a low proportional area of protected areas in the region demonstrate the importance of private ranchland for the long-term conservation of the species.",

    "abstract": "Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid (TRPV1) channels support the detection and integration of nociceptive input. Currently available functional and structural data suggest that that TRPV1 channels have two potential gates within their cation selective permeation pathway: a barrier formed by a  bundle crossing at the intracellular entrance and a second constriction created by the ion selectivity filter. To describe conformational changes associated with channel gating within the pore, the fluorescent non-canonical amino acid (f- ncAA) coumarin-tyrosine was genetically encoded at Y671, a residue proximal to the selectivity filter. TRPV1 channels expressing coumarin at either site displayed normal voltage- and agonist-dependent gating. Next, total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF) was performed to enable ultra-rapid, millisecond imaging of the conformational dynamics in single TRPV1 channels in live cells. Here, the data obtained from channels expressed in human derived cells show that optical fluctuations, photon counts, and variance of noise analysis from Y671 coumarin encoded in TRPV1 tetramers correlates closely with channel activation by capsaicin, thus providing an direct optical marker of channel activation at the selectivity filter. In companion molecular dynamics simulations, Y671 displays alternating solvent exposure between the closed and open states, giving support to the optical data. These calculations further suggest a direct involvement of Y671 in controlling the relative position of the pore helix and its role in supporting ionic conductance at the TRPV1 selectivity filter.",

    "abstract": "Defective endocytosis and vesicular trafficking of signaling receptors has recently emerged as a multifaceted hallmark of malignant cells. Clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), the fundamental unit of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, display highly heterogeneous dynamics on the plasma membrane where they can take from 20 seconds to over a minute to form cytosolic coated-vesicles. Despite the large number of cargo molecules that traffic through CCPs, it is not well understood whether signaling receptors activated in cancer, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are regulated through a specific subset of CCPs. The signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), which is dephosphorylated by phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN), is a potent tumorigenic signaling lipid that is present in excess in many types of cancers. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and automated tracking and detection of CCPs, we find PTEN and EGF bound EGFR are enriched in a distinct subset of short-lived CCPs that corresponded with clathrin-dependent EGF-induced signaling. By deleting PTEN using CRISPR-Cas9 and reconstituting PTEN, we demonstrate that PTEN plays a role in the regulation of CCP dynamics; this appears to recapitulate CCP dynamics in highly metastatic PTEN-deleted cancer cells where we find a larger proportion of short-lived CCPs and higher initiation density compared to the normal cells. Furthermore, increased PI(3,4,5)P3 results in higher proportion of short-lived CCPs, an effect that recapitulates PTEN deletion. Our findings provide strong evidence for the existence of short-lived  signaling-capable CCPs. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the importance of PTEN and PI(3,4,5)P3 in regulating CCP dynamics and assign a new function to PTEN as a modulator of signaling-capable CCPs.",

    "abstract": "We used quantitative confocal microscopy and FPALM super resolution microscopy of live fission yeast to investigate the structures and assembly of two types of interphase nodes, multiprotein complexes associated with the plasma membrane that merge together and mature into the precursors of the cytokinetic contractile ring. During the long G2 phase of the cell cycle seven different interphase node proteins maintain constant concentrations as they accumulate in proportion to cell volume. During mitosis the total numbers of type 1 node proteins (cell cycle kinases Cdr1p, Cdr2p, Wee1p, and anillin Mid1p) are constant even when the nodes disassemble. Quantitative measurements provide strong evidence that both types of nodes have defined sizes and numbers of constituent proteins, as observed for cytokinesis nodes. Type 1 nodes assemble in two phases, a burst at the end of mitosis, followed by steady increase during interphase to double the initial number. Type 2 nodes containing Blt1p, Rho-GEF Gef2p, and kinesin Klp8p remain intact throughout the cell cycle and are constituents of the contractile ring. They are released from the contractile ring as it disassembles and then associate with type 1 nodes around the equator of the cell during interphase.\\n\\nHighlight summaryFPALM super resolution microscopy and quantitative confocal microscopy reveal that interphase nodes, the precursors to the fission yeast cytokinetic contractile ring, are discrete unitary structures with defined sizes and ratios of component proteins.

    "abstract": "RNAs have been shown to undergo transfer between mammalian cells, though the mechanism behind this phenomenon and its overall importance to cell physiology is not well understood. Numerous publications have suggested that RNAs (microRNAs and incomplete mRNAs) undergo transfer via extracellular vesicles (e.g. exosomes). However, in contrast to a diffusion-based transfer mechanism, we find that full-length mRNAs undergo direct cell-cell transfer via cytoplasmic extensions, called membrane nanotubes (mNTs), which connect donor and acceptor cells. By employing a simple co-culture experimental model and using single-molecule imaging, we provide quantitative data showing that mRNAs are transferred between cells in contact. Examples of mRNAs that undergo transfer include those encoding GFP, mouse {beta}-actin, and human Cyclin D1, BRCA1, MT2A, and HER2. We show that intercellular mRNA transfer occurs in all co-culture models tested (e.g. between primary cells, immortalized cells, and in co-cultures of immortalized human and murine cells). Rapid mRNA transfer is dependent upon actin, but independent of de novo protein synthesis, and is modulated by stress conditions and gene expression levels. Hence, this work supports the hypothesis that full-length mRNAs undergo transfer between cells through a refined structural connection. Importantly, unlike the transfer of miRNA or RNA fragments, this process of communication transfers genetic information that could potentially alter the acceptor cell proteome. This phenomenon may prove important for the proper development and functioning of tissues, as well as host-parasite or symbiotic interactions.\\n\\nSignificanceMessenger RNA (mRNA) molecules convey genetic information within cells, beginning from genes in the nucleus to ribosomes in the cell body, where they are translated into proteins. Here, we show a novel mode of transferring genetic information from one cell to another. Contrary to previous publications suggesting that mRNAs transfer via extracellular vesicles, we provide visual and quantitative data showing that mRNAs transfer via membrane nanotubes and direct cell-to-cell contact. We predict that this process has a major role in regulating local cellular environments with respect to tissue development and maintenance, cellular responses to stress, interactions with parasites, tissue transplants, and the tumor microenvironment.\\n\\nAuthor contributionsG.H., A.R. and R.H.S. conceived the research and designed the experiments; C.M.E. performed and analyzed the experiments with WM983b+/-GFP, including transwell and exosomes; M.C.D. and E.E. performed and analyzed the WM983b/NIH393 co-culture experiments; G.H. performed and analyzed all other experiments; and G.H., J.E.G, A.R. and R.H.S. wrote the paper.",

    "abstract": "MotivationUnderstanding the relationship between protein structure and function is a fundamental problem in protein science. Given a protein of unknown function, fast identification of similar protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a critical step for inferring its biological function. Such structural neighbors can provide evolutionary insights into protein conformation, interfaces and binding sites that are not detectable from sequence similarity. However, the computational cost of performing pairwise structural alignment against all structures in PDB is prohibitively expensive. Alignment-free approaches have been introduced to enable fast but coarse comparisons by representing each protein as a vector of structure features or fingerprints and only computing similarity between vectors. As a notable example, FragBag represents each protein by a \\\"bag of fragments\\\", which is a vector of frequencies of contiguous short backbone fragments from a predetermined library.\\n\\nResultsHere we present a new approach to learning effective structural motif presentations using deep learning. We develop DeepFold, a deep convolutional neural network model to extract structural motif features of a protein structure. Similar to FragBag, DeepFold represents each protein structure or fold using a vector of learned structural motif features. We demonstrate that DeepFold substantially outperforms FragBag on protein structural search on a non-redundant protein structure database and a set of newly released structures. Remarkably, DeepFold not only extracts meaningful backbone segments but also finds important long-range interacting motifs for structural comparison. We expect that DeepFold will provide new insights into the evolution and hierarchical organization of protein structural motifs.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/largelymfs/DeepFold\\n\\nContactjianpeng@illinois.edu",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in the biology of sex-differences has eluded direct study in humans: how does sex chromosome dosage (SCD) shape genome function? To address this, we developed a systematic map of SCD effects on gene function by analyzing genome-wide expression data in humans with diverse sex chromosome aneuploidies (XO, XXX, XXY, XYY, XXYY). For sex chromosomes, we demonstrate a pattern of obligate dosage sensitivity amongst evolutionarily preserved X-Y homologs, and update prevailing theoretical models for SCD compensation by detecting X-linked genes whose expression increases with decreasing X- and/or Y-chromosome dosage. We further show that SCD-sensitive sex chromosome genes regulate specific co-expression networks of SCD-sensitive autosomal genes with critical cellular functions and a demonstrable potential to mediate previously documented SCD effects on disease. Our findings detail wide-ranging effects of SCD on genome function with implications for human phenotypic variation.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSex chromosome dosage (SCD) effects on human gene expression are central to the biology of sex differences and sex chromosome aneuploidy syndromes, but challenging to study given the co-segregation of SCD and gonadal status. We address this obstacle by systematically modelling SCD effects on genome wide expression data from a large and rare cohort of individuals with diverse SCDs (XO, XX, XXX, XXXX, XY, XXY, XYY, XXYY, XXXXY). Our findings update current models of sex chromosome biology by (i) pinpointing a core set of X- and Y-linked genes with \\\"obligate\\\" SCD sensitivity, (ii) discovering several non-canonical modes of X-chromosome dosage compensation, and (iii) dissecting complex regulatory effects of X-chromosome dosage on large autosomal gene networks with key roles in cellular functioning.",

Here we trained participants to encode specific AO associations whilst undergoing functional imaging (fMRI) and used computational modelling to evaluate competing models. This analysis revealed that a Kalman filter, which learned the unique causal effect of each action, best characterized AO learning and found the medial prefrontal cortex differentiated the unique effect of actions from background effects. We subsequently extended these findings to show that mPFC participated in a circuit with parietal cortex and caudate nucleus to segregate distinct contributions to AO learning.

    "abstract": "Neural circuits are wired by chemotactic migration of growth cones guided by extracellular guidance cue gradients. How growth cone chemotaxis builds the macroscopic structure of the neural circuit is a fundamental question in neuroscience. I addressed this issue in the case of the ordered axonal projections called topographic maps in the retinotectal system. In the retina and tectum, the erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, are expressed in gradients. According to Sperrys chemoaffinity theory, gradients in both the source and target areas enable projecting axons to recognize their proper terminals, but how axons chemotactically decode their destinations is largely unknown. To identify the chemotactic mechanism of topographic mapping, I developed a mathematical model of intracellular signaling in the growth cone that focuses on the growth cones unique chemotactic property of being attracted or repelled by the same guidance cues in different biological situations. The model presented mechanism by which the retinal growth cone reaches the correct terminal zone in the tectum through alternating chemotactic response between attraction and repulsion around a preferred concentration. The model also provided a unified understanding of the contrasting relationships between receptor expression levels and preferred ligand concentrations in EphA/ephrinA- and EphB/ephrinB-encoded topographic mappings. Thus, this study redefines the chemoaffinity theory in chemotactic terms.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThis study revisited the chemoaffinity theory for topographic mapping in terms of chemotaxis. According to this theory, the axonal growth cone projects to specific targets based on positional information encoded by chemical gradients in both source and target areas. However, the mechanism by which the chemotactic growth cone recognizes its proper terminal site remains elusive. To unravel this mystery, I mathematically modeled a growth cone exhibiting concentration-dependent attraction and repulsion to chemotactic cues. The model identified a novel growth cone guidance mechanism in topographic mapping, highlighting the importance of the growth cones unique ability to alternate between attraction and repulsion. Furthermore, an extension of the model provided possible molecular mechanisms for contrasting two types of topographic mappings observed in the retinotectal system.",

    "abstract": "The oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) causes downy mildew disease on Arabidopsis. During infection, Hpa like other biotrophic pathogens, suppresses activation of plant innate immunity by translocating effector proteins into host cells. Some of these effectors localize to the host cell nucleus where they may manipulate transcriptional reprogramming of plant defense genes. Here we report that the nuclear-localized Hpa effector HaRxL106, when expressed in Arabidopsis, induces shade avoidance and attenuates the transcriptional response to the defense signaling molecule salicylic acid. HaRxL106 interacts with RADICAL-INDUCED CELL DEATH1 (RCD1) and loss of RCD1 function renders Arabidopsis resilient against HaRxL106-mediated suppression of immunity. To further characterize the molecular functions of RCD1 we solved a crystal structure of RCD1s Poly-(ADP-ribose)-Polymerase (PARP) domain and, based on non-conservation of amino acids constituting the active site of canonical PARPs, conclude that RCD1 has no PARP activity. We report that RCD1-type proteins are phosphorylated and identified histone-modifying Mut9-like kinases (MLKs) as RCD1-interacting proteins. A mlk1,3,4 triple mutant exhibits stronger SA-induced defense marker gene expression compared to wild-type plants. Our data suggest that HaRxL106 suppresses Arabidopsis innate immunity by manipulating the function(s) of RCD1 in the host cell nucleus and point towards a role of RCD1 as a transcriptional co-regulator that integrates signals from light and pathogen sensors.",

    "abstract": "Predictable tuning of gene expression is essential for engineering genetic circuits and for optimising enzyme levels in metabolic engineering projects. In bacteria, gene expression can be tuned at the stage of transcription, by exchanging the promoter, or at stage of translation by altering the ribosome binding site sequence. In eukaryotes, however, only promoter exchange is regularly used, as the tools to modulate translation are lacking. Working in S. cerevisiae yeast, we here describe how hairpin RNA structures inserted into the 5 untranslated region (5UTR) of mRNAs can be used to tune expression levels by altering the efficiency of translation initiation. We demonstrate a direct link between the calculated free energy of folding in the 5UTR and protein abundance, and show that this enables rational design of hairpin libraries that give predicted expression outputs. Our approach is modular, working with different promoters and protein coding sequences, and it outperforms promoter mutation as a way to predictably generate a library where a protein is induced to express at a range of different levels. With this tool, computational RNA sequence design can be used to predictably fine-tune protein production, providing a new way to modulate gene expression in eukaryotes.",

Herein, we further characterize the development of novel RTA & PAP-S1 antiviral fusion proteins. In brief, RTA/PAP-S1 and PAP-S1/RTA fusion proteins were produced in both cell free and E. coli in vivo expression systems, purified by His-tag affinity chromatography, and protein synthesis inhibitory activity assayed by comparison to the production of a control protein, CalmL3. Results showed that the RTA/PAP-S1 fusion protein is amenable to standardized production and purification and has both increased potency and less toxicity compared to either RTA or PAP-S1 alone. Thus, this research highlights the developmental potential of novel fusion proteins with reduced cytotoxic risk and increased potency.",

Such dedicated pathways, however, may be inadequate for adaptation to novel or extreme environments. We propose the existence of a fitness optimization mechanism that tunes the global transcriptional output of a genome to match arbitrary external conditions in the absence of dedicated gene-regulatory networks. We provide evidence for the proposed tuning mechanism in the adaptation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to laboratory-engineered environments that are foreign to its native gene-regulatory network. We show that transcriptional tuning operates locally at individual gene promoters and its efficacy is modulated by genetic perturbations to chromatin modification machinery.",

    "abstract": "miRNAs are key non-protein coding regulators of gene expression in various pathophysiological conditions. Targeting miRNA with small molecules offer an unconventional approach, where clinically active compounds with RNA binding activity can be tested for their ability to modulate miRNA levels and thus for drug repositioning. Aminoglycoside antibiotics are highly effective microbicidal RNA binding molecules that bind to prokaryotic rRNA secondary structures. Here, we report that specific subsets of miRNA can be modulated by aminoglycosides. However, ototoxicity (cochlear and vestibular) and nephrotoxicity of multiple origins resulting from prolonged use are a well-known disadvantage of aminoglycosides. Mature non-coding RNAs and their precursors can present off-target sites, by forming secondary structures that resemble ribosomal RNA, thus providing an additional molecular basis for the toxicity of aminoglycosides. Using in vitro, in cellulae and physiological responses, we provide evidence for the direct functional perturbation of the miR- 96 cluster leading to selective cell death in neuromasts- the zebrafish equivalent of cochlear hair cells, by Streptomycin, a prototype aminoglycoside antibiotic, thus contributing to the observed ototoxicity. Our observations, collectively underscore the importance of re- evaluating RNA binding drugs for their off-targeting effects in the context of miRNA and other functional non-coding RNA.",

    "abstract": "The long-term stability of microbiomes is crucial as the persistent occurrence of beneficial microbes and their associated functions ensure host health and well-being. Microbiomes are highly diverse and dynamic, making them challenging to understand. Because many natural systems work as temporal networks, we present an approach that allows identifying meaningful ecological patterns within complex microbiomes: the dynamic core microbiome. On the basis of six marine sponge species sampled monthly over three years, we study the structure, dynamics and stability of their microbiomes. What emerge for each microbiome is a negative relationship between temporal variability and mean abundance. The notion of the dynamic core microbiome allowed us to determine a relevant functional attribute of the microbiome: temporal stability is not determined by the diversity of a hosts microbial assemblages, but rather by the density of those microbes that conform its core microbiome. The core microbial interaction network consisted of complementary members interacting weakly with dominance of comensal and amensal interactions that suggests self-regulation as a key determinant of the temporal stability of the microbiome. These interactions have likely coevolved to maintain host functionality and fitness over ecological, and even evolutionary time scales.",

Evidence and confirmation were treated as separate concepts.\\n\\nResults29 animal and 24 human studies were included in the analysis. The majority of animal studies (72%) yielded evidence for an anti-tumor effect of KDs. Evidential support for such effects in humans was weak and limited to individual cases, but a probabilistic argument shows that the available data strengthen the belief in the anti-tumor effect hypothesis at least for some individuals. Evidence for pro-tumor effects was lacking completely.\\n\\nConclusionsFeasibility of KDs for cancer patients has been shown in various contexts. The probability of achieving an anti-tumor effect seems greater than that of causing serious side effects when offering KDs to cancer patients. Future controlled trials would provide stronger evidence for or against the anti-tumor effect hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Woolly mammoths were among the most abundant cold adapted species during the Pleistocene. Their once large populations went extinct in two waves, an end-Pleistocene extinction of continental populations followed by the mid-Holocene extinction of relict populations on St. Paul Island ~5,600 years ago and Wrangel Island ~4,000 years ago. Wrangel Island mammoths experienced an episode of rapid demographic decline coincident with their isolation, leading to a small population, reduced genetic diversity, and the fixation of putatively deleterious alleles, but the functional consequences of these processes are unclear. Here we show that the Wrangel Island mammoth accumulated many putative deleterious mutations that are predicted to cause diverse behavioral and developmental defects. Resurrection and functional characterization of Wrangel Island mammoth genes carrying these substitutions identified both loss and gain of function mutations in genes associated with developmental defects (HYLS1), oligozoospermia and reduced male fertility (NKD1), diabetes (NEUROG3), and the ability to detect floral scents (OR5A1). These results suggest that Wrangel Island mammoths may have suffered adverse consequences from their reduced population sizes and isolation.",

We describe the effects of US on two ion channels proposed to be involved in the response of excitable cells to US: the mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel and the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2. Our patch-clamp recordings, together with finite-element simulations of acoustic field parameters indicate that Piezo1 channels are activated by continuous wave US at 43 MHz and 50 or 90 W/cm2 through cell membrane stress caused by acoustic streaming. NaV1.2 channels were not affected through this mechanism at these intensities, but their kinetics could be accelerated by US-induced heating.",

Here, we study computational models of neurons to investigate the functional effects of dendritic spikes. In agreement with previous studies, we found that point neurons or neurons with passive dendrites increase their somatic firing rate in response to the correlation of synaptic bombardment for a wide range of input conditions, i.e. input firing rates, synaptic conductances or refractory periods. However, neurons with active dendrites show the opposite behavior: for a wide range of conditions the firing rate decreases as a function of correlation. We found this property in three types of models of dendritic excitability: a Hodgkin-Huxley model of dendritic spikes, a model with integrate-and-fire dendrites, and a discrete-state dendritic model. We conclude that neurons equipped with with fast dendritic spikes confer much broader computational properties to neurons, sometimes opposite to that of point neurons.",
