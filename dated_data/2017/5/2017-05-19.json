    "abstract": "The social hymenoptera are emerging as models for epigenetics. DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group, is a common epigenetic marker. In mammals and flowering plants methylation affects allele specific expression. There is contradictory evidence for the role of methylation on allele specific expression in social insects. The aim of this paper is to investigate allele specific expression and monoallelic methylation in the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. We found nineteen genes that were both monoallelically methylated and monoallelically expressed in a single bee. Fourteen of these genes express the hypermethylated allele, while the other five express the hypomethylated allele. We also searched for allele specific expression in twenty-nine published RNA-seq libraries. We found 555 loci with allele-specific expression. We discuss our results with reference to the functional role of methylation in gene expression in insects and in the, as yet unquantified, role of genetic cis effects in insect allele specific methylation and expression.",

    "abstract": "Here I analyze the brush-fire cycle behind the brushy frontier of a grassland, seeking evolutionary feedback loops for large grazing animals and their hominin predators. Several months after a lightning strike, the burn scar grows enough new grass to expand the carrying capacity for grass-specialized herbivores,which evolved from mixed feeders in Africa during the early Pleistocene. The frontier subpopulation of grazers that discovers the auxiliary grassland quickly multiplies,creating a secondary boom for its hominin predators as well. Following this boom, a bust occurs several decades later when the brush returns; it squeezes both prey and predator populations back into the core grassland. This creates a feedback loop that can repeatedly shift the cores gene frequencies toward those of the frontier subpopulation until fixation occurs. Any brush-relevant allele could benefit from this amplifying feedback loop, so long as its phenotypes concentrate near where fresh resources can suddenly open up, back in the brush. Thus, traits concentrated in the frontier fringe can hitchhike; improved survival is not needed. This is natural selection but utilizin selective reproductive opportunity instead of the usual selective survival. Cooperative nurseries in the brushs shade should concentrate the alleles favoring eusociality, repeatedly increasing their proportion via trait hitchhiking in the feedback loop.",

    "abstract": "The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria is a global threat to human health. The problem is aggravated by unnecessary and incorrect use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. One way to provide correct treatment and to slow down the development of antibiotic resistance is to assay the susceptibility profile of the infecting bacteria before treatment is initiated and let this information guide the choice of antibiotic. However, current methods for Antibiotics Susceptibility Testing (AST) are too slow for point of care application. Here we present a fast AST, fASTest, that rapidly captures individual bacterial cells in nanofluidics channels and monitors their response to different antibiotics based on direct imaging. By averaging the growth rate over many cells, we determined the susceptibility to several antibiotics in less than 25 min even at cell densities as low as 104 CFU/mL. The short time scale, high sensitivity and high specificity make the method practically useful for guiding antibiotic treatment in, for example, urinary tract infections.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryIndividual bacterial cells can be captured and imaged in a microfluidic device to determine how their growth rate responds to antibiotic treatment in a few minutes.",

    "abstract": "Sleep deprivation has been reported to affect intrinsic brain connectivity, notably reducing connectivity in the default mode network. Studies to date have however shown inconsistent effects, in many cases lacked monitoring of wakefulness, and largely included young participants. We investigated effects of sleep deprivation on intrinsic brain connectivity in young and older participants. Participants aged 20-30 (n=30) and 65-75 (n=23) years underwent partial sleep deprivation (3h sleep) in a cross-over design, with two 8-minutes eyes-open resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) runs in each session, monitored by eye-tracking. We assessed intrinsic brain connectivity using independent components analysis (ICA) as well as seed-region analyses of functional connectivity, and also analysed global signal variability, regional homogeneity, and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations. Sleep deprivation caused increased global signal variability. In our study, changes in investigated resting state networks and in regional homogeneity were not statistically significant. Younger participants had higher connectivity in most examined networks, as well as higher regional homogeneity in areas including anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. In conclusion, we found that sleep deprivation caused increased global signal variability. We speculate that this may be caused by wake-state instability.",

    "abstract": "The quality of samples preserved long term at ultralow temperatures has not been adequately studied. To improve our understanding, we need a strategy to analyze protein degradation and metabolism at subfreezing temperatures. To do this, we obtained liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) data of calculated protein signal intensities in HEK-293 cells. Our first attempt at directly clustering the values failed, most likely due to the so-called \\\"curse of dimensionality\\\". The clusters were not reproducible, and the outputs differed with different methods. By utilizing rigid geometry with a prime ideal I-adic (p-adic) metric, however, we rearranged the sample clusters into a meaningful and reproducible order, and the results were the same with each of the different clustering methods tested. Furthermore, we have also succeeded in application of this method to expression array data in similar situations. Thus, we eliminated the \\\"curse of dimensionality\\\" from the data set, at least in clustering methods. It is possible that our approach determines a characteristic value of systems that follow a Boltzmann distribution.",

Furthermore, aging brains display altered levels of irregularity. We here show that a single, within-trial information-theoretic measure (weighted permutation entropy) captures neural irregularity in the human electroencephalogram as a proxy for both, trait-like differences between individuals of varying age, and state-like fluctuations that bias perceptual decisions. First, the overall level of neural irregularity increased with participants  age, paralleled by a decrease in variability over time, likely indexing age-related disintegration on structural and functional levels of brain activity. Second, states of higher neural irregularity were associated with optimized sensory encoding and a subsequently increased probability of choosing the first of two physically identical stimuli. In sum, neural irregularity not only characterizes behaviorally relevant brain states, but also can identify trait-like changes that come with age.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (<http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100022>). Understanding Ebola Virus (EBOV) virulence evolution is not only timely but also raises specific questions because it causes one of the most virulent human infections and it is capable of transmission after the death of its host. Using a compartmental epidemiological model that captures three transmission routes (by regular contact, via dead bodies and by sexual contact), we infer the evolutionary dynamics of case fatality ratio (CFR) on the scale of an outbreak and on the long term. Our major finding is that the viruss specific life cycle imposes selection for high levels of virulence and that this pattern is robust to parameter variations in biological ranges. In addition to shedding a new light on the ultimate causes of EBOVs high virulence, these results generate testable predictions and contribute to informing public health policies. In particular, burial management stands out as the most appropriate intervention since it decreases the R0 of the epidemics, while imposing selection for less virulent strains.\\n\\nImpact SummaryThe severe haemorrhagic fever caused by Ebola Virus (EBOV) usually kills more than one infected individual out of two in the absence of treatment, which makes this pathogen one of the most virulent known to humans. The recent outbreak in West Africa (2013-2016) revealed that the virus is able to spread and persist for months across countries. It is often thought that virulence could be due to the fact that the virus is adapted to its reservoir host. Given that microbes evolve rapidly, it is important to determine whether EBOV virulence is likely to decrease as the virus adapts to its human host. To address this problem, we developed a novel mathematical model tailored to EBOVs life cycle, notably by capturing its three main transmission routes (by regular contact, sexual contact and via dead bodies). We investigated the evolutionary trends of EBOVs virulence on different time scales (outbreak initiation, short term and long term). Our results reveal that the virulence of EBOV might not be due to the maladaptation of the virus, but could rather originate from its unique life cycle. These results are robust to the parameter values chosen. From a public health perspective, burial management stands out as the main leverage to fight the virulence of EBOV, both on the short and long terms.",

Water oxidation is the distinctive photochemical reaction that permitted the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and the eventual rise of Eukaryotes. At what point during the history of life an ancestral photosystem evolved the capacity to oxidize water still remains unknown. Here we study the evolution of the core reaction center proteins of Photosystem II using sequence and structural comparisons in combination with Bayesian relaxed molecular clocks. Our results indicate that a homodimeric photosystem with sufficient oxidizing power to split water had already appeared in the early Archean about a billion years before the most recent common ancestor of all described Cyanobacteria capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, and well before the diversification of some of the known groups of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Based on a structural and functional rationale we hypothesize that this early Archean photosystem was capable of water oxidation and had already evolved some level of protection against the formation of reactive oxygen species, which would place primordial forms of oxygenic photosynthesis at a very early stage in the evolutionary history of life.",

    "abstract": "All organisms utilize resources to grow, survive, and reproduce. The supply of these resources varies widely across landscapes and time, imposing ultimate constraints on the maximal trait values for allocation-related traits. In this review, we address three key questions fundamental to our understanding of the evolution of allocation strategies and their underlying mechanisms. First, we ask: how diverse are flexible resource allocation strategies among different organisms? We find there are many, varied, examples of flexible strategies that depend on nutrition. However, this diversity is often ignored in some of the best-known cases of resource allocation shifts, such as the commonly observed pattern of lifespan extension under nutrient limitation. A greater appreciation of the wide variety of flexible allocation strategies leads directly to our second major question: what conditions select for different plastic allocation strategies? Here, we highlight the need for additional models that explicitly consider the evolution of phenotypically plastic allocation strategies and empirical tests of the predictions of those models in natural populations. Finally, we consider the question: what are the underlying mechanisms determining resource allocation strategies? Although evolutionary biologists assume differential allocation of resources is a major factor limiting trait evolution, few proximate mechanisms are known that specifically support the model. We argue that an integrated framework can reconcile evolutionary models with proximate mechanisms that appear at first glance to be in conflict with these models. Overall, we encourage future studies to 1) mimic ecological conditions in which those patterns evolve, and 2) take advantage of the  omic opportunities to produce multi-level data and analytical models that effectively integrate across physiological and evolutionary theory.",

To follow evolution of de novo promoters, we put various random sequences upstream to the lac operon in Escherichia coli and evolved the cells in the presence of lactose. We found that a typical random sequence of ~100 bases requires only one mutation in order to enable growth on lactose by increasing resemblance to the canonical promoter motifs. We further found that ~10% of random sequences could serve as active promoters even without any period of evolutionary adaptation. Such a short mutational distance from a random sequence to an active promoter may improve evolvability yet may also lead to undesirable accidental expression. We found that across the E. coli genome accidental expression is minimized by avoiding codon combinations that resemble promoter motifs. Our results suggest that the promoter recognition machinery has been tuned to allow high accessibility to new promoters, and similar findings might also be observed in higher organisms or in other motif recognition machineries, like transcription factor binding sites or protein-protein interactions.",

We constructed a library of half a million 50-nucleotide-long random 5 UTRs and assayed their activity in a massively parallel growth selection experiment. The resulting data allow us to quantify the impact on translation of Kozak sequence composition, upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and secondary structure. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the random library and showed that it performs well at predicting the translational efficiency of both a held-out set of the random 5 UTRs as well as native S. cerevisiae 5 UTRs. The model additionally was used to computationally evolve highly translating 5 UTRs. We confirmed experimentally that the great majority of the evolved sequences lead to higher translation rates than the starting sequences, demonstrating the predictive power of this model.",

    "abstract": "Moving animal groups such as schools of fish or flocks of birds often undergo sudden collective changes of their travelling direction as a consequence of stochastic fluctuations in heading of the individuals. However, the mechanisms by which these behavioural fluctuations arise at the individual level and propagate within a group are still unclear. In the present study, we combine an experimental and theoretical approach to investigate spontaneous collective U-turns in groups of rummy-nose tetra (Hemigrammus rhodostomus) swimming in a ring-shaped tank. U-turns imply that fish switch their heading between the clockwise and anticlockwise direction. We reconstruct trajectories of individuals moving alone and in groups of different sizes. We show that the group decreases its swimming speed before a collective U-turn. This is in agreement with previous theoretical predictions showing that speed decrease facilitates an amplification of fluctuations in heading in the group, which can trigger U-turns. These collective U-turns are mostly initiated by individuals at the front of the group. Once an individual has initiated a U-turn, the new direction propagates through the group from front to back without amplification or dampening, resembling the dynamics of falling dominoes. The mean time between collective U-turns sharply increases as the size of the group increases. We develop an Ising spin model integrating anisotropic and asymmetrical interactions between fish and their tendency to follow the majority of their neighbours nonlinearly (social conformity). The model quantitatively reproduces key features of the dynamics and the frequency of collective U-turns observed in experiments.",

Following the introduction of routine whole genome sequencing of Salmonella enterica by Public Health England in 2014, we have discovered that 2.7% (79/2888) of S. Typhimurium from patients in England and Wales are ST313. Of these isolates, 59/72 originated from stool and 13/72 were from extra-intestinal sites. The isolation of ST313 from extra-intestinal sites was significantly associated with travel to Africa (OR 12 [95% CI: 3,53]). Phylogenetic analysis revealed previously unsampled diversity of ST313, and distinguished UK-linked isolates causing gastroenteritis from African-associated isolates causing invasive disease. Bayesian evolutionary investigation suggested that the two African lineages diverged from their most recent common ancestors independently, circa 1796 and 1903. The majority of genome degradation of African ST313 lineage 2 is conserved in the UK ST313 lineages and only 10/44 pseudogenes were lineage 2-specific. The African lineages carried a characteristic prophage and antibiotic resistance gene repertoire, suggesting a strong selection pressure for these horizontally-acquired genetic elements in the sSA setting. We identified an ST313 isolate associated with travel to Kenya that carried a chromosomally-located blaCTX-M-15, demonstrating the continual evolution of this sequence type in Africa in response to selection pressure exerted by antibiotic usage.\\n\\nThe S. Typhimurium ST313 sequence type has been primarily associated with invasive disease in Africa. Here, we highlight the power of routine whole-genome-sequencing by public health agencies to make epidemiologically-significant deductions that would be missed by conventional microbiological methods. The discovery of ST313 isolates responsible for gastroenteritis in the UK reveals new diversity in this important sequence type. We speculate that the niche specialization of sub-Saharan African ST313 lineages is driven in part by the acquisition of accessory genome elements.",

    "abstract": "What adaptations allow humans to produce and perceive speech so effortlessly? We show that speech is supported by a largely undocumented core of structural and functional connectivity between the central sulcus (CS or primary motor and somatosensory cortex) and the transverse temporal gyrus (TTG or primary auditory cortex). Anatomically, we show that CS and TTG cortical thickness covary across individuals and that they are connected by white matter tracts. Neuroimaging network analyses confirm the functional relevance and specificity of these structural relationships. Specifically, the CS and TTG are functionally connected at rest, during natural audiovisual speech perception, and are coactive over a large variety of linguistic stimuli and tasks. Importantly, across structural and functional analyses, connectivity of regions immediately adjacent to the TTG are with premotor and prefrontal regions rather than the CS. Finally, we show that this structural/functional CS-TTG relationship is mediated by a constellation of genes associated with vocal learning and disorders of efference copy. We propose that this core circuit constitutes an interface for rapidly exchanging articulatory and acoustic information and discuss implications for current models of speech.",

    "abstract": "The complex cellular network was formed by the interacting gene modules. Building the high-quality RNA-seq-based Gene Co-expression Network (GCN) is critical for uncovering these modules and understanding the phenotypes of an organism. Here, we established and analyzed the RNA-seq-based GCNs in two monocot species rice and maize, and two eudicot species Arabidopsis and soybean, and subdivided them into co-expressed modules. Taking rice as an example, we associated these modules with biological functions and agronomic traits by enrichment analysis, and discovered a large number of conditin-specific or tissue-specific modules. In addition, we also explored the regulatory mechanism of the modules by enrichment of the known cis-elements, transcription factors and miRNA targets. Their coherent enrichment with the inferred functions of the modules revealed their synergistic effect on the gene expression regulation. Moreover, the comparative analysis of gene co-expression was performed to identify conserved and species-specific functional modules across 4 plant species. We discovered that the modules shared across 4 plants participate in the basic biological processes, whereas the species-specific modules were involved in the spatiotemporal-specific processes linking the genotypes to phenotypes. Our research provides the massive modules relating to the cellular activities and agronomic traits in several model and crop plant species.",

    "abstract": "Silent information regulator 2-related enzyme 1 (SIRT1) is an NAD+-dependent class III deacetylase and a key component of the cellular metabolic sensing pathway. The requirement of NAD+ for SIRT1 activity led us to assume that NQO1, an NADH oxidoreductase producing NAD+, regulates SIRT1 activity. We show here that SIRT1 is capable of increasing NQO1 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase Quinone 1) transcription and protein levels. NQO1 physically interacts with SIRT1 but not with an enzymatically dead SIRT1 H363Y mutant. The interaction of NQO1 with SIRT1 is markedly increased under mitochondrial inhibition. Interestingly, under this condition the nuclear pool of NQO1 is elevated. Depletion of NQO1 compromises the role of SIRT1 in inducing transcription of several target genes and eliminates the protective role of SIRT1 following mitochondrial inhibition. Our results suggest that SIRT1 and NQO1 form a regulatory loop where SIRT1 regulates NQO1 expression and NQO1 binds and mediates the protective role of SIRT1 during mitochondrial stress. The interplay between an NADH oxidoreductase enzyme and an NAD+ dependent deacetylase may act as a rheostat in sensing mitochondrial stress.",

However, these areas have been limited by our ability to visualize and track individual C. elegans worms, especially at the subcellular scale, over the course of their lifetime. Here we present a microfluidic device to culture individual C. elegans in parallel throughout post-embryonic development. The device allows for periodic mechanical immobilization of the worm, enabling 3D imaging at subcellular precision. The immobilization is sufficient to enable fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements on organelles and other substructures within the same specific cells, throughout larval development, without the use of chemical anesthetics. Using this device, we measure FRAP recovery of two nucleolar proteins in specific intestinal cells within the same worms during larval development. We show that these exhibit different fluorescence recovery as they grow, suggesting differential protein interactions during development. We anticipate that this device will help expand the possible uses of C. elegans as a model organism, enabling its use in addressing fundamental questions at the subcellular scale, including the role of phase transitions in driving spatiotemporal intracellular organization within multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative analysis of the dynamic cellular mechanisms shaping the Drosophila wing during its larval growth phase has been limited, impeding our ability to understand how morphogen patterns regulate tissue shape. Such analysis requires imaging explants under conditions that maintain both growth and patterning, as well as methods to quantify how much cellular behaviors change tissue shape. Here, we demonstrate a key requirement for the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in the maintenance of numerous patterning systems in vivo and in explant culture. We find that low concentrations of 20E support prolonged proliferation in explanted wing discs in the absence of insulin, incidentally providing novel insight into the hormonal regulation of imaginal growth. We use 20E-containing media to directly observe growth and apply recently developed methods for quantitatively decomposing tissue shape changes into cellular contributions. We discover that while cell divisions drive tissue expansion along one axis, their contribution to expansion along the orthogonal axis is cancelled by cell rearrangements and cell shape changes. This finding raises the possibility that anisotropic mechanical constraints contribute to growth orientation in the wing disc.",

A gene duplication event at the base of a clade of species is synapamorphic, and thus excludes the root of the species tree from that clade. We present STRIDE, a fast, effective, and outgroup-free method for species tree root inference from gene duplication events. STRIDE identifies sets of well-supported gene duplication events from cohorts of gene trees, and analyses these events to infer a probability distribution over an unrooted species tree for the location of the true root. We show that STRIDE infers the correct root of the species tree for a large range of simulated and real species sets. We demonstrate that the novel probability model implemented in STRIDE can accurately represent the ambiguity in species tree root assignment for datasets where information is limited. Furthermore, application of STRIDE to inference of the origin of the eukaryotic tree resulted in a root probability distribution that was consistent with, but unable to distinguish between, leading hypotheses for the origin of the eukaryotes. In summary, STRIDE is a fast, scalable, and effective method for species tree root inference from genome scale data.",

    "abstract": "Behaviour is often on the front line of plasticity in response to different environments. At the genetic level, behavioural changes are likely to be associated with changes of gene expression. Most studies to date have focused on gene expression differences associated with discrete behavioural states reflecting development or age-related changes, such as honey bee castes. However, more rapidly flexible behaviour is often observed in response to social context or simple individual variation. The differences in genetic influences for the different forms of plasticity are poorly understood. In this study we contrasted gene expression during male parental care of the burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides, in a factorial design. Male N. vespilloides males typically do not provide care when females are present. However, male care is inducible by the removing female and has parental effects equivalent to female care. We used this experimental manipulation to isolate gene expression and cytosine methylation associated with differences of behavioural state, differences of social context, or differences of individual flexibility for expressing care. The greatest number of differentially expressed genes was associated with behavioural state, followed by differences of social contexts, and lastly differences of individual variation. DNA methylation has been hypothesized to regulate the transcriptional architecture that regulates behavioural transitions. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying differences of cytosine methylation that were associated with differences of behavioural state and individual flexibility. Changes of cytosine methylation were not associated with changes of gene expression. Our results suggest a hierarchical association between gene expression and the different sources of variation that influence behaviour, but that this process is not controlled by DNA methylation despite reflecting levels of plasticity in behaviour. Our results further suggest that the extent that a behaviour is transient plays an underappreciated role in determining the molecular mechanisms that underpin the behaviour.",

    "abstract": "The oxidation of alcohols and aldehydes is crucial for detoxification and efficient catabolism of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Thus, many Gram-negative bacteria have evolved periplasmic oxidation systems, based on pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (PQQ-ADHs), which are often functionally redundant. Using purified enzymes from the soil-dwelling model organism Pseudomonas putida KT2440, the present study reports the first description and characterization of a lanthanide-dependent PQQ-ADH (PedH) in a non-methylotrophic bacterium. PedH exhibits enzyme activity on a similar substrate range as its Ca2+-dependent counterpart PedE, including linear and aromatic primary and secondary alcohols as well as aldehydes, however, only in the presence of lanthanide ions including La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, Sm3+ or Nd3+. Reporter assays revealed that PedH not only has a catalytic function, but is also involved in the transcriptional regulation of pedE and pedH, most likely acting as a sensory module. Notably, the underlying regulatory network is responsive to as little as 1 - 10 nM of lanthanum, a concentration assumed to be of ecological relevance. The present study further demonstrates that the PQQ-dependent oxidation system is crucial for efficient growth with a variety of volatile alcohols. From these results we conclude that functional redundancy and inverse regulation of PedE and PedH represents an adaptive strategy of P. putida KT2440 to optimize growth with volatile alcohols in response to different lanthanide availability.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEDue to their low bioavailability, lanthanides have long been considered as biologically inert. In recent years however, the identification of lanthanides as a cofactor in methylotrophic bacteria has attracted tremendous interest among various biological fields. The present study reveals that one of the two PQQ-ADHs produced by the model organism P. putida KT2440 also utilizes lanthanides as a cofactor, thus expanding the scope of lanthanide employing bacteria beyond the methylotrophs. Similar to methyloptrophic bacteria, a complex regulatory network is involved in the lanthanide-responsive switch between the two PQQ-ADHs encoded by P. putida KT2440. We further show that functional production of at least one of the enzymes is crucial for efficient growth with several volatile alcohols. Overall, our study provides a novel understanding for the redundancy of PQQ-ADHs observed in many organisms and further highlights the importance of lanthanides for bacterial metabolism, particularly in soil environments.",

However, root architecture is difficult to determine experimentally when grown in opaque soil. Thus, root architectural models have been widely used and been further developed into functional-structural models that simulate the fate of water and solutes in the soil-root system. We present a root architectural model, CRootBox, as a flexible framework to model architecture and its interactions with static and dynamic soil environments.\\n\\nMethodsCRootBox is a C++ -based root architecture model with Python binding, so that CRootBox can be included via a shared library into any Python code. Output formats include VTP, DGF, RSML and CSV. We further created a database of published root architectural parameters. The capabilities of CRootBox for the unconfined growth of single root systems, as well as the different parameter sets, are highlighted into a freely available web application.\\n\\nKey resultsWe demonstrate the use of CRootBox for 5 different cases (1) free growth of individual root systems (2) growth of root systems in containers as a way to mimic experimental setups, (3), field scale simulation, (4) root growth as affected by heterogeneous, static soil conditions, and (5) coupling CRootBox with Soil Physics with Python code to dynamically compute water flow in soil, root water uptake, and water flow inside roots.\\n\\nConclusionsIn conclusion, we present a fast and flexible functional-structural root model which is based on state-of-the-art computational science methods. Its aim is to facilitate modelling of root responses to environmental conditions as well as the impact of root on soil.

    "abstract": "A central model that describes how behavioral sequences are produced features a neural architecture that readies different movements simultaneously, and a mechanism where prioritized suppression between the movements determines their sequential performance. We previously described a model whereby suppression drives a Drosophila grooming sequence that is induced by simultaneous activation of different sensory pathways that each elicit a distinct movement (Seeds et al. 2014). Here, we confirm this model using transgenic expression to identify and optogenetically activate sensory neurons that elicit specific grooming movements. Simultaneous activation of different sensory pathways elicits a grooming sequence that resembles the naturally induced sequence. Moreover, the sequence proceeds after the sensory excitation is terminated, indicating that a persistent trace of this excitation induces the next grooming movement once the previous one is performed. This reveals a mechanism whereby parallel sensory inputs can be integrated and stored to elicit a delayed and sequential grooming response.",

    "abstract": "Human breath and body odors have been used for diagnosis of serious and life-threatening conditions since the dawn of medical practice. More recently, it has been recognized that malodors without accompanying physical symptoms could be a sign of psychologically but not physically debilitating disorders such as Trimethylaminuria (TMAU). Self-reported intermittent odors without apparent cause, are, however, still treated with suspicion by medical professionals. Most cases of socially-disabling idiopathic malodor remain undiagnosed and there are no guidelines for diagnostic tests nor treatment options that extend beyond TMAU. Internationally-recruited volunteers with undiagnosed body odor and halitosis enrolled to participate in our study, registered as NCT02692495 at clinicaltrials.gov. Each volunteer underwent several blood and urine tests conducted by Biolab Medical Unit, a medical referral laboratory in London, specializing in nutritional and environmental medicine. Intestinal permeability measurements were strikingly different for subjects that named the nose/mouth as the malodor source(s) versus other, often unidentified, body regions. Furthermore, metabolite levels in blood and urine allowed matching of participants by dietary sensitivities and the type of odor reported, emphasizing the potential of harnessing patients olfactory observations. In discussing the anecdotal \\\"People are Allergic to Me\\\" condition (PATM), we show how it fits into the picture.",

    "abstract": "Given knowledge at the time, the recent 2015-2016 zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic probably could not have been predicted. Without the prior knowledge of ZIKV being already present in South America, and given the lack of understanding of key epidemiologic processes and long-term records of ZIKV cases in the continent, the best related prediction was for potential risk of an Aedes-borne disease epidemic. Here we use a recently published two-vector capacity model to assess the predictability of the conditions conducive to epidemics of diseases like zika, chikungunya or dengue, transmitted by the independent or concurrent presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. We compare the potential risk of transmission forcing the model with the observed climate and with state-of-the-art operational forecasts from the North American Multi Model Ensemble (NMME), finding that the predictive skill of this new seasonal forecast system is highest for multiple countries in Latin America and the Caribbean during the December-February and March-May seasons, and slightly lower -but still of potential use to decision-makers- for the rest of the year. In particular, we find that above-normal suitable conditions for the occurrence of the zika epidemic at the beginning of 2015 could have been successfully predicted for several zika hotspots, and in particular for Northeast Brazil: the heart of the epidemic. Nonetheless, the initiation and spread of an epidemic depends on the effect of multiple factors beyond climate conditions, and thus this type of approach must be considered as a guide and not as a formal predictive tool of vector-borne epidemics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundContraceptive discontinuation is a major barrier to reducing global unmet needs for family planning, but the reasons why women discontinue contraception are poorly understood. Here we use data from Ethiopia to investigate (i) the magnitude of contraceptive discontinuation in 2005-2011, (ii) how the risk of discontinuation varies with method type and education level and (iii) the barriers to continuation. Our main hypothesis is that contraceptive discontinuation is driven by the experience of physiological side-effects associated with the use of hormonal contraception, rather than a lack of education.\\n\\nMethodsWe used a mixed methods explanatory sequential design to explain the quantitative results in more details through the qualitative data. First, we analysed quantitative data from the 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey to study patterns of contraceptive discontinuation and method choice using multilevel multiprocess models. Second, we conducted semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions in the 3 most populated regions of Ethiopia with individuals of reproductive age and health professionals.\\n\\nResultsThe analysis of EDHS data shows that the rate of discontinuation has not reduced in the period 2005-2011 and remains high. Discontinuation mainly takes the form of abandonment, and is a function of method type and wealth but not of educational level. Interviews with women and health professionals reveal that the experience of debilitating physiological side effects, the need for secrecy and poverty are important barriers to continuation.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings together suggest that physiological and social side-effects of contraceptive use, not education, are the root causes of contraceptive discontinuation in Ethiopia. We argue that to tackle discontinuation due to side-effects, dispelling misconceptions through educating women is not addressing the root causes of discontinuation, and that priority should be given to both engaging men and questioning the appropriateness of medical technology to the physiology of Ethiopian women, especially those living in poverty.",

We also conducted a cross-sectional study to analyze the impact of the interventions on the surveillance and on infection prevention and control (IPC).\\n\\nResultsThe attrition of the staff trained during the original outbreak was low, and most of the supplies, equipment, and infrastructure from the original outbreak remained available.\\n\\nWith an additional US$1755, improvements were observed in the IPC indicators of triage, which increased from a mean of 60% during the first assessment to 77% (P=0.002). Additionally, personal/staff training improved from 78% to 89% (P=0.04).\\n\\nThe percentage of EVD death alerts per expected deaths investigated increased from 26% to 63% (P<0.0001).\\n\\nDiscussionThe small attrition of the trained staff and the availability of most of the supplies, equipment, and infrastructure made the reactivation of the multi-sectoral EVD control strategy fast and affordable. The improvement of the EVD surveillance was possibly affected by the community engagement activities, awareness and mentoring of the health workers, and improved availability of clinicians in the facilities during the flare-up. The community engagement may contribute to the report of community-based events, specifically community deaths. The mentoring of the staff during the supportive supervisions also contributed to improve the IPC indicators.",

The anterior, middle, and posterior heights, anteroposterior diameter and area of intervertebral discs (T4T5 to L4L5) were measured on lateral radiographs. Disc Area Index for Lumbar Spine (DAIL, disc area divided by the mean of the sum of square of the adjacent upper and lower vertebrae mid-height anterior-posterior diameter) was developed and compared with semi-quantitative DSN expert grading.\\n\\nResultsDAIL correlated with semi-quantitative grading, with sensitivity and specificity varying from 87.3% to 96.8% for grade-1 DSN (<30% reduction in disc height), and 92.9 % to 100% for grade-3 DSN (>60% reduction in disc height). The thoracolumbar disc area loss among men and women during 4-years follow-up period varied between 1.32% and 3.56%, and it was greater for women (mean: 2.44%) than for men (mean: 1.90%, p=0.044). Majority of lumbar DSN progressions during 72 to 76 years old were progression from normal disc space to grade-1DSN. Osteoporosis was associated with greater disc area decrease, both for thoracic and lumbar discs.\\n\\nConclusionLumbar DSN can be quantified using DAIL. In elderly Chinese, intervertebral disc narrowing over a 4-year period was greater in women than men, and associated with the presence of osteoporosis.",

Such effects may be assessed more precisely in settings where exogenous estrogen administration is rare. We aimed to determine whether reproductive period (menarche to menopause), and other indicators of endogenous estrogen exposure are inversely associated with dementia incidence\\n\\nMethodsPopulation-based cohort studies, of women aged 65 years and over in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic Puerto Rico and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico and China. Sociodemographic and risk factor questionnaires were administered to all participants, including ages at menarche, birth of first child, and menopause, and parity, with ascertainment of incident 10/66 dementia, and mortality, three to five years later.\\n\\nResults9,428 women participated in the baseline phase, with response rates of 72-98% by site. The  at risk cohort comprised 8,466 dementia-free women. Mean age at baseline varied from 72.0 to 75.4 years, lower in rural than urban sites and in China than in Latin America. Mean parity was 4.1, generally higher in rural than urban sites and ranging from 2.4-7.2 by site. 6,854 women with baseline reproductive period data were followed up for 26,463 person years. There were 692 cases of incident dementia, and 895 dementia free deaths. Pooled meta-analysed fixed effects, per year, for reproductive period (Adjusted Sub-Hazard Ratio [ASHR] 1.001, 95% CI 0.988-1.015) did not support any association with dementia incidence, with no evidence also for any interaction between APOE genotype and reproductive period (ASHR 0.993, 95% CI 0.947-1.041, I2=39.3%). Similarly no association was observed between incident dementia and; ages at menarche, birth of first child, and menopause: nulliparity; or index of cumulative endogenous estrogen exposure. Greater parity was positively associated with incident dementia (ASHR 1.030, 95% CI 1.002-1.059, I2=0.0%).\\n\\nConclusionsWe found no evidence to support the theory that natural variation in cumulative exposure to endogenous oestrogens across the reproductive period influences the incidence of dementia in late life.",

    "abstract": "Two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) consist of sensor histidine kinases and response regulators. TCSs mediate adaptation to environmental changes in bacteria, plants, fungi, and protists. Histidine kinase 2 (Hik2) is a sensor histidine kinase found in all known cyanobacteria and as chloroplast sensor kinase in eukaryotic algae and plants. Sodium ions have been shown to inhibit the autophosphorylation activity of Hik2 that precedes phosphoryl transfer to response regulators, but the mechanism of inhibition has not been determined. We report on the mechanism of Hik2 activation and inactivation probed by chemical crosslinking and size exclusion chromatography together with direct visualisation of the kinase using negative-stain transmission electron microscopy of single particles. We show that the functional form of Hik2 is a higher order oligomer such as a hexamer or octamer. Increased NaCl concentration converts the active hexamer into an inactive tetramer. Furthermore, the action of NaCl appears to be confined to the Hik2 kinase domain.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBacteria sense change and respond to it by means of two-component regulatory systems. The sensor component is a protein that becomes covalently modified by a phosphate group on a histidine side chain. The response regulator accepts the phosphate group onto an aspartate, with structural and functional consequences, often for gene transcription. Histidine kinase 2 is a sensor of sodium ion concentration and redox potential, regulating transcription of genes for light-harvesting and reaction center proteins of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of algae and plants. Using radiolabeling, chemical crosslinking, chromatography and electron microscopy, we find that sodium ion concentration governs the oligomeric state of Histidine Kinase 2 and its phosphorylation by ATP.",

In contrast, the few known Maturation Inducing Hormones (MIHs) that act on oocytes to initiate this process have highly variable molecular natures. Using the hydrozoan jellyfish species Clytia and Cladonema, which undergo oocyte maturation in response to dark-light and light-dark transitions respectively, we deduced from gonad transcriptome data amidated tetrapeptide sequences and found that synthetic peptides could induce maturation of isolated oocytes at nanomolar concentrations. Antibody preabsorption experiments conclusively demonstrated that these W/RPRPamide-related neuropeptides account for endogenous MIH activity produced by isolated gonads. We further showed that the MIH peptides are synthesised by neural-type cells in the gonad, are released following dark-light / light-dark transitions, and probably act on the oocyte surface. They are produced by male as well as female jellyfish and can trigger both sperm and egg release, suggesting a role in spawning coordination. We propose an evolutionary link between hydrozoan MIH and the neuropeptide hormones that regulate reproduction upstream of MIH in bilaterian species.",

    "abstract": "Apple (Malus spp.) is a widely grown and valuable fruit crop. Leaf shape and size are important for flowering in apple and may also be early indicators for other agriculturally valuable traits. We examined 9,000 leaves from 869 unique apple accessions using linear measurements and comprehensive morphometric techniques. We identified allometric variation in the length-to-width aspect ratio between accessions and species of apple. The allometric variation was due to variation in the width of the leaf blade, not length. Aspect ratio was highly correlated with the primary axis of morphometric variation (PC1) quantified using elliptical Fourier descriptors (EFDs) and persistent homology (PH). While the primary source of variation was aspect ratio, subsequent PCs corresponded to complex shape variation not captured by linear measurements. After linking the morphometric information with over 122,000 genome-wide SNPs, we found high narrow-sense heritability values even at later PCs, indicating that comprehensive morphometrics can capture complex, heritable phenotypes. Thus, techniques such as EFDs and PH are capturing heritable biological variation that would be missed using linear measurements alone, and which could potentially be used to select for a hidden phenotype only detectable using comprehensive morphometrics.",

The simplicity of its DNA assembly and the exchangeability of standard parts greatly facilitate the generation of combinatorial assembly libraries. Currently there are two popular Golden Gate Assembly frameworks that allow multigene augmentation (MoClo and Golden Braid); they render either high cloning capacity or vector toolkit simplicity. We have developed a new Golden Gate Assembly framework called Mobius Assembly, which combines vector toolkit simplicity with high cloning capacity. Mobius Assembly is based on a two-level approach and embraces the standard overhangs defined by MoClo and Golden Braid to confer exchangeability, but with reduced domestication requirement. Furthermore, we have implemented drop-out cassettes encoding chromogenic proteins for visible cloning screening. As proofs of concept, we have functionally assembled up to 16 transcriptional units of various pigmentation genes in both operon and multigene arrangements.",

These images can be mined to extract quantitative features that describe histologic elements, yielding measurements for hundreds of millions of objects. A central challenge in utilizing this data is enabling investigators to train and evaluate classification rules for identifying objects related to processes like angiogenesis or immune response. Here we present HistomicsML, an interactive machine-learning framework for large whole-slide imaging data. HistomicsML uses active learning direct user feedback, making classifier training efficient and scalable in datasets containing 108+ histologic objects. We demonstrate how HistomicsML can be used to phenotype microvascular structures in gliomas to predict survival, and to explore the molecular pathways associated with these phenotypes. Our approach enables researchers to unlock phenotypic information from digital pathology datasets to investigate prognostic image biomarkers and genotype-phenotype associations.",

    "abstract": "At synapses throughout the mammalian brain, AMPA receptors form complexes with auxiliary proteins, including TARPs. However, how TARPs modulate AMPA receptor gating remains poorly understood. We built structural models of TARP-AMPA receptor complexes for TARPs {gamma}2 and {gamma}8, combining recent structural studies and de novo structure predictions. These models, combined with peptide binding assays, provide evidence for multiple interactions between GluA2 and variable extracellular loops of TARPs. Substitutions and deletions of these loops had surprisingly rich effects on the kinetics of glutamate-activated currents, without any effect on assembly. Critically, by altering the two interacting loops of {gamma}2 and {gamma}8, we could entirely remove all allosteric modulation of GluA2, without affecting formation of AMPA receptor-TARP complexes. Likewise, substitutions in the linker domains of GluA2 completely removed any effect of Y2 on receptor kinetics, indicating a dominant role for this previously overlooked site proximal to the AMPA receptor channel gate.",

However, a concise overview of the resistance genes found in common human bacterial pathogens is lacking, which complicates risk ranking of environmental reservoirs. Here, we present an analysis of potential antibiotic resistance genes in the 17 most common bacterial pathogens isolated from humans. We analyzed more than 20,000 bacterial genomes and defined a clinical resistome as the set of resistance genes found across these genomes. Using this database, we uncovered the co-occurrence frequencies of the resistance gene clusters within each species enabling identification of co-dissemination and co-selection patterns. The resistance genes identified in this study represent the subset of the environmental resistome that is clinically relevant and the dataset and approach provides a baseline for further investigations into the abundance of clinically relevant resistance genes across different environments.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive age-associated neurological disorder. One of the major neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinsons disease is the appearance of protein aggregates, mainly consisting of the protein alpha-Synuclein. These aggregates have been described both in genetic as well as idiopathic forms of the disease. Currently, Parkinsons disease patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are mainly used for in vitro disease modeling or for experimental cell replacement approaches. Here, we demonstrate that these cells can be used for in vivo disease modeling. We show that Parkinsons disease patient-specific, iPSC-derived neurons carrying the LRRK2-G2019S mutation show an upregulation of alpha-Synuclein after transplantation in the mouse brain. However, further investigations indicate that the increased human alpha-Synuclein levels fail to induce spreading or aggregation in the mouse brain. We therefore conclude that grafting of these cells into the mouse brain is suitable for cell autonomous in vivo disease modeling but has strong limitations beyond that. Furthermore, our results support the hypothesis that there might be a species barrier between human to mouse concerning alpha-Synuclein spreading.",

    "abstract": "SummaryCytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) is minus-end directed motor protein that transports cargo over long distances and organizes microtubules (MTs) during critical cellular processes such as mitotic spindle assembly. How dynein motor activity is harnessed for these diverse functions remains unknown. Here, we have uncovered a mechanism for how processive dynein-dynactin complexes drive MT-MT sliding, reorganization, and focusing, activities required for mitotic spindle assembly. We find that motors cooperatively accumulate, in limited numbers, at MT minus-ends. Minus-end accumulations drive MT-MT sliding, independent of MT orientation, and this activity always results in the clustering of MT minus-ends. At a mesoscale level, activated dynein-dynactin drives the formation and coalescence of MT asters. Macroscopically, dynein-dynactin activity leads to bulk contraction of millimeter-scale MT networks, demonstrating that minus-end accumulations produce network scale contractile stresses. Our data provides a model for how localized dynein activity is harnessed by cells to produce contractile stresses within the mitotic spindle.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIProcessive dynein-dynactin complexes cooperatively form stable accumulations at MT minus-ends.\\nC_LIO_LIMinus-end accumulations of motors slide MTs without orientation bias, leading to minus-end focusing.\\nC_LIO_LIMinus-end accumulations of motors organize dynamic MTs into asters.\\nC_LIO_LIMinus-end accumulations of motors drive bulk contractions of large-scale MT networks.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Overexpression of Rictor has been demonstrated to result in increased mTORC2 nucleation and activity leading to tumor growth and increased invasive characteristics in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However the mechanisms regulating Rictor expression in these tumors is not clearly understood. In this report, we demonstrate that Rictor is regulated at the level of mRNA translation via HSF1-induced HuR activity. HuR is shown to directly bind the 3' UTR of the Rictor transcript and enhance translational efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that mTORC2/AKT signaling activates HSF1 resulting in a feed-forward cascade in which continued mTORC2 activity is able to drive Rictor expression. RNAi-mediated blockade of AKT, HSF1 or HuR is sufficient to downregulate Rictor and inhibit GBM growth and invasive characteristics in vitro and suppresses xenograft growth in mice. We further demonstrate that constitutive overexpression of HuR is able to maintain Rictor expression under conditions of AKT or HSF1 loss. In an additional level of regulation, miR-218, a known Rictor targeting miRNA is shown to be subject to mTORC2/STAT3-mediated repression. The expression of these components is also examined in patient GBM samples and correlative associations between the relative expression of these factors support the presence of these signaling relationships in GBM. These data support a role for a feed-forward loop mechanism by which mTORC2 activity stimulates Rictor translational efficiency and suppresses miR-218 resulting in enhanced mTORC2 activity in these tumors.",

Here we identified a novel mechanism for VHL suppression in tumors that do not have inactivating mutations. Using developmental processes to uncover new pathways contributing to tumorigenesis, we found that Daam2 promotes glioma formation. Protein expression screening identified an inverse correlation between Daam2 and VHL expression across a host of cancers, including glioma. These in silico insights guided corroborating functional studies, which revealed that Daam2 promotes tumorigenesis by suppressing VHL expression. Furthermore, biochemical analyses demonstrate that Daam2 associates with VHL and facilitates its ubiquitination and degradation. Together, these studies are the first to define an upstream mechanism regulating VHL suppression in cancer and describe the role of Daam2 in tumorigenesis.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceWe found that the glial developmental factor Daam2 promotes glioma tumorigenesis by suppressing VHL expression.

    "abstract": "Across the animal kingdom, environmental light cues are widely involved in regulating gamete release, but the molecular and cellular bases of the photoresponsive mechanisms are poorly understood. In hydrozoan jellyfish, spawning is triggered by dark-light or light-dark transitions acting on the gonad, and is mediated by oocyte maturation-inducing neuropeptide hormones (MIHs) released from the ectoderm. We determined in Clytia hemisphaerica that blue-cyan light triggers spawning in isolated gonads. A candidate opsin (Opsin9) was found co-expressed with MIH within specialised ectodermal cells. Opsin9 knockout jellyfish generated by CRISPR/Cas9 failed to undergo oocyte maturation and spawning, a phenotype reversible by synthetic MIH. Gamete maturation and release in Clytia is thus regulated by gonadal photosensory-neurosecretory cells that secrete MIH in response to light via Opsin9. Similar cells in ancestral eumetazoans may have allowed tissue-level photo-regulation of diverse behaviours, a feature elaborated in cnidarians in parallel with expansion of the opsin gene family.",

The newly synthesized daughter strands and histones are unmodified and must therefore be covalently modified to allow for transmission of important epigenetic marks to daughter cells. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) display a unique cell cycle profile, and control of the cell cycle is known to be critical for their proper differentiation and survival. A major unresolved question is how hPSCs regulate their DNA methylation status through the cell cycle, namely how passive and active demethylation work to maintain a stable genome. TDG, an embryonic essential gene, has been recently implicated as a major enzyme involved in demethylation1. Here we present new data showing that TDG regulates cell cycle related gene expression in human neural progenitors (NPCs) derived from hPSCs and controls their capacity for neural differentiation. These observations suggest that TDG and active demethylation play an important role in hPSC cell cycle regulation and differentiation.",

In this work, we used spatial and temporal transcriptomic data to predict interactions among the genes involved in stem cell regulation. For this, we transcriptionally profiled several stem cell populations and developed a gene regulatory network (GRN) inference algorithm that combines clustering with Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) inference. We leveraged the topology of our networks to infer potential key regulators. The results presented in this work show that our combination of molecular biology approaches, computational biology and mathematical modeling was key to identify candidate factors that function in the stem cells.

    "abstract": "Messenger RNA degradation is an important aspect of post-transcriptional gene regulation and shortening the poly(A) tail is suggested to be the rate-limiting step in mRNA degradation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Ccr4-Not complex is the major deadenylase and contains two subunits with exoribonuclease domains, Ccr4 and Pop2. Although the role of Ccr4 and Pop2 in deadenylation has previously been studied using individual reporter mRNAs, their activity has not been studied transcriptome-wide. Here, we describe END-seq, a method to accurately measure poly(A) tail lengths of individual mRNAs transcriptome-wide, and have used this assay to examine the impact of deleting or mutating CCR4 and POP2 on steady state poly(A) tail length. We found that Ccr4 and Pop2 have differential effects on the poly(A) tail lengths of individual mRNAs. Additionally, though Pop2 has previously been reported to have exonuclease activity, mutations that render it catalytically inactive have no effect on steady-state poly(A) tail lengths. Furthermore, mutations that disrupt the interaction between Ccr4 and Pop2 result in longer poly(A) tails. We also observe an inverse correlation between codon optimality and poly(A) tail length - transcripts containing predominantly optimal codons display fewer changes in poly(A) tail length upon deletion of Ccr4 or Pop2 than those containing less optimal codons. Together, these results indicate that Pop2 modulates poly(A) tail length, at least partially, via its association with Ccr4 and that Pop2 improves the function of Ccr4 in regulating poly(A) tail length. These data provide important insights into poly(A) tail length dynamics in yeast and demonstrate that END-seq is an efficient and accurate method to study poly(A) tail length.",
