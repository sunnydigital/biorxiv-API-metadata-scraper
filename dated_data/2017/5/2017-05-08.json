    "abstract": "Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology, such as RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) required hundreds of thousands of cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent technical advances permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications are based on data produced with this technology. However, RNA-Seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly different. In particular, unlike RNA-Seq, the majority of reported expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time of measurement, or technically-driven, gene expressing RNA, but not at a sufficient level to detected by sequencing technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially across single cells compared to RNA-seq samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this cell-to-cell variation is being driven by technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that scRNA-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this missing data problem is exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation varies cell-to-cell. Then, we show how this technical cell-to-cell variability can be confused with novel biological results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch-effects and confounded experiments can intensify the problem.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in cancer treatment is predicting the clinical response to anti-cancer drugs for each individual patient. For complex diseases such as cancer, characterized by high inter-patient variance, the implementation of precision medicine approaches is dependent upon understanding the pathological processes at the molecular level. While the \\\"omics\\\" era provides unique opportunities to dissect the molecular features of diseases, the ability to utilize it in targeted therapeutic efforts is hindered by both the massive size and diverse nature of the \\\"omics\\\" data. Recent advances with Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNNs), suggests that DLNN could be trained on large data sets to efficiently predict therapeutic responses in cancer treatment. We present the application of Association Rule Mining combined with DLNNs for the analysis of high-throughput molecular profiles of 1001 cancer cell lines, in order to extract cancer-specific signatures in the form of easily interpretable rules and use these rules as input to predict pharmacological responses to a large number of anti-cancer drugs. The proposed algorithm outperformed Random Forests (RF) and Bayesian Multitask Multiple Kernel Learning (BMMKL) classification which currently represent the state-of-the-art in drug-response prediction. Moreover, the in silico pipeline presented, introduces a novel strategy for identifying potential therapeutic targets, as well as possible drug combinations with high therapeutic potential. For the first time, we demonstrate that DLNNs trained on a large pharmacogenomics data-set can effectively predict the therapeutic response of specific drugs in different cancer types. These findings serve as a proof of concept for the application of DLNNs to predict therapeutic responsiveness, a milestone in precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Modifications to transcriptional regulators play a major role in adaptation. Here we compared the effects of multiple beneficial mutations within and between Escherichia coli rpoB, the gene encoding the RNA polymerase {beta} subunit, and rho, which encodes a transcriptional terminator. These two genes have harbored adaptive mutations in numerous E. coli evolution experiments but particularly in our previous large-scale thermal stress experiment, where the two genes characterized two alternative adaptive pathways. To compare the effects of beneficial mutations, we engineered four advantageous mutations into each of the two genes and measured their effects on fitness, growth, gene expression and transcriptional termination at 42.2{degrees}C. Among the eight mutations, two rho mutations had no detectable effect on relative fitness, suggesting they were beneficial only in the context of epistatic interactions. The remaining six mutations had an average relative fitness benefit of [~]20%. The rpoB mutations altered the expression of [~]1700 genes; rho mutations altered the expression of fewer genes, most of which were a subset of the genes altered by rpoB. Across our eight mutants, relative fitness correlated with the degree to which a mutation restored gene expression back to the unstressed, 37.0{degrees}C state. The rho mutations do not enhance transcriptional termination in known rho-terminated regions, but the genome-wide effects of mutations in both genes was to enhance termination. Although beneficial mutations in the two genes did not have identical effects on fitness, growth or gene expression, they acted predominantly through parallel phenotypic effects on gene expression and transcriptional termination.",

    "abstract": "Cellular adhesion provides one of the fundamental forms of biological interaction between cells and their surroundings, yet the continuum modelling of cellular adhesion has remained mathematically challenging. In 2006, Armstrong et al. proposed a mathematical model in the form of an integro-partial differential equation. Although successful in applications, a derivation from an underlying stochastic random walk has remained elusive. In this work we develop a framework by which non-local models can be derived from a space-jump process. We show how the notions of motility and a cell polarization vector can be naturally included. With this derivation we are able to include microscopic biological properties into the model. We show that particular choices yield the original Armstrong model, while others lead to more general models, including a doubly non-local adhesion model and non-local chemotaxis models. Finally, we use random walk simulations to confirm that the corresponding continuum model represents the mean field behaviour of the stochastic random walk.",

    "abstract": "How the brain preserves information about multiple simultaneous items is poorly understood. We report that single neurons can represent multiple different stimuli by interleaving different signals across time. We record single units in an auditory region, the inferior colliculus, while monkeys localize 1 or 2 simultaneous sounds. During dual-sound trials, we find that some neurons fluctuate between firing rates observed for each single sound, either on a whole-trial or on a sub-trial timescale. These fluctuations are correlated in pairs of neurons, can be predicted by the state of local field potentials prior to sound onset, and, in one monkey, can predict which sound will be reported first. We find corroborating evidence of fluctuating activity patterns in a separate data set involving responses of inferotemporal cortex neurons to multiple visual stimuli. Alternation between activity patterns corresponding to each of multiple items may therefore be a general strategy to enhance the brain processing capacity, potentially linking such disparate phenomena as variable neural firing, neural oscillations, and limits in attentional/memory capacity.",

Inspired by such observations, we construct a model of the striatum, an all-inhibitory circuit where sequential activity patterns are prominent, addressing the following key challenges: (i) obtaining control over temporal rescaling of the sequence speed, with the ability to generalize to new speeds; (ii) facilitating flexible expression of distinct sequences via selective activation, concatenation, and recycling of specific subsequences; and (iii) enabling the biologically plausible learning of sequences, consistent with the decoupling of learning and execution suggested by lesion studies showing that cortical circuits are necessary for learning, but that subcortical circuits are sufficient to drive learned behaviors. The same mechanisms that we describe can also be applied to circuits with both excitatory and inhibitory populations, and hence may underlie general features of sequential neural activity pattern generation in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Systems neuroscience is in a head-long rush to record from as many neurons at the same time as possible. As the brain computes and codes using neuron populations, it is hoped these data will uncover the fundamentals of neural computation. But with hundreds, thousands, or more simultaneously recorded neurons comes the inescapable problems of visualising, describing, and quantifying their interactions. Here I argue that network science provides a set of scalable, analytical tools that already solve these problems. By treating neurons as nodes and their interactions as links, a single network can visualise and describe an arbitrarily large recording. I show that with this description we can quantify the effects of manipulating a neural circuit, track changes in population dynamics over time, and quantitatively define theoretical concepts of neural populations such as cell assemblies. Using network science as a core part of analysing population recordings will thus provide both qualitative and quantitative advances to our understanding of neural computation.",

Mean home range size was 818 km2 (95% CI:425-1981) in the Dry Chaco and 237 km2 (95% CI:90-427) in the Humid Chaco/Pantanal. Core areas, defined as the home range area where use was equal to expected use, was consistent across sexes and systems represented on average by the 59% utility distribution isopleth (range:56-64%). Males had a higher probability of larger home ranges and more directional and greater daily movements than females collectively and within systems. The large home ranges in the Dry Chaco are attributable to the relatively low productivity of that semi-arid ecosystem and high heterogeneity in resource distribution while larger than expected home ranges in the Humid Chaco/Pantanal compared to home range estimates from the Brazilian Pantanal may be due to differences in geomorphology and hydrological cycle. The large home ranges of jaguars in western Paraguay and a low proportional area of protected areas in the region demonstrate the importance of private ranchland for the long-term conservation of the species.",

    "abstract": "Almost twenty years after the completion of the C. elegans genome sequence, gene structure annotation is still an ongoing process with new evidence for gene variants still being regularly uncovered by additional in-depth transcriptome studies. While alternative splice forms can allow a single gene to encode several functional isoforms the question of how much spurious splicing is tolerated is still heavily debated.\\n\\nHere we gathered a compendium of 1,682 publicly available C. elegans RNA-seq datasets to increase the dynamic range of detection of RNA isoforms and obtained robust measurements of the relative abundance of each splicing event. While most of the splicing reads come from reproducibly detected splicing events, a large fraction of purported junctions are only supported by a very low number of reads. We devised an automated curation method that takes into account the expression level of each gene to discriminate robust splicing events from potential biological noise. We found that rarely used splice sites disproportionately come from highly expressed genes and are significantly less conserved in other nematode genomes than splice sites with a higher usage frequency.\\n\\nOur increased detection power confirmed trans-splicing for at least 84% of C. elegans protein coding genes. The genes for which trans-splicing was not observed are overwhelmingly low expression genes, suggesting that the mechanism is pervasive but not full captured by organism-wide RNA-Seq.\\n\\nWe generated annotated gene models including quantitative exon usage information for the entire C. elegans genome.

    "abstract": "The minimum audible movement angle increases as a function of source azimuth. If listeners do not perceptually compensate for this change in acuity, then sounds rotating around the head should appear to move faster at the front than at the side. We examined whether judgments of relative amounts of acoustic motion depend on signal center angle and found that the azimuth of two signals strongly affects their point of subjective similarity for motion. Signal motion centered at 90{degrees} had to be roughly twice as large as motion centered at 0{degrees} to be judged as equivalent. This distortion of acoustic space around the listener suggests that the perceived velocity of moving sound sources changes as a function of azimuth around the head. The \\\"equivalent arc ratio,\\\" a mathematical framework based on these results, is used to successfully provide quantitative explanations for previously documented discrepancies in spatial localization, motion perception, and head-to-world coordinate transformations.",

Here, we demonstrate that depletion of Ki-67 in human hTERT-RPE1, WI-38, IMR90, hTERT-BJ cell lines and primary fibroblast cells slowed entry into S phase and coordinately downregulated genes related to DNA replication. Some gene expression changes were partially relieved in Ki-67-depleted hTERT-RPE1 cells by co-depletion of the Rb checkpoint protein, but more thorough suppression of the transcriptional and cell cycle defects was observed upon depletion of cell cycle inhibitor p21. Notably, induction of p21 upon depletion of Ki-67 was a consistent hallmark of cell types in which transcription and cell cycle distribution were sensitive to Ki-67; these responses were absent in cells that did not induce p21. Furthermore, upon Ki-67 depletion, a subset of inactive x (Xi) chromosomes in female hTERT-RPE1 cells displayed several features of compromised heterochromatin maintenance, including decreased H3K27me3 and H4K20me1 labeling. These chromatin alterations were limited to Xi chromosomes localized away from the nuclear lamina and were not observed in checkpoint-deficient 293T cells. Altogether, our results indicate that Ki-67 integrates normal S phase progression and Xi heterochromatin maintenance in p21 checkpoint-proficient human cells.",

The insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway, which has diverse roles from metabolism to stress response and longevity, is activated as part of the HSR2-4. Recent evidence suggest that the IIS pathway is able to affect proteostasis non-autonomously5,6, yet it is not known if it is activated autonomously in stressed cells or systemically as part of an organismic program. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the single forkhead box O (FOXO) homologue DAF-16 functions as the major target of the IIS pathway7 and, together with the heat-shock factor HSF-1, induce the expression of small heat shock proteins in response to heat shock8-10,3. Here we use a novel microfluidic device that allows precise control of the spatiotemporal temperature profile to show that cellular activation of DAF-16 integrates local temperature sensation with systemic signals. We demonstrate that DAF-16 activation in head sensory neurons is essential for DAF-16 activation in other tissues, but show that no known thermosensory neuron is individually required.

    "abstract": "Moonmilk is a karstic speleothem mainly composed of fine calcium carbonate crystals (CaCO3) with different textures ranging from pasty to hard, in which the contribution of biotic rock-building processes is presumed to involve indigenous microorganisms. The real bacterial input in the genesis of moonmilk is difficult to assess leading to controversial hypotheses explaining the origins and the mechanisms (biotic versus abiotic) involved. In this work we undertook a comprehensive approach in order to assess the potential role of filamentous bacteria, particularly a collection of moonmilk-originating Streptomyces, in the genesis of this speleothem. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that indigenous filamentous bacteria could indeed participate in moonmilk development by serving as nucleation sites for CaCO3 deposition. The metabolic activities involved in CaCO3 transformation were furthermore assessed in vitro among the collection of moonmilk Streptomyces, which revealed that peptides/amino acids ammonification, and to a lesser extend ureolysis, could be privileged metabolic pathways participating in carbonate precipitation by increasing the pH of the bacterial environment. Additionally, in silico search for the genes involved in biomineralization processes including ureolysis, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia, active calcium ion transport, and reversible hydration of CO2 allowed to identify genetic predispositions for carbonate precipitation in Streptomyces. Finally, their biomineralization abilities were confirmed by environmental SEM, which allowed to visualize the formation of abundant mineral deposits under laboratory conditions. Overall, our study provides novel evidences that filamentous Actinobacteria could be key protagonists in the genesis of moonmilk through a wide spectrum of biomineralization processes.",

Inactivation of autophagy has been linked with detrimental effects to cells and organisms. The antagonistic pleiotropy theory postulates that fitness promoting genes during youth are harmful during aging (Williams 1957). On this basis we examined genes mediating post-reproductive longevity using an RNA interference screen. From this screen we identified 30 novel regulators of post-reproductive longevity including pha-4. Through downstream analysis of pha-4 we identify that genes governing the early stages of autophagy up until the stage of vesicle nucleation, such as bec-1, strongly extend both lifespan and healthspan. Further, our data demonstrates that the improvements in health and longevity are mediated through the neurons - resulting in reduced neurodegeneration and sarcopenia. We propose that autophagy switches from advantageous to harmful in the context of an age-associated dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Central pattern generators are cell- or network-driven oscillators that underlie motor rhythmicity. The existence and identity of C. elegans CPGs are unknown. Through cell ablation, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging, we identified oscillators for C. elegans reverse locomotion. We show that the cholinergic and excitatory class A motor neurons exhibit intrinsic and oscillatory activity, and such an activity can drive reverse locomotion without premotor interneurons. Regulation of their oscillatory activity, either through effecting the P/Q/N high voltage-activated calcium channel, an endogenous constituent of their intrinsic oscillation, or, via the dual regulation by descending premotor interneurons, determines the propensity, velocity, and sustention of reverse locomotion. Thus, the reversal motor neuron themselves serve as distributed local oscillators; regulation of their intrinsic activity controls the reversal motor state. These findings exemplify anatomic and functional compression: motor executors integrate the role of rhythm generation in a locomotor network that is constrained by small cell numbers.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe class A motor neurons (A-MNs) intrinsically oscillate.\\nC_LIO_LIHigh voltage-activated calcium channel is a constituent of A-MN oscillation.\\nC_LIO_LIRegulation of A-MN oscillation by interneurons determines the reversal state.\\nC_LIO_LIA-MNs integrate the role of multiple neuron types in large locomotor networks.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Human romantic partners tend to have similar physical traits1, but the mechanisms causing this homogamy are controversial. One potential explanation is direct matching to own characteristics2,3. Alternatively, studies showing similarity between parent and partner4,5 support positive sexual imprinting6,7, where individuals are more likely to choose mates with the physical characteristics of their other-sex parent. This interpretation has been strongly criticized because the same pattern could also be caused by sex-linked heritable preferences3, where similarity in appearance between an individuals partner and their other-sex parent is caused by similarity in preferences between the individual and their same-sex parent. The relationships among own, parents and same-sex partners eye color provide an elegant test of these hypotheses, which each postulate a different best predictor of partners eye color. While the matching hypothesis predicts this will be own eye color, the sex-linked heritable preference hypothesis predicts this will be the other-sex parents eye color and the positive sexual imprinting hypothesis predicts this will be the partner-sex parents eye color. Here we show that partner eye color was best predicted by the partner-sex parents eye color. Our results provide clear evidence against matching and sex-linked heritable preference hypotheses, and support the positive sexual imprinting hypothesis of the relationship between own and partners eye color.",

    "abstract": "Reprogramming of human somatic cells to induce pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generates valuable precursors for disease modeling and regenerative medicine. However, the reprogramming process can be inefficient and noisy, creating many partially reprogrammed cells in addition to fully reprogrammed iPSCs. To address these shortcomings, we developed a micropatterned substrate that allows for dynamic live-cell microscopy of thousands of cell subpopulations undergoing reprogramming. Micropatterning facilitated a change in shape, size and clustering of nuclei to promote somatic identity erasure. Increased proliferation, cell density and decreased intercellular YAP signaling accompanied these nuclear changes. A combination of eight nuclear characteristics could be used to track reprogramming progression and distinguish partially reprogrammed cells from those that were fully reprogrammed.\\n\\nMicropatterned substrates constitute a new tool for facile iPSC production and can be used in high-throughput to probe and understand the subcellular changes that accompany human cell fate transitions.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the basis of protein thermostability raises a general question: which residue with specific interaction degrees is more important to the protein thermostability? A strictly selected dataset of 131 pairs of thermophilic (TPs) and mesophilic proteins (MPs) was constructed. There were 6.4% and 8.4% of the total residues in sequences did not interact with others in TPs and MPs. The amino acid contents in sequences are closest to those with the interaction degrees of 3 according to the Chi-squared distances. Only Glu, Gln and the amide residues showed significant differences in sequences, which was the same as identified at low residue interaction degrees. However, we observed significant Phe, Lys, Leu, Gln and the charged, aliphatic, aromatic, positive charged and small residues at high interaction degree. Among them, Phe was rarely reported previously although aromatic residues were well-known contributor to protein thermostability. Finally, we took aspartate transcarbamylases as an example to explain how a residue with various interaction degrees contributed differently to their thermostability. Our results clearly demonstrated the differences of amino acids in sequence between TPs and MPs could only represent those involved in low interaction degrees. Much more residues with significant differences existed at high interaction degrees even if they had few significant amino acids in sequences. The interaction degree-based method should be an alternative tool in extracting valuable eigenvalues for predicting proteins attributes in bioinformatics. It could also provide a new perspective for studying the thermostability of proteins and engineering novel thermostable proteins.\\n\\nList of abbreviations",

    "abstract": "The transient outward potassium current (Ito) plays a key, albeit incompletely defined, role in cardiomyocyte physiology and pathophysiology. In light of the technical challenges of studying adult human cardiomyocytes, this study examines the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) as a system which potentially preserves the native cellular milieu of human cardiomyocytes. ISPC-CMs express a robust Ito with slow recovery kinetics and fail to express the rapidly recovering Ito,f which is implicated in human disease. Overexpression of the accessory subunit KChIP2 (which is not expressed in iPSC-CMs) resulted in restoration of a rapid component of recovery. To define the functional role of Ito, dynamic current clamp was used to introduce computationally modeled currents into iPSC-CMs while recording action potentials. However, iPSC-CMs exhibit action potentials with multiple immature physiological properties, including slow upstroke velocity, heterogeneous action potential waveforms, and the absence of a phase 1 notch, thus potentially limiting the utility of these cells as a model of adult cardiomyocytes. Importantly, the introduction of modeled inwardly rectified current (IK1) ameliorated these immature properties by restoring a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential. In this context of normalized action potential morphologies, dynamic current clamp experiments introducing Ito,f demonstrated that there is significant cell-to-cell heterogeneity and that the functional effect of Ito,f is highly sensitive to the action potential plateau voltage in each cell.",

    "abstract": "Fish can be threatened by distorted sex ratios that arise during sex differentiation. It is therefore important to understand sex determination and differentiation, especially in river-dwelling fish that are often exposed to environmental factors that may interfere with sex differentiation. However, sex differentiation is not sufficiently understood in keystone taxa such as the Thymallinae, one of the three salmonid subfamilies. Here we study a wild grayling (Thymallus thymallus) population that suffers from distorted sex ratios. We found sex determination in the wild and in captivity to be genetic and linked to the sdY locus. We therefore studied sex-specific gene expression in embryos and early larvae that were bred and raised under different experimental conditions, and we studied gonadal morphology in five monthly samples taken after hatching. Significant sex-specific changes in gene expression (affecting about 25,000 genes) started around hatching. Gonads were still undifferentiated three weeks after hatching, but about half of the fish showed immature testes around seven weeks after hatching. Over the next few months, this phenotype was mostly replaced by the \\\"testis-to-ovary\\\" or \\\"ovaries\\\" phenotypes. The gonads of the remaining fish, i.e. approximately half of the fish in each sampling period, remained undifferentiated until six months after fertilization. Genetic sexing of the last two samples revealed that fish with undifferentiated gonads were all males, who, by that time, were on average larger than the genetic females (verified in 8-months old juveniles raised in another experiment). Only 12% of the genetic males showed testicular tissue six months after fertilization. We conclude that sex differentiation starts around hatching, goes through an all-male stage for both sexes (which represents a rare case of \\\"undifferentiated\\\" gonochoristic species that usually go through an all-female stage), and is delayed in males who, instead of developing their gonads, grow faster than females during these juvenile stages.\\n\\nAuthor contributionMRR and CW initiated the project. DM, OS, AU, LMC, LW, and CW sampled the adult fish, did the experimental in vitro fertilizations, and prepared the embryos for experimental rearing in the laboratory.

The RNA-seq data were analyzed by OS, JR, and MRR, the histological analyses were done by DM, supervised by SK, and the molecular genetic sexing was performed by DM, OS, AU, and KBM.

    "abstract": "Primary microcephaly is a congenital brain malformation characterized by a head circumference less than three standard deviations below the mean for age and sex and results in moderate to severe mental deficiencies and decreased lifespan. We recently studied two children with primary microcephaly in an otherwise unaffected family. Exome sequencing identified an autosomal recessive mutation leading to an amino acid substitution in a WD40 domain of the highly conserved Coatomer Protein Complex, Subunit Beta 2 (COPB2). To study the role of Copb2 in neural development, we utilized genome editing technology to generate an allelic series in the mouse. Two independent null alleles revealed that Copb2 is essential for early stages of embryogenesis. Mice homozygous for the patient variant (Copb2R254C/R254C) appear to have a grossly normal phenotype, likely due to differences in corticogenesis between the two species. Strikingly, mice heterozygous for the patient mutation and a null allele (Copb2R254C/Znf) show a severe perinatal phenotype including low neonatal weight, significantly increased apoptosis in the brain, and death within the first week of life. Immunostaining of the Copb2R254C/Znf brain revealed a reduction in layer V (CTIP2+) neurons, while the overall cell density of the cortex is unchanged. Moreover, disruption of Copb2 in mouse neurospheres resulted in reduced proliferation. These results identify a general requirement for COPB2 in embryogenesis and a specific role in corticogenesis. We further demonstrate the utility of CRISPR-Cas9 generated mouse models in the study of potential pathogenicity of variants of potential clinical interest.",

In non-allelic gene conversion (NAGC), the donor and the acceptor are at distinct genetic loci. Despite the role NAGC plays in various genetic diseases and the concerted evolution of gene families, the parameters that govern NAGC are not well-characterized. Here, we survey duplicate gene families and identify converted tracts in 46% of them. These conversions reflect a large GC-bias of NAGC. We develop a sequence evolution model that leverages substantially more information in duplicate sequences than used by previous methods and use it to estimate the parameters that govern NAGC in humans: a mean converted tract length of 250bp and a probability of 2.5x10-7 per generation for a nucleotide to be converted (an order of magnitude higher than the point mutation rate). Despite this high baseline rate, we show that NAGC slows down as duplicate sequences diverge--until an eventual \\\"escape\\\" of the sequences from its influence. As a result, NAGC has a small average effect on the sequence divergence of duplicates. This work improves our understanding of the NAGC mechanism and the role that it plays in the evolution of gene duplicates.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOral epithelial cells discriminate between pathogenic and non-pathogenic stimuli, and only induce an inflammatory response when they are exposed to high levels of a potentially harmful microorganism. The pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in epithelial cells that mediate this differential response are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) is an oral epithelial cell PRR that binds to exposed {beta}-glucans on the surface of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Binding of C. albicans to EphA2 on oral epithelial cells activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in an inoculum-dependent manner, and is required for induction of a pro-inflammatory and antifungal response. Inhibition of EphA2 in mice decreases IL-17 signaling during oropharyngeal candidiasis, resulting in increased oral fungal burden and fungal dissemination. Our study reveals that EphA2 functions as PRR for {beta}-glucans that senses epithelial cell fungal burden and is required for the maximal mucosal inflammatory response to C. albicans.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryEphA2 is a pattern recognition receptor that senses fungal {beta}-glucans to induce an inflammatory response in oral epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Extensively drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (XDR-KP) infections cause high mortality and are disseminating globally. Identifying the genetic basis underpinning resistance allows for rapid diagnosis and treatment. XDR isolates sourced from Greece and Brazil, including nineteen polymyxin-resistant and five polymyxin-susceptible strains, underwent whole genome sequencing. Approximately 90% of polymyxin resistance was enabled by alterations upstream or within mgrB. The most common mutation identified was an insertion at nucleotide position 75 in mgrB via an ISKpn26-like element in the ST258 lineage and ISKpn13 in one ST11 isolate. Three strains acquired an IS1 element upstream of mgrB and another strain had an ISKpn25 insertion at 133 bp. Other isolates had truncations (C28STOP, Q30STOP) or a missense mutation (D31E) affecting mgrB. Complementation assays revealed all mgrB perturbations contributed to resistance. Missense mutations in phoQ (T281M, G385C) were also found to facilitate resistance. Several variants in phoPQ co-segregating with the ISKpn26-like insertion were identified as potential partial suppressor mutations. Three ST258 samples were found to contain subpopulations with different resistance conferring mutations, including the ISKpn26-like insertion colonising with a novel mutation in pmrB (P158R), both confirmed via complementation assays. We also characterized a new multi-drug resistant Klebsiella quasipneumoniae strain ST2401 which was susceptible to polymyxins. These findings highlight the broad spectrum of chromosomal modifications which can facilitate and regulate resistance against polymyxins in K. pneumoniae.\\n\\nDATA SUMMARYO_LIWhole genome sequencing of the 24 clinical isolates has been deposited under BioProject PRJNA307517 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA307517).\\nC_LI\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTKlebsiella pneumoniae contributes to a high abundance of nosocomial infections and the rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance hinders treatment. Polymyxins are predominantly utilized to treat multidrug-resistant infections, however, resistance to the polymyxins is arising. This increasing prevalence in polymyxin resistance is evident especially in Greece and Brazil. Identifying the genomic variations conferring resistance in clinical isolates from these regions assists with potentially detecting novel alterations and tracing the spread of particular strains. This study commonly found mutations in the gene mgrB, the negative regulator of PhoPQ, known to cause resistance in KP. In the remaining isolates, missense mutations in phoQ were accountable for resistance. Multiple novel mutations were detected to be segregating with mgrB perturbations. This was either due to a mixed heterogeneous sample of two polymyxin-resistant strains, or because of multiple mutations within the same strain. Of interest was the validation of novel mutations inphoPQ segregating with a previously known ISKpn26-like element in disrupted mgrB isolates. Complementation of these phoPQ mutations revealed a reduction in minimum inhibitory concentrations and suggests the first evidence of partial suppressor mutations in KP. This research builds upon our current understanding of heteroresistance, lineage specific mutations and regulatory variations relating to polymyxin resistance.",

ZIKV has been associated with severe symptoms including infant microcephaly and Guillain Barre syndrome, stimulating interest in understanding factors governing ZIKV infection. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) has been shown to be an infection factor for multiple viruses. We investigated the role of Hsp70 in the ZIKV infection process. We localized Hsp70 protein to the Vero cell membrane surface by confocal microscopy and demonstrated that, inside the cell, there is significant co-localization between Hsp70 and ZIKV E protein. Inducing and suppressing Hsp70 expression increased and decreased ZIKV production, respectively. Antibody blocking cell surface-localized Hsp70 decreased ZIKV cell infection rates and production of infectious virus particles, as did competition with recombinant Hsp70 protein. Our data suggest that Hsp70 is an important factor in the ZIKV infection process. Understanding the interactions between Hsp70 and ZIKV may lead to novel therapeutics for ZIKV infection, particularly for pregnant women and fetuses.",

Here, we describe a computational model of the reflexive saccadic oculomotor system incorporating the basal ganglia, key structures in motor control and competition between possible actions. To restrict the likelihood of overfitting the model it is structured and parameterised by the known anatomy and neurophysiology along with data from a single experimental behavioural paradigm, then validated by testing against several additional behavioural experimental data without modification of the parameters. With this model we reproduce a range of fundamental reflexive saccadic results both qualitatively and quantitatively, comprising: the distribution of saccadic latencies; the effect of eccentricity, luminance and fixation-target interactions on saccadic latencies; and the effect of competing targets on saccadic endpoint. By investigating the model dynamics we are able to provide mechanistic explanations for the sources of these behaviours. Further, because of its accesibility, the oculomotor system has also been used to study general principle of sensorimotor control. We interpret the ability of the basal ganglia to successfully control saccade selection in our model as further evidence for the action selection hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is an ancient interaction between plants and fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota. In exchange for photosynthetically fixed carbon, the fungus provides the plant host with greater access to soil nutrients via an extensive network of root-external hyphae. Here, to determine the impact of the symbiosis on the host ionome, the concentration of nineteen elements was determined in the roots and leaves of a panel of thirty maize varieties, grown under phosphorus limiting conditions, with, or without, inoculation with the fungus Funneliformis mosseae. Although the most recognized benefit of the symbiosis to the host plant is greater access to soil phosphorus, the concentration of a number of other elements responded significantly to inoculation across the panel as a whole. In addition, variety-specific effects indicated the importance of plant genotype to the response. Clusters of elements were identified that varied in a coordinated manner across genotypes, and that were maintained between non-inoculated and inoculated plants.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Here, we present a highly efficient toolkit enabling genome and epigenome engineering in the chicken embryo, and demonstrate its utility by probing gene regulatory interactions mediated by neural crest enhancers. First, we optimise efficient guide-RNA expression from novel chick U6-mini-vectors, provide a strategy for rapid somatic gene knockout and establish protocol for evaluation of mutational penetrance by targeted next generation sequencing. We show that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of transcription factors causes a reduction in their cognate enhancer-driven reporter activity. Next, we assess endogenous enhancer function using both enhancer deletion and nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) effector fusions to modulate enhancer chromatin landscape, thus providing the first report of epigenome engineering in a developing embryo. Finally, we use the synergistic activation mediator (SAM) system to activate an endogenous target promoter. The novel genome and epigenome engineering toolkit developed here enables manipulation of endogenous gene expression and enhancer activity in chicken embryos, facilitating high-resolution analysis of gene regulatory interactions in vivo.\\n\\nSummary StatementWe present an optimised toolkit for efficient genome and epigenome engineering using CRISPR in chicken embryos, with a particular focus on probing gene regulatory interactions during neural crest development.\\n\\nList of AbbreviationsGenome Engineering (GE), Epigenome Engineering (EGE), single guide RNA (sgRNA), Neural Crest (NC), Transcription Factor (TF), Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), somite stage (ss), Hamburger Hamilton (HH).",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia endosymbionts may be acquired by horizontal transfer, by introgression through hybridization between closely related species, or by cladogenic retention during speciation. All three modes of acquisition have been demonstrated, but their relative frequency is largely unknown. Drosophila suzukii and its sister species D. subpulchrella harbor Wolbachia, denoted wSuz and wSpc, very closely related to wRi, identified in California populations of D. simulans. However, these variants differ in their induced phenotypes: wRi causes significant cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in D. simulans, but CI has not been detected in D. suzukii or D. subpulchrella. Our draft genomes of wSuz and wSpc contain full-length copies of 703 of the 734 single-copy genes found in wRi. Over these coding sequences, wSuz and wSpc differ by only 0.004% (i.e., 28 of 704,883 bp); they are sisters relative to wRi, from which each differs by 0.014-0.015%. Using published data from D. melanogaster, Nasonia wasps and Nomada bees to calibrate relative rates of Wolbachia versus host nuclear divergence, we conclude that wSuz and wSpc are too similar - by at least a factor of 100 - to be plausible candidates for cladogenic transmission. These three wRi-like Wolbachia, which differ in CI phenotype in their native hosts, have different numbers of orthologs of genes postulated to contribute to CI; and the CI loci differ at several nucleotides that may account for the CI difference. We discuss the general problem of distinguishing alternative modes of Wolbachia acquisition, focusing on the difficulties posed by limited knowledge of variation in absolute and relative rates of molecular evolution for host nuclear genomes, mitochondria and Wolbachia.",

However, much of the perceived benefit of such discoveries lies in the promise that the identification of genes that influence disease would directly translate into the identification of potential therapeutic targets (1-4), but this has yet to be realised at a level reflecting expectation. One reason for this, we suggest, is that GWAS to date have generally not focused on phenotypes that directly relate to the progression of disease, and thus speak to disease treatment.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown that kinship normally determines fertility in humans and animals. At smaller populations the curve of fertility against kinship rises steeply as kinship rises until inbreeding is reached. In large and progressively larger populations, fertility slowly falls. At an equilibrium point fertility matches replacement. Away from that, fertility changes by one of four published time courses. Earlier we demonstrated damped oscillation in a population of captive fruit flies. I hypothesized that since fertility changes so rapidly, DNA base mutations could not be the cause. The mechanism must be epigenetic, the control of genes, and gave varying doses of a methylating cocktail to the same flies. The fly population changed in a complex way, which only happens when there are pre-zygotic and post-zygotic processes in effect together.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThere is evidence for an epigenetic effect - with both pre-zygotic and post-zygotic components - of kinship on fertility of flies (Drosophila melanogaster) induced by a methylating cocktail.",

    "abstract": "The killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) region of human chromosome 19 contains up to sixteen genes for natural killer (NK) cell receptors that recognize human leukocyte antigen (HLA)/peptide complexes and other ligands. The KIR proteins fulfill functional roles in infections, pregnancy, autoimmune diseases, and transplantation. However, their characterization remains a constant challenge. Not only are the genes highly homologous due to their recent evolution by tandem duplications, but the region is structurally dynamic due to frequent transposon-mediated recombination. A sequencing approach that precisely captures the complexity of KIR haplotypes for functional annotation is desirable.\\n\\nWe present a unique approach to haplotype the KIR loci using Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT(R)) Sequencing. Using this method, we have - for the first time - comprehensively sequenced and phased sixteen KIR haplotypes from eight individuals without imputation. The information revealed four novel haplotype structures, a novel gene-fusion allele, novel and confirmed insertion/deletion events, a homozygous individual, and overall diversity for the structural haplotypes and their alleles.\\n\\nThese KIR haplotypes augment our existing knowledge by providing high-quality references, evolutionary informers, and source material for imputation.

For schizophrenia (SCZ), however, while sets of genes have been implicated through study of rare variation, only two risk genes have been identified.\\n\\nMethodsWe used hierarchical Bayesian modeling of rare variant genetic architecture to estimate mean effect sizes and risk-gene proportions, analyzing the largest available collection of whole exome sequence (WES) data for schizophrenia (1,077 trios, 6,699 cases and 13,028 controls), and data for four NDDs (ASD, ID, DD, and EPI; total 10,792 trios, and 4,058 cases and controls).\\n\\nResultsFor SCZ, we estimate 1,551 risk genes, more risk genes and weaker effects than for NDDs. We provide power analyses to predict the number of risk gene discoveries as more data become available, demonstrating greater value of case-control over trio samples. We confirm and augment prior risk gene and gene set enrichment results for SCZ and NDDs. In particular, we detected 98 new DD risk genes at FDR < 0.05. Correlations of risk-gene posterior probabilities are high across four NDDs ({rho} > 0.55), but low between SCZ and the NDDs ({rho} < 0.3). In depth analysis of 288 NDD genes shows highly significant protein-protein interaction (PPI) network connectivity, and functionally distinct PPI subnetworks based on pathway enrichments, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) cell types and multi-region developmental brain RNA-seq.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have extended a pipeline used in ASD studies and applied it to infer rare genetic parameters for SCZ and four NDDs. We find many new DD risk genes, supported by gene set enrichment and PPI network connectivity analyses. We find greater similarity among NDDs than between NDDs and SCZ. NDD gene subnetworks are implicated in postnatally expressed presynaptic and postsynaptic genes, and for transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation in prenatal neural progenitor and stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of variants and long-range haplotypes in genomes of single human cells remains very challenging. Common approaches require extensive in vitro amplification of genomes of individual cells using DNA polymerases and high-throughput short-read DNA sequencing. These approaches have two notable drawbacks. First, polymerase replication errors could generate tens of thousands of false positive calls per genome. Second, relatively short sequence reads contain little to no haplotype information. Here we report a method, which is dubbed SISSOR (Single-Stranded Sequencing using micrOfluidic Reactors), for accurate single-cell genome sequencing and haplotyping. A microfluidic processor is used to separate the Watson and Crick strands of the double-stranded chromosomal DNA in a single cell and to randomly partition megabase-size DNA strands into multiple nanoliter compartments for amplification and construction of barcoded libraries for sequencing. The separation and partitioning of large single-stranded DNA fragments of the homologous chromosome pairs allows for the independent sequencing of each of the complementary and homologous strands. This enables the assembly of long haplotypes and reduction of sequence errors by using the redundant sequence information and haplotype-based error removal. We demonstrated the ability to sequence single-cell genomes with error rates as low as 10-8 and average 500kb long DNA fragments that can be assembled into haplotype contigs with N50 greater than 7Mb. The performance could be further improved with more uniform amplification and more accurate sequence alignment. The ability to obtain accurate genome sequences and haplotype information from single cells will enable applications of genome sequencing for diverse clinical needs.",

    "abstract": "1Hundreds of clinical studies have been published that demonstrate associations between the human microbiome and a variety of diseases. Yet, fundamental questions remain on how we can generalize this knowledge. For example, if diseases are mainly characterized by a small number of pathogenic species, then new targeted antimicrobial therapies may be called for. Alternatively, if diseases are characterized by a lack of healthy commensal bacteria, then new probiotic therapies might be a better option. Results from individual studies, however, can be inconsistent or in conflict, and comparing published data is further complicated by the lack of standard processing and analysis methods.\\n\\nHere, we introduce the MicrobiomeHD database, which includes 29 published case-control gut microbiome studies spanning ten different diseases. Using standardized data processing and analyses, we perform a comprehensive crossdisease meta-analysis of these studies. We find consistent and specific patterns of disease-associated microbiome changes. A few diseases are associated with many individual bacterial associations, while most show only around 20 genus-level changes. Some diseases are marked by the presence of pathogenic microbes whereas others are characterized by a depletion of health-associated bacteria. Furthermore, over 60% of microbes associated with individual diseases fall into a set of \\\"core\\\" health and disease-associated microbes, which are associated with multiple disease states. This suggests a universal microbial response to disease.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that sensorimotor learning under real-life conditions relies on a composition of several learning processes. Nevertheless, most studies examine learning behaviour in relation to one specific learning mechanism. In this study, we examined the interaction between reward-based skill acquisition and motor adaptation to changes of object dynamics. Thirty healthy subjects, split into two groups, acquired the skill of balancing a pole on a cart in virtual reality. In one group, we gradually increased the gravity, making the task easier in the beginning and more difficult towards the end. In the second group, subjects had to acquire the skill on the maximum, most difficult gravity level. We hypothesized that the gradual increase in gravity during skill acquisition supports learning despite the necessary adjustments to changes in cart-pole dynamics. We found that the gradual group benefits from the slow increment, although overall improvement was interrupted by the changes in gravity and resulting system dynamics, which caused short-term degradations in performance and timing of actions. In conclusion, our results deliver evidence for an interaction of reward-based skill acquisition and motor adaptation processes, which indicates the importance of both processes for the development of optimized skill acquisition schedules.",

    "abstract": "Activated visual cortex typically engages in neuronal synchronization in the gamma-frequency band (30-90 Hz). Gamma-band synchronization is related to cognitive functioning, and its mechanisms have been extensively investigated, predominantly through in-vitro studies. To further elucidate its mechanisms in-vivo, we performed simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and electrophysiological recordings of visual cortical areas 17 and 21a in the anesthetized cat. Viral transfection with AAV1 or AAV9 under a CamKII promoter led to robust Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expression. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that all ChR2-expressing neurons were negative for Parvalbumin, consistent with predominant or exclusive expression in excitatory neurons. Optogenetic stimulation used primarily surface illumination directly above the transfected and recorded cells. Stimulation with constant light led to strong and sustained gamma-band synchronization with strength and bandwidth similar to visually induced gamma. Rhythmic stimulation with light-pulse trains or sinusoidal light modulation revealed strongest resonance for gamma-band frequencies. Gamma resonance was confirmed by optogenetic white-noise stimulation. White-noise stimulation allowed the quantification of the transfer function between the optogenetic stimulation and the local field potential response. This transfer function showed a dominant peak in the gamma band. Thus, we find that visual cortical circuits resonate most strongly to gamma-band components in their input. This resonance renders both the sensitivity to input, and the output of these circuits, selectively tuned to gamma.\\n\\nSignificance StatementActivated groups of cortical neurons often display rhythmic synchronization in the gamma-frequency band (30-90 Hz). Gamma-band synchronization is particularly well studied in visual cortex. We used optogenetics to control visual cortex neurons with light. Different optogenetic stimulation protocols, using constant light, rhythmically modulated light or white-noise modulated light, all demonstrated that the investigated circuits predominantly resonate to stimulation in the gamma band. The observed gamma-band resonance renders visual cortical circuits most sensitive to gamma-rhythmic synaptic inputs. This in turn renders their spike output and the ensuing interareal synchronization gamma rhythmic.\\n\\nThis work was supported by DFG (SPP 1665, FOR 1847, FR2557/5-1-CORNET to P.F.; EXC 1086, DI 1908/5-1, DI 1908/6-1 to I.D.), BMBF (01GQ1301 to I.D.), EU (HEALTH-F2-2008-200728-BrainSynch, FP7-604102-HBP, FP7-600730-Magnetrodes to P.F.; ERC Starting Grant OptoMotorPath to I.D.), a European Young Investigator Award to P.F., the FENS-Kavli Network of Excellence to I.D., National Institutes of Health (1U54MH091657-WU-Minn-Consortium-HCP to P.F.), the LOEWE program (NeFF to P.F. and I.D.).

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a major technique for human brain mapping. We present a Fast Periodic Stimulation (FPS) fMRI approach, demonstrating its high effectiveness in defining category-selective brain regions. Observers see a dynamic stream of widely variable natural object images alternating at a fast rate (6 images/sec). Every 9 seconds, a short burst of variable face images contrasting with objects in pairs induces an objective 0.111 Hz face-selective neural response in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex and beyond. A model-free Fourier analysis achieves a two-fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio compared to a conventional block-design approach with identical stimuli. Periodicity of category contrast and random variability among images minimize low-level visual confounds while preserving naturalness of the stimuli, leading to the highest values (80-90%) of test-retest reliability yet reported in this area of research. FPS-fMRI opens a new avenue for understanding brain function with low temporal resolution methods.\\n\\nHighlightsFPS-fMRI achieves a two-fold increase in peak SNR over conventional approach\\n\\nFPS-fMRI reveals comprehensive extended face-selective areas including ATL\\n\\nFPS-fMRI achieves high specificity by minimizing influence of low-level visual cues\\n\\nFPS-fMRI achieves very high test-retest reliability (80%-90%) in spatial activation map\\n\\neTOC BlurbIn Brief\\n\\nGao et al. present a novel FPS-fMRI approach, which achieves a two-fold increase in peak signal-to-noise ratio in defining the neural basis of visual categorization while preserving ecological validity, minimizing low-level visual confounds and reaching very high (80%-90%) test-retest reliability.",

    "abstract": "Summary paragraphCognition and behavior emerge from the dynamic interaction of widely distributed, but functionally specialized brain networks. However, it remains unclear how network-level interactions dynamically reorganize to support ever-shifting cognitive and behavioral demands. Here, we investigate how the interaction between posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and lateral posterior (LP) / Pulvinar is shaped by ongoing fluctuations in pupil-linked arousal, which is a non-invasive measure related to neuromodulatory tone in the brain. We found that fluctuations in pupil-linked arousal tracked the dynamic interaction between PPC and LP/Pulvinar characterized by changes in the direction and carrier frequency of oscillatory interaction. Active visual exploration by saccadic eye movements elicited similar transitions in thalamo-cortical interaction. These findings suggest a common network substrate of both spontaneous activity and active vision. Thus, neuromodulators may play a role in dynamically sculpting the patterns of thalamo-cortical functional interaction that underlie visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Short-term synaptic plasticity is a critical regulator of neural circuits, and largely determines how information is temporally processed. In the olfactory bulb, afferent olfactory receptor neurons respond to increasing concentrations of odorants with barrages of action potentials, and their terminals have an extraordinarily high release probability (Sicard, 1986; Murphy et al., 2004). These features suggest that during naturalistic stimuli, afferent input to the olfactory bulb is subject to strong synaptic depression, presumably truncating the postsynaptic response to afferent stimuli. To examine this issue, we used single glomerular stimulation in mouse olfactory bulb slices to measure the synaptic dynamics of afferent-evoked input at physiological stimulus frequencies. In cell-attached recordings, mitral cells responded to high frequency stimulation with sustained responses, whereas external tufted cells responded transiently. Consistent with previous reports (Murphy et al., 2004), olfactory nerve terminals onto both cell types had a high release probability (0.7), from a single pool of slowly recycling vesicles, indicating that the distinct responses of mitral and external tufted cells to high frequency stimulation did not originate presyaptically. Rather, distinct temporal response profiles in mitral cells and external tufted cells could be attributed to slow dendrodendritic responses in mitral cells, as blocking this slow current in mitral cells converted mitral cell responses to a transient response profile, typical of external tufted cells. Our results suggest that despite strong axodendritic synaptic depression, the balance of axodendritic and dendrodendritic circuitry in external tufted cells and mitral cells, respectively, tunes the postsynaptic responses to high frequency, naturalistic stimulation.\\n\\nKey PointsO_LIThe release probability of the ORN is reportedly one of the highest in the brain (Murphy et al., 2004), which is predicted to impose a transient temporal filter on postsynaptic cells.\\nC_LIO_LIMitral cells responded to high frequency ORN stimulation with sustained transmission, whereas external tufted cells responded transiently.\\nC_LIO_LIThe release probability of ORNs (0.7) was equivalent across mitral and external tufted cells and could be explained by a single pool of slowly recycling vesicles.\\nC_LIO_LIThe sustained response in mitral cells resulted from dendrodendritic amplification in mitral cells, which was blocked by NMDA and mGluR1 receptor antagonists, converting mitral cell responses to transient response profiles.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results suggest that although the afferent ORN synapse shows strong synaptic depression, dendrodendritic circuitry in mitral cells produces robust amplification of brief afferent input, thus the relative strength of axodendritic and dendrodendritic input determines the postsynaptic response profile.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "How the brain sequentially groups sensory events into temporal chunks and how this process is modulated by attention are fundamental questions in cognitive neuroscience. Sequential grouping includes bottom-up primitive grouping and top-down knowledge-based grouping. In speech perception, grouping acoustic features into syllables can rely on bottom-up acoustic continuity cues but grouping syllables into words critically relies on the listeners lexical knowledge. This study investigates whether top-down attention is required to apply lexical knowledge to group syllables into words, by concurrently monitoring neural entrainment to syllables and words using electroencephalography (EEG). When attention is directed to a competing speech stream or cross-modally to a silent movie, neural entrainment to syllables is weakened but neural entrainment to words largely diminishes. These results strongly suggest that knowledge-based grouping of syllables into words requires top-down attention and is a bottleneck for the neural processing of unattended speech.",

    "abstract": "While the composition of the human gut microbiome has been well defined, the forces governing its assembly are poorly understood. Recently, prominent members of this community from the order Bacteroidales were shown to possess the type VI secretion system (T6SS), which mediates contact-dependent antagonism between Gram-negative bacteria. However, the distribution of the T6SS in human gut microbiomes and its role have not yet been characterized. To address this challenge, we construct an extensive catalog of T6SS effector/immunity (E-I) genes from three genetic architectures (GA1-3) found in Bacteroidales genomes. We then use metagenomic analysis to assess the abundances of these genes across a large set of gut microbiome samples. We find that despite E-I diversity across reference strains, each individual microbiome harbors a limited set of E-I genes representing a single E-I genotype. Importantly, for GA1-2, these genotypes are not associated with a specific species, suggesting selection for compatibility. GA3, in contrast, is restricted to B. fragilis, and its low diversity reflects a single B. fragilis strain per sample. We further show that in infant microbiomes GA3 is enriched and B. fragilis strains are replaced over time, suggesting competition for dominance in developing microbiomes. Finally, we find a strong association between the presence of GA3 and increased abundance of Bacteroides, indicating that this system confers a selective advantage in vivo in Bacteroides rich ecosystems. Combined, our findings provide the first comprehensive characterization of the T6SS landscape in the human microbiome, implicating it in both intra- and inter-species interactions.",
