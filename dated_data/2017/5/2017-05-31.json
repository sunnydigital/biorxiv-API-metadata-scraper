    "abstract": "Adult Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies were placed into one end of a tube near to repellents (benzaldehyde and heat) and away from the other end containing attractants (light and a favored temperature). They escaped from the repellents and went to the attractants. Five motile mutants that failed to do that were isolated. They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal sensory stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. The mutants, although motile, failed to respond to stimuli at both 34{degrees}C and at room temperature. Some of the mutants have been mapped. It is proposed that the information from the different sensory receptors comes together at an intermediate, called \\\"inbetween\\\" (Inbet), that brings about a behavioral response. The Boss is defined here.",

    "abstract": "Promiscuity can drive the evolution of sexual conflict before and after mating occurs. Post-mating, the male ejaculate can selfishly manipulate female physiology leading to a chemical arms race between the sexes. Theory suggests that drift and sexually antagonistic coevolution can cause allopatric populations to evolve different chemical interactions between the sexes, thereby leading to postmating reproductive barriers and speciation. There is, however, little empirical evidence supporting this form of speciation. We tested this theory by creating an experimental evolutionary model of Drosophila melanogaster populations undergoing different levels of interlocus sexual conflict. We found that allopatric populations under elevated sexual conflict show assortative mating indicating premating reproductive isolation. Further, these allopatric populations also show reduced copulation duration and sperm defense ability when mating happens between individuals between individuals across populations compared to that within the same population, indicating postmating prezygotic isolation. Sexual conflict can cause reproductive isolation in allopatric populations through the coevolution of chemical (postmating prezygotic) as well as behavioural (premating) interaction between the sexes. Thus, to our knowledge, we provide the first comprehensive evidence of postmating (as well as premating) reproductive isolation due to sexual conflict.",

    "abstract": "Multiple approaches have been proposed to study differential splicing from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data1, including the analysis of transcript isoforms2,3, clusters of splice-junctions4,5, alternative splicing events6-8 and exonic regions9. However, many challenges remain unsolved, including the limitation in speed, the computing capacity and storage requirements, the constraints in the number of reads needed to achieve sufficient accuracy, and the lack of robust methods to account for variability between replicates and for analyses across multiple conditions. We present here a significant extension of SUPPA8 to enable streamlined analysis of differential splicing across multiple conditions, taking into account biological variability. We show that SUPPA differential splicing analysis achieves high accuracy using extensive experimental and simulated data compared to other methods; and shows higher accuracy at low sequencing depth, with short read lengths, and using replicas with unbalanced depth, which has important implications for the cost-effective use of RNA-seq data for splicing analysis. We also validate the analysis of multiple conditions with SUPPA by studying differential splicing during iPS-cell to neuron differentiation and during erythroblast differentiation, providing support for the applicability of SUPPA for the robust analysis of differential splicing beyond binary comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the forebrain neuromodulation by the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is fundamental for cognitive and systems neuroscience. The diffuse projections of individual LC neurons and presumably their synchronous spiking have long been perceived as features of the global nature of noradrenergic neuromodulation. Yet, the commonly referenced \\\"synchrony\\\" underlying global neuromodulation, has never been assessed in a large population, nor has it been related to projection target specificity. Here, we recorded up to 52 single units simultaneously (3164 unit pairs in total) in rat LC and characterized projections by stimulating 15 forebrain sites. Spike count correlations were low and, surprisingly, only 13% of pairwise spike trains had synchronized spontaneous discharge. Notably, even noxious sensory stimulation did not activate the entire population, only evoking synchronized responses in ~16% of units on each trial. We also identified novel infra-slow (0.01-1 Hz) fluctuations of LC unit spiking that were asynchronous across the population. A minority, synchronized possibly by gap junctions, was biased toward restricted (non-global) forebrain projection patterns. Finally, we characterized two types of LC single units differing by waveform shape, propensity for synchronization, and interactions with cortex. These cell types formed finely-structured ensembles. Our findings suggest that the LC conveys a highly complex, differentiated, and potentially target-specific neuromodulatory signal.",

    "abstract": "Photosystem II is a photochemical reaction center that catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water to molecular oxygen. Water oxidation is the distinctive photochemical reaction that permitted the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and the eventual rise of Eukaryotes. At what point during the history of life an ancestral photosystem evolved the capacity to oxidize water still remains unknown. Here we study the evolution of the core reaction center proteins of Photosystem II using sequence and structural comparisons in combination with Bayesian relaxed molecular clocks. Our results indicate that a homodimeric photosystem with sufficient oxidizing power to split water had already appeared in the early Archean about a billion years before the most recent common ancestor of all described Cyanobacteria capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, and well before the diversification of some of the known groups of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Based on a structural and functional rationale we hypothesize that this early Archean photosystem was capable of water oxidation and had already evolved some level of protection against the formation of reactive oxygen species, which would place primordial forms of oxygenic photosynthesis at a very early stage in the evolutionary history of life.",

    "abstract": "The detection of ancient gene flow between human populations is an important issue in population genetics. A common tool for detecting ancient admixture events is the D-statistic. The D-statistic is based on the hypothesis of a genetic relationship that involves four populations, whose correctness is assessed by evaluating specific coincidences of alleles between the groups.\\n\\nWhen working with high throughput sequencing data calling genotypes accurately is not always possible, therefore the D-statistic currently samples a single base from the reads of one individual per population. This implies ignoring much of the information in the data, an issue especially striking in the case of ancient genomes.\\n\\nWe provide a significant improvement to overcome the problems of the D-statistic by considering all reads from multiple individuals in each population. We also apply type-specific error correction to combat the problems of sequencing errors and show a way to correct for introgression from an external population that is not part of the supposed genetic relationship, and how this leads to an estimate of the admixture rate.\\n\\nWe prove that the D-statistic is approximated by a standard normal. Furthermore we show that our method outperforms the traditional D-statistic in detecting admixtures. The power gain is most pronounced for low/medium sequencing depth (1-10X) and performances are as good as with perfectly called genotypes at a sequencing depth of 2X. We show the reliability of error correction on scenarios with simulated errors and ancient data, and correct for introgression in known scenarios to estimate the admixture rates.",

We applied multivariate pattern analysis to fMRI data to investigate aspects of familiarity that are shared by all familiar identities and information that distinguishes specific face identities from each other. Both identity-independent familiarity information and face identity could be decoded in an overlapping set of areas in the core and extended systems. Representational similarity analysis revealed a clear distinction between the two systems and a subdivision of the core system into ventral, dorsal and anterior components. This study provides evidence that activity in the extended system carries information about both individual identities and personal familiarity, while clarifying and extending the organization of the core system for face perception.",

    "abstract": "Integrative clustering is used to identify groups of samples by jointly analysing multiple datasets describing the same set of biological samples, such as gene expression, copy number, methylation etc. Most existing algorithms for integrative clustering assume that there is a shared consistent set of clusters across all datasets, and most of the data samples follow this structure. However in practice, the structure across heterogeneous datasets can be more varied, with clusters being joined in some datasets and separated in others.\\n\\nIn this paper, we present a probabilistic clustering method to identify groups across datasets that do not share the same cluster structure. The proposed algorithm, Clusternomics, identifies groups of samples that share their global behaviour across heterogeneous datasets. The algorithm models clusters on the level of individual datasets, while also extracting global structure that arises from the local cluster assignments. Clusters on both the local and the global level are modelled using a hierarchical Dirichlet mixture model to identify structure on both levels.\\n\\nWe evaluated the model both on simulated and on real-world datasets. The simulated data exemplifies datasets with varying degrees of common structure. In such a setting Clusternomics outperforms existing algorithms for integrative and consensus clustering. In a real-world application, we used the algorithm for cancer subtyping, identifying subtypes of cancer from heterogeneous datasets. We applied the algorithm to TCGA breast cancer dataset, integrating gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation and proteomics. The algorithm extracted clinically meaningful clusters with significantly different survival probabilities. We also evaluated the algorithm on lung and kidney cancer TCGA datasets with high dimensionality, again showing clinically significant results and scalability of the algorithm.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIntegrative clustering is the task of identifying groups of samples by combining information from several datasets. An example of this task is cancer subtyping, where we cluster tumour samples based on several datasets, such as gene expression, proteomics and others. Most existing algorithms assume that all such datasets share a similar cluster structure, with samples outside these clusters treated as noise. The structure can, however, be much more heterogeneous: some meaningful clusters may appear only in some datasets.\\n\\nIn the paper, we introduce the Clusternomics algorithm that identifies groups of samples across heterogeneous datasets. It models both cluster structure of individual datasets, and the global structure that appears as a combination of local structures. The algorithm uses probabilistic modelling to identify the groups and share information across the local and global levels. We evaluated the algorithm on both simulated and real world datasets, where the algorithm found clinically significant clusters with different survival outcomes.",

We hypothesize that perioperative blood loss, hypothermia, and sepsis facilitate tumour metastases in these murine models.\\n\\nMethodsPrior to surgery, pulmonary metastases were established by intravenous challenge of CT26LacZ colon cancer cells in Balb/c mice or B16LacZ melanoma cells in C57Bl/6 mice. Surgical stress was generated through partial hepatectomy (PH) or left nephrectomy (LN). Sepsis was induced by puncturing the cecum to express stool into the abdomen. Hemorrhagic shock was induced by removal of 30% of total blood volume via saphenous vein. Hypothermia was induced by removing the heating apparatus during surgery and lowering core body temperatures to 30{degrees}C. Lung tumour burden was quantified 3 days following surgery.\\n\\nResultsSurgically stressed mice subjected to Stage 3 hemorrhagic shock or hypothermia did not show an additional increase in lung tumour burden. In contrast, surgically stressed mice subjected to intraoperative sepsis demonstrated an additional 2-fold increase in the number of tumour metastases. Furthermore, natural killer (NK) cell function, as assessed by YAC-1 tumour cell lysis, was significantly attenuated in surgically stressed mice subjected to intraoperative sepsis. Both NK cell-mediated cytotoxic function and lung metastases were improved with perioperative administration of polyI:C, which is a ligand for toll-like receptor (TLR)-3\\n\\nConclusionsPerioperative sepsis, but not hemorrhagic shock or hypothermia, enhances the prometastatic effect of surgery in murine models of cancer. Identification of the mechanisms underlying perioperative immune suppression will be critical in the development of immunomodulation strategies that aim to attenuate perioperative metastatic disease.",

As the ability to sequence more cells improves rapidly, existing computational tools suffer from three problems.

Finally we demonstrate that UNCURL is extremely scalable and parallelizable, and runs faster than other methods on a scRNA-seq dataset containing 1.3 million cells.\\n\\nAvailabilitySource code is available at https://github.com/yjzhang/uncurl_python\\n\\nContactksreeram@uw.edu, gseelig@uw.edu",

However, the mechanistic understanding of protrusion activities is usually based on the ensemble average of actin regulator dynamics at the cellular or population levels. Here, we establish a machine learning-based computational framework called HACKS (deconvolution of Heterogeneous Activity Coordination in cytosKeleton at a Subcellular level) to deconvolve the subcellular heterogeneity of lamellipodial protrusion in migrating cells. HACKS quantitatively identifies distinct subcellular protrusion phenotypes from highly heterogeneous protrusion activities and reveals their underlying actin regulator dynamics at the leading edge. Furthermore, it can identify specific subcellular protrusion phenotypes susceptible to pharmacological perturbation and reveal how actin regulator dynamics are changed by the perturbation. Using our method, we discovered  accelerating protrusion phenotype in addition to  fluctuating and  periodic protrusions. Intriguingly, the accelerating protrusion was driven by the temporally coordinated actions between Arp2/3 and VASP: initiated by Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation, and then accelerated by VASP-mediated actin elongation. We were able to confirm it by pharmacological perturbations using CK666 and Cytochalasin D, which specifically reduced  strong accelerating protrusion activities. Taken together, we have demonstrated that HACKS allows us to discover the fine differential coordination of molecular dynamics underlying subcellular protrusion heterogeneity via a machine learning analysis of live cell imaging data.",

Since social-ecological systems (SESs) depend on a range of ecosystem services, lagged ecological dynamics may affect their long-term sustainability. Here, we investigate the role of consumption changes in sustainability enforcement, under a time-delayed ecological feedback on agricultural production. We use a stylized model that couples the dynamics of biodiversity, technology, human demography and compliance to a social norm prescribing sustainable consumption. Compliance to the sustainable norm reduces both the consumption footprint and the vulnerability of SESs to transient overshoot-and-collapse population crises. We show that the timing and interaction between social, demographic and ecological feedbacks govern the transient and long-term dynamics of the system. A sufficient level of social pressure (e.g. disapproval) applied on the unsustainable consumers leads to the stable coexistence of unsustainable and sustainable or mixed equilibria, where both defectors and conformers coexist. Under bistability conditions, increasing time delays reduces the basin of attraction of the mixed equilibrium, thus resulting in abrupt regime shifts towards unsustainable pathways. Given recent evidence of large ecological relaxation rates, such results call for farsightedness and a better understanding of lag effects when studying the sustainability of coupled SESs.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary timescales can be inferred from molecular sequence data using a Bayesian phylogenetic approach. In these methods, the molecular clock is often calibrated using fossil data. The uncertainty in these fossil calibrations is important because it determines the limiting posterior distribution for divergence-time estimates as the sequence length tends to infinity. Here we investigate how the accuracy and precision of Bayesian divergence-time estimates improve with the increased clock-partitioning of genome-scale data into clock-subsets. We focus on a data set comprising plastome-scale sequences of 52 angiosperm taxa. There was little difference among the Bayesian date estimates whether we chose clock-subsets based on patterns of among-lineage rate heterogeneity or relative rates across genes, or by random assignment. Increasing the degree of clock-partitioning usually led to an improvement in the precision of divergence-time estimates, but this increase was asymptotic to a limit presumably imposed by fossil calibrations. Our clock-partitioning approaches yielded highly precise age estimates for several key nodes in the angiosperm phylogeny. For example, when partitioning the data into 20 clock-subsets based on patterns of among-lineage rate heterogeneity, we inferred crown angiosperms to have arisen 198-178 Ma. This demonstrates that judicious clock-partitioning can improve the precision of molecular dating based on phylogenomic data, but the meaning of this increased precision should be considered critically.",

Here we characterize its genomic diversity by sequencing 134 individuals covering 73 species across all major lineages. Average sequence divergence between species pairs is only 0.1-0.25%. These divergence values overlap diversity within species, with 82% of heterozygosity shared between species. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that diversification initially proceeded by serial branching from a generalist Astatotilapia-like ancestor. However, no single species tree adequately represents all species relationships, with evidence for substantial gene flow at multiple times. Common signatures of selection on visual and oxygen transport genes shared by distantly related deep water species point to both adaptive introgression and independent selection. These findings enhance our understanding of genomic processes underlying rapid species diversification, and provide a platform for future genetic analysis of the Malawi radiation.\\n\\nOne Sentence Summary: The genomes of 73 cichlid fish species from Lake Malawi uncover evolutionary processes underlying a large adaptive evolutionary radiation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in comparative genomics have revealed that divergence between populations is not necessarily uniform across all parts of the genome. There are examples of regions with divergent haplotypes that are substantially more different from each other that the genomic average.\\n\\nTypically, these regions are of interest, as their persistence over long periods of time may reflect balancing selection. However, they are hard to detect unless the divergent sub-populations are known prior to analysis.\\n\\nHere, we introduce HaploDistScan, an R-package implementing model-free detection of deep-divergence genomic regions based on the distribution of pair-wise haplotype distances, and show that it can detect such regions without use of a priori information about population sub-division. We apply the method to real-world data sets, from ruff and Darwins finches, and show that we are able to recover known instances of balancing selection - originally identified in studies reliant on detailed phenotyping - using only genotype data. Furthermore, in addition to replicating previously known divergent haplotypes as a proof-of-concept, we identify novel regions of interest in the Darwins finch genome and propose a plausible, data-driven evolutionary history for each novel locus individually.\\n\\nIn conclusion, HaploDistScan requires neither phenotypic nor demographic input data, thus filling a gap in the existing set of methods for genome scanning, and provides a useful tool for identification of regions under balancing selection or similar evolutionary processes.",

    "abstract": "The Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) is one of the most abundant vertebrates on earth but its nucleotide diversity is moderate ({pi}=0.3%), only three-fold higher than in human. The expected nucleotide diversity for selectively neutral alleles is a function of population size and the mutation rate, and it is strongly affected by demographic history. Here, we present a pedigree-based estimation of the mutation rate in the Atlantic herring. Based on whole-genome sequencing of four parents and 12 offspring, the estimated mutation rate is 1.7 x 10-9 per base per generation. There was no significant difference in the frequency of paternal and maternal mutations (8 and 7, respectively). Furthermore, we observed a high degree of parental mosaicism indicating that a large fraction of these de novo mutations occurred during early germ cell development when we do not expect a strong gender effect. The now estimated mutation rate - the lowest among vertebrates analyzed to date - partially explains the discrepancy between the rather low nucleotide diversity in herring and its huge census population size (>1011). But our analysis indicates that a species like the herring will never reach its expected nucleotide diversity for selectively neutral alleles primarily because of fluctuations in population size due to climate variation during the millions of years it takes to build up a high nucleotide diversity. In addition, background selection and selective sweeps lead to reductions in nucleotide diversity at linked neutral sites.",

    "abstract": "Imaging the dynamic behavior of neuromodulatory neurotransmitters in the extracelluar space arising from individual quantal releases would constitute a major advance in neurochemical imaging. Spatial and temporal resolution of these highly stochastic neuromodulatory events requires concurrent advances in the chemical development of optical nanosensors selective for neuromodulators in concert with advances in imaging methodologies to capture millisecond neurotransmitter release. Herein, we develop and implement a stochastic model to describe dopamine dynamics in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain dorsal striatum. Our model is developed from first principles and simulates release, diffusion, and reuptake of dopamine in a 3D simulation volume of striatal tissue. We find that in vivo imaging of neuromodulation requires simultaneous optimization of dopamine nanosensor reversibility and sensitivity: dopamine imaging in the striatum or nucleus accumbens requires nanosensors with an optimal dopamine dissociation constant (Kd) of 1 M, whereas Kd above 10 M are required for dopamine imaging in the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, our model reveals that imaging frame rates of 20 Hz are optimal for imaging temporally-resolved dopamine release events based on the probabilistic nature of dopaminergic terminal activity in the striatum. Our work provides a modeling platform to probe how complex neuromodulatory processes can be studied with fluorescent nanosensors and enables direct evaluation of nanosensor chemistry and imaging hardware parameters. Our stochastic model is generic for evaluating fluorescent neurotransmission probes, and is broadly applicable to the design of other neurotransmitter fluorophores and their optimization for implementation in vivo.",

Cells lacking Boi1p and Boi2p accumulate secretory vesicles in their bud. The essential PH domains of Boi1p and Boi2p interact with Sec1p, a protein required for SNARE complex formation and vesicle fusion. Sec1p loses its tip localization in cells depleted of Boi1p and Boi2p but can partially compensate for their loss upon overexpression. The capacity to simultaneously bind phospholipids, Sec1p, multiple subunits of the exocyst, Cdc42p, and the module for generating active Cdc42p identify Boi1p and Boi2p as essential mediators between exocytosis and polar growth.\\n\\nSummary statementA novel protein complex connects vesicle fusion with Cdc42p activation.

    "abstract": "Many mutualistic microbial relationships are based on nutrient cross-feeding. Traditionally, cross-feeding is viewed as being unidirectional from the producer to the recipient. This is likely true when a producers metabolic waste, such as fermentation products, provides carbon for a recipient. However, in some cases the cross-fed nutrient holds value for both the producer and the recipient. In such cases, there is potential for nutrient reacquisition by producer cells in a population, leading to competition against recipients. Here we investigate the consequences of inter-partner competition for cross-fed nutrients on mutualism dynamics using an anaerobic coculture pairing fermentative Escherichia coli and phototrophic Rhodopseudomonas palustris. In this coculture, E. coli excretes waste organic acids that provide carbon for R. palustris. In return, R. palustris cross-feeds E. coli ammonium (NH4+), a valuable nitrogen compound that both species prefer. To explore the potential for inter-partner competition, we first used a kinetic model to simulate cocultures with varied affinities for NH4+ in each species. The model predicted that inter-partner competition for cross-fed NH4+ could profoundly impact population dynamics. We then experimentally tested the predictions by culturing mutants lacking NH4+ transporters in both NH4+ competition assays and cooperative cocultures. Both theoretical and experimental results indicated that the recipient must have a competitive advantage in acquiring valuable cross-fed NH4+ to avoid collapse of the mutualism. Thus, the very metabolites that form the basis for cooperative cross-feeding can also be subject to competition between mutualistic partners.\\n\\nSignificanceMutualistic relationships, particularly those based on nutrient cross-feeding, promote stability of diverse ecosystems and drive global biogeochemical cycles. Cross-fed nutrients within these systems can be either waste products valued only by one partner or nutrients that both partners value. Here, we explore how inter-partner competition for a communally-valuable cross-fed nutrient impacts mutualism dynamics. We discovered that mutualism stability necessitates that the recipient have a competitive advantage against the producer in obtaining the cross-fed nutrient. We propose that the requirement for recipient-biased competition is a general rule for mutualistic coexistence based on the transfer of communally valuable resources, microbial or otherwise.",

To explore factors that affect binding and subsequent recombination outcomes, we mapped human and chimp PRDM9 binding sites in a human cell line, and measured PRDM9-induced H3K4me3 and gene expression changes. These data revealed varied DNA-binding modalities of PRDM9, and histone modifications that predict binding. At sites where PRDM9 binds, specific cis sequence motifs associated with TRIM28 recruitment, and histone modifications, predict whether recombination subsequently occurs. These results implicate the large family of KRAB-ZNF genes in consistent, localized meiotic recombination suppression. PRDM9 affects gene expression for a small number of genes including CTCFL and VCX, by binding nearby. Finally, we show that PRDM9s DNA-binding zinc finger domain strongly impacts the formation of multimers, with a pair of highly diverged alleles multimerizing less efficiently.",

We demonstrated that the captured blasts possess the transcriptomic hallmarks of self-renewal and leukemia-initiating ability. The effects of somatic mutations on the cancer cells are visible at the transcriptional level, and the cellular signaling pathway activity of the blasts is altered, revealing disease-associated gene networks. We also identified a core set of transcription factors that were co-activated in blasts, which suggests a joint transcription program among blasts. Finally, we revealed that leukemogenesis and putative prognostic gene-expression signatures are present at diagnosis in leukemic CD33+/CD34+/CD38- cells and can be detected using a single-cell RNA sequencing approach.",

We demonstrate convincing support (posterior probability >80% under the \\\"annotation-weighted\\\" model) that coding variants are causal for the association at 16 of the 40 signals (including novel signals involving POC5 p.His36Arg, ANKH p.Arg187Gln, WSCD2 p.Thr113Ile, PLCB3 p.Ser778Leu, and PNPLA3 p.Ile148Met). However, one third of coding variant association signals represent \\\"false leads\\\" at which naive analysis would have led to an erroneous inference regarding the effector transcript mediating the signal. Accurate identification of validated targets is dependent on correct specification of the contribution of coding and non-coding mediated mechanisms at associated loci.",

The confluence of these factors can lead to severe inflammatory disease in premature infants; however, investigating complex environment-host interactions is diZcult due to limited access to immature human tissue. Here, we demonstrate that the epithelium of human pluripotent stem cell-derived human intestinal organoids is globally similar to the immature human epithelium and we utilize HIOs to investigate complex host-microbe interactions in this naive epithelium. Our findings demonstrate that the immature epithelium is intrinsically capable of establishing a stable host-microbe symbiosis.

However, it is unclear how commonly each of these types of plasticity occurs in natural populations. To answer this question, we measured glucosinolate defensive chemistry and reproductive fitness in over 1,500 individuals of the wild perennial mustard Boechera stricta, planted in four common gardens across central Idaho, USA. Glucosinolate profiles--including total glucosinolate quantity as well as the relative abundances and overall diversity of different compounds--were strongly plastic both among habitats and within habitats. Patterns of glucosinolate plasticity varied greatly among genotypes. More often than expected by chance, glucosinolate profiles shifted in a direction that matched the direction of natural selection, indicating that plasticity among habitats tended to increase relative fitness. In contrast, we found no evidence for within-habitat selection on glucosinolate reaction norm slopes (i.e., plasticity along a continuous environmental gradient). Together, our results indicate that glucosinolate plasticity may improve the ability of B. stricta populations to persist after migration to new habitats.",

    "abstract": "Age-dependent loss of cardiac tissue homeostasis largely impacts heart performance and contributes significantly to cardiovascular diseases later in life. Cellular quality control machinery, such as autophagy/lysosome system, plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiac health and preventing age-induced cardiomyopathy and heart failure. However, how aging alters the autophagy/lysosome system to impact cardiac function remains largely unknown. Here using Drosophila heart as a model system, we show that activin signaling, a member of TGF-beta superfamily, negatively regulates cardiac autophagy and cardiac health during aging. We found that cardiac-specific knockdown of Daw, an activin-like protein in Drosophila, increased cardiac autophagy and prevented age-related cardiac dysfunction, including arrhythmia and bradycardia (slow heart rate). Inhibition of autophagy blocked Daw knockdown-mediated cardioprotection. Consistently, cardiac-specific expression of constitutively activated activin type I receptor Babo disrupted cardiac function at young ages. Intriguingly, the key autophagy regulator, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), was not involved in activin-mediated autophagy. Instead, activin signaling genetically interacted with Rictor, the key subunit of mTORC2, to regulate autophagy and cardiac aging. Knockdown of Daw increased the mRNA expression of Rictor and the phosphorylation of AKT in fly hearts. Finally, cardiac-specific silencing of Daw not only improved cardiac health, but also prolonged lifespan. Thus, our findings highlight an emerging role of activin signaling and mTORC2 in the regulation of autophagy and cardiac aging.",

These microorganisms are part of the Nitrospira genus and are present in a variety of environments, including Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) systems. However, the physiological traits within and between comammox- and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB)-like Nitrospira species have not been analyzed in these ecosystems. In this study, we identified Nitrospira strains dominating the nitrifying community of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) performing BNR under micro-aerobic conditions. We recovered metagenomes-derived draft genomes from two Nitrospira strains: (1) Nitrospira sp. UW-LDO-01, a comammox-like organism classified as Candidatus Nitrospira nitrosa, and (2) Nitrospira sp. UW-LDO-02, a nitrite oxidizing strain belonging to the Nitrospira defluvii species. A comparative genomic analysis of these strains with other Nitrospira-like genomes identified genomic differences in Ca. Nitrospira nitrosa mainly attributed to each strains niche adaptation. Traits associated with energy metabolism also differentiate comammox from NOB-like genomes. We also identified several transcriptionally regulated adaptive traits, including stress tolerance, biofilm formation and micro-aerobic metabolism, which might explain survival of Nitrospira under multiple environmental conditions. Overall, our analysis expanded our understanding of the genetic functional features of Ca.

    "abstract": "Viruses and bacteria are critical components of the human microbiome and play important roles in health and disease. Most previous work has relied on studying bacteria and viruses independently, thereby reducing them to two separate communities. Such approaches are unable to capture how these microbial communities interact, such as through processes that maintain community robustness or allow phage-host populations to co-evolve. We implemented a network-based analytical approach to describe phage-bacteria network diversity throughout the human body. We built these community networks using a machine learning algorithm to predict which phages could infect which bacteria in a given microbiome. Our algorithm was applied to paired viral and bacterial metagenomic sequence sets from three previously published human cohorts. We organized the predicted interactions into networks that allowed us to evaluate phage-bacteria connectedness across the human body. We observed evidence that gut and skin network structures were person-specific and not conserved among cohabitating family members. High-fat diets appeared to be associated with less connected networks. Network structure differed between skin sites, with those exposed to the external environment being less connected and likely more susceptible to network degradation by microbial extinction events. This study quantified and contrasted the diversity of virome-microbiome networks across the human body and illustrated how environmental factors may influence phage-bacteria interactive dynamics. This work provides a baseline for future studies to better understand system perturbations, such as disease states, through ecological networks.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe human microbiome, the collection of microbial communities that colonize the human body, is a crucial component to health and disease. Two major components of the human microbiome are the bacterial and viral communities. These communities have primarily been studied separately using metrics of community composition and diversity. These approaches have failed to capture the complex dynamics of interacting bacteria and phage communities, which frequently share genetic information and work together to maintain ecosystem homestatsis (e.g. kill-the-winner dynamics). Removal of bacteria or phage can disrupt or even collapse those ecosystems. Relationship-based network approaches allow us to capture this interaction information. Using this network-based approach with three independent human cohorts, we were able to present an initial understanding of how phage-bacteria networks differ throughout the human body, so as to provide a baseline for future studies of how and why microbiome networks differ in disease states.",

    "abstract": "The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been implicated in perceptual decisions, but whether its role is specific to sensory processing or sensorimotor transformation is not well understood. To distinguish these possibilities, we trained mice of either sex to perform a visual discrimination task and imaged the activity of PPC populations during both engaged behavior and passive viewing. Unlike neurons in primary visual cortex (V1), which responded robustly to stimuli in both conditions, most neurons in PPC responded exclusively during task engagement. However, PPC responses were heterogeneous, with a smaller subset of neurons exhibiting stimulus-driven, contrast-dependent responses in both conditions. Neurons in PPC also exhibit stronger modulation by noise correlations relative to V1, as illustrated by a generalized linear model that takes into account both task variables and between-neuron correlations. To test whether PPC responses primarily encoded the stimulus or the learned sensorimotor contingency, we imaged the same neurons before and after re-training mice on a reversed task contingency. Unlike V1 neurons, most PPC neurons exhibited a dramatic shift in selectivity after re-training and reflected the new sensorimotor contingency, while a smaller subset of neurons preserved their stimulus selectivity. Mouse PPC is therefore strongly task-dependent, contains heterogeneous populations sensitive to stimulus and choice, and may play an important role in the flexible transformation of sensory inputs into motor commands.\\n\\nSignificance StatementPerceptual decision making involves both processing of sensory information and mapping that information onto appropriate motor commands via learned sensorimotor associations. While visual cortex (V1) is known to be critical for sensory processing, it is unclear what circuits are involved in the process of sensorimotor transformation. While the mouse posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been implicated in visual decisions, its specific role has been controversial. By imaging population activity while manipulating task engagement and sensorimotor contingencies, we demonstrate that PPC, unlike V1, is highly task-dependent, heterogeneous, and sensitive to the learned task demands. Our results suggest that PPC is more than a visual area, and may instead be involved in the flexible mapping of visual information onto appropriate motor actions.",

Several studies in rodents have shown that synchronized theta oscillations facilitate communication between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during salient events, but it remains unclear whether similar oscillatory mechanisms support interactions between the two regions in humans. Here, we had the rare opportunity to conduct simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from the human hippocampus and prefrontal cortex from two patients undergoing presurgical evaluation for pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Recordings were conducted during a task that involved encoding of contextually expected and unexpected visual stimuli. Across both patients, hippocampal-prefrontal theta phase synchronization was significantly higher during encoding of unexpected study items, compared to contextually expected study items. In contrast, we did not find increased theta synchronization between the prefrontal cortex and rhinal cortex. Our findings are consistent with the idea that theta oscillations orchestrate communication between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex during the processing of contextually salient information.",

    "abstract": "Perception is the result of ongoing brain activity combined with sensory stimuli. In natural vision, changes in the visual input typically occur as the result of self-initiated eye movements. Nonetheless, in most studies, stimuli are flashed, and natural eye movements are avoided or restricted. As a consequence, the neural sensory processing associated with active vision is poorly understood. Here, we show that occipital event-related potentials (ERP) to eye movements during free exploration of natural images exhibited different amplitudes, time course and motor dependency than that from the same flashed stimuli. We found that the ERP to visual fixations doubles in P1 magnitude and does not show a late component, which is classically seen with flashed stimuli1,2. In addition, we discovered that the ERP to the saccade onset was as large as the ERP to fixations onset, with an early component that preceded the visual input, suggesting that a motor modulation was associated with the saccades3. Furthermore, the use of different visual scenes revealed that both the ERP amplitude and time course were dependent on the type of image explored. Our results demonstrated that during active vision, the nervous system engages a mechanism of sensory modulation that is precisely timed to the self-initiated stimulus changes. This mechanism could help coordinate neural activity across different cortical areas and, by extension, serve as a general mechanism for the global coordination of neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-seq allows building cell atlases of any given tissue and infer the dynamics of cellular state transitions during developmental or disease trajectories. Both the maintenance and transitions of cell states are encoded by regulatory programs in the genome sequence. However, this regulatory code has not yet been exploited to guide the identification of cellular states from single-cell RNA-seq data. Here we describe a computational resource, called SCENIC (Single Cell rEgulatory Network Inference and Clustering), for the simultaneous reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and the identification of stable cell states, using single-cell RNA-seq data. SCENIC outperforms existing approaches at the level of cell clustering and transcription factor identification. Importantly, we show that cell state identification based on GRNs is robust towards batch-effects and technical-biases. We applied SCENIC to a compendium of single-cell data from the mouse and human brain and demonstrate that the proper combinations of transcription factors, target genes, enhancers, and cell types can be identified. Moreover, we used SCENIC to map the cell state landscape in melanoma and identified a gene regulatory network underlying a proliferative melanoma state driven by MITF and STAT and a contrasting network controlling an invasive state governed by NFATC2 and NFIB. We further validated these predictions by showing that two transcription factors are predominantly expressed in early metastatic sentinel lymph nodes. In summary, SCENIC is the first method to analyze scRNA-seq data using a network-centric, rather than cell-centric approach. SCENIC is generic, easy to use, and flexible, and allows for the simultaneous tracing of genomic regulatory programs and the mapping of cellular identities emerging from these programs. Availability: SCENIC is available as an R workflow based on three new R/Bioconductor packages: GENIE3, RcisTarget and AUCell. As scalable alternative to GENIE3, we also provide GRNboost, paving the way towards the network analysis across millions of single cells.",

For that reason, the identification of the precise traits and mechanisms of RI, and the rates at which they evolve, is crucial to understanding how species originate and persist. Nonetheless, precise measurements of the magnitude of reproductive isolation are rare. Previous work has measured the rates of evolution of prezygotic and postzygotic barriers to gene flow, yet no systematic analysis has carried out the study of the rates of evolution of postmating-prezygotic (PMPZ) barriers. We systematically measured the magnitude of two barriers to gene flow that act after mating occurs but before zygotic fertilization and also measured a premating (female mating rate in nonchoice experiments) and two postzygotic barriers (hybrid inviability and hybrid sterility) for all pairwise crosses of species within the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. Our results indicate that PMPZ isolation evolves faster than hybrid inviability but slower than premating isolation. We also describe seven new interspecific hybrids in the group. Our findings open up a large repertoire of tools that will enable researchers to manipulate hybrids and explore the genetic basis of interspecific differentiation, reproductive isolation, and speciation.",

RNA sequencing revealed 1,274 genes whose expression patterns changed when T. pseudonana was induced into sexual reproduction by ammonium.

In two experiments, we report specific evidence for the transfer of selective WM gating policies across changes of task context. We show that this transfer is not tied to shared structure in S-R mappings, but instead in the dynamic structure of the task.

    "abstract": "Rodents lick to consume fluids. The reward value of ingested fluids is likely to be encoded by neuronal activity entrained to the lick cycle. Here, we investigated relationships between licking and reward signaling by the medial frontal cortex [MFC], a key cortical region for reward-guided learning and decision-making. Multi-electrode recordings of spike activity and field potentials were made in male rats as they performed an incentive contrast licking task. Rats received access to higher and lower value sucrose rewards over alternating 30 sec periods. They learned to lick persistently when higher value rewards were available and to suppress licking when lower value rewards were available. Spectral analysis of spikes and fields revealed evidence for reward value being encoded by the strength of phase-locking of a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm to the rats lick cycle. Recordings during the initial acquisition of the task found that the strength of phase-locking to the lick cycle was strengthened with experience. A modification of the task, with a temporal gap of 2 sec added between reward deliveries, found that the rhythmic signals persisted during periods of dry licking, a finding that suggests the MFC encodes either the value of the currently available reward or the vigor with which rats act to consume it. Finally, we found that reversible inactivations of the MFC in the opposite hemisphere eliminated the encoding of reward information. Together, our findings establish that a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm, generated by the rodent medial frontal cortex, is synchronized to rewarded actions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe cellular and behavioral mechanisms of reward signaling by the medial frontal cortex [MFC] have not been resolved. We report evidence for a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm that is generated by the MFC and synchronized with ongoing consummatory actions. Previous studies of MFC reward signaling have inferred value coding upon temporally sustained activity during the period of reward consumption. Our findings suggest that MFC activity is temporally sustained due to the consumption of the rewarding fluids, and not necessarily the abstract properties of the rewarding fluid. Two other major findings were that the MFC reward signals persist beyond the period of fluid delivery and are generated by neurons within the MFC.",

    "abstract": "We wish to answer this question If you observe a \\\"significant\\\" P value after doing a single unbiased experiment, what is the probability that your result is a false positive?. The weak evidence provided by P values between 0.01 and 0.05 is explored by exact calculations of false positive rates.\\n\\nWhen you observe P = 0.05, the odds in favour of there being a real effect (given by the likelihood ratio) are about 3. This is far weaker evidence than the odds of 19 to 1 that might, wrongly, be inferred from the P value. And if you want to limit the false positive rate to 5 percent, you would have to assume that you were 87% sure that there was a real effect before the experiment was done.\\n\\nIf you observe P = 0.001, which gives likelihood ratio of 100:1 odds on there being a real effect, that would usually be regarded as conclusive, But the false positive rate would still be 8% if the prior probability of a real effect was only 0.1\\n\\nDespite decades of warnings, many areas of science still insist on labelling a result of P < 0.05 as \\\"significant\\\". This must account for a substantial part of the lack of reproducibility in some areas of science. And this is before you get to the many other well-known problems, like multiple comparisons, lack of randomisation and P-hacking.

    "abstract": "Most infections by human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are  acute, that is non-persistent. Yet, for HPVs, as for many other oncoviruses, there is a striking gap between our detailed understanding of chronic infections and our limited data on the early stages of infection. Here we argue that studying HPV acute infections is necessary and timely. Focusing on early interactions will help explain why certain infections are cleared while others become chronic or latent. From a molecular perspective, descriptions of immune effectors and pro-inflammatory pathways during the initial stages of infections have the potential to lead to novel treatments or to improved handling algorithms. From a dynamical perspective, adopting concepts from spatial ecology, such as meta-populations or meta-communities, can help explain why HPV acute infections sometimes last for years. Furthermore, cervical cancer screening and vaccines impose novel iatrogenic pressures on HPVs, implying that anticipating any viral evolutionary response remain essential. Finally, hints at the associations between HPV acute infections and fertility deserve further investigation given their high worldwide prevalence. Overall, understanding asymptomatic and benign infections may be instrumental in reducing HPV virulence.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome measurements and other -omics type data are increasingly more used in epidemiological studies. Most of omics studies to date are small with samples sizes in the tens, or sometimes low hundreds, but this is changing. Our Norwegian Woman and Cancer (NOWAC) datasets are to date one or two orders of magnitude larger. The NOWAC biobank contains about 50000 blood samples from a prospective study. Around 125 breast cancer cases occur in this cohort each year. The large biological variation in gene expression means that many observations are needed to draw scientific conclusions. This is true for both microarray and RNA-seq type data. Hence, larger datasets are likely to become more common soon.\\n\\nTechnical outliers are observations that somehow were distorted at the lab or during sampling. If not removed these observations add bias and variance in later statistical analyses, and may skew the results. Hence, quality assessment and data cleaning are important. We find common quality assessment libraries difficult to work with for large datasets for two reasons: slow execution speed and unsuitable visualizations.\\n\\nIn this paper, we present our standard operating procedure (SOP) for large-sample transcriptomics datasets. Our SOP combines automatic outlier detection with manual evaluation to avoid removing valuable observations. We use laboratory quality measures and statistical measures of deviation to aid the analyst. These are available in the nowaclean R package, currently available on GitHub (https://github.com/3inar/nowaclean). Finally, we evaluate our SOP on one of our larger datasets with 832 observations.",

    "abstract": "Fatty liver has been associated with unfavourable metabolic changes in circulation and is considered as a risk factor for cardiometabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We aimed to provide insights in fatty liver related metabolic deviations by studying the resemblance between the metabolic profile associated with fatty liver observationally and metabolic profiles of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk increasing genotypes. We determined cross-sectional associations of ultrasound-ascertained fatty liver status with 123 metabolic traits in 1,810 individuals aged 34-49 years from The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. The cross-sectional associations were compared with the association profiles of NAFLD risk alleles in PNPLA3, TM6SF2, GCKR, and LYPLAL1 with the corresponding metabolic traits obtained from a publicly available genome-wide association study including up to 24,925 European individuals. The analysis revealed substantially different metabolic effects of the risk alleles. PNPLA3 rs738409-G, the strongest genetic risk factor to NAFLD, did not associate with metabolic changes. GCKR rs1260326-T resulted in an association profile similar to the observational fatty liver associations. Metabolic effects of LYPLAL1 rs12137855-C were similar, but statistically less robust, to the effects of GCKR rs1260326-T. In contrast, NAFLD risk allele TM6SF2 rs58542926-T displayed opposite metabolic associations when compared with the observational association pattern.\\n\\nConclusionThe divergent effects of the risk alleles on circulating lipids and metabolites underline involvement of several metabolic pathways in NAFLD and suggest that there are pathogenically different subtypes of NAFLD with alternate metabolic consequences. NAFLD risk alleles may have neutral or even cardioprotective effect on circulating lipids and metabolites providing evidence that hepatic lipid accumulation by itself would not necessarily cause the metabolic deviations associated observationally with fatty liver.",

We investigated associations of prenatal (birth weight and length) and postnatal growth in infancy and childhood with circulating IGF-I measured at 11.5 years of age.\\n\\nMethodsWe analysed 11.5-year follow-up data from 17,046 Belarusian children who participated in the Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (PROBIT) since birth.\\n\\nResultsComplete data were available for 5422 boys and 4743 girls (60%). We stratified the analyses by sex, as there was evidence of interaction between growth and sex in their associations with IGF-I. Weight and length/height velocity during childhood were positively associated with IGF-I at 11.5 years; associations increased with age at growth assessment and were stronger for length/height gain than for weight gain. The change in internal run-normalized IGF-I z-score at 11.5 years was 0.038 (95% CI -0.004,0.080) per standard deviation (SD) increase in length gain at 0-3 months amongst girls and 0.025 (95% CI - 0.011,0.060) amongst boys, increasing to 0.336 (95% CI 0.281,0.391;) and 0.211 (95% CI 0.165,0.256) for girls and boys, respectively, for growth during 6.5-11.5 years.\\n\\nConclusionPostnatal growth velocities in childhood are positively associated with levels of circulating IGF-I in pre-adolescents.

    "abstract": "BackgroundBreastfeeding is commonly proposed to protect against atopic diseases. However, studies aiming to quantify these protective effects have shown conflicting results.\\n\\nMethodsTo entrench the effects of breastfeeding on risk of asthma, hay fever and eczema, our study included a large study cohort, UK Biobank (N=502,682). Information was collected on whether participants had been breastfeed and on the prevalence of disease. Disease was tested for association with breastfeeding, adjusting or matching for influential covariates.\\n\\nFindingsA total of 443,068 participants were included in our analyses of which 71{middle dot}2% had been breastfed. The prevalence of asthma was 11{middle dot}4 % and 12{middle dot}7% in the breastfed and non-breastfed groups, and hay fever or eczema (23{middle dot}9% and 24{middle dot}8 % in the two groups respectively. When correcting or matching for potential confounders, we could not see any association between being breastfed and asthma. However, there were increased odds of hay fever and eczema among participants that had been breastfed (P=7{middle dot}78x10-6).\\n\\nInterpretationThis study reports that breastfeeding is associated with increased odds of hay fever and eczema but it show no evidence for breastfeeding being associated with asthma diagnosis.\\n\\nFundingThe Swedish Society for Medical Research (SSMF), the Kjell and Marta Beijers Foundation, Goran Gustafssons Foundation, the Swedish Medical Research Council (Project Number 2015-03327), the Marcus Borgstrom Foundation, the [A]ke Wiberg Foundation and the Vleugels Foundation.\\n\\nEvidence before this studyAtopic diseases affect quality of life for a large part of the human population and pose a very high socio-economic burden. Genetic, environmental, and a number of lifestyle factors influence our risk of developing atopic disorders and high familial prevalence is one of the strongest known risk factors for disease. Several environmental and lifestyle risk factors have already been well established in the scientific community, such as smoking on the risk of developing asthma. Breastfeeding is commonly argued to be protective against atopic diseases. However, studies aiming to quantify these protective effects have shown conflicting results.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyOur study is, to our knowledge, the largest investigation on how breastfeeding is associated with being diagnosed with asthma, hay fever and eczema at adult age. The study found breastfeeding to be associated with increased odds of being diagnosed with hay fever and eczema during life, while we found no association between breastfeeding and asthma. Our results for hay fever and eczema is in line with the western world hygiene hypothesis, but contradict the general picture of breastfeeding being protective.\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidenceTo be able to give parents correct advice on lifestyles choices that will protect their kids against atopic diseases, we need to clarify the currently conflicting results on the effect of breastfeeding on risk of atopic diseases. However, these results should not be used to recommend breastfeeding or to discourage it since the present study only investigates the association between breastfeeding history and being diagnosed with asthma, hay fever and eczema during lifetime.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of stress cardiomyopathy (SCM), also known as takotsubo syndrome, is poorly understood. SCM usually occurs sporadically, often in association with a stressful event, but clusters of cases are reported after major natural disasters. There is some evidence that this is a familial condition. We have examined three possible models for an underlying genetic predisposition to SCM. Our primary study cohort consists of 28 women who suffered SCM as a result of two devastating earthquakes that struck the city of Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2010 and 2011. To seek possible underlying genetic factors we carried out exome analysis, Cardio-MetaboChip genotyping array analysis and array comparative genomic hybridization on these subjects. The most striking finding from these analyses was the observation of a markedly elevated rate of rare, heterogeneous copy number variants (CNV) of uncertain clinical significance (in 12/28 subjects). Several of these CNVs clearly impacted on genes of cardiac relevance including RBFOX1, GPC5, KCNRG, CHODL, and GPBP1L1. There is no physical overlap between the CNVs, and the genes they impact do not fall into a clear pathophysiological pathway. However, the recognition that SCM cases display a high rate of unusual CNV, and that SCM predisposition may therefore be associated with these CNVs, offers a novel perspective and a new approach by which to understand this enigmatic condition.",

Z. mobilis requires the vitamin pantothenate for growth. Here we characterized the genetic basis for the Z. mobilis pantothenate auxotrophy. We found that this auxotrophy is due to the absence of a single gene, panD, encoding aspartate-decarboxylase. Heterologous expression of Escherichia coli PanD in Z. mobilis or supplementation of the growth medium with the product of PanD activity, {beta}-alanine, eliminated the need for exogenous pantothenate. We also determined that IlvC, an enzyme better known for branched-chain amino acid synthesis, is required for pantothenate synthesis in Z. mobilis, as it compensates for the absence of PanE, another pantothenate synthesis pathway enzyme. In addition to contributing to an understanding of the nutritional requirements of Z. mobilis, our results have led to the design of a more cost-effective growth medium.",

    "abstract": "Working memory requires information about external stimuli to be represented in the brain even after those stimuli go away. This information is encoded in the activities of neurons, and neural activities change over timescales of tens of milliseconds. Information in working memory, however, is retained for tens of seconds, suggesting the question of how time-varying neural activities maintain stable representations. Prior work shows that, if the neural dynamics are in the  null space of the representation - so that changes to neural activity do not affect the downstream read-out of stimulus information - then information can be retained for periods much longer than the time-scale of individual-neuronal activities. The prior work, however, requires precisely constructed synaptic connectivity matrices, without explaining how this would arise in a biological neural network. To identify mechanisms through which biological networks can self-organize to learn memory function, we derived biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rules that dynamically modify the connectivity matrix to enable information storing. Networks implementing this plasticity rule can successfully learn to form memory representations even if only 10% of the synapses are plastic, they are robust to synaptic noise, and they can represent information about multiple stimuli.",
