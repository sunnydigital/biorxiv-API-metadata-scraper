    "abstract": "The perceptual representation of individual faces is often explained with reference to a norm-based face space. In such spaces, individuals are encoded as vectors where identity is primarily conveyed by direction and distinctiveness by eccentricity. Here we measured human fMRI responses and psychophysical similarity judgments of individual face exemplars, which were generated as realistic 3D animations using a computer-graphics model. We developed and evaluated multiple neurobiologically plausible computational models, each of which predicts a representational distance matrix and a regional-mean activation profile for 24 face stimuli. In the fusiform face area, a face-space coding model with sigmoidal ramp tuning provided a better account of the data than one based on exemplar tuning. However, an image-processing model with weighted banks of Gabor filters performed similarly. Accounting for the data required the inclusion of a measurement-level population averaging mechanism that approximates how fMRI voxels locally average distinct neuronal tunings. Our study demonstrates the importance of comparing multiple models and of modeling the measurement process in computational neuroimaging.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHumans recognize conspecifics by their faces. Understanding how faces are recognized is an open computational problem with relevance to theories of perception, social cognition, and the engineering of computer vision systems. Here we measured brain activity with functional MRI while human participants viewed individual faces. We developed multiple computational models inspired by known response preferences of single neurons in the primate visual cortex. We then compared these neuronal models to patterns of brain activity corresponding to individual faces. The data were consistent with a model where neurons respond to directions in a high-dimensional space of faces. It also proved essential to model how functional MRI voxels locally average the responses of tens of thousands of neurons. The study highlights the challenges in adjudicating between alternative computational theories of visual information processing.",

    "abstract": "Pathogen traits, such as the virulence of an infection, can vary significantly between patients. A major challenge is to measure the extent to which genetic differences between infecting strains explain the observed variation of the trait. This is quantified by the traits broad-sense heritability, H2. A recent discrepancy between estimates of the heritability of HIV-virulence has opened a debate on the estimators accuracy. Here, we show that the discrepancy originates from model limitations and important lifecycle differences between sexually reproducing organisms and transmittable pathogens. In particular, current quantitative genetics methods, such as donor-recipient regression (DR) of surveyed serodiscordant couples and the phylogenetic mixed model (PMM), are prone to underestimate H2, because they fail to model the gradual loss of phenotypic resemblance between transmission-related patients in the presence of within-host evolution. We explore two approaches correcting these errors: ANOVA on closest phylogenetic pairs (ANOVA-CPP) and the phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mixed model (POUMM). Empirical analyses reveal that at least 25% of the variation in HIV-virulence is explained by the virus genome both for European and African data. These results confirm the presence of significant factors for HIV virulence in the viral genotype and reject previous hypotheses of negligible viral influence. Beyond HIV, ANOVA-CPP is ideal for slowly evolving protozoa, bacteria and DNA-viruses, while POUMM suits rapidly mutating RNA-viruses, thus, enabling heritability estimation for a broad range of pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Characteristics of male courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster have been well-described, but the genetic basis of male-female copulation is largely unknown. Here we show that the white (w) gene, a classical gene for eye color, is associated with copulation success. 82.5 % of wild-type Canton-S flies copulated within 60 minutes in circular arenas, whereas few white-eyed mutants mated successfully. The w+ allele exchanged to the X chromosome or duplicated to the Y chromosome in the white-eyed genetic background rescued the defect of copulation success. The w+-associated copulation success was independent of eye color phenotype. Addition of the mini-white (mw+) gene to the white-eyed mutant rescued the defect of copulation success in a manner that was mw+ copy number-dependent. Lastly, male-female sexual experience mimicked the effects of w+/mw+ in improving successful copulation. These data suggest that the w+ gene controls copulation success in Drosophila melanogaster.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the genetic determinants of phenotypes that impact on disease severity is of fundamental importance for the design of new interventions against malaria. Traditionally, such discovery has relied on labor-intensive approaches that require significant investments of time and resources. By combining Linkage Group Selection (LGS), quantitative whole genome population sequencing and a novel mathematical modeling approach (qSeq-LGS), we simultaneously identified multiple genes underlying two distinct phenotypes, identifying novel alleles for growth rate and strain specific immunity (SSI), while removing the need for traditionally required steps such as cloning, individual progeny phenotyping and marker generation. The detection of novel variants, verified by experimental phenotyping methods, demonstrates the remarkable potential of this approach for the identification of genes controlling selectable phenotypes in malaria and other apicomplexan parasites for which experimental genetic crosses are amenable.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThis paper describes a powerful and rapid approach to the discovery of genes underlying medically important phenotypes in malaria parasites. This is crucial for the design of new drug and vaccine interventions. The approach bypasses the most time-consuming steps required by traditional genetic linkage studies and combines Mendelian genetics, quantitative deep sequencing technologies, genome analysis and mathematical modeling. We demonstrate that the approach can simultaneously identify multigenic drivers of multiple phenotypes, thus allowing complex genotyping studies to be conducted concomitantly. This methodology will be particularly useful for discovering the genetic basis of medically important phenotypes such as drug resistance and virulence in malaria and other apicomplexan parasites, as well as potentially in any organism undergoing sexual recombination.",

    "abstract": "Ecosystem development theory predicts that successional turnover in community composition can influence ecosystem functioning. However, tests of this theory in natural systems are made difficult by a lack of replicable and tractable model systems. Using the microbial digestive associates of a carnivorous pitcher plant, I tested hypotheses linking host age-driven microbial community development to host functioning. Monitoring the yearlong development of independent microbial digestive communities in two pitcher plant populations revealed a number of trends in community succession matching theoretical predictions. These included mid-successional peaks in bacterial diversity and metabolic substrate use, predictable and parallel successional trajectories among microbial communities, and convergence giving way to divergence in community composition and carbon substrate use. Bacterial composition, biomass, and diversity positively influenced the rate of prey decomposition, which was in turn positively associated with a host leafs nitrogen uptake efficiency. Overall digestive performance was greatest during late summer. These results highlight links between community succession and ecosystem functioning and extend succession theory to host-associated microbial communities.\\n\\nStatement of authorshipDWA conceived this work, performed data collection and analysis, and wrote the manuscript",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe type and variety of learning strategies used by individuals to acquire behaviours in the wild are poorly understood, despite the presence of behavioural traditions in diverse taxa. Social learning strategies such as conformity can be broadly adaptive, but may also retard the spread of adaptive innovations. Strategies like payoff-biased learning, in contrast, are effective at diffusing new behaviour but may perform poorly when adaptive behaviour is common. We present a field experiment in a wild primate, Cebus capucinus, that introduced a novel food item and documented the innovation and diffusion of successful extraction techniques. We develop a multilevel, Bayesian statistical analysis that allows us to quantify individual-level evidence for different social and individual learning strategies. We find that payoff-biased social learning and age-biased social learning are primarily responsible for the diffusion of new techniques. We find no evidence of conformity; instead rare techniques receive slightly increased attention. We also find substantial and important variation in individual learning strategies that is patterned by age, with younger individuals being more influenced by both social information and their own individual experience. The aggregate cultural dynamics in turn depend upon the variation in learning strategies and the age structure of the wild population.",

Multiplexing samples for single cell capture and library preparation in dscRNA-seq would enable cost-effective designs of differential expression and genetic studies while avoiding technical batch effects, but its implementation remains challenging. Here, we introduce an in-silico algorithm demuxlet that harnesses natural genetic variation to discover the sample identity of each cell and identify droplets containing two cells. These capabilities enable multiplexed dscRNA-seq experiments where cells from unrelated individuals are pooled and captured at higher throughput than standard workflows. To demonstrate the performance of demuxlet, we sequenced 3 pools of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 8 lupus patients. Given genotyping data for each individual, demuxlet correctly recovered the sample identity of > 99% of singlets, and identified doublets at rates consistent with previous estimates. In PBMCs, we demonstrate the utility of multiplexed dscRNA-seq in two applications: characterizing cell type specificity and inter-individual variability of cytokine response from 8 lupus patients and mapping genetic variants associated with cell type specific gene expression from 23 donors. Demuxlet is fast, accurate, scalable and could be extended to other single cell datasets that incorporate natural or synthetic DNA barcodes.",

Consecutive overlapping blocks of the multichannel oscillatory component are assumed to be low-rank whereas the transient component is assumed to be piecewise constant with a zero baseline. The estimated multichannel oscillatory component is used in conjunction with a bandpass filter and the Teager operator for detecting sleep spindles\\n\\nResults and comparison with other methodsSeveral examples are shown to illustrate the utility of the proposed method in detecting global and local spindle activity. The proposed method is applied to two publicly available databases and compared with 7 existing single-channel automated detectors. F1 scores for the proposed spindle detection method averaged 0.66 (0.02) and 0.62 (0.06) for the two databases, respectively. For an overnight 6 channel EEG signal, the proposed algorithm takes about 4 minutes to detect sleep spindles simultaneously across all channels with a single setting of corresponding algorithmic parameters\\n\\nConclusionsThe proposed method aims to mimic and utilize, for better spindle detection, a particular human expert behavior where the decision to mark a spindle event may be subconsciously influenced by the presence of a spindle in EEG channels other than the central channel visible on a digital screen",

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing importance of non-targeted metabolomics to answer various life science questions, extracting biochemically relevant information from metabolomics spectral data is still an incompletely solved problem. Most computational tools to identify tandem mass spectra focus on a limited set of molecules of interest. However, such tools are typically constrained by the availability of reference spectra or molecular databases, limiting their applicability to identify unknown metabolites. In contrast, recent advances in the field illustrate the possibility to expose the underlying biochemistry without relying on metabolite identification, in particular via substructure prediction. We describe an automated method for substructure recommendation motivated by association rule mining. Our framework captures potential relationships between spectral features and substructures learned from public spectral libraries. These associations are used to recommend substructures for any unknown mass spectrum. Our method does not require any predefined metabolite candidates, and therefore it can be used for the partial identification of unknown unknowns. The method is called MESSAR (MEtabolite SubStructure Auto-Recommender) and is implemented in a free online web service available at messar.biodatamining.be.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMass spectrometry is one of most used techniques to detect and identify metabolites. However, learning metabolite structures directly from mass spectrometry data has always been a challenging task. Thousands of mass spectra from various biological systems still remain unanalyzed simply because no current bioinformatic tools are able to generate structural hypotheses. By manually studying mass spectra of standard compounds, chemists discovered that metabolites that share common substructures can also share spectral features. As data scientists, we believe that such relationships can be unraveled from massive structure and spectra data by machine learning. In this study, we adapted \\\"association rule mining\\\", traditionally used in market basket analysis, to structural and spectral data, allowing us to investigate all spectral features - metabolite substructures relationships. We further collected all statistically sound relationships into a database and used them to assign substructral hypotheses to unexplored spectra. We named our approach MESSAR, MEtabolite SubStructure Auto-Recommender, available to the metabolomics and mass spectrometry community as a free and open web service.",

We here found that the anterior PFC, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), were exclusively activated after the initial decisions. dACC was involved in decision uncertainty monitoring, whereas lFPC was involved in decision adjustment controlling, subject to control demands of the tasks. Our findings support that the PFC is essentially involved in metacognition and further suggest that functions of the PFC in metacognition are dissociable.",

    "abstract": "Development and fitness of any organism rely on properly controlled gene expression. This is especially true for plants, as their development is determined by both internal and external cues. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are embedded in the genetic cascades that integrate and translate those cues into developmental programs. miRNAs negatively regulate their target genes mainly post-transcriptionally through two co-existing mechanisms; mRNA cleavage and translational inhibition. It is unclear whether the efficiency of miRNA-guided regulation is generally influenced by factors like ambient temperature or developmental stage. Here we show that plant miRNA accumulation, as well as miRNAs mode of action can be temperature- and development-sensitive. Higher temperatures tend to induce a more pronounced accumulation of mature miRNAs. Both parameters have also an impact on the expression patterns of the core players involved in miRNA performance. We show that efficiency of miRNA-mediated gene silencing declines with age during vegetative development in a temperature-dependent manner. Co-existence of cleavage and translational inhibition was also found to be dependent on temperature and developmental stage. Therefore, each miRNA family specifically regulates their respective targets, while temperature and growth influence the performance of miRNA-dependent regulation in a more general way.",

In practice, however, it is hardly possible to measure fitness for all genotypes in a natural population.

We demonstrate that genetic interactions can often be inferred from fitness rank orders, where all genotypes are ordered according to fitness, and even from partial fitness orders. We provide a complete characterization of rank orders that imply higher order epistasis. Our theory applies to all common types of gene interactions and facilitates comprehensive investigations of diverse genetic interactions.

    "abstract": "In addition to the processes structuring free-living communities, host-associated microbiota are directly or indirectly shaped by the host. Therefore, microbiota data have a hierarchical structure where samples are nested under one or several variables representing host-specific factors, often spanning multiple levels of biological organization. Current statistical methods do not accommodate this hierarchical data structure, and therefore cannot explicitly account for the effect of the host in structuring the microbiota. We introduce a novel extension of joint species distribution models which can straightforwardly accommodate and discern between effects such as host phylogeny and traits, recorded covariates like diet and collection site, among other ecological processes. Our proposed methodology includes powerful yet familiar outputs seen in community ecology overall, including: (i) model-based ordination to visualize and quantify the main patterns in the data; (ii) variance partitioning to asses how influential the included host-specific factors are in structuring the microbiota; and (iii) co-occurrence networks to visualize microbe-to-microbe associations.",

Many variants of these protocols have been developed, each with their own strengths. Currently there is no systematic means for simulating sequence data from this family of sequencing protocols.\\n\\nFindingsWe describe a computational simulator that, given reference genome sequences and some basic parameters, will simulate HiC sequencing on those sequences. The simulator models the basic spatial structure in genomes that is commonly observed in HiC and 3C datasets, including the distance-decay relationship in proximity ligation, differences in the frequency of interaction within and across chromosomes, and the structure imposed by cells. A means to model the 3D structure of topologically associating domains (TADs) is provided. The simulator also models several sources of error common to 3C and HiC library preparation and sequencing methods, including spurious proximity ligation events and sequencing error.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have introduced the first comprehensive simulator for 3C and HiC sequencing protocols. We expect the simulator to have use in testing of HiC data analysis algorithms, as well as more general value for experimental design, where questions such as the required depth of sequencing, enzyme choice, and other decisions must be made in advance in order to ensure adequate statistical power to test the relevant hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "The colored de Bruijn graph-- a variant of the de Bruijn graph which associates each edge (i.e., k-mer) with some set of colors -- is an increasingly important combinatorial structure in computational biology. Iqbal et al. demonstrated the utility of this structure for representing and assembling a collection (pop-ulation) of genomes, and showed how it can be used to accurately detect genetic variants. Muggli et al. introduced VARI, a representation of the colored de Bruijn graph that adopts the BOSS representation for the de Bruijn graph topology and achieves considerable savings in space over Cortex, albeit with some sacrifice in speed. The memory-efficient representation of VARI allows the colored de Bruijn graph to be constructed and analyzed for large datasets, beyond what is possible with Cortex.\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduce Rainbowfish, a succinct representation of the color information of the colored de Bruijn graph that reduces the space usage even further. Our representation also uses BOSS to represent the de Bruijn graph, but decomposes the color sets based on an equivalence relation and exploits the inherent skewness in the distribution of these color sets. The Rainbowfish representation is compressed based on the 0th-order entropy of the color sets, which can lead to a significant reduction in the space required to store the relevant information for each edge. In practice, Rainbowfish achieves up to a 20 x improvement in space over VARI. Rainbowfish is written in C++11 and is available at https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/rainbowfish.",

The recent availability of large-scale RNA-seq sequencing-data provides great potential for co-expression network inference. In this study, for the first time, we presented a novel heterogeneous ensemble pipeline integrating three frequently used inference methods, to build a high-quality RNA-seq-based Gene Co-expression Network (GCN) in rice, an important monocot species. The quality of the network obtained by our proposed method was first evaluated and verified with the curated positive and negative gene functional link datasets, which obviously outperformed each single method. Secondly, the powerful capability of this network for associating unknown genes with biological functions and agronomic traits was showed by enrichment analysis and case studies. Particularly, we demonstrated the potential applications of our proposed method to predict the biological roles of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and circular RNA (circRNA) genes. Our results provided a valuable data source for selecting candidate genes to further experimental validation during rice genetics research and breeding. To enhance identification of novel genes regulating important biological processes and agronomic traits in rice and other crop species, we released the source code of constructing high-quality RNA-seq-based GCN and rice RNA-seq-based GCN, which can be freely downloaded online at https://github.com/czllab/NetMiner.",

    "abstract": "Biofilms are communities of microbial cells that are encapsulated within a self-produced polymeric matrix. The matrix is critical to the success of biofilms in diverse habitats, but despite this many details of the composition, structure, and function remain enigmatic. Biofilms formed by the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis depend on the production of the secreted film-forming protein BslA. Here we show that a gradient of electron acceptor availability through the depth of the biofilm gives rise to two distinct functional roles for BslA and that these can be genetically separated through targeted amino acid substitutions. We establish that monomeric BslA is necessary and sufficient to give rise to complex biofilm architecture, while dimerization of BslA is required to render the community hydrophobic. Dimerization of BslA, mediated by disulfide bond formation, depends on two conserved cysteine residues located in the C-terminal region. Our findings demonstrate that bacteria have evolved multiple uses for limited elements in the matrix, allowing for alternative responses in a complex, changing environment.\\n\\nSignificanceThe biofilm matrix is a critical target in the hunt for novel strategies to destabilise or stabilise biofilms. Knowledge of the processes controlling matrix assembly is therefore an essential prerequisite to exploitation. Here we highlight that the complexity of the biofilm matrix is even higher than anticipated with one matrix component making two independent functional contributions to the community. The influence the protein exerts is dependent on the local environmental properties, providing another dimension to consider during analysis. These findings add to the evidence that bacteria can evolve multifunctional uses for the extracellular matrix components.",

    "abstract": "Trans-translation is a ribosome rescue system that is ubiquitous in bacteria. Small molecules defining a new family of oxadiazole compounds that inhibit trans-translation have been found to have broad-spectrum antibiotic activity. We sought to determine the activity of KKL-35, a potent member of the oxadiazole family, against the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila and other related species that can also cause Legionnaires disease (LD). Consistent with the essential nature of trans-translation in L. pneumophila, KKL-35 inhibits growth of all tested strains at sub-micromolar concentrations. KKL-35 is also active against other LD-causing Legionella species. KKL-35 remains equally active against L. pneumophila mutants that have evolved resistance to macrolides. KKL-35 inhibits multiplication of L. pneumophila in human macrophages at several stages of infection. No resistant mutants could be obtained, even during extended and chronic exposure. Surprisingly, KKL-35 is not synergistic with other ribosome-targeting antibiotics and does not induce the filamentation phenotype observed in cells defective for trans-translation. Importantly, KKL-35 remains active against L. pneumophila mutants expressing an alternate ribosome-rescue system and lacking tmRNA, the essential component of trans-translation. These results indicate that the antibiotic activity of KKL-35 is not related to the specific inhibition of trans-translation and its mode of action remains to be identified. In conclusion, KKL-35 is an effective antibacterial agent against the intracellular pathogen L. pneumophila and with no detectable resistance. However, further studies are needed to better understand its mechanism of action and to assess further the potential of oxadiazoles in treatment.",

Compared to temperate and boreal forests, though, we have limited knowledge about the fungal diversity in tropical rainforest soils. Here we show, by environmental metabarcoding of soil samples collected in three Neotropical rainforests, that Yeasts dominate the fungal communities in terms of the number of sequencing reads and OTUs. These unicellular forms are commonly found in aquatic environments, and their hyperdiversity may be the result of frequent inundation combined with numerous aquatic microenvironments in these rainforests. Other fungi that are frequent in aquatic environments, such as the abundant Chytridiomycotina, were also detected. While there was low similarity in OTU composition within and between the three rainforests, the fungal communities in Central America were more similar to each other than the communities in South America, reflecting a general biogeographic pattern also seen in animals, plants, and protists.\\n\\nContactdunthorn@rhrk.uni-kl.de",

    "abstract": "In a recently published study [1], we investigated how human pupil sizes are modulated by task experience as well as attentional load in a visuospatial task. In particular, participants performed a multiple object tracking (MOT) task while pupil sizes were recorded using binocular eyetracking measurements. To vary the attentional load, participants performed the MOT task either tracking zero or up to five targets. To manipulate the task experience, participants performed the MOT task on three consecutive days. We found that pupil sizes systematically increased with attentional load and decreased with additional task experience. For all these analyses, we averaged across the pupil sizes for the left and right eye. However, findings of a recent study [2] have suggested that also asymmetries in pupil sizes could be related to attentional processing. Given these findings, we further analyzed our data to investigate to what extent pupil size asymmetries are modulated by attentional load and task experience. We found a significant interaction effect between these two factors. That is, on the first day of the measurements, pupil size asymmetries were not modulated by attentional load while this was the case for the second and third day of the measurements. In particular, for the second and third day, pupil size asymmetries systematically increased with attentional load, indicating that attentional processing also modulates pupil size asymmetries. Given these results, we suggest that an increase in task experience (and associated reductions in arousal) uncover modulations in pupil size asymmetries related to attentional processing that are not observable for typical arousal levels. We suggest that these modulations could be a result of right-lateralized attentional processing in the brain that in turn influences structures involved in the control of pupil sizes such as the locus coeruleus. We can exclude a number of possible alternative explanations for this effect related to our experimental setup. Yet, given the novelty of this finding and the arguably speculative explanation of the underlying mechanisms, we suggest that future studies are needed to replicate the present effect and further investigate the underlying mechanisms.",

Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown under controlled environment at four photon flux density levels (PFD). Rosettes from plants were harvested at the four PFD levels and over a diurnal cycle and after a step change in PFD and analysed for ascorbate concentration and transcript levels measured by RNAseq. Ascorbate concentrations and expression of genes in the L-galactose ascorbate biosynthesis, recycling,consumption pathways and regulation are presented to provide a full analysis of the control of ascorbate by environmentally modulated gene expression. Ascorbate concentration responded to PFD levels but not to time of day and showed only a small response to change of PFD after 2 days. Of the L-galactose pathway genes, only GDP galactose phosphorylase (GGP) showed a significant response in to different PFDs, time of day and to change in PFD. Other genes also showed limited responses. This study compares gene expression of a range of ascorbate related genes to changes in environment in a unified way and supports the concept that GGP is the key regulatory gene in ascorbate biosynthesis and that post transcriptional regulation is also important.\\n\\nHighlightIn a comprehensive study of expression of all ascorbate related genes the data is consistent with the control of leaf ascorbate concentration by transcription being through the expression of GDP galactose phosphorylase.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance constitutes one of the most pressing public health concerns. Antimicrobial peptides of multicellular organisms are considered part of a solution to this problem, and AMPs produced by bacteria such as colistin are last resort drugs. Importantly, antimicrobial peptides differ from many antibiotics in their pharmacodynamic characteristics. Here we implement these differences within a theoretical framework to predict the evolution of resistance against antimicrobial peptides and compare it to antibiotic resistance. Our analysis of resistance evolution finds that pharmacodynamic differences all combine to produce a much lower probability that resistance will evolve against antimicrobial peptides. The finding can be generalized to all drugs with pharmacodynamics similar to AMPs. Pharmacodynamic concepts are familiar to most practitioners of medical microbiology, and data can be easily obtained for any drug or drug combination. Our theoretical and conceptual framework is therefore widely applicable and can help avoid resistance evolution if implemented in antibiotic stewardship schemes or the rational choice of new drug candidates.",

Disruption of planar polarity can result in developmental defects such as failed neural tube closure and cleft palette. Recent advances in molecular and live-imaging techniques have implicated both secreted morphogens and mechanical forces as orienting cues for planar polarisation. Components of planar polarity pathways act upstream of cytoskeletal effectors, which can alter cell mechanics in a polarised manner. The study of cell polarisation thus provides a system for dissecting the interplay between chemical and mechanical signals in development. Here, we discuss how different computational models have contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying planar polarity in animal tissues, focusing on recent efforts to integrate cell signalling and tissue mechanics. We conclude by discussing ways in which computational models could be improved to further our understanding of how planar polarity and tissue mechanics are coordinated during development.",

The response must be potent yet carefully controlled to avoid self-damage. How these constraints have shaped the evolution of innate immunity remains poorly understood. Here, we characterise this programmes transcriptional divergence between species and expression variability across cells. Using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics in primate and rodent fibroblasts challenged with an immune stimulus, we reveal a striking architecture of the innate immune response. Rapidly diverging genes, including cytokines and chemokines, also vary across cells and have distinct promoter structures. Conversely, genes involved in response regulation, such as transcription factors and kinases, are conserved between species and display low cell-to-cell variability. We suggest that this unique expression pattern, observed across species and conditions, has evolved as a mechanism for fine-tuned regulation, to achieve an effective but balanced response.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria contain their own DNA, and numerous studies have reported that genetic variation in this (mt)DNA sequence modifies the expression of life-history phenotypes. Maternal inheritance of mitochondria adds a layer of complexity to trajectories of mtDNA evolution, because theory predicts the accumulation of mtDNA mutations that are male-biased in effect. While it is clear that mitochondrial genomes routinely harbor genetic variation that affects components of reproductive performance, the extent to which this variation is sex-biased, or even sex-specific in effect, remains elusive. This is because nearly all previous studies have failed to examine mitochondrial genetic effects on both male and female reproductive performance within the one-and-the-same study. Here, we show that variation across naturally-occurring mitochondrial haplotypes affects components of reproductive success in both sexes, in Drosophila melanogaster. However, while we uncovered evidence for positive pleiotropy, across haplotypes, in effects on separate components of reproductive success when measured within the same sex, such patterns were not evident across sexes. Rather, we found a pattern of sexual antagonism across haplotypes on some reproductive parameters. This suggests the pool of polymorphisms that delineate global mtDNA haplotypes is likely to have been partly shaped by maternal transmission of mtDNA and its evolutionary consequences.",

We tested this hypothesis by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes in the feces of 67 individuals before and after treatment for adenoma (N = 22), advanced adenoma (N = 19), and carcinoma (N = 26).\\n\\nResultsThere were small changes to the bacterial community associated with adenoma or advanced adenoma and large changes associated with carcinoma. The communities from patients with carcinomas changed significantly more than those with adenoma following treatment (P-value < 0.001). Although treatment was associated with intrapersonal changes, the change in the abundance of individual OTUs in response to treatment was not consistent within diagnosis groups (P-value > 0.05). Because the distribution of OTUs across patients and diagnosis groups was irregular, we used the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to identify groups of OTUs that could be used to classify pre and post-treatment samples for each of the diagnosis groups. Although the three models could differentiate between the pre and post-treatment samples, there was little overlap between the OTUs that were indicative of each treatment. To determine whether individuals who underwent treatment were more likely to have OTUs associated with normal colons we used a larger cohort that contained individuals with normal colons and those with adenomas, advanced adenomas, and carcinomas. We again built Random Forest models and measured the change in the positive probability of having one of the three diagnoses to assess whether the post-treatment samples received the same classification as the pre-treatment samples. Samples from patients who had carcinomas changed towards a microbial milieu that resembles the normal colon after treatment (P-value < 0.05). Finally, we were unable to detect any significant differences in the microbiota of individuals treated with surgery alone and those treated with chemotherapy or chemotherapy and radiation (P-value > 0.05).\\n\\nConclusionsBy better understanding the response of the microbiota to treatment for adenomas and carcinomas, it is likely that biomarkers will eventually be validated that can be used to quantify the risk of recurrence and the likelihood of survival. Although it was difficult to identify significant differences between pre and post-treatment samples from patients with adenoma and advanced adenoma, this was not the case for carcinomas. Not only were there large changes in pre versus post-treatment samples for those with carcinoma, but these changes were towards a more normal microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Personally familiar faces are processed more robustly and efficiently than unfamiliar faces. The human face processing system comprises a core system that analyzes the visual appearance of faces and an extended system for the retrieval of person-knowledge and other nonvisual information. We applied multivariate pattern analysis to fMRI data to investigate aspects of familiarity that are shared by all familiar identities and information that distinguishes specific face identities from each other. Both identity-independent familiarity information and face identity could be decoded in an overlapping set of areas in the core and extended systems. Representational similarity analysis revealed a clear distinction between the two systems and a subdivision of the core system into ventral, dorsal and anterior components. This study provides evidence that activity in the extended system carries information about both individual identities and personal familiarity, while clarifying and extending the organization of the core system for face perception.",

    "abstract": "Human reaching movements require complex muscle activations to produce the forces necessary to move the limb in a controlled manner. How gravity and the complex kinetic properties of the limb contribute to the generation of the muscle activation pattern by the central nervous system (CNS) is a long-standing question in neuroscience. To address this question, muscle activity is often subdivided into static and phasic components. The former is thought to be related to posture maintenance and transitions between postures. The latter represents the remainder of muscle activity and is thought to be related to active movement production and the compensation for the kinetic properties of the limb. In the present study, we directly addressed how this subdivision of muscle activity into static and phasic components is related to the corresponding components of active muscle torques. Eight healthy subjects pointed in virtual reality to visual targets arranged to create a standard center-out reaching task in three dimensions. Muscle activity and motion capture data were synchronously collected during the movements. The motion capture data were used to calculate gravitational and dynamic components of active muscle torques using a dynamic model of the arm with 5 degrees of freedom. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was then applied to muscle activity and the torque components, separately, to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Muscle activity was also reconstructed from gravitational and dynamic torque components. Results show that the gravitational and dynamic components of muscle torque represent a significant amount of variance in muscle activity. This method could be used to identify static and phasic components of muscle activity using muscle torques. The contribution of both components to the overall muscle activity was largely equal, unlike their relative contribution to active muscle torques, which may reflect a neural control strategy.",

    "abstract": "Many statistical tests rely on the assumption that the residuals of a model are normally distributed. Rank-based inverse normal transformation (INT) of the dependent variable is one of the most popular approaches to satisfy the normality assumption. Studies regularly adjust for covariates and then normalize the residuals. This study investigated the effect of regressing covariates against the dependent variable and then applying rank-based INT to the residuals. The correlation between the dependent variable and covariates at each stage of processing was assessed. An alternative approach was tested of applying rank-based INT to the dependent variable before regressing covariates was tested. Analyses based on both simulated and real data examples demonstrated that applying rank-based INT to the dependent variable residuals after regressing out covariates re-introduces a linear correlation between the dependent variable and covariates in almost all situations. This will increase type-1 errors and reduce power. Our proposed alternative approach, where rank-based INT was applied prior to controlling for covariate effects, gave residuals that were normally distributed and linearly uncorrelated with covariates. This approach is therefore recommended.",

Information reported from the investigation of the Roka commune outbreak is sufficient to estimate the transmission efficiency of HIV through contaminated injection equipment. With conservative assumptions, two estimates are 4.6% and 9.2%. These estimates are much greater than widely disseminated and influential low estimates of risk from unsafe injections, estimates which have encouraged low estimates of the contribution of unsafe healthcare to Africas generalized HIV epidemics.

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn Ecuador, dengue virus (DENV) infections transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito are among the greatest public health concerns in urban coastal communities. Community- and household-level vector control is the principal means of controlling disease outbreaks. This study aimed to assess the impact of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) and social-ecological factors on the presence or absence of DENV infections in the household..\\n\\nMethodsIn 2014 and 2015, individuals with DENV infections from sentinel clinics were invited to participate in the study, as well as members of their household and members of four neighboring households located within 200 meters. We conducted diagnostic testing for DENV on all study participants; we surveyed heads of households (HOHs) regarding demographics, housing conditions and KAPs. We compared KAPs and social-ecological factors between households with (n=139) versus without (n=80) DENV infections, using bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression models with and without interactions.\\n\\nResultsSignificant risk factors in multivariate models included proximity to abandoned properties, interruptions in piped water, and shaded patios (p<0.05). Significant protective factors included use of mosquito bed nets, fumigation inside the home, piped water inside the home (p<0.05). In bivariate analyses (but not multivariate modeling), DENV infections was positively associated with HOHs who were male, employed, and of younger age than households without infections (p<0.05). DENV infections were not associated with knowledgeattitude, or reported barriers to prevention activities.\\n\\nDiscussionSpecific actions that can be considered to decrease the risk of DENV infections in the household include targeting vector control in highly shaded properties, fumigating inside the home, and use of mosquito bed nets. Community-level interventions include clean-up of abandoned properties, daily trash pick-up, and reliable piped water inside houses. These findings can inform interventions to reduce the risk of other diseases transmitted by the Ae. aegypti mosquito, such as chikungunya and Zika fever.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses are transmitted to people primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions. Diseases transmitted by the Ae. aegypti mosquito are a growing public health concern. Mosquito control is the principal means of preventing and controlling disease outbreaks. In this study, we compared the characteristics of households with and without DENV infections in the city of Machala, Ecuador. We found that risk factors for DENV infection included proximity to abandoned properties, interruptions in the piped water supply, and a highly shaded patio. Protective factors included the use of mosquito bed nets, fumigation inside the home, and piped water inside the home. These findings can be used to inform targeted vector control interventions by the public health sector at the household and community levels.",
