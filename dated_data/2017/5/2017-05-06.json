    "abstract": "Gaining insights into the regulatory mechanisms that underlie the transcriptional variation observed between individual cells necessitates the development of methods that measure chromatin organization in single cells. Here I adapted Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) to measure chromatin accessibility and endogenous DNA methylation in single cells (scNOMe-seq). scNOMe-seq recovered characteristic accessibility and DNA methylation patterns at DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs). An advantage of scNOMe-seq is that sequencing reads are sampled independently of the accessibility measurement. scNOMe-seq therefore controlled for fragment loss, which enabled direct estimation of the fraction of accessible DHSs within individual cells. In addition, scNOMe-seq provided high resolution of chromatin accessibility within individual loci which was exploited to detect footprints of CTCF binding events and to estimate the average nucleosome phasing distances in single cells. scNOMe-seq is therefore well-suited to characterize the chromatin organization of single cells in heterogeneous cellular mixtures.",

    "abstract": "To study sensory representations, neuroscientists record neural activities while presenting different stimuli to the animal. From these data, we identify neurons whose activities depend systematically on each aspect of the stimulus. These neurons are said to be \\\"tuned\\\" to that stimulus feature. It is typically assumed that these tuned neurons represent the stimulus feature in their firing, whereas any \\\"untuned\\\" neurons do not contribute to its representation. Recent experimental work questioned this assumption, showing that in some circumstances, neurons that are untuned to a particular stimulus feature can contribute to its representation. These findings suggest that, by ignoring untuned neurons, our understanding of population coding might be incomplete. At the same time, several key questions remain unanswered: Are the impacts of untuned neurons on population coding due to weak tuning that is nevertheless below the threshold the experimenters set for calling neurons tuned (vs untuned)? Do these effects hold for different population sizes and/or correlation structures? And could neural circuit function ever benefit from having some untuned neurons vs having all neurons be tuned to the stimulus? Using theoretical calculations and analyses of in vivo neural data, I answer those questions by: a) showing how, in the presence of correlated variability, untuned neurons can enhance sensory information coding, for a variety of population sizes and correlation structures; b) demonstrating that this effect does not rely on weak tuning; and c) identifying conditions under which the neural code can be made more informative by replacing some of the tuned neurons with untuned ones. These conditions specify when there is a functional benefit to having untuned neurons.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn the visual system, most neurons firing rates are tuned to various aspects of the stimulus (motion, contrast, etc.). For each stimulus feature, however some neurons appear to be untuned: their firing rates do not depend on that stimulus feature. Previous work on information coding in neural populations ignored untuned neurons, assuming that only the neurons tuned to a given stimulus feature contribute to its encoding. Recent experimental work questioned this assumption, showing that neurons with no apparent tuning can sometimes contribute to information coding. However, key questions remain unanswered. First, how do the untuned neurons contribute to information coding, and could this effect rely on those neurons having weak tuning that was overlooked? Second, does the function of a neural circuit ever benefit from having some neurons untuned? Or should every neuron be tuned (even weakly) to every stimulus feature? Here, I use mathematical calculations and analyses of data from the mouse visual cortex to answer those questions. First, I show how (and why) correlations between neurons enable the untuned neurons to contribute to information coding. Second, I show that neural populations can often do a better job of encoding a given stimulus feature when some of the neurons are untuned for that stimulus feature. Thus, it may be best for the brain to segregate its tuning, leaving some neurons untuned for each stimulus feature. Along with helping to explain how the brain processes external stimuli, this work has strong implications for attempts to decode brain signals, to control brain-machine interfaces: better performance could be obtained if the activities of all neurons are decoded, as opposed to only those with strong tuning.",

    "abstract": "Lipid accumulation within the lumen of endolysosomal vesicles is observed in various pathologies including atherosclerosis, liver disease, neurological disorders, lysosomal storage disorders, and cancer. Current methods cannot measure lipid flux specifically within the lysosomal lumen of live cells. We developed an optical reporter, composed of a photoluminescent carbon nanotube of a single chirality, which responds to lipid accumulation via modulation of the nanotubes optical bandgap. The engineered nanomaterial, composed of short-single stranded DNA and a single nanotube chirality, localizes exclusively to the lumen of endolysosomal organelles without adversely affecting cell viability or proliferation, or organelle morphology, integrity, or function. The emission wavelength of the reporter can be spatially resolved from within the endolysosomal lumen to generate quantitative maps of lipid content in live cells. Endolysosomal lipid accumulation in cell lines, an example of drug-induced phospholipidosis (DIPL), was observed for multiple drugs in macrophages, and measurements of patient-derived Niemann-Pick type C fibroblasts identified lipid accumulation and phenotypic reversal of this lysosomal storage disease. Single-cell measurements using the reporter discerned sub-cellular differences in equilibrium lipid content, illuminating significant intracellular heterogeneity among endolysosomal organelles of differentiating bone marrow-derived monocytes. Single-cell kinetics of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol accumulation within macrophages revealed rates that differed among cells by an order of magnitude. This carbon nanotube optical reporter of endolysosomal lipid content in live cells confers new capabilities for drug development processes and the investigation of lipid-linked diseases.",

    "abstract": "Brain tumors are among the most malignant primary tumors, hallmarked by angiogenesis, neuronal destruction and brain swelling. Inhibition of the glutamate-cystein antiporter xCT (system xc-/SLC7A11) alleviates seizures, neuronal cell death and tumor-associated brain edema. Here we show enhanced tumor vessel growth and increased brain edema in xCT-expressing brain tumors. Furthermore, xCT-mediated glutamate impacts directly on endothelial cells in an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dependent manner with intracellular Ca2+ release. Cerebral intravital microscopy revealed that xCT-driven tumor vessels are functional and display increased permeability. Endothelial-cell-specific NMDAR1 knockout mice (GRINi{Delta}EC) show suppressed endothelial sprouting and vascular density compared to control littermates. In addition, implanted gliomas in GRINi{Delta}EC mice display reduced tumor vessels in contrast to gliomas in wildtype animals. Moreover, therapeutic targeting of xCT in gliomas alleviates tumor angiogenesis to normalized levels comparable to controls. Our data reveal that xCT and its substrate glutamate specifically operate on endothelial cells and promote neoangiogenesis. Thus, targeting xCT expression and glutamate secretion in gliomas provides a novel therapeutic roadmap for normalizing tumor angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding the structure of a bacterial population is essential in order to understand bacterial evolution, or which genetic lineages cause disease, or the consequences of perturbations to the bacterial population. Estimating the core genome, the genes common to all or nearly all strains of a species, is an essential component of such analyses. The size and composition of the core genome varies by dataset, but our hypothesis was that variation between different collections of the same bacterial species should be minimal. To test this, the genome sequences of 3,121 pneumococci recovered from healthy individuals in Reykjavik (Iceland), Southampton (United Kingdom), Boston (USA) and Maela (Thailand) were analysed.\\n\\nResultsThe analyses revealed a  supercore genome (genes shared by all 3,121 pneumococci) of only 303 genes, although 461 additional core genes were shared by pneumococci from Reykjavik, Southampton and Boston. Overall, the size and composition of the core genomes and pan-genomes among pneumococci recovered in Reykjavik, Southampton and Boston were very similar, but pneumococci from Maela were distinctly different. Inspection of the pan-genome of Maela pneumococci revealed several >25 Kb sequence regions that were homologous to genomic regions found in other bacterial species.\\n\\nConclusionsSome subsets of the global pneumococcal population are highly heterogeneous and thus our hypothesis was rejected. This is an essential point of consideration before generalising the findings from a single dataset to the wider pneumococcal population.",

    "abstract": "A wide range of studies in human neuroscience rely on the analysis of electrophysiological bio-signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) where customized data analysis may require supervised artefact rejection, binary marking through visual inspection, selection of noise and artefact samples for pre-processing algorithms, and selection of clinically-relevant signal segments in neurological conditions. Nevertheless, the existing preprocessing tools do not provide the needed flexibility to handle such tasks efficiently. We therefore developed a free open-source Graphical User Interface (GUI), EyeBallGUI, that allows visualization and flexible, manual marking (binary classification) of multi-channel bio-signal data. EyeBallGUI, developed for MATLAB(R), allows the user to interactively and accurately inspect and mark multi-channel digitized data with no restriction on marking periods of data in subsets of channels (a restriction in place in existing tools). The new tool facilitates precise, manual marking of bio-signals by allowing any desired segment of data to be marked in any subset of channels. It is therefore of utility in circumstances where such flexibility is essential. The developed GUI is an auxiliary analysis tool that shall facilitate neural signal (pre-)processing applications where it is desirable to perform accurate supervised artefact rejection, flexible data marking for increased data retention yield, extraction of specific signal segments by expert users from sample data, or labeling of data for clinical and scientific research purposes.",

We apply both classes to the mortality data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics and show that while both perform significantly better than the random classifier, the deep model that utilizes long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), surpasses the N-gram based models and is capable of learning the temporal aspect of the data without a need for building ad-hoc, expert-driven features.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to high temperatures has an adverse effect on cellular processes and results in activation of the cellular heat shock response (HSR), a highly conserved program of inducible genes to maintain protein homeostasis1. The insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway, which has diverse roles from metabolism to stress response and longevity, is activated as part of the HSR2-4. Recent evidence suggest that the IIS pathway is able to affect proteostasis non-autonomously5,6, yet it is not known if it is activated autonomously in stressed cells or systemically as part of an organismic program. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the single forkhead box O (FOXO) homologue DAF-16 functions as the major target of the IIS pathway7 and, together with the heat-shock factor HSF-1, induce the expression of small heat shock proteins in response to heat shock8-10,3. Here we use a novel microfluidic device that allows precise control of the spatiotemporal temperature profile to show that cellular activation of DAF-16 integrates local temperature sensation with systemic signals. We demonstrate that DAF-16 activation in head sensory neurons is essential for DAF-16 activation in other tissues, but show that no known thermosensory neuron is individually required. Our findings demonstrate that systemic and cell-autonomous aspects of stress response act together to facilitate a coordinated cellular response at the organismic level.",

    "abstract": "A key concept in template-based modeling is the high correlation between sequence and structural divergence, with the practical consequence that homologous proteins that are similar at the sequence level will also be similar at the structural level. However, conformational diversity of the native state will reduce the correlation between structural and sequence divergence, because structural variation can appear without sequence diversity.\\n\\nIn this work, we explore the impact that conformational diversity has on the relationship between structural and sequence divergence. We find that the extent of conformational diversity can be as high as the maximum structural divergence among families. Also, as expected, conformational diversity impairs the well-established correlation between sequence and structural divergence, which is nosier than previously suggested. However, we found that this noise can be resolved using a priori information coming from the structure-function relationship. We show that protein families with low conformational diversity show a well-correlated relationship between sequence and structural divergence, which is severely reduced in proteins with larger conformational diversity. This lack of correlation could impair Template-based modelling (TMB) results in highly dynamical proteins. Finally, we also find that the presence of order/disorder can provide useful beforehand information for better TBM performance.\\n\\nAuthor summaryTemplate-based modelling (TBM) is the most reliable and fastest approach to obtain protein structural models. TBM relies in the high correlation between sequence and structural divergence, with the practical consequence that proteins that are similar at the sequence level will also be similar at the structural level, allowing in this way the selection of the better template to obtain the 3D model of the target sequence. However, protein native state could be described by a collection of conformers in equilibrium where their structural differences are called conformational diversity.\\n\\nIn this work, we explore the impact that conformational diversity has on the relationship between structural and sequence divergence. We firstly found that the extent of conformational diversity can be as high as the maximum structural differences reached by families differing in their sequences. In these proteins with higher conformational diversity levels, the well-established correlation between sequence and structural divergence is nosier than previously suggested due to the presence of structural change without sequence variation. This lack of correlation could impair TBM results due to the uncertainty in the correct template selection.
