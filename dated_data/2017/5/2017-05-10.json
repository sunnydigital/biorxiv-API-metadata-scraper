    "abstract": "Recently, psychophysical laws have been observed to be functional in certain factors working downstream of the Wnt pathway. This work tests the veracity of the prevalence of such laws, albeit at a coarse level, using sensitivity analysis on biologically inspired epigenetically influenced computational causal models. In this work, the variation in the effect of the predictive behaviour of the transcription complex (TRCMPLX) conditional on the evidences of gene expressions in normal/tumor samples is observed by varying the initially assigned values of conditional probability tables (cpt) for TRCMPLX. Preliminary analysis shows that the variation in predictive behaviour of TRCMPLX follows power-logarithmic psychophysical law, crudely. More recently, wet lab experiments have proved the existence of sensors that behave in a logarithmic fashion thus supporting the earlier proposed postulates based on computational sensitivity analysis of this manuscript regarding the existence of logarithmic behaviour in the signaling pathways. It also signifies the importance of systems biology approach where in silico experiments combined with in vivo/in vitro experiments have the power to explore the deeper mechanisms of a signaling pathway. Additionally, it is hypothesized that these laws are prevalent at gene-gene interaction level also. The interactions were obtained by thresholding the inferred conditional probabilities of a gene activation given the status of another gene activation. The deviation in the interactions in normal/tumor samples was similarly observed by varying the initially assigned values of conditional probability tables (cpt) for TRCMPLX. Analysis of deviation in interactions show prevalence of psychophysical laws and is reported for interaction between elements of pairs (SFRP3, MYC), (SFRP2, CD44) and (DKK1, DACT2). Based on crude static models, it is assumed that dynamic models of Bayesian networks might reveal the phenomena in a better way.",

    "abstract": "The formation of mammalian chromatin domains was investigated by analyzing the domain/isochore connection. This showed that LADs correspond to GC-poor isochores and are compositionally flat, flexible chromatin structures because of the local nucleosome depletions associated with the presence of oligo-As. In contrast, TADs correspond to GC-rich isochores that consist of single or (much more frequently) multiple, GC peaks that shape the single or multiple, loops of TADs. Indeed, the increasing nucleosome depletions linked to the GC gradients of isochore peaks lead to an increasing chromatin flexibility (accompanied by an increasing accessibility and decreasing supercoiling). In conclusion, isochores not only encode but also mold chromatin architecture; while architectural proteins play a role in closing and insulating TAD loops. An extension of this model concerns the encoding of open and closed chromosome compartments by alternating GC-rich and GC-poor isochores, the interactions among compartments defining the 3-D chromosome folding.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMendelian randomisation (MR) is being increasingly used to strengthen causal inference in observational studies. Availability of summary data of genetic associations for a variety of phenotypes from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allows straightforward application of MR using summary data methods, typically in a two-sample design. In addition to the conventional inverse variance weighting (IVW) method, recently developed summary data MR methods, such as the MR-Egger and weighted median approaches, allow a relaxation of the instrumental variable assumptions.\\n\\nMethodsHere, a new method -the mode-based estimate (MBE) - is proposed to obtain a single causal effect estimate from multiple genetic instruments. The MBE is consistent when the largest number of similar (identical in infinite samples) individual-instrument causal effect estimates comes from valid instruments, even if the majority of instruments are invalid. We evaluate the performance of the method in simulations designed to mimic the two-sample summary data setting, and demonstrate its use by investigating the causal effect of plasma lipid fractions and urate levels on coronary heart disease risk.\\n\\nResultsThe MBE presented less bias and type-I error rates than other methods under the null in many situations. Its power to detect a causal effect was smaller compared to the IVW and weighted median methods, but was larger than that of MR-Egger regression, with sample size requirements typically smaller than those available from GWAS consortia.\\n\\nConclusionsThe MBE relaxes the instrumental variable assumptions, and should be used in combination with other approaches in a sensitivity analysis.\\n\\nKey MessagesO_LISummary data Mendelian randomisation, typically in a two-sample setting, is being increasingly used due to the availability of summary association results from large genome- wide association studies.\\nC_LIO_LIMendelian randomisation analyses using multiple genetic instruments are prone to bias due to horizontal pleiotropy, especially when genetic instruments are selected based solely on statistical criteria.\\nC_LIO_LIA causal effect estimate robust to horizontal pleiotropy can be obtained using the mode- based estimate (MBE).\\nC_LIO_LIThe MBE requires that the most common causal effect estimate is a consistent estimate of the true causal effect, even if the majority of instruments are invalid (i.e., the ZEro Modal Pleiotropy Assumption, or ZEMPA).\\nC_LIO_LIPlotting the smoothed empirical density function is useful to explore the distribution of causal effect estimates, and to understand how the MBE is determined.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Threshold generation in fate-selection circuits is often achieved through deterministic bistability, which requires cooperativity (i.e., nonlinear activation) and associated hysteresis. However, the Tat positive-feedback loop that controls HIVs fate decision between replication and proviral latency lacks self-cooperativity and deterministic bistability. Absent cooperativity, it is unclear how HIV can temporarily remain in an off state long enough for the kinetically slower epigenetic silencing mechanisms to act-- expression fluctuations should rapidly trigger active positive feedback and replication, precluding establishment of latency. Here, using flow cytometry and single-cell imaging, we find that the Tat circuit exhibits a transient activation threshold. This threshold largely disappears after [~]40 hours--accounting for the lack of deterministic bistability--and promoter activation shortens the lifetime of this transient threshold. Continuous differential equation models do not recapitulate this phenomenon. However, chemical reaction (master equation) models where the transcriptional transactivator and promoter toggle between  inactive and  active states can recapitulate the phenomenon since they intrinsically create a single-molecule threshold transiently requiring excess molecules in the  inactive state to achieve at least one molecule (rather than a continuous fractional value) in the  active state. Given the widespread nature of promoter toggling and transcription factor modifications, transient thresholds may be a general feature of inducible promoters.",

While discontinuity is evident in the transition to agriculture across the region, sensitive haplotype-based analyses suggest a significant degree of local hunter-gatherer contribution to later Iberian Neolithic populations. A more subtle genetic influx is also apparent in the Bronze Age, detectable from analyses including haplotype sharing with both ancient and modern genomes, D-statistics and Y-chromosome lineages. However, the limited nature of this introgression contrasts with the major Steppe migration turnovers within third Millennium northern Europe and echoes the survival of non-Indo-European language in Iberia. Changes in genomic estimates of individual height across Europe are also associated with these major cultural transitions, and ancestral components continue to correlate with modern differences in stature.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRecent ancient DNA work has demonstrated the significant genetic impact of mass migrations from the Steppe into Central and Northern Europe during the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. In Iberia, archaeological change at the level of material culture and funerary rituals has been reported during this period, however, the genetic impact associated with this cultural transformation has not yet been estimated. In order to investigate this, we sequence Neolithic and Bronze Age samples from Portugal, which we compare to other ancient and present-day individuals. Genome-wide imputation of a large dataset of ancient samples enabled sensitive methods for detecting population structure and selection in ancient samples. We revealed subtle genetic differentiation between the Portuguese Neolithic and Bronze Age samples suggesting a markedly reduced influx in Iberia compared to other European regions. Furthermore, we predict individual height in ancients, suggesting that stature was reduced in the Neolithic and affected by subsequent admixtures. Lastly, we examine signatures of strong selection in important traits and the timing of their origins.",

    "abstract": "The human transcriptome is so large, diverse and dynamic that, even after a decade of investigation by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), we are yet to resolve its true dimensions. RNA-Seq suffers from an expression-dependent bias that impedes characterization of low-abundance transcripts. We performed targeted single-molecule and short-read RNA-Seq to survey the transcriptional landscape of a single human chromosome (Hsa21) at unprecedented resolution. Our analysis reaches the lower limits of the transcriptome, identifying a fundamental distinction between protein-coding and noncoding gene content: almost every noncoding exon undergoes alternative splicing, producing a seemingly limitless variety of isoforms. Analysis of syntenic regions of the mouse genome shows that few noncoding exons are shared between human and mouse, yet human splicing profiles are recapitulated on Hsa21 in mouse cells, indicative of regulation by a deeply conserved splicing code. We propose that noncoding exons are functionally modular, with alternative splicing generating an enormous repertoire of potential regulatory RNAs and a rich transcriptional reservoir for gene evolution.",

Previous phenomenological studies of the yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria have demonstrated strong positive sexual and fecundity selection on male and female size. Nevertheless, the body size of flies from a Swiss study population has declined by almost 10% from 1993 to 2009. Given substantial heritability of body size, this negative evolutionary response of an evidently positively selected trait suggests important selective factors being missed (e.g. size-selective predation or parasitism). A periodic epidemic outbreak of the fungus Entomophthora scatophagae allowedassessment of selection exerted by this parasite fatal to adult flies. Fungal infection varied over the season from ca. 50% in the cooler and more humid spring and autumn to almost 0% in summer. The probability of dying from fungal infection increased with adult body size. All infected females died before laying eggs, so there was no fungus impact on female fecundity beyond its impact on mortality. Large males showed the typical mating advantage in the field, but this pattern of positive sexual selection was nullified by fungal infection. Mean fluctuating asymmetry of paired appendages (legs, wings) did not affect the viability, fecundity or mating success of yellow dung flies in the field. This study demonstrates rare parasite-mediated disadvantages of large adult body size in the field. Reduced ability to combat parasites such as Entomophthora may be an immunity cost of large size in dung flies, although the hypothesized trade-off between fluctuating asymmetry, a presumed indicator of developmental instability and environmental stress, and immunocompetence was not found here.",

    "abstract": "Faster evolution of X chromosomes has been documented in several species and results from the increased efficiency of selection on recessive alleles in hemizygous males and/or from increased drift due to the smaller effective population size of X chromosomes. Aphids are excellent models for evaluating the importance of selection in faster-X evolution, because their peculiar life-cycle and unusual inheritance of sex-chromosomes lead to equal effective population sizes for X and autosomes. Because we lack a high-density genetic map for the pea aphid whose complete genome has been sequenced, we assigned its entire genome to the X and autosomes based on ratios of sequencing depth in males and females. Unexpectedly, we found frequent scaffold misassembly, but we could unambiguously locate 13,726 genes on the X and 19,263 on autosomes. We found higher non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions ratios (dN/dS) for X-linked than for autosomal genes. Our analyses of substitution rates together with polymorphism and expression data showed that relaxed selection is likely to contribute predominantly to faster-X as a large fraction of X-linked genes are expressed at low rates and thus escape selection. Yet, a minor role for positive selection is also suggested by the difference between substitution rates for X and autosomes for male-biased genes (but not for asexual female-biased genes) and by lower Tajimas D for X-linked than for autosomal genes with highly male-biased expression patterns. This study highlights the relevance of organisms displaying alternative inheritance of chromosomes to the understanding of forces shaping genome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue (TPE) is the causative agent of yaws. The disease was subject to global eradication efforts in the mid 20th century but reemerged in West Africa, Southern Asia, and the Pacific region. Despite its importance for eradication, detailed data on possible nonhuman disease reservoirs are missing. A number of African nonhuman primates (NHPs) have been reported to show skin ulcerations suggestive of treponemal infection in humans. Furthermore antibodies against Treponema pallidum (TP) have been repeatedly detected in wild NHP populations. While genetic studies confirmed that NHPs are infected with TP strains, subspecies identification was only possible once for a strain isolated in 1966, pinpointing the involvement of TPE. We therefore collected a number of recently isolated simian TP strains and determined eight whole genome sequences using hybridization capture or long-range PCR combined with next-generation sequencing. These new genomes were compared with those of known human TP isolates. Our results show that naturally occurring simian TP strains circulating in three African NHP species all cluster with human TPE strains and show the same genomic structure as human TPE strains. These data indicate that humans are not the exclusive host for the yaws bacterium and that a One Health approach is required to achieve sustainable eradication of human yaws.",

    "abstract": "If the brain is inherently Bayesian, then behavior should show the signatures of Bayesian computation from an early stage in life without the need for learning. Children should integrate probabilistic information from prior and likelihood distributions to reach decisions and should be as statistically efficient as adults. To test this idea, we examined the integration of prior and likelihood information in a simple position estimation task comparing children aged 6-11 years and adults. During development, estimation performance became closer to the statistical optimum. Children use likelihood information as well as adults but are limited in their use of priors. This finding suggests that Bayesian behavior is not inherent but learnt over the course of development.",

    "abstract": "Despite a growing body of research suggesting that task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies often suffer from a lack of statistical power due to too-small samples, the proliferation of such underpowered studies continues unabated. Using large independent samples across eleven distinct tasks, we demonstrate the impact of sample size on replicability, assessed at different levels of analysis relevant to fMRI researchers. We find that the degree of replicability for typical sample sizes is modest and that sample sizes much larger than typical (e.g., N = 100) produce results that fall well short of perfectly replicable. Thus, our results join the existing line of work advocating for larger sample sizes. Moreover, because we test sample sizes over a fairly large range and use intuitive metrics of replicability, our hope is that our results are more understandable and convincing to researchers who may have found previous results advocating for larger samples inaccessible.",

Here, we analysed the relative contribution of each phosphorylatable residue in the N17 region (T3, S13 and S16) towards huntingtin exon 1 (HTTex1) oligomerization, aggregation and toxicity in human cells and Drosophila neurons. We used bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to show that expression of single phosphomimic mutations completely abolished HTTex1 aggregation in human cells. In Drosophila, Mimicking phosphorylation at T3 decreased HTTex1 aggregation both in larvae and adult flies. Interestingly, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) prevented HTTex1 aggregation in both human cells and Drosophila while increasing neurotoxicity in flies. Our findings suggest that PP1 modulates HTTex1 aggregation by regulating phosphorylation on T3. In summary, our study suggests that modulation of HTTex1 single phosphorylation events by PP1 could constitute an efficient and direct molecular target for therapeutic interventions in HD.",

Any number of affected FDRs or SDRs significantly increased risk for BC, and more than 4 TDRs, even with no affected FDRs or SDRs significantly increased risk.

BDA employs a rationally designed competitive hybridization reaction to achieve similar enrichment performance across anneal temperatures ranging from 56{degrees}C to 64{degrees}C. This temperature robustness facilitates multiplexed enrichment of many different variants across the genome, and furthermore enables the use of in-expensive and portable thermocycling instruments for rare DNA variant detection. To show the sequence generality of BDA, we demonstrated enrichment on 156 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). BDA has been validated on multiple different PCR platforms, DNA polymerases, and sample types including clinical cell-free DNA samples collected from the blood plasma of lung cancer patients. BDA quantitation of mutation allele fraction is generally consistent with deep sequencing results.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have prioritized trait-relevant cell types by looking for an enrichment of GWAS signal within functional regions. However, these studies are limited in cell resolution by the lack of functional annotations from difficult-to-characterize or rare cell populations. Measurement of single-cell gene expression has become a popular method for characterizing novel cell types, and yet, hardly any work exists linking single-cell RNA-seq to phenotypes of interest. To address this deficiency, we present RolyPoly, a regression-based polygenic model that can prioritize trait-relevant cell types and genes from GWAS summary statistics and single-cell RNA-seq. We demonstrate RolyPolys accuracy through simulation and validate previously known tissue-trait associations. We discover a significant association between microglia and late-onset Alzheimers disease, and an association between oligodendrocytes and replicating fetal cortical cells with schizophrenia. Additionally, RolyPoly computes a trait-relevance score for each gene which reflects the importance of expression specific to a cell type. We found that differentially expressed genes in the prefrontal cortex of Alzheimers patients were significantly enriched for highly ranked genes by RolyPoly gene scores. Overall, our method represents a powerful framework for understanding the effect of common variants on cell types contributing to complex traits.",

Genomic and transcriptomic resources for this species would promote investigation of genetic mechanisms that underpin plastic responses to environmental stress, such as climate warming. Moreover, such resources would aid comparative studies of complex traits at the molecular level, such as the transition from oviparous to viviparous reproduction, which happened at least four times within Sceloporus.\\n\\nFindingsA de novo transcriptome assembly for Sceloporus undulatus, Sund_v1.0, was generated using over 179 million Illumina reads obtained from three tissues (whole brain, skeletal muscle, and embryo) as well as previously reported liver sequences. The Sund_v1.0 assembly had an average contig length of 782 nucleotides and an E90N50 statistic of 2,550 nucleotides. Comparing S. undulatus transcripts with the benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO) for tetrapod species yielded 97.2% gene representation. A total of 13,422 protein-coding orthologs were identified in comparison to the genome of the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis, which is the closest related species with genomic data available.\\n\\nConclusionsThe multi-tissue transcriptome of S. undulatus is the first for a member of the family Phrynosomatidae, offering an important resource to advance studies of adaptation in this species and genomic research in reptiles.",

We studied the diversity of these cyanobacteria in a gypsiferous grassland from Central Spain using both morphological identification after cultivation and genetic analyses with the 16S rRNA gene. Eight different morphotypes were observed, most of them corresponding to filamentous and one of them to unicellular cyanobacteria. We found cyanobacterial genera typical of biocrust communities, such as Microcoleus, Schizothrix or Tolypothrix, and N-fixing cyanobacteria as Scytonema or Nostoc. Genetic information allowed us to identify cultures belonging to recently described genera such as Roholtiella, Nodosilinea and Mojavia.

Our analyses revealed no evidence that women with more attractive faces or lower (i.e., more attractive) waist-to-hip ratios had higher levels of estradiol or progesterone.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDTargeted therapies specifically act by blocking the activity of proteins that are encoded by genes critical for tumorigenesis. However, most cancers acquire resistance and long-term disease remission is rarely observed. Understanding the time course of molecular changes responsible for the development of acquired resistance could enable optimization of patients treatment options. Clinically, acquired therapeutic resistance can only be studied at a single time point in resistant tumors. To determine the dynamics of these molecular changes, we obtained high throughput omics data weekly during the development of cetuximab resistance in a head and neck cancer in vitro model.\\n\\nRESULTSAn unsupervised algorithm, CoGAPS, was used to quantify the evolving transcriptional and epigenetic changes. Applying a PatternMarker statistic to the results from CoGAPS enabled novel heatmap-based visualization of the dynamics in these time course omics data. We demonstrate that transcriptional changes result from immediate therapeutic response or resistance, whereas epigenetic alterations only occur with resistance. Integrated analysis demonstrates delayed onset of changes in DNA methylation relative to transcription, suggesting that resistance is stabilized epigenetically.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSGenes with epigenetic alterations associated with resistance that have concordant expression changes are hypothesized to stabilize resistance. These genes include FGFR1, which was associated with EGFR inhibitor resistance previously. Thus, integrated omics analysis distinguishes the timing of molecular drivers of resistance. Our findings provide a relevant towards better understanding of the time course progression of changes resulting in acquired resistance to targeted therapies. This is an important contribution to the development of alternative treatment strategies that would introduce new drugs before the resistant phenotype develops.",

    "abstract": "Msp1 is a conserved AAA ATPase in budding yeast localized to mitochondria where it prevents accumulation of mistargeted tail-anchored (TA) proteins, including the peroxisomal TA protein Pex15. Msp1 also resides on peroxisomes but it remains unknown how native TA proteins on mitochondria and peroxisomes evade Msp1 surveillance. We used live-cell quantitative cell microscopy tools and drug-inducible gene expression to dissect Msp1 function. We found that a small fraction of peroxisomal Pex15, exaggerated by overexpression, is turned over by Msp1. Kinetic measurements guided by theoretical modeling revealed that Pex15 molecules at mitochondria display age-independent Msp1 sensitivity. By contrast, Pex15 molecules at peroxisomes are rapidly converted from an initial Msp1-sensitive to an Msp1-resistant state. Lastly, we show that Pex15 interacts with the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex3, which shields Pex15 from Msp1-dependent turnover. In sum, our work argues that Msp1 selects its substrates on the basis of their solitary membrane existence.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWExactly a century ago, DArcy Thompson set an agenda for understanding tissue development in terms of underlying biophysical, mathematically-tractable mechanisms. One such mechanism, discovered by Steinberg in the 1960s, is adhesion-mediated sorting of cell mixtures into homotypic groups. Interest in this phase separation mechanism has recently surged, partly because of its use to create synthetic biological patterning mechanisms and partly because it has been found to drive events critical to the formation of organoids from stem cells, making the process relevant to biotechnology as well as to basic development. Here, we construct quantitative model of patterning by phase separation, informed by laboratory data, and use it to explore the relationship between degree of adhesive difference and speed, type and extent of resultant patterning. Our results can be used three ways; to predict the outcome of mix-ing cells with known properties, to estimate the properties required to make some designed organoid system, or to estimate underlying cellular properties from observed behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are genomic parasites that impose fitness costs on their hosts by producing deleterious mutations and disrupting gametogenesis. Host genomes avoid these costs by regulating TE activity, particularly in germline cells where new insertions are heritable and TEs are exceptionally active. However, the capacity of different TE-associated fitness costs to select for repression in the host, and the role of selection in the evolution of TE regulation more generally, remain controversial. In this study, we use forward, individual-based simulations to examine the evolution of small-RNA-mediated TE regulation, a conserved mechanism for TE repression that is employed by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To design and parameterize a biologically realistic model, we drew on an extensive survey of empirical studies of the transposition and regulation of P-element DNA transposons in Drosophila melanogaster. We observed that even under conservative assumptions, where small-RNA-mediated regulation reduces transposition only, repression evolves rapidly and adaptively after the genome is invaded by a new TE. We further show that the spread of repressor alleles is greatly enhanced by two additional TE-imposed fitness costs: dysgenic sterility and ectopic recombination. Finally, we demonstrate that the mutation rate to repression (i.e., the size of the mutational target) is a critical parameter that influences both the evolutionary trajectory of host repression and the associated proliferation of TEs after invasion. Our findings suggest that adaptive evolution of TE regulation may be stronger and more prevalent than previously appreciated, and provide a framework for evaluating empirical data.",

    "abstract": "Recent fossil finds have highlighted extensive morphological diversity within our genus, Homo, and the co-existence of a number of species. However, little is known about the evolutionary processes responsible for producing this diversity. Understanding the action of these processes can provide insight into how and why our lineage evolved and diversified. Here, we examine cranial and mandibular variation and diversification from the earliest emergence of our genus at 2.8 Ma until the Late Pleistocene (0.126-0.0117 Ma), using statistical tests developed from quantitative genetics theory to evaluate whether stochastic (genetic drift) versus non-stochastic (selection) processes were responsible for the observed variation. Results show that random processes can account for species diversification for most traits, including neurocranial diversification, and across all time periods. Where selection was found to shape diversification, we show that: 1) adaptation was important in the earliest migration of Homo out of Africa; 2) selection played a role in shaping mandibular and maxillary diversity among Homo groups, possibly due to dietary differences; and 3) Homo rudolfensis is adaptively different from other early Homo taxa, including the earliest known Homo specimen. These results show that genetic drift, and likely small population sizes, were important factors shaping the evolution of Homo and many of its novel traits, but that selection played an essential role in driving adaptation to new contexts.",

    "abstract": "Human-pathogenic bacteria are found in a variety of niches, including free-living, zoonotic, and microbiome environments. Identifying bacterial adaptions that enable invasive disease is an important means of gaining insight into the molecular basis of pathogenesis and understanding pathogen emergence. Staphylococcus saprophyticus, a leading cause of urinary tract infections, can be found in the environment, food, animals, and the human microbiome. We identified a selective sweep in the gene encoding the Aas adhesin, a key virulence factor that binds host fibronectin. We hypothesize that the mutation under selection (aas_2206A>C) facilitates colonization of the urinary tract, an environment where bacteria are subject to strong shearing forces. The mutation appears to have enabled emergence and expansion of a human pathogenic lineage of S. saprophyticus. These results demonstrate the power of evolutionary genomic approaches in discovering the genetic basis of virulence and emphasize the pleiotropy and adaptability of bacteria occupying diverse niches.\\n\\nImportanceStaphylococcus saprophyticus is an important cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) in women, which are common, can be severe, and are associated with significant impacts to public health. In addition to being a cause of human UTI, S. saprophyticus can be found in the environment, in food, and associated with animals. After discovering that UTI strains of S. saprophyticus are for the most part closely related to each other, we sought to determine whether these strains are specially adapted to cause disease in humans. We found evidence suggesting that a mutation in the gene aas is advantageous in the context of human infection. We hypothesize that the mutation allows S. saprophyticus to survive better in the human urinary tract. These results show how bacteria found in the environment can evolve to cause disease.",

Here we report an expert-vetted, population-averaged atlas of the structural connectome derived from diffusion MRI data (N=842). This was achieved by creating a high-resolution template of diffusion patterns averaged across individual subjects and using tractography to generate 550,000 trajectories of representative white matter fascicles annotated by 80 anatomical labels. The trajectories were subsequently clustered and labeled by a team of experienced neuroanatomists in order to conform to prior neuroanatomical knowledge. A multi-level network topology was then described using whole-brain connectograms, with subdivisions of the association pathways showing small-worldness in intra-hemisphere connections, projection pathways showing hub structures at thalamus, putamen, and brainstem, and commissural pathways showing bridges connecting cerebral hemispheres to provide global efficiency. This atlas of the structural connectome provides representative organization of human brain white matter, complementary to traditional histologically-derived and voxel-based white matter atlases, allowing for better modeling and simulation of brain connectivity for future connectome studies.",

    "abstract": "Tumors exploit angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, in order to obtain nutrients required for continued growth and proliferation. Targeting factors that regulate angiogenesis, including the potent promoter vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is therefore an attractive strategy for inhibiting tumor growth. Computational modeling can be used to identify tumor-specific properties that influence the response to anti-angiogenic strategies. Here, we build on our previous systems biology model of VEGF transport and kinetics in tumor-bearing mice to include a tumor compartment whose volume depends on the \\\"angiogenic signal\\\" produced when VEGF binds to its receptors on tumor endothelial cells. We trained and validated the model using published in vivo measurements of xenograft tumor volume, producing a model that accurately predicts the tumors response to anti-angiogenic treatment. We applied the model to investigate how tumor growth kinetics influence the response to anti-angiogenic treatment targeting VEGF. Based on multivariate regression analysis, we found that certain intrinsic kinetic parameters that characterize the growth of tumors could successfully predict response to anti-VEGF treatment, the reduction in tumor volume. Lastly, we use the trained model to predict the response to anti-VEGF therapy for tumors expressing different levels of VEGF receptors. The model predicts that certain tumors are more sensitive to treatment than others, and the response to treatment shows a nonlinear dependence on the VEGF receptor expression. Overall, this model is a useful tool for predicting how tumors will respond to anti-VEGF treatment, and it complements pre-clinical in vivo mouse studies.",

    "abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum is a pathogenic oral bacterium that is linked to multiple human infections and colorectal cancer. While most Gram-negative pathogens utilize secretion systems for cellular invasion and infection, F. nucleatum lacks Type I, II, III, IV, and VI secretion. By contrast, F. nucleatum strains are enriched in Type V secreted autotransporters, which are Gram-negative bacterial virulence factors critical for binding and entry into host cells. Here we present the first biochemical characterization of a F. nucleatum Type Vd phospholipase class A1 autotransporter (strain ATCC 25586, gene FN1704) that we hereby rename Fusobacterium phospholipase autotransporter (FplA). FplA is expressed as a full-length 85 kDa outer membrane embedded protein, or as a truncated phospholipase domain that remains associated with the outer membrane. Using multiple FplA constructs we characterized lipid substrate specificity, potent inhibitors, and chemical probes to detect and track this enzyme family. While the role of FplA is undetermined in F. nucleatum virulence, homologous phospholipases from intracellular pathogens are critical for vacuole escape, altered host signaling, and intracellular survival. We hypothesize that upon intracellular invasion of the host, FplA could play a role in phagosomal escape, subversion of autophagy, or eicosanoid-mediated inflammatory signaling, as we show that FplA binds with high affinity to host phosphoinositide signaling lipids critical to these processes. Our identification of substrates, inhibitors, and chemical probes for FplA, in combination with an fplA gene deletion strain, encompass a powerful set of tools for the future analysis of FplA in vivo. In addition, these studies will guide the biochemical characterization of additional Type Vd autotransporter phospholipases.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEF. nucleatum is an emerging pathogen that is linked to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, yet there is a critical knowledge gap in the mechanisms used by this bacterium to elicit changes in the host for intracellular entry and survival. As phospholipases are critical virulence factors for intracellular bacteria to initiate vacuole lysis, cell-to-cell spread, and evasion of autophagy, we set out to characterize a unique Type Vd secreted phospholipase A1 enzyme from F. nucleatum. Our results show a potential role for modulating host signaling pathways through cleavage of phosphoinositide dependent signaling lipids. These studies open the door for further characterization of this unique enzyme family in bacterial virulence, host-pathogen interactions, and for F. nucleatum, in colorectal carcinogenesis.",

Here, we show that cholinergic interneurons are present in the zebrafish spinal cord and differentially control the excitability of distinct classes of motoneurons (slow, intermediate and fast) in a muscarinic dependent manner. Moreover, we reveal that m2-type muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are present in fast and intermediate motoneurons, but not in the slow motoneurons, and that their activation decreases neuronal firing. We also provide evidence that this configuration of motoneuron muscarinic receptors serves as the main intrinsic plasticity mechanism to alter the operational range of motoneuron modules. These unexpected findings provide new insights into the functional flexibility of motoneurons and how they execute locomotion at different speeds.",

    "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), together with its cognate receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB), plays an essential role in the development and plasticity of the brain and is widely implicated in psychiatric diseases (Autry and Monteggia, 2012). Due to the highly conserved evolutionary lineage of neurotrophins and their receptors in vertebrates, the zebrafish is a well-suited model for this study. The TrkB receptor, also known as NTRK2, has two forms in zebrafish, Ntrk2a and Ntrk2b. The spatio-temporal expression pattern of bdnf and ntrk2b in zebrafish was studied using in situ hybridization. The complementary expression pattern of ntrk2b to bdnf suggests that ntrk2b is the key receptor, unlike its duplicate isoform ntrk2a. Two reverse genetics strategies, morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) and the TILLING mutant, were applied in this study. The loss or complete deletion of ntrk2b had no major effect on the viability, gross phenotype, or swimming behavior of zebrafish. A specific subset of the dopaminergic and serotonergic neuronal population was affected in the morphants and mutants. Downstream signaling transcripts such as bdnf, serta, th2, and tph2 were downregulated and could be rescued by overexpression of the full-length ntrk2b mRNA in the morphants. Pharmacological intervention with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, K252a, resulted in similar phenotypes. Overall, our results reveal a specific effect of ntrk2b on the two crucial aminergic systems involved in psychiatric disorders and provide an essential tool to study neurotrophin function in modulating neuronal plasticity in the central nervous system.\\n\\nSignificance StatementBrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor, tyrosine kinase (TrkB/NTRK2), play a major role in regulating the development and plasticity of neural circuits. Additionally, BDNF/TrkB signaling is involved in psychiatric disorders and antidepressant responses. This study presents the complementary gene expression pattern of TrkB and BDNF in zebrafish during the early larval stage and in the adult brain. Our results consistently indicate that BDNF/TrkB signaling has a significant role in the development and maintenance of dopaminergic and serotonergic neuronal populations. Therefore, the ntrk2b-deficient zebrafish model is well suited to studying psychiatric disorders attributed to a dysfunctional monoaminergic system, and could potentially be a valuable model for small molecule drug screening.",

Following a prepupal ecdysone pulse, the ecdysone receptor and mediator complex cause neuroblasts to shrink. Shrinking is followed by nuclear accumulation of Prospero and cell cycle exit. Only mushroom body (MB) neuroblasts escape early pupal termination. Here, we demonstrate that the opposing temporal gradients of Imp and Syp RNA-binding proteins that govern temporal fate also regulate neuroblast decommissioning. The Imp gradient declines slower in MB neuroblasts so they still express Imp when it is absent from others. The presence of Imp in MB neuroblasts prevents decommissioning partly through inhibiting the mediator complex. Moreover, a timely induction of Imp can protect many non-MB neuroblasts from aging. We also show that the increasing Syp gradient permits Prospero accumulation and neuroblast termination.
