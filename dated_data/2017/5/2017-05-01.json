    "abstract": "Identifying regions of the genome that are depleted of mutations can reveal potentially deleterious variants. Short tandem repeats (STRs), also known as microsatellites, are among the largest contributors of de novo mutations in humans and are implicated in a variety of human disorders. However, because of the challenges STRs pose to bioinformatics tools, per-locus studies of STR mutations have been limited to highly ascertained panels of several dozen loci. Here, we harnessed bioinformatics tools and a novel analytical framework to estimate mutation parameters for each STR in the human genome by correlating STR genotypes with local sequence heterozygosity. We applied our method to obtain robust estimates of the impact of local sequence features on mutation parameters and used this to create a framework for measuring constraint at STRs by comparing observed vs. expected mutation rates. Constraint scores identified known pathogenic variants with early onset effects. Our constraint metrics will provide a valuable tool for prioritizing pathogenic STRs in medical genetics studies.",

    "abstract": "One in five people with Down syndrome (DS) are born with an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), an incidence 2,000 times higher than in the euploid population. The genetic loci that contribute to this risk are poorly understood. In this study, we tested two hypotheses: 1) individuals with DS carrying chromosome 21 copy number variants (CNVs) that interrupt exons may be protected from AVSD, because these CNVs return AVSD susceptibility loci back to disomy, and 2) individuals with DS carrying chromosome 21 genes spanned by microduplications are at greater risk for AVSD because these microduplications boost the dosage of AVSD susceptibility loci beyond a tolerable threshold. We tested 198 case individuals with DS+AVSD and 211 control individuals with DS and a normal heart using a custom microarray with dense probes tiled on chromosome 21 for array CGH. We found that neither an individual chromosome 21 CNV nor any individual gene intersected by a CNV was associated with AVSD in DS. Burden analyses revealed that African American controls had more bases covered by rare deletions than did African American cases. Inversely, we found that Caucasian cases had more genes intersected by rare duplications than did Caucasian controls. Pathway analyses indicated copy number perturbations of genes involved in protein heterotrimerization and histone methylating proteins. Finally, we showed that previously DS+AVSD-associated common CNVs on chromosome 21 are likely false positives. This research adds to the swell of evidence indicating that DS-associated AVSD is similarly heterogeneous, as is AVSD in the euploid population.",

    "abstract": "Heavy metal contamination is a serious issue in many post-mining regions around the world. Kabwe town, Zambia, is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world, where high lead (Pb) levels have been reported in soils, plants, animals and human blood. Multidisciplinary approaches are critically needed to understand the current situation and to remediate the polluted area. In the current research, a large-scale preliminary field survey was performed to understand the current situation in Kabwe and to plan future mitigation approaches. Three aspects were mainly observed; 1) plant communities during the dry season in Kabwe city, 2) spectral images of the land surfaces in various locations in Kabwe and 3) Pb concentrations in soils and water. Overall, >15 different plant species were observed and many of them maintained their green colour even during the dry season. Some tree species, for example, Caesalpiniaceae and Fabaceae families may be utilised as phytostabilization approaches although their impacts on the soil Pb mobility should be further studied. For the spectral images, we used a handmade portable spectrometer, and our obtained spectral images showed typical curves observed from soils. These data may be used to understand the distribution of different soil types in this area, using aboveground images such as satellite images. For Pb concentrations in soils, extremely high total Pb levels (>1,000 ppm) was observed only within 2 km from the mining site. There was a weak but a positive correlation between the total and soluble Pb thus further study should also focus on the mobility of Pb from soils to plant ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of animal mating systems has changed dramatically with the advent of molecular methods to determine individuals reproductive success. But why are older behavioral descriptions and newer genetic descriptions of mating systems often seemingly inconsistent? We argue that a potentially important reason for such inconsistencies is a research trajectory rooted in early studies that were equivocal and overreaching, followed by studies that accepted earlier conclusions at face value and assumed, rather than tested, key ideas about animal mating systems. We illustrate our argument using Anolis lizards, whose social behavior has been studied for nearly a century. A dominant view emerging from this behavioral research was that anoles display strict territorial polygyny, where females mate with just the one male in whose territory they reside. However, all genetic evidence suggests that females frequently mate with multiple males. We trace this mismatch to early studies that concluded that anoles are territorial based on limited data. Subsequent research assumed territoriality implicitly or explicitly, resulting in studies that were unlikely to uncover or consider important any evidence of anoles departures from strict territorial polygyny. Thus, descriptions of anole behavior were largely led away from predicting a pattern of female multiple mating. We end by considering the broader implications of such erratic trajectories for the study of animal mating systems, and posit that precise definitions, renewed attention to natural history, and explicitly questioning assumptions made while collecting behavioral observations will allow us to move towards a fuller understanding of animal mating systems.",

    "abstract": "Growing cells coordinate protein translation with metabolic rates. Central to this coordination is ribosome production. Ribosomes drive cell growth, but translation of ribosomal proteins competes with production of other proteins. Theory shows that cell growth is maximized when all expressed ribosomes are constantly translating. To examine whether budding yeast function at this limit of full ribosomal usage, we profiled the proteomes of cells growing in different environments. We find that cells produce an excess of ribosomal proteins, amounting to a constant {approx}8% of the proteome. Accordingly, {approx}25% of ribosomal proteins expressed in rapidly growing cells do not contribute to translation. This fraction increases as growth rate decreases. These excess ribosomal proteins are employed during nutrient upshift or when forcing unneeded expression. We suggest that steadily growing cells prepare for conditions that demand increased translation by producing excess ribosomes, at the expense of lower steady-state growth rate.",

    "abstract": "Morphological and archaeological studies suggest that the Americas were first occupied by non-Mongoloids with Australo-Melanesian traits (the Paleoamerican model), which was subsequently followed by Southwest Europeans coming in along the pack ice of the North Atlantic Ocean (the Solutrean model) and by East Asians and Siberians arriving by way of the Bering Strait. Past DNA studies, however, have produced different accounts. With a better understanding of genetic diversity, we have now reinterpreted public DNA data. Consistent with our recent finding of a close relationship between South Pacific populations and Denisovans or Neanderthals who were archaic Africans with Eurasian admixtures, the [~]9500 year old Kennewick Man skeleton with Australo-Melanesian affinity from North America was about equally related to Europeans and Africans, least related to East Asians among present-day people, and most related to the [~]42000 year old Neanderthal Mezmaiskaya-2 from Adygea Russia among ancient Eurasian DNAs. The [~]12700 year old Anzick-1 of the Clovis culture was most related to the [~]18720 year old El Miron of the Magdalenian culture in Spain among ancient DNAs. Amerindian mtDNA haplotypes, unlike their Eurasian sister haplotypes, share informative SNPs with Australo-Melanesians, Africans, or Neanderthals.

    "abstract": "Plant responses to the environment are shaped by external stimuli and internal signaling pathways. In both the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and crop species, circadian clock factors have been identified as critical for growth, flowering and circadian rhythms. Outside of A. thaliana, however, little is known about the molecular function of clock genes. Therefore, we sought to compare the function of Brachypodium distachyon and Seteria viridis orthologs of EARLY FLOWERING3, a key clock gene in A. thaliana. To identify both cycling genes and putative ELF3 functional orthologs in S. viridis, a circadian RNA-seq dataset and online query tool (Diel Explorer) was generated as a community resource to explore expression profiles of Setaria genes under constant conditions after photo- or thermo-entrainment. The function of ELF3 orthologs from A. thaliana, B. distachyon, and S. viridis were tested for complementation of an elf3 mutation in A. thaliana. Despite comparably low sequence identity versus AtELF3 (less than 37%), both monocot orthologs were capable of rescuing hypocotyl elongation, flowering time and arrhythmic clock phenotypes. Molecular analysis using affinity purification and mass spectrometry to compare physical interactions also found that BdELF3 and SvELF3 could be integrated into similar complexes and networks as AtELF3, including forming a composite evening complex. Thus, we find that, despite 180 million years of separation, BdELF3 and SvELF3 can functionally complement loss of ELF3 at the molecular and physiological level.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryOrthologs of a key circadian clock component ELF3 from grasses functionally complement the Arabidopsis counterpart at the molecular and physiological level, in spite of high sequence divergence.",

TepP is the most abundant effector protein secreted early in infection but its molecular function is poorly understood. In this report, we provide evidence that TepP is important for bacterial replication in cervical epithelial cells, the activation of Type I IFN genes, and the recruitment of Class I phosphoinositide 3 kinases (PI3K) and the signaling adaptor protein CrkL to nascent pathogen-containing vacuoles (inclusions). We also show that TepP is a target of tyrosine phosphorylation by Src kinases but these modifications do not appear to influence the recruitment of PI3K or CrkL. The translocation of TepP correlated with an increase in the intracellular pools of phosphoinositide 3,4,5 triphosphate but not the activation of the pro-survival kinase Akt, suggesting that TepP-mediated activation of PI3K is spatially restricted to early inclusions. Furthermore, we linked PI3K activity to the dampening of transcription of Type I IFN induced genes early in infection. Overall, these findings indicate that TepP can modulate cell signaling and potentially membrane trafficking events by spatially restricted activation of PI3K.",

    "abstract": "The relevance of interspecific resource competition in the context of community assembly by herbivorous insects is a well-known topic in ecology. Most previous studies focused on local species assemblies, that shared host plants. Few studies evaluated species pairs within a single taxon when investigating the effects of host plant sharing at the regional scale. Herein, we explore the effect of plant sharing on the geographical co-occurrence patterns of 232 butterflies distributed across the Japanese archipelago; we use two spatial scales (10 x 10 km and 1 x 1 km grids) to this end. We considered that we might encounter one of two predictable patterns in terms of the relationship between co-occurrence and host sharing among butterflies. On the one hand, host sharing might promote distributional exclusivity attributable to interspecific resource competition. On the other hand, sharing of host plants may promote co-occurrence attributable to filtering by resource niche. At both grid scales, we found significant negative correlations between host use similarity and distributional exclusivity. Our results support the hypothesis that the butterfly co-occurrence pattern across the Japanese archipelago is better explained by filtering via resource niche rather than interspecific resource competition.",

These viruses are composed by multiple DNA circles that are packaged into infective particles and injected together with wasp's eggs during parasitization. One of the viral segments of Cotesia vestalis bracovirus contains a gene that has been previously described as a helicase of unknown origin. Here we demonstrate that this gene is a Rep/Helicase from an intact Helitron transposable element that covers the viral segment almost entirely. We also provide evidence that this element underwent at least two horizontal transfers, which appear to have occurred consecutively: first from a Drosophila host ancestor to the genome of the parasitoid wasp Cotesia vestalis and its bracovirus, and then from C. vestalis to a lepidopteran host (Bombyx mori). Our results reinforce the idea of parasitoid wasps as frequent agents of horizontal transfers in eukaryotes. Additionally, this Helitron-bracovirus segment is the first example of a transposable element that effectively became a whole viral circle.",

The configuration termed as Omnipresent Localisation Microscope (OLM), is an extension of Single Molecule Localisation Microscopy (SMLM) techniques and allows single molecules to be switched on and off (blinking), detected and localised. The use of a short burst of deep blue excitation can be further used to reactivate the blinking, once the blinking process has slowed or stopped. A resolution of 90 nm is achieved on test specimens (mouse and amphibian meiotic chromosomes). Finally, for the first time, we demonstrate that STED and OLM can be performed on the same biological sample using a simple imaging buffer. It is hoped that such a correlative imaging will provide a basis for a further enhanced resolution.\\n\\nScope of the findingsDespite ten years of development, superresolution microscopy is still limited to relatively few microscopy and optics groups. This is mainly due to the significant cost of the superresolution microscopes which require high-quality lasers, high NA objective lens, a very sensitive camera, a highly precise microscope stage, and a complex post-acquisition data reconstruction and analysis. We present results that demonstrate the possibility to obtain nanoscale resolution images using a conventional microscope and an incoherent light source. We show an easyto-follow protocol that every biologist can implement in the laboratory. We hope that this finding will help any scientist to generate high-density super-resolution images even with limited budget.

It remains elusive how conformational changes of the AAA-ATPase unfoldase in the regulatory particle (RP) control the gating of substrate-translocation channel to the proteolytic chamber of the core particle (CP). Here we report three alternative states of the ATP-{gamma}S-bound human proteasome, in which the CP gate is asymmetrically open, visualized by cryo-EM at near-atomic resolutions. Only four nucleotides are stably bound to the AAA-ATPase ring in the open-gate states. Concerted nucleotide exchange gives rise to a back-and-forth wobbling motion of the AAA-ATPase channel, coincident with remarkable transitions of their pore loops between the spiral staircase and saddle-shaped circle topologies. Gate opening in the CP is thus controlled with nucleotide-driven remodeling of the AAA-ATPase unfoldase. These findings demonstrate an elegant mechanism of allosteric coordination among sub-machines within the holoenzyme that is crucial for substrate translocation.",

    "abstract": "Cancers arise as the result of somatically acquired changes in the DNA of cancer cells. However, in addition to the mutations that confer a growth advantage, cancer genomes accumulate a large number of somatic mutations resulting from normal DNA damage and repair processes as well as mutations triggered by carcinogenic exposures or cancer related aberrations of DNA mainte-nance machinery. These mutagenic processes often produce characteristic mutational patterns called mutational signatures. Decomposition of cancers mutation catalog into mutations consistent with such signatures can provide valuable information about cancer etiology. However, the results from di[ff]erent decomposition methods are not always consistent. Hence, one needs to not only be able to decompose a patients mutational profile into signatures but also to establish the accuracy of such decomposition. We proposed two complementary ways of measuring confidence and stability of decomposition results and applied them to analyze mutational signatures in breast cancer genomes. We identified very stable and highly unstable signatures, as well as signatures that have been missed altogether. We also provided additional support for the novel signatures. Our results emphasize the importance of assessing the confidence and stability of inferred signature contributions. All tools developed in this paper have been implemented in an R package, called SignatureEstimation, which is available from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Przytycka/index.cgi#signatureestimation.",

The cell arrangement patterns are diverse, even among close relatives. We evaluated how the diversity and robustness are achieved in developing embryos. We succeeded in reproducing different patterns of cell arrangements observed in various nematode species using Caenorhabditis elegans embryos by changing the eggshell shapes. This implies that the diversity of cell arrangements can be explained by differences in a shape parameter. Additionally, we found that the cell arrangement was robust against eggshell deformation. Computational modeling revealed that, in addition to repulsion forces, attraction forces are sufficient for this robustness. Genetic perturbation experiments demonstrated that attraction forces derived from cell adhesion are necessary for the robustness. The proposed model accounts for both diversity and robustness of cell arrangements and contributes to our understanding of how diversity and robustness are achieved in developing embryos.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factors (TF) which regulate gene expressions are key determinants of cellular phenotypes. Reconstructing large-scale genome-wide networks which capture the influence of TFs on target genes are essential for understanding and accurate modelling of living cells. We propose RGBM: a gene regulatory network (GRN) inference algorithm, which can handle data from heterogeneous information sources including dynamic time-series, gene knockout, gene knockdown, DNA microarrays and RNA-Seq expression profiles. RGBM allows to use an a priori mechanistic of active biding network consisting of TFs and corresponding target genes. RGBM is evaluated on the DREAM challenge datasets where it surpasses the winners of the competitions and other established methods for two evaluation metrics by about 10-15%.\\n\\nWe use RGBM to identify the main regulators of the molecular subtypes of brain tumors. Our analysis reveals the identity and corresponding biological activities of the master regulators driving transformation of the G-CIMP-high into the G-CIMP-low subtype of glioma and PA-like into LGm6-GBM, thus, providing a clue to the yet undetermined nature of the transcriptional events driving the evolution among these novel glioma subtypes.\\n\\nRGBM is available for download on CRAN at https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/RGBM/index.html",

    "abstract": "Depression and anxiety disorders are the first and sixth leading cause of disability worldwide according to latest reports from the World Health Organization. Despite their high prevalence and the significant disability resulted, there are limited advances in new drug development. On the other hand, the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has greatly improved our understanding of the genetic basis underlying psychiatric disorders.\\n\\nIn this work we employed gene-set analyses of GWAS summary statistics for drug repositioning. We explored five related GWAS datasets, including two on major depressive disorder (MDD-PGC and MDD-CONVERGE, with the latter focusing on severe melancholic depression), one on anxiety disorders, and two on depressive symptoms and neuroticism in the population. We extracted gene-sets associated with each drug from DSigDB and examined their association with each GWAS phenotype. We also performed repositioning analyses on meta-analyzed GWAS data, integrating evidence from all related phenotypes.\\n\\nImportantly, we showed that the repositioning hits are generally enriched for known psychiatric medications or those considered in clinical trials, except for MDD-PGC. Enrichment was seen for antidepressants and anxiolytics but also for antipsychotics. We also revealed new candidates or drug classes for repositioning, some of which were supported by experimental or clinical studies. For example, the top repositioning hit using meta-analyzed p-values was fendiline, which was shown to produce antidepressant-like effects in mouse models by inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase and reducing ceramide levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that human genomic data such as GWAS are useful in guiding drug discoveries for depression and anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "Sheep are a key source of meat, milk and fibre for the global livestock sector, and an important biomedical model. Global analysis of gene expression across multiple tissues has aided genome annotation and supported functional annotation of mammalian genes. We present a large-scale RNA-Seq dataset representing all the major organ systems from adult sheep and from several juvenile, neonatal and prenatal developmental time points. The Ovis aries reference genome (Oar v3.1) includes 27,504 genes (20,921 protein coding), of which 25,350 (19,921 protein coding) had detectable expression in at least one tissue in the sheep gene expression atlas dataset. Network-based cluster analysis of this dataset grouped genes according to their expression pattern. The principle of  guilt by association was used to infer the function of uncharacterised genes from their co-expression with genes of known function. We describe the overall transcriptional signatures present in the sheep gene expression atlas and assign those signatures, where possible, to specific cell populations or pathways. The findings are related to innate immunity by focusing on clusters with an immune signature, and to the advantages of cross-breeding by examining the patterns of genes exhibiting the greatest expression differences between purebred and crossbred animals. This high-resolution gene expression atlas for sheep is, to our knowledge, the largest transcriptomic dataset from any livestock species to date. It provides a resource to improve the annotation of the current reference genome for sheep, presenting a model transcriptome for ruminants and insight into gene, cell and tissue function at multiple developmental stages.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySheep are ruminant mammals kept as livestock for the production of meat, milk and wool in agricultural industries across the globe. Genetic and genomic information can be used to improve production traits such as disease resiliance. The sheep genome is however missing important information relating to gene function and many genes, which may be important for productivity, have no informative gene name. This can be remedied using RNA-Sequencing to generate a global expression profile of all protein-coding genes, across multiple organ systems and developmental stages. Clustering genes based on their expression profile across tissues and cells allows us to assign function to those genes. If for example a gene with no informative gene name is expressed in macrophages and is found within a cluster of known macrophage related genes it is likely to be involved in macrophage function and play a role in innate immunity. This information improves the quality of the reference genome and provides insight into biological processes underlying the complex traits that influence the productivity of sheep and other livestock species.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian function is directly correlated with survival of the primordial follicle reserve. Women diagnosed with cancer have a primary imperative of treating the cancer, but since the resting oocytes are hypersensitive to the DNA-damaging modalities of certain chemo- and radiotherapeutic regimens, such patients face the collateral outcome of premature loss of fertility and ovarian endocrine function. Current options for fertility preservation primarily include collection and cryopreservation of oocytes or in vitro fertilized oocytes, but this necessitates a delay in cancer treatment and additional assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures. Here, we evaluated the potential of pharmacological preservation of ovarian function by inhibiting a key element of the oocyte DNA damage checkpoint response, checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2; CHEK2). Whereas non-lethal doses of ionizing radiation (IR) eradicate immature oocytes in wild type mice, irradiated Chk2-/- mice retain their oocytes and thus, fertility. Using an ovarian culture system, we show that transient administration of the CHK2 inhibitor 2-(4-(4-Chlorophenoxy)phenyl)-1H-benzimidazole-5-carboxamide-hydrate (\\\"CHK2iII\\\") blocked activation of the CHK2 targets TRP53 and TRP63 in response to sterilizing doses of IR, and preserved oocyte viability. After transfer into sterilized host females, these ovaries proved functional and readily yielded normal offspring. These results provide experimental evidence that chemical inhibition of CHK2 is a potentially valid treatment for preserving fertility and ovarian endocrine function of women exposed to DNA-damaging cancer therapies such as IR.\\n\\nSummary sentenceOocytes, which are highly sensitive to DNA damage caused by certain cancer treatments, can be protected from radiation-induced death by an inhibitor of the checkpoint protein CHK2.",

    "abstract": "Tendon injuries heal via scar tissue rather than regeneration. This healing response forms adhesions between the flexor tendons in the hand and surrounding tissues, resulting in impaired range of motion and hand function. Mechanistically, inflammation has been strongly linked to adhesion formation, and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is associated with both adhesion formation and tendinopathy. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that deletion of the PGE2 receptor EP4 in S100a4-lineage cells would decrease adhesion formation. S100a4-Cre; EP4flox/flox (EP4cKOS100a4) repairs healed with improved gliding function at day 14, followed by impaired gliding at day 28, relative to wild type. Interestingly, EP4cKOS100a4 resulted in only transient deletion of EP4, suggesting up-regulation of EP4 in an alternative cell population in these mice. Loss of EP4 in Scleraxis-lineage cells did not alter gliding function, suggesting that Scx-lineage cells are not the predominant EP4 expressing population. In contrast, a dramatic increase in -SMA+, EP4+ double-positive cells were observed in EP4cKOS100a4 suggesting that EP4cKOS100a4 repairs heal with increased infiltration of EP4 expressing -SMA myofibroblasts, identifying a potential mechanism of late up-regulation of EP4 and impaired gliding function in EP4cKOS100a4 tendon repairs.",

    "abstract": "The relative contributions of additive versus non-additive interactions in the regulation of complex traits remains controversial. This may be in part because large-scale epistasis has traditionally been difficult to detect in complex, multi-cellular organisms. We hypothesized that it would be easier to detect interactions using mouse chromosome substitution strains that simultaneously incorporate allelic variation in many genes on a controlled genetic background. Analyzing metabolic traits and gene expression levels in the offspring of a series of crosses between mouse chromosome substitution strains demonstrated that inter-chromosomal epistasis was a dominant feature of these complex traits. Epistasis typically accounted for a larger proportion of the heritable effects than those due solely to additive effects. These epistatic interactions typically resulted in trait values returning to the levels of the parental CSS host strain. Due to the large epistatic effects, analyses that did not account for interactions consistently underestimated the true effect sizes due to allelic variation or failed to detect the loci controlling trait variation. These studies demonstrate that epistatic interactions are a common feature of complex traits and thus identifying these interactions is key to understanding their genetic regulation.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe biological importance of changes in gene and transcript expression is well recognised and is reflected by the wide variety of tools available to characterise these changes. Regulation via Differential Transcript Usage (DTU) is emerging as an important phenomenon. Several tools exist for the detection of DTU from read alignment or assembly data, but options for detection of DTU from alignment-free quantifications are limited.\\n\\nResultsWe present an R package named RATs - (Relative Abundance of Transcripts) - that identifies DTU transcriptome-wide directly from transcript abundance estimations. RATs is agnostic to quantification methods and exploits bootstrapped quantifications, if available, to inform the significance of detected DTU events. RATs contextualises the DTU results and shows good False Discovery performance (median FDR [&le;]0.05) at all replication levels. We applied RATs to a human RNA-seq dataset associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with three DTU events validated by qRT-PCR. RATs found all three genes exhibited statistically significant changes in isoform proportions based on Ensembl v60 annotations, but the DTU for two were not reliably reproduced across bootstrapped quantifications. RATs also identified 500 novel DTU events that are enriched for eleven GO terms related to regulation of the response to stimulus, regulation of immune system processes, and symbiosis/parasitism. Repeating this analysis with the Ensembl v87 annotation showed the isoform abundance profiles of two of the three validated DTU genes changed radically. RATs identified 414 novel DTU events that are enriched for five GO terms, none of which are in common with those previously identified. Only 141 of the DTU evens are common between the two analyses, and only 8 are among the 248 reported by the original study. Furthermore, the original qRT-PCR probes no longer match uniquely to their original transcripts, calling into question the interpretation of these data. We suggest parallel full-length isoform sequencing, annotation pre-filtering and sequencing of the transcripts captured by qRT-PCR primers as possible ways to improve the validation of RNA-seq results in future experiments.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe package is available through Github at https://github.com/bartongroup/Rats.",

    "abstract": "Ecological phenomena are often measured in the form of count data. These data can be analyzed using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) when observations are correlated in ways that require random effects. However, count data are often zero-inflated, containing more zeros than would be expected from the standard error distributions used in GLMMs, e.g., parasite counts may be exactly zero for hosts with effective immune defenses but vary according to a negative binomial distribution for non-resistant hosts.\\n\\nWe present a new R package, glmmTMB, that increases the range of models that can easily be fitted to count data using maximum likelihood estimation. The interface was developed to be familiar to users of the lme4 R package, a common tool for fitting GLMMs. To maximize speed and flexibility, estimation is done using Template Model Builder (TMB), utilizing automatic differentiation to estimate model gradients and the Laplace approximation for handling random effects. We demonstrate glmmTMB and compare it to other available methods using two ecological case studies.\\n\\nIn general, glmmTMB is more flexible than other packages available for estimating zero-inflated models via maximum likelihood estimation and is faster than packages that use Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for estimation; it is also more flexible for zero-inflated modelling than INLA, but speed comparisons vary with model and data structure. Our package can be used to fit GLMs and GLMMs with or without zero-inflation as well as hurdle models. By allowing ecologists to quickly estimate a wide variety of models using a single package, glmmTMB makes it easier to find appropriate models and test hypotheses to describe ecological processes.",

The performance of 9 mutual information estimation methods are compared using three popular network inference algorithms: CLR, MRNET and ARACNE. The performance of the estimators is compared on one synthetic and two real datasets. For estimators that discretise data, the effect of discretisation parameters are also studied in detail. Implementations of 5 estimators are provided in parallelised C++ with an R interface. These are faster than alternative implementations, with reductions in computation time up to a factor of 3,500.\\n\\nResultsThe B-spline estimator consistently performs well on real and synthetic datasets. CLR was found to be the best performing inference algorithm, corroborating previous results indicating that it is the state of the art mutual inference algorithm. It is also found to be robust to the mutual information estimation method and their parameters. Furthermore, when using an estimator that discretises expression data, using N1/3 bins for N samples gives the most accurate inferred network. This contradicts previous findings that suggested using N 1/2 bins.",

FORKS, which is a generic method, can be applied to both single-cell and bulk differentiation data. It is a semi-supervised approach, in that it requires the user to specify the starting point of the time course. We systematically benchmarked FORKS and eight other pseudo-time estimation algorithms on six benchmark datasets, and found it to be more accurate, more reproducible, and more memory-efficient than existing methods for pseudo-temporal ordering. Another major advantage of our approach is its robustness - FORKS can be used with default parameter settings on a wide range of datasets.",

We have recently reported that HPV E7-dependent promoter hypermethylation leads to downregulation of the chemokine CXCL14 and suppression of antitumor immune responses. To investigate the extent of gene expression dysregulated by HPV E7-induced DNA methylation, we analyzed parallel global gene expression and DNA methylation using normal immortalized keratinocyte lines, NIKS, NIKS-16, NIKS-18, and NIKS-16{Delta}E7. We show that expression of the MHC class I genes is downregulated in HPV-positive keratinocytes in an E7-dependent manner. Methylome analysis revealed hypermethylation at a distal CpG island (CGI) near the HLA-E gene in NIKS-16 cells compared to either NIKS cells or NIKS-16{Delta}E7 cells, which lack E7 expression. The HLA-E CGI functions as an active promoter element which is dramatically repressed by DNA methylation. HLA-E protein expression on cell surface is downregulated by high-risk HPV16 and HPV18 E7 expression, but not by low-risk HPV6 and HPV11 E7 expression. Conversely, demethylation at the HLA-E CGI restores HLA-E protein expression in HPV-positive keratinocytes. Because HLA-E plays an important role in antiviral immunity by regulating natural killer and CD8+ T cells, epigenetic downregulation of HLA-E by high-risk HPV E7 may contribute to virus-induced immune evasion during HPV persistence.",

    "abstract": "Tracking the coordinated activity of cellular events through volumes of intact tissue is a major challenge in biology that has inspired significant technological innovation. Yet scanless measurement of the high-speed activity of individual neurons across three dimensions in scattering mammalian tissue remains an open problem. Here we develop and validate a computational imaging approach (SWIFT) that integrates high-dimensional, structured statistics with light field microscopy to allow the synchronous acquisition of single-neuron resolution activity throughout intact tissue volumes as fast as a camera can capture images (currently up to 100 Hz at full camera resolution), attaining rates needed to keep pace with emerging fast calcium and voltage sensors. We demonstrate that this large field-of-view, single-snapshot volume acquisition method--which requires only a simple and inexpensive modification to a standard fluorescence microscope--enables scanless capture of coordinated activity patterns throughout mammalian neural volumes. Further, the volumetric nature of SWIFT also allows fast in vivo imaging, motion correction, and cell identification throughout curved subcortical structures like the dorsal hippocampus, where cellular-resolution dynamics spanning hippocampal subfields can be simultaneously observed during a virtual context learning task in a behaving animal. SWIFTs ability to rapidly and easily record from volumes of many cells across layers opens the door to widespread identification of dynamical motifs and timing dependencies among coordinated cell assemblies during adaptive, modulated, or maladaptive physiological processes in neural systems.",

    "abstract": "Repeated stimulus presentation leads to complex changes in cortical neuron response properties, commonly known as repetition suppression or stimulus-specific adaptation. Circuit-based models of repetition suppression provide a framework for investigating patterns of repetition effects that propagate through cortical hierarchies. To further develop such models it is critical to determine whether (and if so, when) repetition effects are modulated by top-down influences, such as those related to perceptual expectation. We investigated this by presenting pairs of repeated and alternating face images, and orthogonally manipulating expectations regarding the likelihood of stimulus repetition. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from n=39 healthy adults, to map the spatiotemporal progression of stimulus repetition and expectation effects, and interactions between these factors, using mass univariate analyses. We also tested whether the ability to predict unrepeated (compared to repeated) face identities could influence the magnitude of observed repetition effects, by presenting separate blocks with predictable and unpredictable alternating faces. Multiple repetition and expectation effects were identified between 99-800ms from stimulus onset, which did not statistically interact at any point. Repetition effects in blocks with predictable alternating faces were smaller than in unpredictable alternating face blocks between 117-179ms and 506-652ms, and larger between 246-428ms. ERP repetition effects appear not to be modulated by perceptual expectations, supporting separate mechanisms for repetition and expectation suppression. However, previous studies that aimed to test for repetition effects, in which the repeated (but not unrepeated) stimulus was predictable, are likely to have conflated repetition and stimulus predictability effects.\\n\\nHighlights- ERP face image repetition effects were apparent between 99-800ms from stimulus onset\\n- Expectations of stimulus image properties did not modulate face repetition effects\\n- The predictability of unrepeated stimuli influenced repetition effect magnitudes",

    "abstract": "An emerging discovery in phylogenomics is that interspecific gene flow has played a major role in the evolution of many different organisms. To what extent is the Tree of Life not truly a tree reflecting strict \\\"vertical\\\" divergence, but rather a more general graph structure known as a phylogenetic network which also captures \\\"horizontal\\\"gene flow? The answer to this fundamental question not only depends upon densely sampled and divergent genomic sequence data, but also compu-tational methods which are capable of accurately and efficiently inferring phylogenetic networks from large-scale genomic sequence datasets. Re-cent methodological advances have attempted to address this gap. How-ever, in the 2016 performance study of Hejase and Liu, state-of-the-art methods fell well short of the scalability requirements of existing phy-logenomic studies.\\n\\nThe methodological gap remains: how can phylogenetic networks be ac-curately and efficiently inferred using genomic sequence data involving many dozens or hundreds of taxa? In this study, we address this gap by proposing a new phylogenetic divide-and-conquer method which we call FastNet.

    "abstract": "SncRNA-Seq has become a routine for sncRNA profiling; however, software packages currently available are either exclusively for miRNA or piRNA annotation (e.g., miRDeep, miRanalyzer, Shortstack, PIANO), or for direct mapping of the sequence reads to the genome (e.g., Bowtie 2, SOAP and BWA), which tend to generate inaccurate counting due to repetitive matches to the genome or sncRNA homologs. Moreover, novel sncRNA variants in the sequencing reads, including those bearing small overhangs or internal insertions, deletions or mutations, are totally excluded from counting by these algorithms, leading to potential quantification bias. To overcome these problems, a comprehensive software package that can annotate all known small RNA species with adjustable tolerance towards small mismatches is needed. AASRA is based on our unique anchor alignment algorithm, which not only avoids repetitive or ambiguous counting, but also distinguishes mature miRNA from precursor miRNA reads. Compared to all existing pipelines for small RNA annotation, AASRA is superior in the following aspects: 1) AASRA can annotate all known sncRNA species simultaneously with the capability of distinguishing mature and precursor miRNAs; 2) AASRA can identify and allow for inclusion of sncRNA variants with small overhangs and/or internal insertions/deletions into the final counts; 3) AASRA is the fastest among all small RNA annotation pipelines tested. AASRA represents an all-in-one sncRNA annotation pipeline, which allows for high-speed, simultaneous annotation of all known sncRNA species with the capability to distinguish mature from precursor miRNAs, and to identify novel sncRNA variants in the sncRNA-Seq sequencing reads.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe AASRA software is freely available at https://github.com/biogramming/AASRA.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPiwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are sRNAs that have a distinct biogenesis and molecular function from siRNAs and miRNAs. The piRNA pathway is well-conserved and shown to play an important role in the regulatory capacity of germline cells in Metazoans. Significant subsets of piRNAs are generated from discrete genomic loci referred to as piRNA clusters. Given that the contents of piRNA clusters dictate the target specificity of primary piRNAs, and therefore the generation of secondary piRNAs, they are of great significance when considering transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation on a genomic scale. A quantitative comparison of top piRNA cluster composition can provide further insight into piRNA cluster biogenesis and function.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed software for general use, piClusterBusteR, which performs nested annotation of piRNA cluster contents to ensure high-quality characterization, provides a quantitative representation of piRNA cluster composition by feature, and makes available annotated and unannotated piRNA cluster sequences that can be utilized for downstream analysis. The data necessary to run piClusterBusteR and the skills necessary to execute this software on any species of interest are not overly burdensome for biological researchers.\\n\\npiClusterBusteR has been utilized to compare the composition of top piRNA generating loci amongst 13 Metazoan species. Characterization and quantification of cluster composition allows for comparison within piRNA clusters of the same species and between piRNA clusters of different species.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have developed a tool that accurately, automatically, and efficiently describes the contents of piRNA clusters in any biological system that utilizes the piRNA pathway. The results from piClusterBusteR have provided an in-depth description and comparison of the architecture of top piRNA clusters within and between 13 species, as well as a description of annotated and unannotated sequences from top piRNA cluster loci in these Metazoans.\\n\\npiClusterBusteR is available for download on GitHub: https://github.com/pschreiner/piClusterBuster",

We designed an in vitro myeloid differentiation model to analyze the genetic and developmental contribution to methylome dynamics using whole-genome bisulfide sequencing and transcriptome sequencing. Using a recursive partitioning approach, we identified 34,502 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with genetic background and/or developmental stimuli. Specifically, 23,792 DMRs (69%) were significantly associated with inter-individual variations, of which 82% were associated with genetic polymorphisms in cis.

Our study presents a novel analytical approach to determine the bona fide genetic contribution embedded in outlier patterns of CpG-SNPs in individual methylomes.

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii is the causative agent of cryptococcal meningitis, a significant source of mortality in immunocompromised individuals, typically HIV/AIDS patients from developing countries. Despite the worldwide emergence of this ubiquitous infection, little is known about the global molecular epidemiology of this fungal pathogen. Here we sequence the genomes of 188 diverse isolates and characterized the major subdivisions, their relative diversity and the level of genetic exchange between them. While most isolates of C. neoformans var. grubii belong to one of three major lineages (VNI, VNII, and VNB), some haploid isolates show hybrid ancestry including some that appear to have recently interbred, based on the detection of large blocks of each ancestry across each chromosome. Many isolates display evidence of aneuploidy, which was detected for all chromosomes. In diploid isolates of C. neoformans var. grubii (serotype A/A) and of hybrids with C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotype A/D) such aneuploidies have resulted in loss of heterozygosity, where a chromosomal region is represented by the genotype of only one parental isolate. Phylogenetic and population genomic analyses of isolates from Brazil revealed that the previously  African VNB lineage occurs naturally in the South American environment. This suggests migration of the VNB lineage between Africa and South America prior to its diversification, supported by finding ancestral recombination events between isolates from different lineages and regions. The results provide evidence of substantial population structure, with all lineages showing multi-continental distributions demonstrating the highly dispersive nature of this pathogen.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCryptococcus neoformans var. grubii is a human fungal pathogen of immunocompromised individuals that has global clinical impact, causing half a million deaths per year. Substantial genetic substructure exists for this pathogen, with two lineages found globally (VNI, VNII) whereas a third has appeared confined to sub-Saharan Africa (VNB). Here, we utilized genome sequencing of a large set of global isolates to examine the genetic diversity, hybridization, and biogeography of these lineages. We found that while the three major lineages are well separated, recombination between the lineages has occurred, notably resulting in hybrid isolates with segmented ancestry across the genome. In addition, we showed that isolates from South America are placed within the VNB lineage, formerly thought to be confined to Africa, and that there is phylogenetic separation between these geographies that substantially expands the diversity of these lineages. Our findings provide a new framework for further studies of the dynamics of natural populations of C. neoformans var. grubii.",

    "abstract": "The attribution of incentive salience to reward-paired cues is dependent on dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core. These dopamine signals conform to traditional reward-prediction error signals and have been shown to diminish with time. Here we examined if the diminishing dopamine signal in the nucleus accumbens core has functional implications for the expression of sign-tracking, a Pavlovian conditioned response indicative of the attribution of incentive salience to reward-paired cues. Food-restricted male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained in a Pavlovian paradigm in which an insertable lever predicted delivery of food reward in a nearby food cup. After 7 or 14 training sessions, rats received infusions of saline, the dopamine antagonist flupenthixol (100 mM), or the GABA agonists baclofen and muscimol (0.5 mM baclofen/0.05 mM muscimol) into the nucleus accumbens core or the dorsal lateral striatum. Dopamine antagonism within the nucleus accumbens core attenuated sign-tracking, whereas reversible inactivation did not affect sign-tracking but increased non-specific food cup checking behaviors. Neither drug in the dorsal lateral striatum affected sign-tracking behavior. Critically, extended training did not alter these effects. Though extended experience with an incentive stimulus may reduce cue-evoked dopamine in the nucleus accumbens core, this does not alter the function of dopamine in this region to promote Pavlovian cue approach nor result in the recruitment of dorsal lateral striatal systems for this behavior. These data support the notion that dopamine within the mesoaccumbal system, but not the nigrostriatal system, contributes critically to incentive motivational processes independent of the length of training.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "If the brain abstractly represents probability distributions as knowledge, then the modality of a decision, e.g. movement vs perception, should not matter. If on the other hand, learned representations are policies, they may be specific to the task where learning takes place. Here, we test this by asking if a learned spatial prior generalizes from a sensorimotor estimation task to a two-alternative-forced choice (2-Afc) perceptual comparison task. A model and simulation-based analysis revealed that while participants learn the experimentally-imposed prior distribution in the sensorimotor estimation task, measured priors are consistently broader than expected in the 2-Afc task. That the prior does not fully generalize suggests that sensorimotor priors strongly resemble policies. In disagreement with standard Bayesian thought, the modality of the decision has a strong influence on the implied prior distribution.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYWe do not know if the brain represents abstract and generalizable knowledge or task-specific policies that map internal states to actions. We find that learning in a sensorimotor task does not generalize strongly to a perceptual task, suggesting that humans learned policies and did not truly acquire knowledge. Priors differ across tasks, thus casting doubt on the central tenet of may Bayesian models, that the brains representation of the world is built on generalizable knowledge.",

Reproducibility was evaluated from structure detectability, variability of DTI measures using the coefficient of variation (CV), image correlation and structural similarity across repeated scans for six selected structures. The effect of age, scanner type, presence of pathology was determined using Wilcoxon rank sum test.\\n\\nWhite matter structures were detectable in the following percentage of fetuses in at least two of the three repeated scans: corpus callosum genu 76%, splenium 64%, internal capsule, posterior limb 60%, brainstem fibers 40% and temporooccipital association pathways 60%. The mean CV of DTI metrics ranged between 3% and 14.6% and we measured higher reproducibility in fetuses with normal brain development.

Structures on 3.0 T had higher variability both with- and without motion correction.\\n\\nFetal DTI is reproducible for projection and commissural bundles during mid-gestation, however, in 16-30% of the cases, data were corrupted by artifacts, resulting in impaired detection of white matter structures. To achieve robust results for the quantitative analysis of diffusivity and anisotropy values, fetal-specific image processing is recommended and repeated DTI is needed to ensure the detectability of fiber pathways.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

However, measuring genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions remains a progress bottleneck. Here we describe strategies for identifying shape, color and ionomic indicators of plant nitrogen use efficiency. We subjected a panel of 30 genetically diverse sorghum genotypes to a spectrum of nitrogen deprivation and measured responses using high-throughput phenotyping technology followed by ionomic profiling. Responses were quantified using shape (16 measurable outputs), color (hue and intensity) and ionome (18 elements). We measured the speed at which specific genotypes respond to environmental conditions, both in terms of biomass and color changes, and identified individual genotypes that perform most favorably. With this analysis we present a novel approach to quantifying color-based stress indicators over time. Additionally, ionomic profiling was conducted as an independent, low cost and high throughput option for characterizing G x E, identifying the elements most affected by either genotype or treatment and suggesting signaling that occurs in response to the environment. This entire dataset and associated scripts are made available through an open access, user-friendly, web-based interface. In summary, this work provides analysis tools for visualizing and quantifying plant abiotic stress responses over time. These methods can be deployed as a time-efficient method of dissecting the genetic mechanisms used by sorghum to respond to the environment to accelerate crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "Divergence in migratory behavior is a potential mechanism of lineage divergence in sympatric populations and a key life history trait used in the identification of demographically independent units for conservation purposes. In the Painted Bunting (Passerina ciris), a North American songbird, populations on the Atlantic coast and interior southern United States are known to be allopatric during the breeding season, but efforts to map connectivity with wintering ranges in Mexico, Florida, and the Caribbean have been largely inconclusive. Using genomic and morphological data from natural history specimens and banded birds, we found evidence of three genetically differentiated populations with distinct wintering ranges and molt-migration phenologies. In addition to confirming that the Atlantic coast population remains allopatric throughout the annual cycle, we identified an unexpected migratory divide within the interior breeding range. Populations breeding in the Lower Mississippi River Valley winter on the Yucatan Peninsula, and are parapatric with other interior populations that winter in mainland Mexico and Central America. Across the interior breeding range, genetic ancestry is also associated with variation in wing length; suggesting that selective pressures may be promoting morphological divergence in populations with different migration strategies.",

    "abstract": "All current nanopore basecalling applications begin with the segmentation of raw signal into discrete events, which are ultimately processed into called bases. We propose the basecRAWller algorithm, a pair of unidirectional recurrent neural networks that enables the calling of DNA bases in real time directly from the rawest form of nanopore output. This shift in nanopore basecalling provides a number of advantages over current processing pipelines including: 1) streaming basecalling, 2) tunable ratio of insertions to deletions, and 3) potential for streaming detection of modified bases. Key to the streaming basecalling capability is sequence prediction at a delay of less than 1/100th of a second, allowing future signal to continuously modulate sequence prediction. BasecRAWller is computationally efficient enabling basecalling at speeds faster than current nanopore instrument measurement speeds on a single core. Further, basecalling can be paused and resumed without any change in the resulting predicted sequence, transforming the potential applications for dynamic read rejection capabilities. The basecRAWller algorithm provides an alternative approach to nanopore basecalling at comparable accuracy and provides the community with the capacity to train their own basecRAWller neural networks with minimal effort.",

    "abstract": "RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) is responsible for over 60% of transcriptional output in human cells, yet basic questions concerning the spatial and temporal organization of the polymerase remain unanswered. Here we investigate how mammalian cells rely on Pol I organization throughout the cell cycle to balance different needs, from complete transcription shut down to massive increase in protein synthesis (and thus ribosomal RNA synthesis) before cell division. In contrast to our previous reports on RNA Polymerase II, Pol I clusters are stable with active transcription, and the presence of transient Pol I clusters correlates with inactive ribosomal transcription. Our results suggest that both stable and transient populations Pol I clusters co-exist in individual living cells, and their relative fraction may directly reflect the global gene expression need of the cell.",

    "abstract": "When marked for degradation, surface receptor and transporter proteins are internalized and delivered to endosomes where they are packaged into intralumenal vesicles (ILVs). Many rounds of ILV formation create multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that fuse with lysosomes exposing ILVs to hydrolases for catabolism. Despite being critical for protein degradation, the molecular underpinnings of MVB-lysosome fusion remain unclear, although machinery underlying other lysosome fusion events is implicated. But how then is specificity conferred? And how is MVB maturation and fusion coordinated for efficient protein degradation? To address these questions, we developed a cell-free MVB-lysosome fusion assay using S. cerevisiae as a model. After confirming that the Rab7 ortholog Ypt7 and the multisubunit tethering complex HOPS are required, we found that the Qa-SNARE Pep12 distinguishes this event from homotypic lysosome fusion. Mutations that impair MVB maturation block fusion by preventing Ypt7 activation, confirming that a Rab-cascade mechanism harmonizes MVB maturation with lysosome fusion.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTEndocytosis culminates with multivesicular bodies (MVBs) fusing with lysosomes. But the molecular underpinnings of this event remain unclear. Here, using S. cerevisiae as a model, Karim et al. employ a new in vitro assay to show that MVB-lysosome fusion is driven by ESCRT-dependent Rab-GTPase activation and the syntaxin ortholog Pep12, distinguishing it from other lysosome membrane fusion events.",

    "abstract": "Morphogen gradients direct the spatial patterning of developing embryos, however, the mechanisms by which these gradients are interpreted remain elusive. Here we perform in vivo single molecule imaging in early Drosophila melanogaster embryos of the transcription factor Bicoid that forms a gradient and initiates patterning along the anteroposterior axis. We observe that Bicoid binds to DNA with a rapid off-rate, such that its average occupancy at target loci is on-rate dependent, a property required for concentration-sensitive regulation. Surprisingly, we also observe abundant specific DNA binding in posterior nuclei, where Bicoid levels are vanishingly low. Live embryo imaging reveals spatiotemporal \\\"hubs\\\" of local high Bicoid concentration that are dependent on the ubiquitous maternal factor Zelda. We propose that localized modulation of transcription factor on-rates via clustering, provides a general mechanism to facilitate binding to low-affinity targets, and that this may be a prevalent feature directing other developmental transcription networks.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we found that morphine promoted presynaptic glutamate release of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which constituted the main mechanism for morphine-induced increase in VTA-DA neuron firing and related behaviors (Chen et al., 2015). However, what source of presynaptic glutamate release of DA neurons in the VTA is promoted by morphine remains unknown. To address this question, we used optogenetic strategy to selectively activate glutamatergic inputs from different projection neurons and then observed the effect of morphine on them. The result shows that morphine promotes glutamate release from glutamatergic terminals of projection neurons from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to VTA DA neurons, but has no effect on that from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or the lateral hypothalamus (LH) to VTA DA neurons, and the inhibition of glutamatergic projection neurons from the mPFC to the VTA significantly reduces morphine-induced increase in locomotor activity of mice.",
