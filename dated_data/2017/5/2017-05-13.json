    "abstract": "The genetic regulation of anterior-posterior segment pattern development has been elucidated in detail for Drosophila, but it is not canonical for insects. A surprising diversity of regulatory mechanisms is being uncovered not only between insect Orders, but also within the Order of the Diptera. This raises the question whether the same diversity of regulatory mechanisms exists within other insect Orders. This paper draws attention to the promise of the pea beetle Callosobruchus maculatus for elucidating the evolution of pattern regulation mechanisms in Coleoptera and other insect Orders. Introduction of RNase in eggs of Callosobruchus replaces anterior segments with posterior segments oriented in mirror image symmetry to the original posterior segments (double abdomens). Reversal is specific for RNase activity, for treatment of the anterior egg pole and for cytoplasmic RNA. Yield depends on developmental stage, enzyme concentration and temperature. A maximum of 30% of treated eggs reversed segment sequence after puncture in 10.0 g/ml RNase S reconstituted from S-protein and S-peptide at 30 {degrees}C. This result sets the stage for an analysis of the genetic regulation of segment pattern formation in the long germ embryo of the Coleopteran Callosobruchus and for comparison with the short germ embryo of the Coleopteran Tribolium.",

    "abstract": "The precise identification of Human Leukocyte Antigen class I (HLA-I) binding motifs plays a central role in our ability to understand and predict (neo-)antigen presentation in infectious diseases and cancer. Here, by exploiting co-occurrence of HLA-I alleles across ten newly generated as well as forty public HLA peptidomics datasets comprising more than 115,000 unique peptides, we show that we can rapidly and accurately identify many HLA-I binding motifs and map them to their corresponding alleles without any a priori knowledge of HLA-I binding specificity. Our approach recapitulates and refines known motifs for 43 of the most frequent alleles, uncovers new motifs for 9 alleles that up to now had less than five known ligands and provides a scalable framework to incorporate additional HLA peptidomics studies in the future. The refined motifs improve neo-antigen and cancer testis antigen predictions, indicating that unbiased HLA peptidomics data are ideal for in silico predictions of neo-antigens from tumor exome sequencing data. The new motifs further reveal allosteric modulation of the binding specificity of HLA-I alleles and we unravel the underlying mechanisms by protein structure analysis, mutagenesis and in vitro binding assays.",

    "abstract": "1. ABSTRACTThe \\\"bionic eye\\\" - so long a dream of the future - is finally becoming a reality with retinal prostheses available to patients in both the US and Europe. However, clinical experience with these implants has made it apparent that the vision provided by these devices differs substantially from normal sight. Consequently, the ability to learn to make use of this abnormal retinal input plays a critical role in whether or not some functional vision is successfully regained. The goal of the present review is to summarize the vast basic science literature on developmental and adult cortical plasticity with an emphasis on how this literature might relate to the field of prosthetic vision. We begin with describing the distortion and information loss likely to be experienced by visual prosthesis users. We then define cortical plasticity and perceptual learning, and describe what is known, and what is unknown, about visual plasticity across the hierarchy of brain regions involved in visual processing, and across different stages of life. We close by discussing what is known about brain plasticity in sight restoration patients and discuss biological mechanisms that might eventually be harnessed to improve visual learning in these patients.",

We identify classes of molecules for which E3FP is a better predictor of similarity in bioactivity than is ECFP.

    "abstract": "The proteostasis network (PN) comprises a plethora of proteins that are dedicated to aid in protein folding; some with over-lapping functions. Despite this, there are multiple pathophysiological states associated with depletion of chaperones. This is counter-intuitive assuming cells have the ability to re-program transcriptional outputs in accordance with its proteostasic limitations. To this effect, we have used S. cerevisiae to understand the route a cell takes as a response when challenged with different proteostasis impairments. Using 14 single deletion strains of genes of Protein Quality Control (PQC) system, we quantify their proteostasis impairment and the transcriptional response. In most cases cellular response was incapable of restoring proteostasis. The response did not activate proteostasis components or pathways that could complement the function of the missing PQC gene. Over-expression of alternate machineries, could restore part of the proteostasis defect in deletion strains. We posit that epistasis guided synthetic biology approaches may be helpful in realizing the true potential of the cellular chaperone machinery.",

    "abstract": "Non-equilibrium demography impacts coalescent genealogies leaving detectable, well-studied signatures of variation. However, similar genomic footprints are also expected under models of large reproductive skew, posing a serious problem when trying to make inference. Furthermore, current approaches consider only one of the two processes at a time, neglecting any genomic signal that could arise from their simultaneous effects, preventing the possibility of jointly inferring parameters relating to both offspring distribution and population history. Here, we develop an extended Moran model with exponential population growth, and demonstrate that the underlying ancestral process converges to a time-inhomogeneous psi-coalescent. However, by applying a non-linear change of time scale - analogous to the Kingman coalescent - we find that the ancestral process can be rescaled to its time-homogeneous analogue, allowing the process to be simulated quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the expected site-frequency spectrum under the time-inhomogeneous psi-coalescent and develop an approximate-likelihood framework for the joint estimation of the coalescent and growth parameters. By means of extensive simulation, we demonstrate that both can be estimated accurately given linkage equilibrium, while linkage disequilibrium systematically biases growth rate estimates. In addition, not accounting for demography can lead to serious biases in the inferred coalescent model, with broad implications for genomic studies ranging from ecology to conservation biology. Finally, we use our method to analyze sequence data from Japanese sardine populations and find evidence of high variation in individual reproductive success, but few signs of a recent demographic expansion.",

We study how the nervous system of the medicinal leech processes visual and mechanical information derived from surface waves.\\n\\nAbstractSensitivity to water waves is a key modality by which aquatic predators can detect and localize their prey. For one such predator, the medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana, behavioral responses to visual and mechanical cues from water waves are well documented. Here, we quantitatively characterized the response patterns of a multisensory interneuron, the S cell, to mechanically and visually cued water waves. The frequency dependence of the S-cell response matched the behavioral response well, in that sensitivity was higher for low frequencies in the visual modality and for high frequencies in the mechanical modality. We demonstrated that neither the cephalic ganglia nor the tail brain is required for the S cell to respond to visually cued water waves. The direction of spike propagation within the S- cell system did follow the direction of wave propagation under certain circumstances, but it is unlikely that downstream neuronal targets can use this information. In terms of overall firing rate, the S cell response was not direction selective. Accordingly we propose a role for the S cell in the detection of waves but not in the localization of their source.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (GSL) are the major species that accumulate in plasma membrane lipid rafts. These complexes imbue the membrane with increased order, which in turn, plays a central role in the transmembrane signaling foci lipid rafts provide. In addition, both GSL and cholesterol binding can mediate (separate) signal pathways. We have shown that cholesterol and GSLs however, form a complex in which the GSL sugar is reoriented from a membrane perpendicular to parallel format, becoming largely unavailable for exogenous ligand binding. Similarly, the steroid hydroxyl is masked, restricting access of cholesterol ligands. This was observed in model and cell membranes and in human tumour frozen tissue sections. We now show the order of exogenous ligand binding plays a significant role to determine the extent of GSL or cholesterol receptor activity. Ligand binding to cholesterol enhances subsequent GSL recognition and vice versa, suggesting that ligand binding to \\\"free\\\" receptor (membrane perpendicular GSL carbohydrate, nonmasked cholesterol) can result in partial dissociation of the GSL/cholesterol complex to allow additional GSL ligand and cholesterol ligand binding. Since many GSLs can complex with membrane cholesterol, the binding of a single cholesterol ligand may unmask cholesterol-complexed GSL for increased binding of both a single or multiple GSL-specific ligands. We show that multiple cholesterol-masked GSLs can be coincident in tissues. This provides a mechanism for GSL-dependent signal amplification and diversification, representing a biological  transistor, regulating amplitude and potentially, diversity of GSL signaling. The process represents a new mechanism of  cross-talk between GSL and cholesterol signaling. This is of clinical importance since we have found cholesterol/GSL masking applies to monoclonal anti GSL antibodies in development and in current use as antineoplastic therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The role of competitive interactions in the formation and coexistence of viral strains remains unresolved. Neglected aspects of existing strain theory are that viral pathogens are repeatedly introduced from animal sources and readily exchange their genes. The combined effect of introduction and reassortment opposes strain structure, in particular the predicted stable coexistence of antigenically differentiated strains under strong frequency-dependent selection mediated by cross-immunity. Here we use a stochastic model motivated by rotavirus, the most common cause of childhood diarrheal mortality, to investigate serotype structure under these conditions. We describe a regime in which the transient coexistence of distinct strains emerges despite only weak cross-immunity, but is disturbed by invasions of new antigenic segments that reassort into existing backgrounds. We find support for this behavior in global rotavirus sequence data and present evidence for the displacement of new strains towards open antigenic niches. Our work extends previous work to bacterial and viral pathogens that share these rotavirus-like characteristics, with important implications for the effects of interventions such as vaccination on strain composition, and for the understanding of the factors promoting emergence of new subtypes.",

Bivalent domains (marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) have been proposed to act in the histone pre-patterning of poised genes; however, bivalent genes could also resolve into monovalent silenced states during differentiation. Thus, the histone signatures of poised genes need to be more precisely characterized.\\n\\nResultsUsing a support vector machine (SVM), we show that the collective histone modification data from human blood hematopoietic cells (HSCs) could predict poised genes with fairly high predictive accuracy within the model of directed erythrocyte differentiation from HSCs. Surprisingly, models with single histone marks (e.g., H3K4me3 or H2A.Z) could reach comparable predictive powers to the full model built with all of the nine histone marks. We also derived an H2A.Z and H3K9me3-based Naive Bayesian model for inferring poised genes, and the validity of this model was supported by data from several other pluripotent/multipotent cells (including mouse ES cells).\\n\\nConclusionOur work represents a systematic quantitative study that verified that histone marks play a role in pre-programming the activation or repression of specific genes during cellular differentiation.

Because HHT is caused by loss-of-function mutations in BMP9-ALK1-Smad1/5/8 signaling, interventions aimed at activating this pathway are of therapeutic value. By screening FDA-approved drug libraries, we identified tacrolimus (FK-506) as a potent activator of Smad1/5/8 in BMP9-challenged reporter cells. In primary ECs, tacrolimus activated Smad1/5/8 to oppose the pro-angiogenic gene expression signature associated with ALK1 loss-of-function, by notably reducing Dll4 expression. In these cells, tacrolimus also inhibited Akt and p38 stimulation by VEGF. In the BMP9/10-immunodepleted postnatal retina--a mouse model of HHT vascular pathology--tacrolimus activated endothelial Smad1/5/8 and prevented the Dll4 overexpression and hypervascularization associated with this model. Finally, tacrolimus stimulated Smad1/5/8 in cells transfected with BMP9-unresponsive ALK1 HHT mutants and in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs.

Many insects are also protected via immune memory ( immune priming), whereby sub-lethal exposure to a pathogen enhances survival after secondary infection. To understand the evolution and consequences of these immune responses, we imposed strong pathogen selection on flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum), infecting them with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for 11 generations. Populations injected first with heat-killed and then live Bt each generation evolved high basal resistance against multiple Bt strains. In contrast, all populations injected only with a high dose of live Bt evolved less effective but strain-specific priming response. Control populations injected with heat-killed Bt did not evolve priming; and in the ancestor, priming was effective only against a low Bt dose. Thus, pathogens can select for rapid modulation of insect priming ability, leading to divergent immune strategies (generalized resistance vs. specific immune priming) with distinct mechanisms and adaptive benefits.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic control of cell polarity is of critical importance for many aspects of cellular development and motility. In Myxococcus xanthus, a G-protein and its cognate GTPase-activating protein establish a polarity axis that defines the direction of movement of the cell and which can be rapidly inverted by the Frz chemosensory system. Although vital for collective cell behaviours, how Frz triggers this switch has remained unknown. Here, we use genetics, imaging and mathematical modelling to show that Frz controls polarity reversals via a gated relaxation oscillator. FrzX, which we newly identify as the primary Frz output, provides the gating and thus acts as the trigger for reversals. Slow relocalisation of the polarity protein RomR then creates a refractory period during which another switch cannot be triggered. A secondary Frz output, FrzZ, decreases this delay allowing rapid reversals when required. This architecture thus results in a highly tunable switch that allows a wide range of motility responses.",

    "abstract": "We reported previously that the selective agonist U50,488H promoted phosphorylation of the mouse kappa opioid receptor (KOPR) at residues S356, T357, T363 and S369. Here, we found that agonist (U50,488H)-dependent KOPR phosphorylation at all the residues were mediated by Gi/o proteins and multiple protein kinases [GRKs2, 3, 5 and 6 and protein kinase C (PKC)]. In addition, PKC activation by phorbol ester induced agonist-independent KOPR phosphorylation. Compared with U50,488H, PKC activation promoted much higher S356/T357 phosphorylation, much lower T363 phosphorylation and similar levels of S369 phosphorylation. Following U50,488H, GRKs, but not PKC, were involved in agonist-induced KOPR internalization. In contrast, PKC activation caused a lower level of agonist-independent KOPR internalization, compared to U50,488H. U50,488H-induced activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was G protein-, but not {beta}-arrestin-, dependent. After U50,488H, GRK- mediated, but not PKC-mediated, KOPR phosphorylation followed by {beta}-arrestin recruitment desensitized U50,488H-induced ERK1/2 response. Therefore, agonist-dependent (GRK- and PKC-mediated) and agonist-independent (PKC-promoted) KOPR phosphorylations show distinct phosphorylation patterns, leading to diverse cellular outcomes.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Many adult organs grow or shrink to accommodate different physiological demands. Often, as total cell number changes, stem cell number changes proportionally in a phenomenon called  stem cell scaling. The cellular behaviors that give rise to scaling are unknown. Here we study two complementary theoretical models of the adult Drosophila midgut, a stem cell-based organ with known resizing dynamics. First, we derive a differential equations model of midgut resizing and show that the in vivo kinetics of growth can be recapitulated if the rate of fate commitment depends on the tissues stem cell proportion. Second, we develop a twodimensional simulation of the midgut and find that proportion-dependent commitment rate and stem cell scaling can arise phenomenologically from the stem cells exploration of physical tissue space during its lifetime. Together, these models provide a biophysical understanding of how stem cell scaling is maintained during organ growth and shrinkage.",
