    "abstract": "Many bacteria are adapted for attaching to surfaces and for building complex communities, termed biofilms. The biofilm mode of life is predominant in bacterial ecology. So, too, is exposure of bacteria to ubiquitous viral pathogens, termed bacteriophages. Although biofilmphage encounters are likely to be very common in nature, little is known about how phages might interact with biofilm-dwelling bacteria. It is also unclear how the ecological dynamics of phages and their hosts depend on the biological and physical properties of the biofilm environment. To make headway in this area, here we develop the first biofilm simulation framework that captures key mechanistic features of biofilm growth and phage infection. Using these simulations, we find that the equilibrium state of interaction between biofilms and phages is governed largely by nutrient availability to biofilms, infection likelihood per host encounter, and the ability of phages to diffuse through biofilm populations. Interactions between the biofilm matrix and phage particles are thus likely to be of fundamental importance, controlling the extent to which bacteria and phages can coexist in natural contexts. Our results open avenues to new questions of host-parasite coevolution and horizontal gene transfer in spatially structured biofilm contexts.",

    "abstract": "Complex learned behaviors must involve the integrated action of distributed brain circuits. While the contributions of individual regions to learning have been extensively investigated, understanding how distributed brain networks orchestrate their activity over the course of learning remains elusive. To address this gap, we used fMRI combined with tools from dynamic network neuroscience to obtain time-resolved descriptions of network coordination during reinforcement learning. We found that learning to associate visual cues with reward involves dynamic changes in network coupling between the striatum and distributed brain regions, including visual, orbitofrontal, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, we found that flexibility in striatal network dynamics correlates with participants learning rate and inverse temperature, two parameters derived from reinforcement learning models. Finally, we found that not all forms of learning relate to this circuit: episodic memory, measured in the same participants at the same time, was related to dynamic connectivity in distinct brain networks. These results suggest that dynamic changes in striatal-centered networks provide a mechanism for information integration during reinforcement learning.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLearning from the outcomes of actions-referred to as reinforcement learning-is an essential part of life. The roles of individual brain regions in reinforcement learning have been well characterized in terms of the updating of values for actions or sensory stimuli. Missing from this account, however, is a description of the manner in which different brain areas interact during learning to integrate sensory and value information. Here we characterize flexible striatal-cortical network dynamics that relate to reinforcement learning behavior.",

    "abstract": "Planning can be defined as a process of action selection that leverages an internal model of the environment. Such models provide information about the likely outcomes that will follow each selected action, and their use is a key function underlying complex adaptive behavior. However, the neural mechanisms supporting this ability remain poorly understood. In the present work, we adapt for rodents recent advances from work on human planning, presenting for the first time a task for animals which produces many trials of planned behavior per session, allowing the experimental toolkit available for use in trial-by-trial tasks for rodents to be applied to the study of planning. We take advantage of one part of this toolkit to address a perennially controversial issue in planning research: the role of the dorsal hippocampus. Although prospective representations in the hippocampus have been proposed to support model-based planning, intact planning in hippocampally damaged animals has been observed in a number of assays. Combining formal algorithmic behavioral analysis with muscimol inactivation, we provide the first causal evidence directly linking dorsal hippocampus with planning behavior. The results reported, and the methods introduced, open the door to new and more detailed investigations of the neural mechanisms of planning, in the hippocampus and throughout the brain.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplication can have large impacts on genome evolution. However, much remains unknown about these impacts, such as the mechanisms of coping with a duplicated sex determination system, which may result in increased sex determination mechanism diversity. Sexual conflict (i.e. alleles having different optimums in each sex) can result in sequestration of genes into non-recombining sex chromosomes. Development of sex chromosomes may involve heterochiasmy (i.e. sex-specific recombination rate), which is also poorly understood. Family Salmonidae is a model system for these phenomena, having undergone autotetraploidization and subsequent rediploidization in most of the genome at the base of the lineage. The salmonid master sex determining gene is known, and many species have non-homologous sex chromosomes, putatively due to transposition of this gene. In this study, we identify the sex chromosome of Brook Charr Salvelinus fontinalis and compare sex chromosome identities across the lineage (eight species, four genera). Although non-homology is frequent, homologous sex chromosomes and other consistencies are present in distantly related species, indicating probable convergence on specific sex and neo-sex chromosomes. We also characterize strong heterochiasmy with 2.7-fold more crossovers in maternal than paternal haplotypes with paternal crossovers biased to chromosome ends. Y chromosome crossovers are restricted to a single end of the chromosome, and this chromosome contains a large interspecific inversion, although its status between males and females remains unknown. Finally, we identify QTL for 21 unique growth, reproductive and stress-related phenotypes to improve knowledge of the genetic architecture of these traits important to aquaculture and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Genetic distance is a standard measure of variation in populations. When sequencing genomes individually, genetic distances are computed over all pairs of multilocus haplotypes in a sample. However, when next-generation sequencing methods obtain reads from heterogeneous assemblages of genomes (e.g. for microbial samples in a biofilm or cells from a tumor), individual reads are often drawn from different genomes. This means that pairwise genetic distances are calculated across independently sampled sites rather than across haplotype pairs. In this paper, we show that while the expected pairwise distance under whole haplotype sampling (WHS) is the same as with independent locus sampling (ILS), the sample variances of pairwise distance differ and depend on the direction and magnitude of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among polymorphic sites. We derive a weighted LD value that, when positive, predicts higher sample variance in estimated genetic distance for WHS. Weighted LD is positive when on average, the most common alleles at two loci are in positive LD. Using individual-based simulations of an infinite sites model under Fisher-Wright genetic drift, variances of estimated genetic distance are found to be almost always higher under WHS than under ILS, suggesting a reduction in estimation error when sites are sampled independently. We apply these results to haplotype frequencies from a lung cancer tumor to compute weighted LD and the variances in estimated genetic distance under ILS vs. WHS, and find that the the relative magnitudes of variances under WHS vs. ILS are sensitive to sampled allele frequencies.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPhylogenetic comparative methods have been used to model trait evolution, to test selection versus neutral hypotheses, to estimate optimal trait-values, and to quantify the rate of adaptation towards these optima. Several authors have proposed algorithms calculating the likelihood for trait evolution models, such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, in time proportional to the number of tips in the tree. Combined with gradient-based optimization, these algorithms enable maximum likelihood (ML) inference within seconds, even for trees exceeding 10,000 tips. Despite its useful statistical properties, ML has been criticised for being a point estimator prone to getting stuck in local optima. As an elegant alternative, Bayesian inference explores the entire information in the data and compares it to prior knowledge but, usually, runs in much longer time, even for small trees. Here, we propose an approach to use the full potential of ML and Bayesian inference, while keeping the runtime within minutes. Our approach combines (i) a new algorithm for parallel likelihood calculation; (ii) a previously published method for adaptive Metropolis sampling. In principle, the strategy of (i) and (ii) can be applied to any likelihood calculation on a tree which proceeds in a pruning-like fashion leading to enormous speed improvements. As a showcase, we implement the phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mixed model (POUMM) in the form of an easy-to-use and highly configurable R-package. In addition to the above-mentioned usage of comparative methods, the POUMM allows to estimate non-heritable variance and phylogenetic heritability. Using simulations and empirical data from 487 mammal species, we show that the POUMM is far more reliable in terms of unbiased estimates and false positive rate for stabilizing selection, compared to its alternative - the non-mixed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, which assumes a fully heritable and perfectly measurable trait. Further, our analysis reveals that the phylogenetic mixed model (PMM), which assumes neutral evolution (Brownian motion) can be a very unstable estimator of phylogenetic heritability, even if the Brownian motion assumption is only weakly violated. Our results prove the need for a simultaneous account for selection and non-heritable variance in phylogenetic evolutionary models and challenge stabilizing selection hypotheses stated in numerous macro-evolutionary studies.",

    "abstract": "Puttick et al. [1] performed a simulation study to compare accuracy among methods of inferring phylogeny from discrete morphological characters. They report that a Bayesian implementation of the Mk model [2] was most accurate (but with low resolution), while a maximum likelihood (ML) implementation of the same model was least accurate. They conclude by strongly advocating that Bayesian implementations of the Mk model should be the default method of analysis for such data. While we appreciate the authors attempt to investigate the accuracy of alternative methods of analysis, their conclusion is based on an inappropriate comparison of the ML point estimate, which does not consider confidence, with the Bayesian consensus, which incorporates estimation credibility into the summary tree. Using simulation, we demonstrate that ML and Bayesian estimates are concordant when confidence and credibility are comparably reflected in summary trees, a result expected from statistical theory. We therefore disagree with the conclusions of PEA and consider their prescription of any default method to be poorly founded. Instead, we recommend caution and thoughtful consideration of the model or method being applied to a morphological dataset.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, biofilms have become a central subject of research in the fields of microbiology, medicine, agriculture, or systems biology amongst others. The sociomicrobiology of multispecies biofilms, however, is still poorly understood. Here, we report a screening system that allowed us to identify soil bacteria, which induce architectural changes in biofilm colonies when cocultured with B. subtilis. We identified the soil bacterium Lysinibacillus fusiformis M5 as inducer of wrinkle-formation in B. subtilis colonies mediated by a diffusible signaling molecule. This compound was isolated by bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation. The elicitor was identified to be the purine hypoxanthine using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We show that the induction of wrinkle formation by hypoxanthine is not dependent on signal recognition by the histidine kinases KinA, KinB, KinC, and KinD, which are generally involved in phosphorylation of the master regulator Spo0A. Likewise, we show that hypoxanthine signaling does not induce the expression of biofilm-matrix related operons epsA-O and tasA-sipW-tapA. Finally, we demonstrate that the purine permease PbuO, but not PbuG, is necessary for hypoxanthine to induce an increase in wrinkle formation of B. subtilis biofilm colonies. Our results suggest that hypoxanthine-stimulated wrinkle development is not due to a direct induction of biofilm-related gene expression, but rather caused by the excess of hypoxanthine within B. subtilis cells, which may lead to cell stress and death.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBiofilms are a bacterial lifestyle with high relevance regarding diverse human activities. Biofilms can be favorable, for instance in crop protection. In nature, biofilms are commonly found as multispecies communities displaying complex social behaviors and characteristics. The study of interspecies interactions will thus lead to a better understanding and use of biofilms as they occur outside laboratory conditions. Here, we present a screening method suitable for the identification of multispecies interactions, and showcase L. fusiformis as a soil bacterium that is able to live alongside B. subtilis and modify the architecture of its biofilms.",

In our attempt to discriminate the ADHD patients from normal subjects by hierarchical clustering of behavioural, psychological and event related potential (ERP) variables, the late P3 component of potentials from the right central region (C4) proved to be one of the most informative parameters (in preparation for publication). Here, we have studied the differences in ERPs between the left (C3) and right (C4) central leads and relation of this asymmetry to ADHD diagnosed using DSM.\\n\\nMethods20 typically developing (TD) boys and 19 boys diagnosed with ADHD according to DSM-IV-TR, aged 10-13 years, were examined by the Attentional Network Test (ANT), with simultaneous recording of the respective ERPs. The intergroup differences in the ERP amplitude parameters in the left (C3) and right (C4) central channels and in the difference in these parameters between the two channels (C3 minus C4) were accessed. These characteristics were compared to the subjects DSM scores and ANT performance.\\n\\nResultsThe target-related potentials late characteristics from the C4 and C3 did not shown significant difference between the groups. The difference between ERPs of the C3 and C4 channels inside the interval of 40-290 ms after target onset was larger in the ADHD group than in control, mainly for incongruent target condition. This asymmetry and right late component were correlated with DSM scores, mainly to hyperactive and impulsive criteria.\\n\\nConclusionIn ADHD patients, the results suggest ERP pattern of right-side functional predominance in the motor control, which correlates to DSM scores, mainly to hyperactive and impulsive criteria.",

In the present work we report the de novo midgut transcriptomes of four non-model insects from four distinct orders: Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera), Musca domestica (Diptera), Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera) and Dysdercus peruvianus (Hemiptera). We employed a computational strategy to merge assemblies obtained with two different algorithms, which substantially increased the quality of the final transcriptomes. Unigenes were annotated and analyzed using the eggNOG database, which allowed us to assign some level of functional and evolutionary information to 79.7% to 93.1% of the transcriptomes. We found interesting transcriptional patterns, such as: i) the intense use of lysozymes in digestive functions of M. domestica larvae, which are streamlined and adapted to feed on bacteria; ii) the up-regulation of orthologous UDP-glycosyl transferase and cytochrome P450 genes in the whole midguts different species, supporting the presence of an ancient defense frontline to counter xenobiotics; iii) evidence supporting roles for juvenile hormone binding proteins in the midgut physiology, probably as a way to activate genes that help fight anti-nutritional substances (e.g. protease inhibitors). The results presented here shed light on the digestive and structural properties of the digestive systems of these distantly related species.

Using an agent-based framework to model spatial competition among sensitive and resistant populations, we apply anti-proliferative drug treatments to varying ratios of sensitive and resistant cells. We compare a continuous maximum tolerated dose schedule with an adaptive schedule aimed at tumor control through competition between sensitive and resistant cells. We find that continuous treatment cures mostly sensitive tumors, but with any resistant cells, recurrence is inevitable.

    "abstract": "Farming was first introduced to southeastern Europe in the mid-7th millennium BCE - brought by migrants from Anatolia who settled in the region before spreading throughout Europe. To clarify the dynamics of the interaction between the first farmers and indigenous hunter-gatherers where they first met, we analyze genome-wide ancient DNA data from 223 individuals who lived in southeastern Europe and surrounding regions between 12,000 and 500 BCE. We document previously uncharacterized genetic structure, showing a West-East cline of ancestry in hunter-gatherers, and show that some Aegean farmers had ancestry from a different lineage than the northwestern Anatolian lineage that formed the overwhelming ancestry of other European farmers. We show that the first farmers of northern and western Europe passed through southeastern Europe with limited admixture with local hunter-gatherers, but that some groups mixed extensively, with relatively sex-balanced admixture compared to the male-biased hunter-gatherer admixture that prevailed later in the North and West. Southeastern Europe continued to be a nexus between East and West after farming arrived, with intermittent genetic contact from the Steppe up to 2,000 years before the migration that replaced much of northern Europes population.",

    "abstract": "Recent work done exclusively in tissue culture cells revealed that the nuclear envelope (NE) undergoes ruptures leading to transient mixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic components. The duration of transient NE ruptures depends on lamins, however the underlying mechanisms and the relevance to in vivo events is not known. Here, we use C. elegans embryos to show that dynein forces that position nuclei increase the severity of lamin-induced NE ruptures in vivo. In the absence of dynein forces, lamin prevents nuclear-cytoplasmic mixing caused by NE ruptures. By monitoring the dynamics of NE rupture events, we demonstrate that lamin is required for a distinct step in NE recovery that restricts nucleocytoplasmic mixing prior to the full restoration of NE rupture sites. We show that laser-induced puncture of the NE recapitulates phenotypes associated with NE recovery in wild type cells. Surprisingly, we find that embryonic lethality does not correlate with the incidence of NE rupture events suggesting that embryos survive transient losses of NE compartmentalization during early embryogenesis. In addition to presenting the first mechanistic analysis of transient NE ruptures in vivo, this work demonstrates that lamin controls the duration of NE ruptures by opposing dynein forces on ruptured nuclei to allow reestablishment of the NE permeability barrier and subsequent restoration of NE rupture sites.",

    "abstract": "An important application of genomic selection in plant breeding is the prediction of untested single crosses (SCs). Most investigations on the prediction efficiency were based on tested SCs, using cross-validation. The main objective was to assess the prediction efficiency by correlating the predicted and true genotypic values of untested SCs (accuracy) and measuring the efficacy of identification of the best 300 untested SCs (coincidence), using simulated data. We assumed 10,000 SNPs, 400 QTLs, two groups of 70 selected DH lines, and 4,900 SCs. The heritabilities for the assessed SCs were 30, 60 and 100%. The scenarios included three sampling processes of DH lines, two sampling processes of SCs for testing, two SNP densities, DH lines from distinct and same populations, DH lines from populations with lower LD, two genetic models, three statistical models, and three statistical approaches. We derived a model for genomic prediction based on SNP average effects of substitution and dominance deviations. The prediction accuracy is not affected by the linkage phase. The prediction of untested SCs is very efficient. The accuracies and coincidences ranged from approximately 0.8 and 0.5, respectively, under low heritability, to 0.9 and 0.7, assuming high heritability. Additionally, we highlighted the relevance of the overall LD and evidenced that efficient prediction of untested SCs can be achieved for crops that show no heterotic pattern, for reduced training set size (10%), for SNP density of 1 cM, and for distinct sampling processes of DH lines, based on random choice of the SCs for testing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenotyping and whole-genome sequencing data have been collected in many cattle breeds. The compilation of large reference panels facilitates imputing sequence variant genotypes for animals that have been genotyped using dense genotyping arrays. Association studies with imputed sequence variant genotypes allow characterization of quantitative trait loci (QTL) at nucleotide resolution particularly when individuals from several breeds are included in the mapping populations.\\n\\nResultsWe imputed genotypes for more than 28 million sequence variants in 17,229 animals of the Braunvieh (BV), Fleckvieh (FV) and Holstein (HOL) cattle breeds in order to generate large mapping populations that are required to identify sequence variants underlying milk production traits. Within-breed association tests between imputed sequence variant genotypes and fat and protein percentages in milk uncovered between six and thirteen QTL (P<1e-8) per breed. Eight of the detected QTL were significant in more than one breed. We combined the association studies across three breeds using meta-analysis and identified 25 QTL including six that were not significant in the within-breed association studies. Closer inspection of the QTL revealed that two well-known causal missense mutations in the ABCG2 (p.Y581S, rs43702337, P=4.3e-34) and GHR (p.F279Y, rs385640152, P=1.6e-74) genes were the top variants at two QTL on chromosomes 6 and 20. Another true causal missense mutation in the DGAT1 gene (p.A232K, rs109326954, P=8.4e-1436) was the second top variant at a QTL on chromosome 14 but its allelic substitution effects were not consistent across three breeds analyzed. It turned out that the conflicting allelic substitution effects resulted from flaws in the imputed genotypes due to the use of a multi-breed reference population for genotype imputation.\\n\\nConclusionsMany QTL for milk production traits segregate across breeds. Metaanalysis of association studies across breeds has greater power to detect such QTL than within-breed association studies. True causal mutations can be readily detected among the most significantly associated variants at QTL when the accuracy of imputation is high. However, true causal mutations may show conflicting allelic substitution effects across breeds when the imputed sequence variant genotypes contain flaws. Validating the effect of known causal variants is highly recommended in order to assess the ability to detect true causal mutations in association studies with imputed sequence variant genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic crossovers must be properly patterned to ensure accurate disjunction of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I. Disruption of the spatial distribution of crossovers can lead to nondisjunction, aneuploidy, gamete dysfunction, miscarriage, or birth defects. One of the earliest identified genes in involved proper crossover patterning is textitDrosophila mei-41, which encodes the ortholog of the checkpoint kinase ATR. Analysis of hypomorphic mutants suggested the existence of crossover patterning defects, but it was not possible to assess this in null mutants because of maternal-effect embryonic lethality. To overcome this lethality, we constructed mei-41 null mutants in which we expressed wild-type Mei-41 in the germline after completion of meiotic recombination, allowing progeny to survive. We find that crossovers are decreased to about one third of wild-type levels, but the reduction is not uniform, being less severe in the proximal regions of 2L than in medial or distal 2L or on the X chromosome. None of the crossovers formed in the absence of Mei-41 require Mei-9, the presumptive meiotic resolvase, suggesting that Mei-41 functions everywhere, despite the differential effects on crossover frequency. Interference appears to be significantly reduced or absent in mei-41 mutants, but the reduction in crossover density in centromere-proximal regions is largely intact. We propose that crossover patterning is achieved in a stepwise manner, with the crossover suppression related to proximity to the centromere occurring prior to and independently of crossover designation and enforcement of interference. In this model, Mei-41 has an essential after the centromere effect is established but before crossover designation and interference occur.",

    "abstract": "Natural lachrymatory effects are invoked by small volatile S-oxide compounds. They are produced through alkene sulfenic acids by the action of lachrymatory factor synthase (LFS). Here we present the crystal structures of onion LFS (AcLFS) revealed in solute-free and two solute-stabilized forms. Each structure adopts a single seven-stranded helix-grip fold possessing an internal pocket. Mutagenesis analysis localized the active site to a layer near the bottom of the pocket, which is adjacent to the deduced key residues Arg71, Glu88, and Tyr114. Solute molecules visible on the active site have suggested that AcLFS accepts various small alcohol compounds as well as its natural substrate, and they inhibit this substrate according to their chemistry. Structural homologs have been found in the SRPBCC superfamily, and comparison of the active sites has demonstrated that the electrostatic potential unique to AcLFS could work in capturing the substrate in its specific state. Finally, we propose a rational catalytic mechanism based on intramolecular proton shuttling in which the microenvironment of AcLFS can bypass the canonical [1,4]-sigmatropic rearrangement principle established by microwave studies. Beyond revealing how AcLFS generates the lachrymatory compound, this study provides insights into the molecular machinery dealing with highly labile organosulfur species.\\n\\nSignificance statementCrushing of onion liberates a volatile compound, syn-propanethial S-oxide (PTSO), which causes lachrymatory effect on humans. We present the crystal structures of onion LFS (AcLFS), the enzyme responsible for natural production of PTSO. AcLFS features a barrel-like fold, and mutagenic and inhibitory analyses revealed that the key residues are present in the central pocket, harboring highly concentrated aromatic residues plus a dyad motif. The architecture of AcLFS is widespread among proteins with various biological functions, such as abscisic acid receptors and polyketide cyclases, and comparisons with these homologs indicate that unique steric and electronic properties maintain the pocket as a reaction compartment. We propose the molecular mechanism behind PTSO generation and shed light on biological decomposition of short-lived sulfur species.",

    "abstract": "In recent work, we discovered that the presence of highly substoichiometric amounts (10-8 molar ratio) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria caused fibrinogen clotting to lead to the formation of an amyloid form of fibrin. We here show that the broadly equivalent lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from two species of Gram-positive bacteria have similarly (if not more) potent effects. Using thioflavin T fluorescence to detect amyloid as before, the addition of low concentrations of free ferric ion is found to have similar effects. Luminescent conjugated oligothiophene dyes (LCOs), marketed under the trade name AmytrackerTM, also stain classical amyloid structures. We here show that they too give very large fluorescence enhancements when clotting is initiated in the presence of the four amyloidogens (LPS, ferric ions and two LTA types). The staining patterns differ significantly as a function of both the amyloidogens and the dyes used to assess them, indicating clearly that the nature of the clots formed is different. This is also the case when clotting is measured viscometrically using thromboelastography. Overall, the data provide further evidence for an important role of bacterial cell wall products in the various coagulopathies that are observable in chronic, inflammatory diseases. The assays may have potential in both diagnostics and therapeutics.",

We establish the tragedy in the context of a general chemostat model with two species, the cooperator and the cheater. Both species have the same growth rate function and yield constant, but the cooperator allocates a portion of the nutrient uptake towards the production of a public good -the \\\"Commons\\\" in the Tragedy-which is needed to digest the externally supplied nutrient. The cheater on the other hand does not produce this enzyme, and allocates all nutrient uptake towards its own growth. We prove that when the cheater is present initially, both the cooperator and the cheater will eventually go extinct, hereby confirming the occurrence of the tragedy. We also show that without the cheater, the cooperator can survive indefinitely, provided that at least a low level of public good or processed nutrient is available initially. Our results provide a predictive framework for the analysis of cooperator-cheater dynamics in a powerful model system of experimental evolution.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cells have a remarkable capacity to adapt and to evolve to environmental changes. Although many mutations contributing to adaptive evolution have been identified, the relationship between the mutations and the phenotypic changes responsible for fitness gain has yet to be fully elucidated. For a better understanding of phenotype-genotype relationship in evolutionary dynamics, we performed high-throughput laboratory evolution of Escherichia coli under various stress conditions using an automated culture system. One measure of phenotype, transcriptome analysis, revealed that the expression changes which occurred during the evolution were generally similar among the strains evolved in the same stress environment. We also found several genes and gene functions for which mutations were commonly fixed in the strains resistant to the same stress, and whose effects on resistance were verified experimentally. We demonstrated that the integration of transcriptome and genome data enables us to extract the mechanisms for stress resistance.\\n\\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding the relationship between phenotypic and genetic changes is a fundamental goal in evolutionary biology, which can provide insights into the past and future evolutionary trajectories. Evolution of microorganisms in a laboratory has been the primary approach to clarify the mappings of phenotypic and genotypic changes. Here, we performed high-throughput laboratory evolution with bacteria using an automated culture system, to quantify phenotypic and genotypic changes occurred under various stress conditions. We identified various stress-specific gene expression changes and mutations, and contributions of them to fitness gain were validated.

    "abstract": "The advent of next-generation sequencing allows researchers to use large-scale datasets for species delimitation analyses, yet one can envision an inflection point where the added accuracy of including more loci does not offset the increased computational burden. One alternative to including all loci could be to prioritize the analysis of loci for which there is an expectation of high informativeness, such as those with higher numbers of parsimony-informative sites. Here, we explore the issue of species delimitation and locus selection with species from two anuran genera: Melanophryniscus (Bufonidae) and Brachycephalus (Brachycephalidae). Montane species in these genera have been isolated in sky islands across the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest, which led to the formation of a number of microendemic species. To delimit species, we obtained genetic data using target enrichment of ultraconserved elements from 32 populations (13 for Melanophryniscus and 19 for Brachycephalus), and we were able to create datasets that included over 800 loci with no missing data. We ranked loci according to their corresponding number of parsimony-informative sites, and we performed species delimitation analyses using BPP in each genus based on the top 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, and 640 loci. We also conducted several additional analyses using 10 randomly sampled datasets containing the same numbers of loci to discriminate the relative contribution of increasing the number of loci from prioritizing those with higher informativeness. We identified three types of node: nodes with either consistently high or low support regardless of the number of loci or their informativeness, and nodes that were initially poorly supported, but their support became stronger with more data. Adding more loci had a stronger impact on model support than prioritizing loci for their informativeness, but this effect was less apparent in datasets with more than 160 loci. When viewed across all sensitivity analyses, our results suggest that the current species richness in both genera might have been underestimated. In addition, our results provide useful guidelines to the use of different sampling strategies to carry out species delimitation with phylogenomic datasets.",

Vaccination with diphtheria toxoid protects against infection with potent toxin producing strains.

Phylogeny was determined using SNP-based mapping and genome wide analysis.\\n\\nResultsC. diphtheriae sequence type (ST) 32, a non-toxigenic ST with evidence of enhanced virulence that is also circulating in Europe, appears to be endemic in Australia. Isolates from temporospatially related patients displayed the same ST and similarity in their core genomes. The genome-wide analysis highlighted a role of pilins, adhesion factors and iron utilization in infections caused by toxigenic as well as non-toxigenic strains.\\n\\nConclusionsThe genomic diversity of toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae in Australia suggests multiple local and overseas sources of infection and colonisation. Our findings suggest that regular genomic surveillance of co-circulating toxigenic and non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae can deliver highly nuanced data in order to inform targeted public health actions and policy for predicting the future impact of this highly successful pathogen.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which language processing involves prediction of upcoming inputs remains a question of ongoing debate. One important data point comes from DeLong et al. (2005) who reported that an N400-like event-related potential correlated with a probabilistic index of upcoming input. This result is often cited as evidence for gradient probabilistic prediction of form and/or semantics, prior to the bottom-up input becoming available. However, a recent multi-lab study reports a failure to find these effects (Nieuwland et al., 2017). We review the evidence from both studies, including differences in the design and analysis approach between them. Building on over a decade of research on prediction since DeLong et al. (2005)s original study, we also begin to spell out the computational nature of predictive processes that one might expect to correlate with ERPs that are evoked by a functional element whose form is dependent on an upcoming predicted word. For paradigms with this type of design, we propose an index of anticipatory processing, Bayesian surprise, and apply it to the updating of semantic predictions. We motivate this index both theoretically and empirically. We show that, for studies of the type discussed here, Bayesian surprise can be closely approximated by another, more easily estimated information theoretic index, the surprisal (or Shannon information) of the input. We re-analyze the data from Nieuwland and colleagues using surprisal rather than raw probabilities as an index of prediction. We find that surprisal is gradiently correlated with the amplitude of the N400, even in the data shared by Nieuwland and colleagues. Taken together, our review suggests that the evidence from both studies is compatible with anticipatory semantic processing. We do, however, emphasize the need for future studies to further clarify the nature and degree of form prediction, as well as its neural signatures, during language comprehension.",

    "abstract": "Sounds activate occipital regions in early blind individuals. How different sound categories map onto specific regions of the occipital cortex remains however debated. We used fMRI to characterize brain responses of early blind and sighted individuals to familiar object sounds, human voices and their respective low-level control sounds. Sighted participants were additionally tested when viewing pictures of faces, objects and phase-scrambled control pictures. In both early blind and sighted, a double dissociation was evidenced in bilateral auditory cortices between responses to voices and object sounds: voices elicited categorical responses in bilateral superior temporal sulci while object sounds elicited categorical responses along the lateral fissure bilaterally, including the primary auditory cortex and planum temporale. Outside of the auditory regions, object sounds additionally elicited categorical responses in left lateral and ventral occipito-temporal regions in both groups. These regions also showed response preference for images of objects in the sighted, thus suggesting a functional specialization in these regions that is independent of sensory input and visual experience. Between-group comparisons revealed that only in the blind group, categorical responses to object sounds extended more posteriorly into the occipital cortex. Functional connectivity analyses evidenced a selective increase in the functional coupling between these reorganized regions and regions of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex in the early blind. In contrast, vocal sounds did not elicit preferential responses in the occipital cortex in either group. Nevertheless, enhanced voice-selective connectivity between the left temporal voice area and the right fusiform gyrus were found in the blind. Altogether, these findings suggest that separate auditory categories are not equipotent in driving selective auditory recruitment of occipito-temporal regions in the absence of developmental vision, highlighting domain-region constraints on the expression of crossmodal plasticity.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesPre-historic decline in human craniofacial masculinity has been proposed as evidence of selection for elevated sociability and a process of  human self-domestication thought to have promoted complex capacities including language, culture, and cumulative technological development. This follows experimental observation of similar changes in non-human animals under selection for reduced aggression. Two distinct domestication hypotheses posit developmental explanations, involving hypoplasia of embryonic neural crest cells (NCCs), and declining androgen influence, respectively. Here, I assess the operation and potential interactions between these two mechanisms and consider their role in enhanced human adaptation to a cooperative sociocultural niche.\n\nMethodsI provide a review and synthesis of related literature with a focus on physiological mechanisms effecting domesticated reductions in masculinity and sexual dimorphism. Further, I examine pre-historic modes of socio-sexual selection likely to drive human self-domestication via reduced aggression and masculinity.\n\nResultsI find pluripotent NCCs provide progenitors for a wide range of vertebrate masculine features, acting as regular targets for sexually driven evolutionary change; suggesting domesticated hypoplasia of NCC-derived tissues would be sufficient to explain declines in masculine traits and features. However, lineage specific androgen receptor variability likely moderates these NCC-based effects.\n\nConclusionsThese findings extend theorised mechanisms driving noted physiological, morphological, and behavioural changes thought to indicate enhanced sociability and human and self-domestication. Multiple current explanations for human sociability are consistent with physiological domestication under socio-sexual selection favouring dampened masculine physiology and behaviour as adaptations to an enhanced sociocultural niche. The analysis highlights multiple avenues for further investigation.",

Here, we focus on endogenous tRFs (18-22 bases) derived from 3 end of human mature tRNAs (tRF-3) and their functions in gene repression. tRF-3 levels increase upon parental tRNA over-expression or tRNA induction by c-Myc oncogene activation. Elevated tRF-3 levels lead to repression of target genes with a sequence complementary to the tRF-3 in the 3 UTR. The tRF-3-mediated repression is Dicer-independent, Argonaute-dependent and the targets are recognized by 5 seed sequence rules similar to miRNAs. Furthermore, tRF-3s associate with GW proteins in P-bodies. RNA-seq identifies the endogenous target genes of tRF-3s that are specifically repressed upon tRF-3 induction. Overall, our analysis shows Dicer-independent tRF-3s, generated upon tRNA upregulation such as c-Myc overexpression, regulate gene expression globally through Argounate via seed sequence matches.",

    "abstract": "The mouse retina contains a single type of horizontal cell, a GABAergic interneuron that samples from all cone photoreceptors within reach and modulates their glutamatergic output via parallel feedback mechanisms. Because horizontal cells form an electrically-coupled network, they have been implicated in global signal processing, such as large scale contrast enhancement. Recently, it has been proposed that horizontal cells can also act locally at the level of individual cone photoreceptors. To test this possibility physiologically, we used two-photon microscopy to record light stimulus-evoked Ca2+ signals in cone axon terminals and horizontal cell dendrites as well as glutamate release in the outer plexiform layer. By selectively stimulating the two mouse cone opsins with green and UV light, we assessed whether signals from individual cones remain \\\"isolated\\\" within horizontal cell dendritic tips, or whether they spread across the dendritic arbour. Consistent with the mouse s opsin expression gradient, we found that the Ca2+ signals recorded from dendrites of dorsal horizontal cells were dominated by M- and those of ventral horizontal cells by S-opsin activation. The signals measured in neighbouring horizontal cell dendritic tips varied markedly in their chromatic preference, arguing against global processing. Rather, our experimental data and results from biophysically realistic modelling support the idea that horizontal cells can process cone input locally, extending the \\\"classical\\\" view of horizontal cells function. Pharmacologically removing horizontal cells from the circuitry reduced the sensitivity of the cone signal to low frequencies, suggesting that local horizontal cell feedback shapes the temporal properties of cone output.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LILight-evoked Ca2+ signals in horizontal cell dendrites reflect opsin gradient\\nC_LIO_LIChromatic preferences in neighbouring dendritic tips vary markedly\\nC_LIO_LIMouse horizontal cells process cone photoreceptor input locally\\nC_LIO_LILocal horizontal cell feedback shapes the temporal properties of cone output\\nC_LI\\n\\neTOC BlurbChapot et al. show that local light responses in mouse horizontal cell dendrites inherit properties, including chromatic preference, from the presynaptic cone photoreceptor, suggesting that their dendrites can provide \\\"private\\\" feedback to cones, for instance, to shape the temporal filtering properties of the cone synapse.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) mediate stress resistance indirectly via physiological mechanisms driven by the genes they regulate. When studying TF-mediated stress resistance, it is important to understand how TFs interact with different genetic backgrounds. Here, we fine-mapped the aluminum (Al) resistance QTL Alt12.1 to a 44 Kb region containing six gene models. Among them is ART1, which encodes a C2H2-type zinc finger TF required for Al resistance in rice. The parents of the mapping population, Al-resistant Azucena (tropical japonica) and Al-sensitive IR64 (indica), showed similar ART1 expression levels but extensive sequence polymorphism within the ART1 coding region. Using reciprocal near-isogenic lines (NILs) in the Azucena and IR64 genetic backgrounds, we examined how allele-swapping Alt12.1 would affect plant responses to Al. Analysis of global transcriptional responses to Al stress in roots of the NILs alongside their recurrent parents demonstrated that the ART1 from Al-resistant Azucena led to greater changes in gene expression in response to Al when compared to the ART1 from IR64 in both genetic backgrounds. The presence of the ART1 allele from the opposite parent affected the expression of several genes not previously implicated in rice Al tolerance. We highlight examples where putatively functional variation in cis-regulatory regions of ART1-regulated genes interacts with ART1 to determine gene expression in response to Al. This ART1-promoter interaction may be associated with transgressive variation for Al resistance in the Azucena x IR64 population. These results illustrate how ART1 interacts with the genetic background to contribute to quantitative phenotypic variation in rice Al resistance.",

Previous studies suggested carbohydrates as the only form of carbon transferred to the fungi. However, de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis has not been observed in AM fungi in absence of the plant. In a forward genetic approach, we identified two Lotus japonicus mutants defective in AM-specific paralogs of lipid biosynthesis genes (KASI and GPAT6). These mutants perturb fungal development and accumulation of emblematic fungal 16:1{omega}5 FAs. Using isotopolog profiling we demonstrate that 13C patterns of fungal FAs recapitulate those of wild-type hosts, indicating cross-kingdom lipid transfer from plants to fungi. This transfer of labelled FAs was not observed for the AM-specific lipid biosynthesis mutants. Thus, growth and development of beneficial AM fungi is not only fueled by sugars but depends on lipid transfer from plant hosts.",

To identify the genotype-phenotype correspondence, we perform live-cell imaging to determine the phenotype of each cell, and massively multiplexed FISH imaging to measure the barcode expressed in the same cell. We demonstrated the utility of this approach by screening for brighter and more photostable variants of the fluorescent protein YFAST.

Some limited understanding of PI3K signaling in brain cancer come from studies on neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) where signals transmitted via the PI3K pathway cooperate with other intracellular pathways and downstream transcription factors to regulate NSPC proliferation. To investigate the role for the PI3K pathway in glioma initiation and development, we generated a mouse model targeting the inducible expression of a Pik3caH1047A oncogenic mutation and simultaneous deletion of the PI3K negative regulator, Pten, in NSPCs. We show that the expression of a Pik3caH1047A was sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis but that simultaneous loss of Pten, was required for the development of invasive, high-grade glioma. Mutant NSPCs exhibited enhanced neurosphere forming capacity which correlated with increased Wnt signaling. We also show that loss of CREB in Pik3ca-PTEN tumors led to a longer symptom-free survival in mice. Taken together, our findings present a novel mouse model for high-grade glioma with which we demonstrate that the PI3K pathway is important for initiation of tumorigenesis and that disruption of downstream CREB signaling attenuates tumor expansion.",

Using live imaging of zebrafish larvae, we reveal that the ES undergoes cycles of slow pressure-driven inflation followed by rapid deflation every 1-3 hours. Using serial-section electron microscopy and adaptive optics lattice light-sheet microscopy, we find a pressure relief valve in the ES comprised of thin overlapping basal lamellae that dynamically extend over neighboring cells before rupturing under pressure leading to ES collapse. The unexpected discovery of a physical relief valve in the ear emphasizes the need for further study into how organs control fluid pressure, volume, flow, and ion homeostasis in development and disease.",

Osteocyte-conditional deletion impaired bone accrual and matrix collagen, while allele dosage-dependent deletion from all osteogenic lineage cells caused spontaneous fractures, with neonatal lethality only in dual homozygous knockouts. We identified putative target genes whose mutation in humans causes osteogenesis imperfecta and which contain promoter-proximate binding domains for the YAP/TAZ co-effector, TEAD4. Two candidates, Col1a1 and SerpinH1, exhibited reduced expression upon either YAP/TAZ deletion or YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibition by verteporfin.

    "abstract": "That population size affects the fate of new mutations arising in genomes, modulating both how frequently they arise and how efficiently natural selection is able to filter them, is well established. It is therefore clear that these distinct roles for population size that characterize different processes should affect the evolution of proteins and need to be carefully defined. Empirical evidence is consistent with a role for demography in influencing protein evolution, supporting the idea that functional constraints alone do not determine the composition of coding sequences.\\n\\nGiven that the relationship between population size, mutant fitness and fixation probability has been well characterized, estimating fitness from observed substitutions is well within reach with well-formulated models. Molecular evolution research has, therefore, increasingly begun to leverage concepts from population genetics to quantify the selective effects associated with different classes of mutation. However, in order for this type of analysis to provide meaningful information about the intra- and inter-specific evolution of coding sequences, a clear definition of concepts of population size, what they influence, and how they are best parameterized is essential.\\n\\nHere, we present an overview of the many distinct concepts that \\\"population size\\\" and \\\"effective population size\\\" may refer to, what they represent for studying proteins, and how this knowledge can be harnessed to produce better specified models of protein evolution.",

    "abstract": "Chondrodystrophy in dogs is defined by dysplastic, shortened long bones and premature degeneration and calcification of intervertebral discs. Independent genome-wide association analyses for skeletal dysplasia (short limbs) within a single breed (pBonferroni=0.0072) and intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) across breeds (pBonferroni=4.02x10-10) both identified a significant association to the same region on CFA12. Whole genome sequencing identified a highly expressed FGF4 retrogene within this shared region. The FGF4 retrogene segregated with limb length and had an odds ratio of 51.23 (95% CI = 46.69, 56.20) for IVDD. Long bone length in dogs is a unique example of multiple disease-causing retrocopies of the same parental gene in a mammalian species. FGF signaling abnormalities have been associated with skeletal dysplasia in humans, and our findings present opportunities for both selective elimination of a medically and financially devastating disease in dogs and further understanding of the ever-growing complexity of retrogene biology.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRapid evolution is a hallmark of reproductive genetic systems and arises through the combined processes of sequence divergence, gene gain and loss, and changes in gene and protein expression. While studies aiming to disentangle the molecular ramifications of these processes are progressing, we still know little about the genetic basis of evolutionary transitions in reproductive systems. Here we conduct the first comparative analysis of sperm proteomes in Lepidoptera, a group that broadly exhibits dichotomous spermatogenesis, in which males simultaneously produce a functional fertilization-competent sperm (eupyrene) and an incompetent sperm morph lacking DNA (apyrene). Through the integrated application of evolutionary proteomics and genomics, we characterize the genomic patterns associated with the origination of this unique spermatogenic process and assess the importance of genetic novelty in Lepidoptera sperm biology.\\n\\nResultsComparison of the newly characterized Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) sperm proteome to those of the Carolina sphinx moth (Manduca sexta) and the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) demonstrated conservation at the level of protein abundance and post-translational modification within Lepidoptera. In contrast, comparative genomic analyses across insects reveals significant divergence at two levels that differentiate the genetic architecture of sperm in Lepidoptera from other insects. First, a significant reduction in orthology among Monarch sperm genes relative to the remainder of the genome in non-Lepidopteran insect species was observed. Second, a substantial number of sperm proteins were found to be specific to Lepidoptera, in that they lack detectable homology to the genomes of more distantly related insects. Lastly, the functional importance of Lepidoptera specific sperm proteins is broadly supported by their increased abundance relative to proteins conserved across insects.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results suggest that the origin of heteromorphic spermatogenesis early in Lepidoptera evolution was associated with a burst of genetic novelty. This pattern of genomic diversification is distinct from the remainder of the genome and thus suggests that this transition has had a marked impact on Lepidoptera genome evolution. The identification of abundant sperm proteins unique to Lepidoptera, including proteins distinct between specific lineages, will accelerate future functional studies aiming to understand the developmental origin of dichotomous spermatogenesis and the functional diversification of the fertilization incompetent apyrene sperm morph.",

    "abstract": "CD163 is a scavenger receptor expressed on innate immune cell populations which can be shed from the plasma membrane via the metalloprotease ADAM17 to generate a soluble peptide with lympho-inhibitory properties. The purpose of this study was to investigate CD163 as a possible effector of stroke-induced adaptive immune system suppression. Liquid biopsies were collected from ischemic stroke patients (n=39), neurologically asymptomatic controls (n=20), and stroke mimics (n=20) within 24 hours of symptom onset. Peripheral blood ADAM17 activity and soluble CD163 levels were elevated in stroke patients relative to non-stroke control groups, and negatively associated with post-stroke lymphocyte counts. Subsequent in vitro experiments suggested that this stroke-induced elevation in circulating soluble CD163 likely originates from activated monocytic cells, as serum from stroke patients stimulated ADAM17-dependant CD163 shedding from healthy donor-derived monocytes. Additional in vitro experiments demonstrated that stroke-induced elevations in circulating soluble CD163 can elicit direct suppressive effects on the adaptive immune system, as serum from stroke patients inhibited the proliferation of healthy donor-derived lymphocytes, an effect which was attenuated following serum CD163 depletion. Collectively, these observations provide novel evidence that the innate immune system employs protective mechanisms aimed at mitigating the risk of post-stroke autoimmune complications driven by adaptive immune system overactivation, and that CD163 is key mediator of this phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Throughout an animals postembryonic development, neuronal circuits must maintain appropriate output even as the body grows. The contribution of structural adaptation -- neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity -- to circuit development remains unclear. In a previous paper (Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016), we measured the detailed neuronal morphological structures subserving neuronal connectivity in Drosophila. Here, we examine how neuronal morphology and connectivity change across postembyronic development. Using new and existing serial section electron microscopy volumes, we reconstructed an identified nociceptive circuit in two larvae, one 1st instar and one 3rd instar. We found extremely consistent, topographically-arranged circuit structure. Five-fold increases in size of interneurons were associated with compensatory structural changes that maintained cell-type-specific synaptic input as a fraction of total inputs. An increase in number of synaptic contacts was accompanied with a disproportionate increase in the number of small dendritic terminal branches relative to other neuronal compartments. We propose that these precise patterns of structural growth act to conserve the computational function of a circuit, for example determining the location of a nociceptive stimulus.",

    "abstract": "Cas nucleases are popular tools for genome editing applications due to their ability to introduce DNA breaks at desired genomic locations. Such differential targeting is achieved through loading an RNA guide complimentary to the intended target sequence. As it turns out, sequences with only a partial match to the guide can also be cleaved. A large number of experiments have shed light on this off-targeting, outlining a number of rather peculiar empirical rules that detail the effect of mismatches at various positions and at various relative distances. We construct a kinetic model predicting on-target cleavage efficiency as well as off-target specificity. Our model explains a unified targeting rule for any target harboring mismatches, independent of their abundance and placing, and the observed decoupling between efficiency and specificity when protein-DNA interactions are weakened. We favorably compare our model to published experimental data from CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-Cpf1, CRISPR-Cascade, as well as to the human Argonaute 2 systems. Understanding the origins of off-targeting principles is important for the further development of CRISPR-Cas as a precise genome editing tool.",

This transcriptional cyclin interacts with chromatin regulators of the Enhancer of Trithorax and Polycomb (ETP) and Polycomb families. We investigate here the importance of these interactions in developmental stability. Deregulation of Cyclin G highlights an organ intrinsic control of developmental noise, linked to the ETP-interacting domain, and enhanced by mutations in genes encoding members of the Polycomb Repressive complexes PRC1 and PR-DUB. Deep-sequencing of wing imaginal discs deregulating CycG reveals that high developmental noise correlates with up-regulation of genes involved in translation and down-regulation of genes involved in energy production. Most Cyclin G direct transcriptional targets are also direct targets of PRC1, ASX and RNAPolII in the developing wing. Altogether, our results suggest that Cyclin G, PRC1 and PR-DUB cooperate for developmental stability.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWe demonstrate a replicable model health district for Madagascar. The governments of many low-income countries have adopted health policies that follow international standards, and yet there are four hundred million people without basic access to primary care. Closing this global health delivery gap is typically framed as an issue of scale-up, accomplished primarily through integrating international donor funds with broad-based health system strengthening (HSS) efforts. However, there is no established process by which healthcare systems measure improvements at the point of service and how those, in turn, impact population health. There is no gold standard, equivalent to randomized trials of individual-level interventions, for health systems research. Here, we present a framework for a model district in Madagascar where national policies are implemented along with additional health system interventions to allow for bottom-up adaptation.\\n\\nSettingThe intervention takes place in a government district in Madagascar, which includes 1 district hospital, 20 primary care health centers, and a network of community health workers.\\n\\nInterventionThe program simultaneously strengthens the WHOs six building blocks of HSS at all levels of the health system within a government district and pioneers a data platform that includes 1) strengthening the districts health management information systems; 2) monitoring and evaluation dashboards; and 3) a longitudinal cohort demographic and health study of over 1,500 households, with a true baseline in intervention and comparison groups.\\n\\nConclusionThe integrated intervention and data platform allows for the evaluation of system output indicators as well as population-level impact indicators, such as mortality rates. It thus supports field-based implementation and policy research to fill the know-do gap, while providing the foundation for a new science of sustaining health.\\n\\nData Sharing StatementData can be made available upon request by emailing research@pivotworks.org.",

Birth-death and coalescent processes have been introduced to model the stochastic dynamics of epidemic spread under common epidemiological models such as the SIS and SIR models, and are successfully used to infer phylogenetic trees together with transmission (birth) and removal (death) rates. These methods either integrate analytically over past incidence and prevalence to infer rate parameters, and thus cannot explicitly infer past incidence or prevalence, or allow such inference only in the coalescent limit of large population size. Here we introduce a particle filtering framework to explicitly infer prevalence and incidence trajectories along with phylogenies and epidemiological model parameters from genomic sequences and case count data in a manner consistent with the underlying birth-death model.

There has been renewed interest in environmental releases of engineered gene drives due to recent proof of principle experiments with the CRISPR-Cas9 system as a drive mechanism. Release of modified organisms, however, is controversial, especially when the drive mechanism could theoretically alter all individuals of a species. Thus, it is desirable to have countermeasures to reverse a drive if a problem arises. Several genetic mechanisms for limiting or eliminating gene drives have been proposed and/or developed, including synthetic resistance, reversal drives, and immunizing reversal drives. While predictions about efficacy of these mechanisms have been optimistic, we lack detailed analyses of their expected dynamics. We develop a discrete time model for population genetics of a drive and proposed genetic countermeasures. Efficacy of drive reversal varies between countermeasures. For some parameter values, the model predicts unexpected behavior including polymorphic equilibria and oscillatory dynamics. The timing and number of released individuals containing a genetic countermeasure can substantially impact outcomes. The choice among countermeasures by researchers and regulators will depend on specific goals and population parameters of target populations.",

    "abstract": "Segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis depends on their ability to reorganize within the nucleus, discriminate among potential partners, and stabilize pairwise associations through assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC). Here we report a high-resolution time-course analysis of these key early events during Caenorhabditis elegans meiosis. Labeled nucleotides are incorporated specifically into the X chromosomes during the last two hours of S phase, a property we exploit to identify a highly synchronous cohort of nuclei. By tracking X-labeled nuclei through early meiotic prophase, we define the sequence and duration of chromosome movement, nuclear reorganization, pairing at pairing centers (PCs), and SC assembly. Appearance of ZYG-12 foci (marking attachment of PCs to the nuclear envelope) and onset of active mobilization occur within an hour after S phase completion. Movement occurs for nearly 2 hours before stable pairing is observed at PCs, and autosome movement continues for roughly 4 hours thereafter. Chromosomes are tightly clustered during a 2-3 hour post-pairing window, during which the bulk of SC assembly occurs; however, initiation of SC assembly can precede evident chromosome clustering. SC assembly on autosomes begins immediately after PC pairing is detected and is completed within about 3.5 hours. For the X chromosomes, PC pairing is contemporaneous with autosomal pairing, but autosomes complete synapsis earlier (on average) than X chromosomes, implying that X chromosomes have a delay in onset and/or a slower rate of SC assembly. Additional evidence suggests that transient association among chromosomes sharing the same PC protein may contribute to partner discrimination.",

    "abstract": "Given the increasing amount of neuroimaging studies, there is a growing need to summarize published results. Coordinate-based meta-analyses use the locations of statistically significant local maxima with possibly the associated effect sizes to aggregate studies. In this paper, we investigate the influence of key characteristics of a coordinate-based meta-analysis on (1) the balance between false and true positives and (2) the reliability of the outcome from a coordinate-based meta-analysis. More particularly, we consider the influence of the chosen group level model at the study level (fixed effects, ordinary least squares or mixed effects models), the type of coordinate-based meta-analysis (Activation Likelihood Estimation, fixed effects and random effects meta-analysis) and the amount of studies included in the analysis (10, 20 or 35). To do this, we apply a resampling scheme on a large dataset (N = 1400) to create a test condition and compare this with an independent evaluation condition. The test condition corresponds to subsampling participants into studies and combine these using meta-analyses. The evaluation condition corresponds to a high-powered group analysis. We observe the best performance when using mixed effects models in individual studies combined with a random effects meta-analysis. This effect increases with the number of studies included in the meta-analysis. We also show that the popular Activation Likelihood Estimation procedure is a valid alternative, though the results depend on the chosen threshold for significance. Furthermore, this method requires at least 20 to 35 studies. Finally, we discuss the differences, interpretations and limitations of our results.",

    "abstract": "The incubation period of a disease is the time between an initiating pathologic event and the onset of symptoms1. For typhoid fever2,3, polio4, measles5, leukemia6 and many other diseases7-10, the incubation period is highly variable. Some affected people take much longer than average to show symptoms, leading to a distribution of incubation periods that is right skewed and often approximately lognormal8-10. Although this statistical pattern was discovered more than sixty years ago8, it remains an open question to explain its ubiquity11. Here we propose an explanation based on evolutionary dynamics on graphs12-18. For simple models of a mutant or pathogen invading a network-structured population of healthy cells, we show that skewed distributions of incubation periods emerge for a wide range of assumptions about invader fitness, competition dynamics, and network structure. The skewness stems from stochastic mechanisms associated with two classic problems in probability theory: the coupon collector and the random walk19,20. Unlike previous explanations11,21 that rely crucially on heterogeneity, our results hold even for homogeneous populations. Thus, we predict that two equally healthy individuals subjected to equal doses of equally pathogenic agents may, by chance alone, show remarkably different time courses of disease.",

    "abstract": "Many researchers want to report an R2 to measure the variance explained by a model. When the model includes correlation among data, such as phylogenetic models and mixed models, defining an R2 faces two conceptual problems. (i) It is unclear how to measure the variance explained by predictor (independent) variables when the model contains covariances. (ii) Researchers may want the R2 to include the variance explained by the covariances by asking questions such as \\\"How much of the variance is explained by phylogeny?\\\" Here, I investigate three R2s for phylogenetic and mixed models. A least-squares R2ls is an extension of the ordinary least-squares R2 that weights residuals by variances and covariances estimated by the model; it is closely related to R2glmm proposed by Nakagawa & Schielzeth (2013). The conditional expectation R2ce is based on \\\"predicting\\\" each residual from the remaining residuals of the fitted model. The likelihood ratio R2lr was first used by Cragg & Uhler (1970) for logistic regression, and here is used with the standardization proposed by Nagelkerke (1991). These three R2s are formulated as partial R2s, making it possible to compare the contributions of mean components (regression coefficients in phylogenetic models and fixed effects in mixed models) and variance components (phylogenetic correlations and random effects) to the fit of models. The properties of the R2s for phylogenetic models were assessed using simulations for continuous and binary response data (phylogenetic generalized least squares and phylogenetic logistic regression). Because the R2s are designed broadly for any model for correlated data, the R2s were also compared for LMMs and GLMMs. R2ls, R2ce, and R2lr all have good performance, and each has advantages and disadvantages for different applications. These R2s are computed in the R package rr2 (https://github.com/arives/rr2). [Binomial regression, coefficient of determination, non-independent residuals, phylogenetic model, pseudo-likelihood]",

    "abstract": "Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) Vif mediates degradation of two anti-lentiviral feline APOBEC3 (fA3) proteins, fA3Z3 and fA3Z2bZ3. HIV-1 Vif targets the restriction factor human APOBEC3G (A3G, hA3Z2g-Z1c) for proteasome degradation to mediate viral evasion. Despite this similarity, FIV and HIV-1 Vif share limited homology. Vif binds hA3Z2g-Z1c through its N-terminal region, while its C-terminal region binds to an E3-ligase complex containing Cullin5 and Elongin B/C. Further, HIV-1 Vif contains critical domains in its C-terminus, including an adjacent BC box, the only shared domain between FIV and HIV-1 Vif, and a non-classical zinc finger (HCCH) domain. Felid lentivirus Vif, however, contains a highly conserved KCCC motif. While both Vifs have evolved to counteract select A3 antiretroviral proteins, the FIV Vif domains necessary to target fA3s for degradation are incompletely understood. To identify these domains, we used the well-characterized HIV-1 Vif domains to show that distinct mutations within the BC box of FIV Vif prevent fA3Z3 and fA3Z2bZ3 degradation and reduce virion infectivity. We also found that mutating any single residue in the KCCC motif blocked fA3 targeting and impaired FIV infectivity and replication. These mutations also failed to disrupt the FIV Vif and Cullin5 interaction. Further, we showed that, in contrast to the HCCH domain in HIV-1 Vif, the KCCC domain of FIV Vif does not bind zinc. However, unlike HIV-1 Vif, FIV Vif (C36 isolate) reduces intracellular levels of co-expressed Cullin5 proteins, a novel finding. Our results reveal important C-terminal residues in FIV Vif and show that the BC box and KCCC regions are critical for fA3 degradation, infectivity, and spreading replication.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the precise relation between functional connectivity and structural (white-matter) connectivity and how these relationships account for cognitive changes in older adults are major challenges for neuroscience. We investigate these issues using a new approach in which structural equation modeling (SEM) is employed to integrate functional and structural connectivity data analyzed with a common framework based on regions connected by canonical tract groups (CTGs). CTGs (e.g., uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, etc.) serve as a common currency between functional and structural connectivity matrices, and ensures that the same amount of data contributing to brain-behavior relationships. We used this approach to investigate the neural mechanisms supporting memory for items and memory for associations, and how they are affected by healthy aging. Our results are threefold. Firstly, structural and functional CTGs made independent contributions to associative memory performance, suggesting that both forms of connectivity underlie age-related changes in associative memory. Secondly, distinct groups of CTGs supported associative versus item memory. Lastly, the relationship between functional and structural connectivity was best explained by the relationship between latent variables describing functional and structural CTGs based on a constrained set of tracts--but no one specific CTG group--suggesting that age effects in connectivity are constrained to specific pathways. These results provide further insights into the interplay between structural and functional connectivity patterns, and help to elucidate their relative contribution to age-related changes in associative memory performance.",
