    "abstract": "The non-cell autonomous transfer of OTX2 homeoprotein transcription factor into juvenile mouse cerebral cortex regulates parvalbumin interneuron maturation and critical period timing. By analyzing gene expression in primary visual cortex of wild-type and Otx2+/GFP mice at plastic and non-plastic ages, we identified several putative genes implicated in Otx2-dependent visual cortex plasticity for ocular dominance. Cortical OTX2 infusion in juvenile mice induced Gadd45b/g expression through direct regulation of transcription. Intriguingly, a reverse effect was found in the adult, where reducing cortical OTX2 resulted in Gadd45b/g up-regulation. Viral expression of Gadd45b in adult visual cortex directly induced ocular dominance plasticity with concomitant changes in MeCP2 foci within parvalbumin interneurons and in methylation states of several plasticity gene promoters, suggesting epigenetic regulation. This interaction provides a molecular mechanism for OTX2 to trigger critical period plasticity yet suppress adult plasticity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEvaluation of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) ratios in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems can advance our understanding of biological processes, nutrient cycling and the fate of organic matter (OM) in aquatic ecosystems. Eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems can disrupt the accumulation and decomposition of OM which serves as the base of the aquatic food web, and is central to the effectiveness of a treatment wetland. This study investigated nutrient stoichiometry within and between wetland ecosystem compartments (i.e. water column, vegetation, flocculent and soil) of two treatment flow-ways (FWs) in the Everglades Stormwater Treatment Areas located in south Florida (USA). These FWs include an emergent aquatic vegetation cell dominated by Typha spp.(cattail) and a submerged aquatic vegetation cell composed of species such as Chara spp. (muskgrass) and Potamogeton spp. (pondweed). The primary objective of this evaluation was to determine if nutrient stoichiometry is consistent within and between ecosystems and compartments to understand biogeochemical cycling and controls of nutrient removal within a treatment wetland ecosystem.\\n\\nResultsThis study demonstrates that C, N, and P stoichiometry can be highly variable among ecosystem compartments and between differing wetland ecosystems. Generally, total P declined along the length of each treatment FW in all ecosystem compartments, whereas trends in total N and C trends were more variable. These changes in C and nutrient concentrations result in variable nutrient stoichiometry along treatment FWs signaling potential changes in absolute and relative nutrient availability and biogeochemical processes.\\n\\nConclusionsAssessment of wetland nutrient stoichiometry between and within ecosystem compartments suggest decoupling of C:N:P relationships likely as a consequence of differential external nutrient supply, differences in primary producer communities and differential decomposition of organic matter. However, stoichiometry varies often monotonous along the flow paths, likely exhibiting a response to nutrient loading. Differences in C:N:P ratios in primary producers, light availability, microbial immobilization in the early stage of decomposition as well as nutrient mining during decomposition of OM are likely feedback mechanisms that lead to deviations from fixed stoichiometry, which in turn may have considerable influence on nutrient removal rates. This information could be used to further understand water treatment performance with respect to stoichiometric processes and OM decomposition.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal metabolism is an emerging hallmark of cancer. Cancer cells utilize both aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for energy production and biomass synthesis. Understanding the metabolic reprogramming in cancer can help design therapies to target metabolism and thereby to improve prognosis. We have previously argued that more malignant tumors are usually characterized by a more modular expression pattern of cancer-associated genes. In this work, we analyzed the expression patterns of metabolism genes in terms of modularity for 371 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that higher modularity significantly correlated with glycolytic phenotype, later tumor stages, higher metastatic potential, and cancer recurrence, all of which contributed to poorer prognosis. Among patients with recurred tumor, we found the correlation of higher modularity with worse prognosis during early to mid-progression. Furthermore, we developed metrics to calculate individual modularity, which was shown to be predictive of cancer recurrence and patients survival and therefore may serve as a prognostic biomarker. Our overall conclusion is that more aggressive HCC tumors, as judged by decreased host survival probability, had more modular expression patterns of metabolic genes. These results may be used to identify cancer driver genes and for drug design.",

However, only two choanoflagellate genomes are currently available, providing poor coverage of their diversity. We sequenced transcriptomes of 19 additional choanoflagellate species to produce a comprehensive reconstruction of the gains and losses that shaped the ancestral animal gene repertoire. We find roughly 1,700 gene families with origins on the animal stem lineage, of which only a core set of 36 are conserved across animals. We find more than 350 gene families that were previously thought to be animal-specific actually evolved before the animal-choanoflagellate divergence, including Notch and Delta, Toll-like receptors, and glycosaminoglycan hydrolases that regulate animal extracellular matrix (ECM). In the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca helianthica, we show that a glycosaminoglycan hydrolase modulates rosette colony size, suggesting a link between ECM regulation and morphogenesis in choanoflagellates and animals.\\n\\nData AvailabilityRaw sequencing reads: NCBI BioProject PRJNA419411 (19 choanoflagellate transcriptomes), PRJNA420352 (S. rosetta polyA selection test)\\n\\nTranscriptome assemblies, annotations, and gene families: https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5686984\\n\\nProtocols: https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.kwscxee",

    "abstract": "The therapeutic effect of targeted kinase inhibitors can be significantly reduced by intrinsic or acquired resistance mutations that modulate the affinity of the drug for the kinase. In cancer, the majority of missense mutations are rare, making it difficult to predict their impact on inhibitor affinity. This complicates the practice of precision medicine, pairing of patients with clinical trials, and development of next-generation inhibitors. Here, we examine the potential for alchemical free-energy calculations to predict how kinase mutations modulate inhibitor affinities to Abl, a major target in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We find these calculations can achieve useful accuracy in predicting resistance for a set of eight FDA-approved kinase inhibitors across 144 clinically-identified point mutations, achieving a root mean square error in binding free energy changes of [Formula] kcal/mol (95% confidence interval) and correctly classifying mutations as resistant or susceptible with [Formula] accuracy. Since these calculations are fast on modern GPUs, this benchmark establishes the potential for physical modeling to collaboratively support the rapid assessment and anticipation of the potential for patient mutations to affect drug potency in clinical applications.",

Thalamic neurogenesis occurs over a short period during mammalian embryonic development. These features have hampered the effort to understand how regionalization, cell divisions and fate specification are coordinated and produce a wide array of nuclei that exhibit distinct patterns of gene expression and functions. Here, we performed in vivo clonal analysis to track the divisions of individual progenitor cells and spatial allocation of their progeny in the developing mouse thalamus. Quantitative analysis of clone compositions revealed evidence for sequential generation of distinct sets of thalamic nuclei based on the location of the founder progenitor cells. Furthermore, we identified intermediate progenitor cells that produced neurons populating more than one thalamic nuclei, indicating a prolonged specification of nuclear fate. Our study reveals an organizational principle that governs the spatial and temporal progression of cell divisions and fate specification, and provides a framework for studying cellular heterogeneity and connectivity in the mammalian thalamus.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTechnological advancements in high-throughput DNA sequencing have led to an exponential growth of sequencing data being produced and stored as a byproduct of biomedical research. Despite its public availability, a majority of this data remains hard to query to the research community due to a lack of efficient data representation and indexing solutions. One of the available techniques to represent read data is a condensed form as an assembly graph. Such a representation contains all sequence information but does not store contextual information and metadata.\\n\\nResultsWe present two new approaches for a compressed representation of a graph coloring: a lossless compression scheme based on a novel application of wavelet tries as well as a highly accurate lossy compression based on a set of Bloom filters. Both strategies retain a coloring with dynamically changing graph topology. We present construction and merge procedures for both methods and evaluate their performance on a wide range of different datasets. By dropping the requirement of a fully lossless compression and using the topological information of the underlying graph, we can reduce memory requirements by up to three orders of magnitude. Representing individual colors as independently stored modules, our approaches are fully dynamic and can be efficiently parallelized. These properties allow for an easy upscaling to the problem sizes common to the biomedical domain.\\n\\nAvailabilityWe provide prototype implementations in C++, summaries of our experiments as well as links to all datasets publicly at https://github.com/ratschlab/graph_annotation.\\n\\nContactandre.kahles@inf.ethz.ch, carsten@brown.edu, Gunnar.Ratsch@ratschlab.org",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 system, which relies on RNA-guided DNA cleavage to induce site-specific DNA double-strand breaks, is a powerful tool for genome editing. This system has been successfully adapted for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by expressing Cas9 and the single-guide RNA (sgRNA) from a plasmid. In the procedures published to date, the cloning step that introduces a specific sgRNA target sequence into the plasmid is the most tedious and time-consuming. To increase the efficiency of applying the CRISPR/Cas9 system in fission yeast, we here developed a cloning-free procedure that uses gap repair in fission yeast cells to assemble two linear DNA fragments, a gapped Cas9-encoding plasmid and a PCR-amplified sgRNA insert, into a circular plasmid. Both fragments contain only a portion of the ura4 or bsdMX marker so that only the correctly assembled plasmid can confer uracil prototrophy or blasticidin resistance. We show that this gap-repair-based and cloning-free CRISPR/Cas9 procedure permits rapid and efficient point mutation knock-in, endogenous N-terminal tagging, and genomic sequence deletion in fission yeast.",

Interest in the species was sparked in New Zealand following a series of dog deaths caused by ingestions of slugs containing high levels of the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin. Here we describe the genetic structure and demographic history of P. maculata populations from five principle locations in New Zealand based on extensive analyses of 12 microsatellite loci and the COI and CytB regions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Microsatellite data showed significant differentiation between northern and southern populations with population structure being associated with previously described regional variations in tetrodotoxin concentrations. However, mtDNA sequence data did not support such structure, revealing a star-shaped haplotype network with estimates of expansion time suggesting a population expansion in the Pleistocene era. Inclusion of publicly available mtDNA sequence from Argentinian sea slugs did not alter the star-shaped network. We interpret our data as indicative of a single founding population that fragmented following geographical changes that brought about the present day north-south divide in New Zealand waters. Lack of evidence of cryptic species supports data indicating that differences in toxicity of individuals among regions are a consequence of differences in diet.",

Our recent work, which we believe will lead to a paradigm shift in sensorimotor research, has shown that in addition to these movement related variables, activity in M1, and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), are also modulated by context, such as value, during both active movement and movement observation. Here we expand on the investigation of reward modulation in M1, showing that reward level changes the neural tuning function of M1 units to both kinematic as well as dynamic related variables. In addition, we show that this reward-modulated activity is present during brain machine interface (BMI) control. We suggest that by taking into account these context dependencies of M1 modulation, we can produce more robust BMIs. Toward this goal, we demonstrate that we can classify multiple levels of reward from M1 on a movement-by-movement basis under BMI control and use this to gate multiple linear BMI decoders toward improved offline performance. These findings demonstrate that it is possible and meaningful to design a more accurate BMI decoder that takes reward and context into consideration. Our next step in this development will be to incorporate this gating system, or a continuous variant of it, into online BMI performance",

Computational models based on ideal-observer theory have provided quantitative accounts of human gaze selection in a range of visual search tasks. According to these models, gaze is directed to the position in a visual scene, at which uncertainty about task relevant properties will be reduced maximally with the next look. However, in tasks going beyond a single action, delayed rewards can play a crucial role thereby necessitating planning. Here we investigate whether humans are capable of planning more than the next single eye movement. We found evidence that our subjects behavior was better explained by an ideal planner compared to the ideal observer. In particular, the location of the first fixation differed depending on the stimulus and the time available for the search. Overall, our results are the first evidence that our visual system is capable of planning.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDengue is the most rapidly spreading viral disease transmitted by the bite of infected Aedes mosquitos. Pathogenesis of dengue is still unclear; although host genetic factors, immune responses and virus serotypes have been proposed to contribute to disease severity. The development of high-throughput methods have allowed to scale up capabilities of identifying the key markers of inflammation. Since NS1 protein of dengue virus has been reported to activate immune cells towards enhanced inflammation through TLR2, we examined the role of a polymorphism, a 23bp deletion in 5UTR region of TLR2 gene in patients with dengue (with and without warning signs) and correlated with plasma levels of inflammatory mediators with disease severity and viral serotypes.\\n\\nMethodsEighty nine patients classified as per WHO 2009 criteria during dengue outbreak in Odisha, India in 2016 were included in the current study. Presence of dengue virus (DENV) was demonstrated by detecting NS1 antigen, IgM capture ELISA and serotypes in circulation were discriminated by type-specific RT-PCR and/or sequencing. Sixty-one confirmed dengue cases were typed for TLR2 indel polymorphism and compared with 485 disease free controls. Plasma samples were assayed for 41-plex cytokine/ chemokines using Luminex bead based immunoassay.\\n\\nResultsPresence of 23bp deletion allele of TLR2 gene was significantly more in patients with severe dengue in comparison to dengue fever cases (p= 0.03; Odds ratio 4.05) although the frequency of insertion (Ins) allele of TLR2 was comparable in healthy controls and dengue cases (82.4 and 87.9 % respectively). Seventy-three (82%) samples were found to be positive by NS1/IgM capture ELISA/ RT-PCR. DENV-2 was predominant (58%) during the outbreak. Among the host inflammatory biomarkers 9 molecules were significantly altered in dengue patients when compared to healthy controls. The increased levels of IFN-{gamma}, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-1R and MIP-1{beta} correlated significantly with severe dengue.\\n\\nConclusionsThe frequency of 23bp Indel mutation of TLR2 was comparable between healthy controls and dengue fever (with and without warning signs), suggesting that this indel mutation does not contribute significantly to susceptibility/ resistance to dengue; however, del allele of TLR2 gene was significantly more associated in patients with severe dengue symptoms when compared to dengue fever cases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReproducibility of a research is a key element in the modern science and it is mandatory for any industrial application. It represents the ability of replicating an experiment independently by the location and the operator. Therefore, a study can be considered reproducible only if all used data are available and the exploited computational analysis workflow is clearly described. However, today for reproducing a complex bioinformatics analysis, the raw data and a list of tools used in the workflow could be not enough to guarantee the reproducibility of the results obtained. Indeed, different releases of the same tools and/or of the system libraries (exploited by such tools) might lead to sneaky reproducibility issues.\\n\\nResultsTo address this challenge, we established the Reproducible Bioinformatics Project (RBP), which is a non-profit and open-source project, whose aim is to provide a schema and an infrastructure, based on docker images and R package, to provide reproducible results in Bioinformatics. One or more Docker images are then defined for a workflow (typically one for each task), while the workflow implementation is handled via R-functions embedded in a package available at github repository. Thus, a bioinformatician participating to the project has firstly to integrate her/his workflow modules into Docker image(s) exploiting an Ubuntu docker image developed ad hoc by RPB to make easier this task. Secondly, the workflow implementation must be realized in R according to an R-skeleton function made available by RPB to guarantee homogeneity and reusability among different RPB functions. Moreover she/he has to provide the R vignette explaining the package functionality together with an example dataset which can be used to improve the user confidence in the workflow utilization.\\n\\nConclusionsReproducible Bioinformatics Project provides a general schema and an infrastructure to distribute robust and reproducible workflows. Thus, it guarantees to final users the ability to repeat consistently any analysis independently by the used UNIX-like architecture.",

In this study, we examined the evolutionary dynamics of the developmental sequence on a macroevolutionary scale using the teleost. Using the information from previous reports describing the development of 31 species, we extracted the developmental sequences of 19 landmark events involving the formation of phylogenetically conserved body parts; we then inferred ancestral developmental sequences by two different parsimony-based methods--event-pairing (Jeffery, Bininda-Emonds, Coates & Richardson, 2002a) and continuous analysis (Germain & Laurin, 2009). The phylogenetic comparisons of these sequences revealed event-dependent heterogeneity in the frequency of sequence changes. Most of the sequence changes occurred as exchanges of temporally neighboring events. The phylogenetic analyses suggested that the ancestral species had experienced frequent changes in developmental sequences. Although the analyses showed that these heterochronic changes accumulated along phylogenic time, the precise distribution of the changes over the teleost phylogeny remains unclear due to technical limitations. Finally, this first comprehensive analysis of teleost developmental sequences will provide solid ground on which to elucidate the significance of developmental timing in animal morphological diversification.",

Although many genes or regulators involved in chloroplast biogenesis and development have been isolated and characterized, identification of novel components associated with cold is still lacking. In this study, we reported the functional characterization of white stripe leaf 5 (wsl5) mutant in rice. The mutant developed white-striped leaves during early leaf development and was albinic when planted under cold stress. Genetic and molecular analysis revealed that WSL5 encodes a novel chloroplast-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat protein. RNA-seq analysis showed that expression of nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes in the mutant was significantly repressed, and expression of many chloroplast-encoded genes was also significantly changed. Notably, the WSL5 mutation caused defects in editing of rpl2 and atpA, and in splicing of rpl2 and rps12. Chloroplast ribosome biogenesis was impaired under cold stress. We propose that WSL5 is required for normal chloroplast development in rice under cold stress.",

Sex differences in recombination have been previously observed by analyses of recombination end-products. To understand when and how sex differences are established, we built genome-wide maps of meiotic DSBs in both male and female mice. We found that most recombination initiates at sex-biased DSB hotspots. Local context, the choice of DSB targeting pathway and sex-specific patterns of DNA methylation give rise to these differences. Sex differences are not limited to the initiation stage, as the rate at which DSBs are repaired as crossovers appears to differ between the sexes in distal regions. This uneven repair patterning may be linked to the higher aneuploidy rate in females. Together, these data demonstrate that sex differences occur early in meiotic recombination.",

However, fast progress in the field applied mostly to human and mouse research, with only few studies devoted to other model vertebrates. We present the first in-depth characterization of the TCR{beta} repertoire in a non-model mammal with limited genomic resources available - the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). We used 5'RACE and Illumina HTS to describe V and J segments and to qualitatively characterize preferential V-J segment usage and CDR3 length distribution. Finally, a molecular protocol integrating unique molecular identifiers was used for quantitative analysis of CDR3 repertoire with stringent error correction. We found 37 V and 11 J genes that were orthologous to mice genes. A conservative, lower bound estimation of the TCR{beta} repertoire was 1.7-2.3x105 clonotypes, and the degree of sharing of the observed repertoire between any two individuals was 3.6% of nucleotide sequences and 14.3% of amino acid sequences. Our work adds a crucial element to the immunogenetic resources available for the bank vole, an important species in ecological and evolutionary research. The workflow that we developed can be applied for immune repertoire sequencing of non-model species, including endangered vertebrates.",

Both the co-expression and differential co-expression analysis suggested these genes to be interconnected as a core network and that their regulations were strengthened during the transition to disease states. Functional studies suggested the dysregulated genes to be associated with aging and synaptic function. Further, we checked the evolutionary conservation of the gene co-expression and found that human and mouse brain might have divergent transcriptional co-regulation even when they had conserved gene expression profiles.\\n\\nConclusionOverall, our study reveals a profile of transcriptional dysregulation in the genesis of Alzheimers disease by forming a core network with altered regulation; the core network is associated with Alzheimers diseases by affecting the aging and synaptic functions related genes; the gene regulation in brain may not be conservative between human and mouse.",

    "abstract": "Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses are important pathogens infecting almost all types of organisms. Experimental evidences from mutant distributions and amplification kinetics of viral RNA suggest that these pathogens may follow different RNA replication modes, ranging from the stamping machine replication (SMR) to the geometric replication (GR) modes. Despite previous theoretical works have focused on the evolutionary dynamics of RNA viruses amplifying their genomes with different strategies, few is known in terms of the bifurcations and transitions involving error thresholds (mutation-induced dominance of mutants) and lethal mutagenesis (mutation-induced extinction of all sequences). Here we analyze a dynamical system describing the intracellular amplification of viral RNA genomes evolving on a single-peak fitness landscape focusing on three cases considering neutral, deleterious, and lethal mutants spectra. In our model, the different replication modes are introduced with parameter : with  {gtrsim} 0 for the SMR and  = 1 for the GR. We analytically derive the critical mutation rates causing lethal mutagenesis and error catastrophe, governed by transcritical bifurcations that depend on parameters , k1 (replicative fitness of mutants), and on the spontaneous degradation rates of the sequences,{epsilon} . For the lethal case the critical mutation rate involving lethal mutagenesis is [Formula]. Here, the SMR involves lower critical mutation rates, being the system more robust to lethal mutagenesis replicating closer to the GR mode. This result is also found for the neutral and deleterious cases, but for these later cases lethal mutagenesis can shift to the error catastrophe once the replication mode surpasses a threshold given by [Formula].",

In the cell body and ciliary matrix, RS proteins are present in a 12S precursor, which is converted into axonemal 20S spokes consisting of a head and stalk. To study RS assembly in vivo, we expressed fluorescent protein (FP)-tagged versions of the head protein RSP4 and the stalk protein RSP3 to rescue the corresponding Chlamydomonas mutants pfl, lacking spoke heads, and pf14, lacking RSs entirely. RSP3 and RSP4 mostly co-migrated by intraflagellar transport (IFT). Transport was elevated during ciliary assembly. IFT of RSP4-FP depended on RSP3. To study RS assembly independently of ciliogenesis, strains expressing FP-tagged RS proteins were mated to untagged cells with, without, or with partial RSs. RSP4-FP is added a tip-to-base fashion to preexisting pf1 spoke stalks while de novo RS assembly occurred lengthwise. In wild-type cilia, the exchange rate of head protein RSP4 exceeded that of the stalk protein RSP3 suggesting increased turnover of spoke heads. The data indicate that RSP3 and RSP4 while transported together separate inside cilia during RS repair and maintenance. The 12S RS precursor encompassing both proteins could represent transport form of the RS ensuring stoichiometric delivery by IFT. (196 of 200)",

To understand these interactions, we performed RNA-seq analysis after H2Bub1 loss, Cdk9 inhibition, or both. Either Cdk9 inhibition or H2Bub1 loss increased levels of antisense transcription initiating within coding regions of distinct subsets of genes; ablation of both pathways led to antisense derepression affecting over half the genome. Cdk9 and H2Bub1 cooperate to suppress antisense transcription by promoting function of the Clr6-CII histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex. H2Bub1 plays a second role, in opposition to Clr6-CII, to promote sense transcription in subtelomeric regions.

Here we show that increased auxin biosynthesis in the endosperm prevents its cellularization, leading to seed arrest. Auxin-overproducing seeds phenocopy paternal-excess triploid seeds derived from hybridizations of diploid maternal plants with tetraploid fathers. Concurrently, auxin-related genes are strongly overexpressed in triploid seeds, correlating with increased auxin activity. Reducing auxin biosynthesis and signaling reestablishes endosperm cellularization in triploid seeds and restores their viability, highlighting a causal role of increased auxin in preventing endosperm cellularization. We propose that auxin determines the time of endosperm cellularization and thereby uncovered a central role of auxin in establishing hybridization barriers in plants.",
