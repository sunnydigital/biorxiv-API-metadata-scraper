    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a rapidly evolving set of technologies that can be used to determine the sequence of an individuals genome1 by calling genetic variants present in an individual using billions of short, errorful sequence reads2. Despite more than a decade of effort and thousands of dedicated researchers, the hand-crafted and parameterized statistical models used for variant calling still produce thousands of errors and missed variants in each genome3,4. Here we show that a deep convolutional neural network5 can call genetic variation in aligned next-generation sequencing read data by learning statistical relationships (likelihoods) between images of read pileups around putative variant sites and ground-truth genotype calls. This approach, called DeepVariant, outperforms existing tools, even winning the \\\"highest performance\\\" award for SNPs in a FDA-administered variant calling challenge. The learned model generalizes across genome builds and even to other mammalian species, allowing non-human sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground truth data. We further show that, unlike existing tools which perform well on only a specific technology, DeepVariant can learn to call variants in a variety of sequencing technologies and experimental designs, from deep whole genomes from 10X Genomics to Ion Ampliseq exomes. DeepVariant represents a significant step from expert-driven statistical modeling towards more automatic deep learning approaches for developing software to interpret biological instrumentation data.",

    "abstract": "1.The number of individuals in a random sample with close relatives in the sample is a quantity of interest when designing Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and other cohort based genetic, and non-genetic, studies. In this paper, we develop expressions for the distribution and expectation of the number of p-th cousins in a sample from a population of size N under two diploid Wright-Fisher models. We also develop simple asymptotic expressions for large values of N. For example, the expected proportion of individuals with at least one p-th cousin in a sample of K individuals, for a diploid dioecious Wright-Fisher model, is approximately 1 - e-(22p-1)K/N. Our results show that a substantial fraction of individuals in the sample will have at least a second cousin if the sampling fraction (K/N) is on the order of 10-2. This confirms that, for large cohort samples, relatedness among individuals cannot easily be ignored.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe tropics harbor a large part of the worlds biodiversity and have a long history of human habitation. However, paleogenomics research in these climates has been constrained so far by poor ancient DNA yields. Here we compare the performance of two DNA extraction methods on ancient samples of teeth and petrous portions excavated from tropical and semitropical sites in Tanzania, Mexico, and Puerto Rico (N=12).\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsAll samples were extracted twice, built into double-stranded sequencing libraries, and shotgun sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500. The first extraction protocol, Method D, was previously designed for recovery of ultrashort DNA fragments from skeletal remains. The second, Method H, modifies the first by adding an initial EDTA wash and an extended digestion and decalcification step.\\n\\nResultsNo significant difference was found in overall ancient DNA yields or post-mortem damage patterns recovered from samples extracted with either method, irrespective of tissue type. However, Method H samples had higher endogenous content and more mapped reads after quality-filtering, but also higher clonality. In contrast, samples extracted with Method D had shorter average DNA fragments.\\n\\nDiscussionBoth methods successfully recovered endogenous ancient DNA. But, since surviving DNA in ancient or historic remains from tropical contexts is extremely fragmented, our results suggest that Method D is the optimal choice for working with samples from warm and humid environments. Additional optimization of extraction conditions and further testing of Method H with different types of samples may allow for improvement of this protocol in the future.",

    "abstract": "Systematic analysis of statistical and dynamical properties of proteins is critical to understanding cellular events. Extraction of biologically relevant information from a set of high-resolution structures is important because it can provide mechanistic details behind the functional properties of protein families, enabling rational comparison between families. Most of the current structure comparisons are pairwise-based, which hampers the global analysis of increasing contents in the Protein Data Bank. Additionally, pairing of protein structures introduces uncertainty with respect to reproducibility because it frequently accompanies other settings for superimposition. This study introduces intramolecular distance scoring, for the analysis of human proteins, for each of which at least several high-resolution are available. We show that the results are comprehensively used to overview advances at the atomic level exploration of each protein and protein family. This method, and the interpretation based on model calculations, provide new criteria for understanding specific and non-specific structure variation in a protein, enabling global comparison of the dynamics among a vast variety of proteins from different species.",

    "abstract": "Affective decoding is the inference of human emotional states using brain signal measurements. This approach is crucial to develop new therapeutic approaches for psychiatric rehabilitation, such as affective neurofeedback protocols. To reduce the training duration and optimize the clinical outputs, an ideal clinical neurofeedback could be trained using data from an independent group of volunteers before being used by new patients. Here, we investigated if this subject-independent design of affective decoding can be achieved using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals from frontal and occipital areas. For this purpose, a linear discriminant analysis classifier was first trained in a dataset (49 participants, 24.65{+/-}3.23 years) and then tested in a completely independent one (20 participants, 24.00{+/-}3.92 years). Significant balanced accuracies between classes were found for positive vs. negative (64.50 {+/-} 12.03%, p<0.01) and negative vs. neutral (68.25 {+/-} 12.97%, p<0.01) affective states discrimination during a reactive block consisting in viewing affective-loaded images. For an active block, in which volunteers were instructed to recollect personal affective experiences, significant accuracy was found for positive vs. neutral affect classification (71.25 {+/-} 18.02%, p<0.01). In this last case, only three fNIRS channels were enough to discriminate between neutral and positive affective states. Although more research is needed, for example focusing on better combinations of features and classifiers, our results highlight fNIRS as a possible technique for subject-independent affective decoding, reaching significant classification accuracies of emotional states using only a few but biologically relevant features.",

While recent studies have indicated that spatial gradients of selection pressure can accelerate resistance evolution, much less is known about evolution in more complex spatial profiles. Here we use a stochastic toy model of drug resistance to investigate how different spatial profiles of selection pressure impact the time to fixation of a resistant allele. Using mean first passage time calculations, we show that spatial heterogeneity accelerates resistance evolution when the rate of spatial migration is sufficiently large relative to mutation but slows fixation for small migration rates. Interestingly, there exists an intermediate regime--characterized by comparable rates of migration and mutation--in which the rate of fixation can be either accelerated or decelerated depending on the spatial profile, even when spatially averaged selection pressure remains constant. Finally, we demonstrate that optimal tuning of the spatial profile can dramatically slow the spread and fixation of resistant subpopulations, even in the absence of a fitness cost for resistance. Our results may lay the groundwork for optimized, spatially-resolved drug dosing strategies for mitigating the effects of drug resistance.",

However, little is known about the spatiotemporal pattern of ultrasound-induced brain activity that could drive these responses. Here, we address this question by combining focused ultrasound with wide-field optical imaging of calcium signals in transgenic mice. Surprisingly, we find cortical activity patterns consistent with indirect activation of auditory pathways rather than direct neuromodulation at the ultrasound focus. Ultrasound-induced activity is similar to that evoked by audible sound. Furthermore, both ultrasound and audible sound elicit motor responses consistent with a startle reflex, with both responses reduced by chemical deafening. These findings reveal an indirect auditory mechanism for ultrasound-induced cortical activity and movement requiring careful consideration in future development of ultrasonic neuromodulation as a tool in neuroscience research.",

In this work we study the properties of LD Score regression, a recently developed method for using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to ensure that confounding does not inflate the number of false positives. We do not treat the effects of genetic variation as a random variable and thus are able to obtain results about the unbiasedness of this method. We demonstrate that LD Score regression can produce estimates of confounding at null SNPs that are unbiased or conservative under fairly general conditions. This robustness holds in the case of the parent genotype affecting the offspring phenotype through some environmental mechanism, despite the resulting correlation over SNPs between LD Scores and the degree of confounding. Additionally, we demonstrate that LD Score regression can produce reasonably robust estimates of the genetic correlation, even when its estimates of the genetic covariance and the two univariate heritabilities are substantially biased.",

While each of these states is generally resilient, certain perturbations such as antibiotics, probiotics and diet shifts, result in transitions to other states. Can we reliably both predict such stable states as well as direct and control transitions between them? Here we present a new conceptual model -- inspired by the stable marriage problem in game theory and economics -- in which microbial communities naturally exhibit multiple stable states, each state with a different species abundance profile. Our models core ingredient is that microbes utilize nutrients one at a time while competing with each other. Using only two ranked tables, one with microbes nutrient preferences and one with their competitive abilities, we can determine all possible stable states as well as predict inter-state transitions, triggered by the removal or addition of a specific nutrient or microbe. Further, using an example of 7 Bacteroides species common to the human gut utilizing 9 polysaccharides, we predict that mutual complementarity in nutrient preferences enables these species to coexist at high abundances.",

While the primary reservoir is associated with cattle, plant foods have been associated as sources of human infection. E. coli is able to grow in the tissue of food plants such as spinach. While fecal contamination is the primary suspect, soil has been underestimated as a potential reservoir. Persistence of bacterial populations in open systems is the product of growth, death, predation, and competition. Here we report that E. coli O157:H7 can grow using the soluble compounds in soil, and characterize the effect of soil growth in the stationary phase proteome. E. coli 933D (stxII-) was cultured in Soil Extracted Soluble Organic Matter (SESOM) and the culturable count determined for 24 d. The proteomes of exponential and stationary phase populations were characterized by 2D gel electrophoresis and protein spots were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. While LB controls displayed a death phase, SESOM grown population remained culturable for 24 d, indicating an altered physiological state with superior longevity. This was not due to decreased cell density on entry to stationary phase as 24h SESOM populations concentrated 10-fold retained their longevity. Principal component analysis showed that stationary phase proteomes from SESOM and LB were different. Differences included proteins involved in stress response, motility, membrane and wall composition, nutrient uptake, translation and protein turnover, and anabolic and catabolic pathways, indicating an altered physiological state of soil-grown cells entering stationary phase. The results suggest that E. coli may be a soil commensal that in absence of predation and competition maintains stable populations in soil.",

The problem of scale is central to community ecology, where functional ecological groups are aggregated and treated as a unit underlying an ecological pattern, such as aggregation of \\\"nitrogen fixing trees\\\" into a total abundance of a trait underlying ecosystem physiology. With the emergence of massive community ecological datasets, from microbiomes to breeding bird surveys, there is a need to objectively identify the scales of organization pertaining to well-defined patterns in community ecological data.\\n\\nThe phylogeny is a scaffold for identifying key phylogenetic scales associated with macroscopic patterns. Phylofactorization was developed to objectively identify phylogenetic scales underlying patterns in relative abundance data. However, many ecological data, such as presence-absences and counts, are not relative abundances, yet it is still desireable and informative to identify phylogenetic scales underlying a pattern of interest. Here, we generalize phylofactorization beyond relative abundances to a graph-partitioning algorithm for any community ecological data.\\n\\nGeneralizing phylofactorization connects many tools from data analysis to phylogenetically-informe analysis of community ecological data. Two-sample tests identify three phylogenetic factors of mammalian body mass which arose during the K-Pg extinction event, consistent with other analyses of mammalian body mass evolution. Projection of data onto coordinates defined by the phylogeny yield a phylogenetic principal components analysis which refines our understanding of the major sources of variation in the human gut microbiome. These same coordinates allow generalized additive modeling of microbes in Central Park soils and confirm that a large clade of Acidobacteria thrive in neutral soils. Generalized linear and additive modeling of exponential family random variables can be performed by phylogenetically-constrained reduced-rank regression or stepwise factor contrasts. We finish with a discussion of how phylofac-torization produces an ecological species concept with a phylogenetic constraint.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) was introduced in the United States in 2010. Using a large pediatric carriage sample collected from shortly after the introduction of PCV-7 to several years after the introduction of PCV-13, we investigate alterations in the composition of the pneumococcal population following the introduction of PCV-13, evaluating the extent to which the post-vaccination non-vaccine type (NVT) population mirrors that from prior to vaccine introduction and the effect of PCV-13 on vaccine type lineages.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsDraft genome assemblies from 736 newly sequenced and 616 previously published pneumococcal carriages isolates from children in Massachusetts between 2001 and 2014 were analyzed. Isolates were classified into one of 22 sequence clusters (SCs) on the basis of their core genome sequence. We calculated the SC diversity for each sampling period as the probability that any two randomly drawn isolates from that period belong to different SCs. The sampling period immediately after the introduction of PCV-13 (2011) was found to have higher diversity than preceding (2007) or subsequent (2014) sampling periods (Simpsons D 2007: 0.915 95% CI [0.901, 0.929]; 2011: 0.935 [0.927, 0.942]; 2014: 0.912 [0.901, 0.923]). Amongst NVT isolates, we found the distribution of SCs in 2011 to be significantly different from that in 2007 or 2014 (Fishers Exact Test p=0.018, 0.0078), but did not find a difference comparing 2007 to 2014 (Fishers Exact Test p=0.24), indicating greater similarity between samples separated by a longer time period than between samples from closer time periods. We also found changes in the accessory gene content of the NVT population between 2007 and 2011 to have been reduced by 2014. Amongst the new serotypes targeted by PCV-13, four were present in our sample. The proportion of our sample composed of PCV-13-only vaccine serotypes 19A, 6C, and 7F decreased between 2007 and 2014, but no such reduction was seen for serotype 3. We did, however, observe differences in the genetic composition of the pre- and post-PCV-13 serotype 3 population. Our isolates were collected during discrete sampling periods from a small geographic area, which may limit the generalizability our findings.\\n\\nConclusionPneumococcal diversity increased immediately following the introduction of PCV-13, but subsequently returned to pre-vaccination levels. This is reflected in the distribution of NVT lineages, and, to a lesser extent, their accessory gene frequencies. As such, there may be a period during which the population is particularly disrupted by vaccination before returning to a more stable distribution. The persistence and shifting genetic composition of serotype 3 is a concern and warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the historical events that shaped current genomic diversity has applications in historical, biological, and medical research. However, the amount of historical information that can be inferred from genetic data is finite, which leads to an identifiability problem. For example, different historical processes can lead to identical distribution of allele frequencies. This identifiability issue casts a shadow of uncertainty over the results of any study which uses the frequency spectrum to infer past demography. It has been argued that imposing mild  reasonableness constraints on demographic histories can enable unique reconstruction, at least in an idealized setting where the length of the genome is nearly infinite. Here, we discuss this problem for finite sample size and genome length. Using the diffusion approximation, we obtain bounds on likelihood differences between similar demographic histories, and use them to construct pairs of very different reasonable histories that produce almost-identical frequency distributions. The finite-genome problem therefore remains poorly determined even among reasonable histories. Where fits to few-parameter models produce narrow parameter confidence intervals, large uncertainties lurk hidden by model assumption.",

There may be multiple, competing considerations behind the assessment of normalization performance, some of them study-specific. Because normalization can have a large impact on downstream results (e.g., clustering and differential expression), it is critically important that practitioners assess the performance of competing methods.\\n\\nWe have developed scone -- a flexible framework for assessing normalization performance based on a comprehensive panel of data-driven metrics. Through graphical summaries and quantitative reports, scone summarizes performance trade-offs and ranks large numbers of normalization methods by aggregate panel performance. The method is implemented in the open-source Bioconductor R software package scone. We demonstrate the effectiveness of scone on a collection of scRNA-seq datasets, generated with different protocols, including Fluidigm C1 and 10x platforms.

    "abstract": "This study explores the relationships between three-dimensional genome organization and the ultraconserved elements (UCEs), an enigmatic set of DNA elements that show very high DNA sequence conservation between vertebrate reference genomes. Examining both human and mouse genomes, we interrogate the relationship of UCEs to three features of chromosome organization derived from Hi-C studies. Firstly, we report that UCEs are enriched within contact  domains and, further, that the UCEs that fall into domains shared across diverse cell types are linked to kidney-related and neuronal processes. In  boundaries, UCEs are generally depleted, with those that do overlap boundaries being overrepresented in exonic UCEs. Regarding loop anchors, UCEs are neither over- nor under-represented, with those present in loop anchors being enriched for splice sites compared to all UCEs. Finally, as all of the relationships we observed between UCEs and genomic features are conserved in the mouse genome, our findings suggest that UCEs contribute to interspecies conservation of genome organization and, thus, genome stability.",

Here, we developed statistically principled methods using a hierarchical cascade of linear-nonlinear subunits (hLN) to model the dynamically evolving somatic response of neurons receiving complex spatio-temporal synaptic input patterns. We used the hLN to predict the membrane potential of a detailed biophysical model of a L2/3 pyramidal cell receiving in vivo-like synaptic input and reproducing in vivo dendritic recordings. We found that more than 90% of the somatic response could be captured by linear integration followed a single global non-linearity. Multiplexing inputs into parallel processing channels could improve prediction accuracy by as much as additional layers of local non-linearities. These results provide a data-driven characterisation of a key building block of cortical circuit computations: dendritic integration and the input-output transformation of single neurons during in vivo-like conditions.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has sought to quantify head impact exposure using wearable kinematic sensors. However, many sensors suffer from poor accuracy in estimating impact kinematics and count, motivating the need for additional independent impact exposure quantification for comparison. Here, we equipped seven collegiate American football players with instrumented mouthguards, and video recorded practices and games to compare video-based and sensor-based exposure rates and impact location distributions. Over 50 player-hours, we identified 271 helmet contact periods in video, while the instrumented mouthguard sensor recorded 2,032 discrete head impacts. Matching video and mouthguard real-time stamps yielded 193 video-identified helmet contact periods and 217 sensor-recorded impacts. To compare impact locations, we binned matched impacts into frontal, rear, side, oblique, and top locations based on video observations and sensor kinematics. While both video-based and sensor-based methods found similar location distributions, our best method utilizing integrated linear and angular position only correctly predicted 81 of 217 impacts. Finally, based on the activity timeline from video assessment, we also developed a new exposure metric unique to American football quantifying number of cross-verified sensor impacts per player-play. We found significantly higher exposure during games (0.35, 95% CI: 0.29-0.42) than practices (0.20, 95% CI: 0.17-0.23) (p<0.05). In the traditional impacts per player-hour metric, we observed higher exposure during practices (4.7) than games (3.7) due to increased player activity in practices. Thus, our exposure metric accounts for variability in on-field participation. While both video-based and sensor-based exposure datasets have limitations, they can complement one another to provide more confidence in exposure statistics.",

How biochemical and mechanical factors affect formin processivity are open questions. Monitoring individual actin filaments in a microfluidic flow, we report that formin mDia1 dissociates faster under higher ionic strength and when actin concentration is increased. Profilin, known to increase the elongation rate of formin-associated filaments, surprisingly decreases the formin dissociation rate, by bringing formin FH1 domains in transient contact with the barbed end. In contrast, piconewton tensile forces applied to actin filaments accelerate formin dissociation by orders of magnitude, largely overcoming profilin-mediated stabilization. We developed a model of formin conformations and its confrontation to our data indicates the existence of two different dissociation pathways, with force favoring one over the other. How cells limit formin dissociation under tension is now a key question for future studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSudden cardiac arrest (SCA) accounts for 10% of adult mortality in Western populations. While several risk factors are observationally associated with SCA, the genetic architecture of SCA in the general population remains unknown. Furthermore, understanding which risk factors are causal may help target prevention strategies.\\n\\nMethodsWe carried out a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) for SCA (n=3,939 cases, 25,989 non-cases) to examine common variation genome-wide and in candidate arrhythmia genes. We also exploited Mendelian randomization methods using cross-trait multi-variant genetic risk score associations (GRSA) to assess causal relationships of 18 risk factors with SCA.\\n\\nResultsNo variants were associated with SCA at genome-wide significance, nor were common variants in candidate arrhythmia genes associated with SCA at nominal significance. Using cross-trait GRSA, we established genetic correlation between SCA and (1) coronary artery disease (CAD) and traditional CAD risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, and diabetes), (2) height and BMI, and (3) electrical instability traits (QT and atrial fibrillation), suggesting etiologic roles for these traits in SCA risk.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings show that a comprehensive approach to the genetic architecture of SCA can shed light on the determinants of a complex life-threatening condition with multiple influencing factors in the general population. The results of this genetic analysis, both positive and negative findings, have implications for evaluating the genetic architecture of patients with a family history of SCA, and for efforts to prevent SCA in highrisk populations and the general community.",

Previous work has demonstrated that endogenous oscillations and subsequent behavior can be modulated by oscillating transcranial current stimulation (otCS). The purpose of the current study is to establish the efficacy of cathodal otCS for modulation of the ongoing alpha brain oscillations, allowing for modulation of individuals visual perception. Thirty-six participants performed a target detection with sham and 10-Hz cathodal otCS. Each participant had two practice and two experimental sets composed of three blocks of 128 trials per block. Stimulating electrodes were small square sponges (20 cm2) placed on the participants head with the anode electrode at Cz and the cathode electrode at Oz. A 0.5 mA current was applied at the cathode electrode every 100 ms (10 Hz frequency) during the otCS condition. The same current and frequency was applied for the first 10-20 s of the sham condition, after which the current was turned off. Target detection rates were separated into ten 10-ms bins based on the latency between the stimulation/sham pulse and target onset. Target detection rates were then compared between the sham and otCS experimental conditions across the ten bins in order to test for effects of otCS phase on target detection. We found no significant difference in target detection rates between the sham and otCS conditions, and discuss potential reasons for the apparent inability of cathodal otCS to effectively modulate visual perception.",

    "abstract": "Adaptor protein (AP) complexes have critical roles in transmembrane protein sorting. AP-4 remains poorly understood in the brain despite its loss of function leading to a hereditary spastic paraplegia termed AP-4 deficiency syndrome. Here we demonstrate that knockout (KO) of AP-4 in a mouse model leads to thinning of the corpus callosum and ventricular enlargement, anatomical defects previously described in patients. At the cellular level, we find that AP-4 KO leads to defects in axonal extension and branching, in addition to aberrant distal swellings. Interestingly, we show that ATG9A, a key protein in autophagosome maturation, is critically dependent on AP-4 for its sorting from the trans-golgi network. Failure of AP-4 mediated ATG9A sorting results in its dramatic retention in the trans-golgi network in vitro and in vivo leading to a specific reduction of the axonal pool of ATG9A. As a result, autophagosome biogenesis is aberrant in the axon of AP-4 deficient neurons. The specific alteration to axonal integrity and axonal autophagosome maturation in AP-4 knockout neurons may underpin the pathology of AP-4 deficiency.",

S1P signaling has been linked to cutaneous pain, but its role in itch has not yet been studied. Here we find that S1P triggers itch and pain in mice in a concentration-dependent manner, with low levels triggering acute itch alone, and high levels triggering both pain and itch. Calcium imaging and electrophysiological experiments revealed that S1P signals via S1PR3 and TRPA1 in a subset of pruriceptors, and via S1PR3 and TRPV1 in a subset of heat nociceptors. And in behavioral assays, S1P-evoked itch was selectively lost in mice lacking TRPA1, whereas S1P-evoked acute pain and heat hypersensitivity were selectively lost in mice lacking TRPV1.

Our discovery elucidates the diverse roles that S1P signaling plays in somatosensation and provides insight into how itch and pain are discriminated in the periphery.\\n\\nSignificance StatementItch and pain are major health problems with few effective treatments.

Phylogenetics indicates that the AcCoA pathway, the reductive fixation of CO2 to acetyl and pyruvate, was a key biosynthetic route used by the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) to build its biochemistry. However, debate exists over whether CO2 fixation is a relatively late invention of pre-LUCA evolution or whether it dates back to prebiotic chemistry. Here we show that zero-valent forms of the transition metals known to act as co-factors in the AcCoA pathway (Fe0, Ni0, Co0) fix CO2 on their surface in a manner closely resembling the biological pathway, producing acetate and pyruvate in near mM concentrations following cleavage from the surface. The reaction is robust over a wide range of temperatures and pressures with acetate and pyruvate constituting the major products in solution at 1 bar of CO2 and 30 {degrees}g;C. The discovered conditions also promote 7 of the 11 steps of the rTCA cycle and amino acid synthesis, providing a stunning direct connection between simple inorganic chemistry and ancient CO2-fixation pathways.

However, the prevalence of such shifts in mutational effects remains unclear. Here we quantify the effects on viral growth of all amino-acid mutations to two HIV envelope (Env) proteins that differ at >100 residues. Most mutations similarly affect both Envs, but the amino-acid preferences of a minority of sites have clearly shifted. These shifted sites usually prefer a specific amino acid in one Env, but tolerate many amino acids in the other. Surprisingly, shifts are only slightly enriched at sites that have substituted between the Envs -- and many occur at residues that do not even contact substitutions. Therefore, long-range epistasis can unpredictably shift Env's mutational tolerance during HIV evolution, although the amino-acid preferences of most sites are conserved between moderately diverged viral strains.",

    "abstract": "The stability of long-term memories is enhanced by reactivation during sleep. Correlative evidence has linked memory reactivation with thalamocortical sleep spindles, although their functional role is poorly understood. Our initial study replicated this correlation but also demonstrated a novel rhythmicity to spindles, such that spindles are less likely to occur immediately following other spindles. We leveraged this rhythmicity to test the role of spindles in memory by using real-time spindle tracking to present cues inside versus outside the presumptive refractory period; as predicted, cues presented in the refractory period led to better memory. Our findings reveal a previously undescribed neural mechanism whereby spindles segment sleep into two distinct substates: prime opportunities for reactivation and gaps that segregate reactivation events.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe characteristic timing of sleep spindles regulates when memories can be reactivated during sleep.",

    "abstract": "Human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (A3) proteins are a family of cytidine deaminases that catalyze the conversion of cytidine to uridine in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A3 proteins act in the innate immune response to viral infection by mutating the viral ssDNA. One of the most well-studied human A3 family members is A3G, which is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1. Each A3 protein prefers a specific substrate sequence for catalysis - for example, A3G deaminates the third cytidine in the CCCA sequence motif. However, the interaction between A3G and ssDNA is difficult to characterize due to poor solution behavior of the full-length protein and loss of DNA affinity of the truncated protein. Here, we present a novel DNA-anchoring fusion strategy, which we have used to capture an A3G-ssDNA interaction. We characterized an A3G-DNA binding pocket that is important for the enzyme to scan the DNA for its hotspot. The results provide insights into the mechanism by which A3G selects and deaminates its preferred substrates and help define how A3 proteins are tailored to recognize specific DNA sequences. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of DNA substrate selection by A3G, as well as A3G antiviral activity against HIV-1.",

    "abstract": "Observation techniques with high spatial and temporal resolution, such as single-particle tracking (SPT) based on interferometric Scattering (iSCAT) microscopy, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy applied on a super-resolution STED microscope (STED-FCS), have revealed new insights of the molecular organization of membranes. While delivering complementary information, there are still distinct differences between these techniques, most prominently the use of fluorescent dye-tagged probes for STED-FCS and a need for larger scattering gold nanoparticle tags for iSCAT. In this work we have used lipid analogues tagged with a hybrid fluorescent tag - gold nanoparticle construct, to directly compare the results from STED-FCS and iSCAT measurements of phospholipid diffusion on a homogeneous Supported Lipid Bilayer (SLB). These comparative measurements showed that while the mode of diffusion remained free, at least at the spatial (>40 nm) and temporal (50 [&le;] t [&le;] 100 ms) scales probed, the diffussion coefficient was reduced by 20- to 60-fold when tagging with 20 and 40 nm large gold particles as compared to when using dye-tagged lipid analogues. These FCS measurements of hybrid fluorescent tag - gold nanoparticle labeled lipids also revealed that commercially supplied streptavidin-coated gold nanoparticles contain large quantities of free streptavidin. Finally, the values of apparent diffusion coefficients obtained by STED-FCS and iSCAT differed by a factor of 2-3 across the techniques, while relative differences in mobility between different species of lipid analogues considered were identical in both approaches. In conclusion, our experiments reveal that large and potentially crosslinking scattering tags introduce a significant slow-down in diffusion on SLBs but no additional bias, and our labeling approach creates a new way of exploiting complementary information from STED-FCS and iSCAT measurements.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in our capacity to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to human kidney tissue are moving the field closer to novel approaches for renal replacement. Such protocols have relied upon our current understanding of the molecular basis of mammalian kidney morphogenesis. To date this has depended upon population based-profiling of non-homogenous cellular compartments. In order to improve our resolution of individual cell transcriptional profiles during kidney morphogenesis, we have performed 10x Chromium single cell RNA-seq on over 6000 cells from the E18.5 developing mouse kidney, as well as more than 7000 cells from human iPSC-derived kidney organoids. We identified 16 clusters of cells representing all major cell lineages in the E18.5 mouse kidney. The differentially expressed genes from individual murine clusters were then used to guide the classification of 16 cell clusters within human kidney organoids, revealing the presence of distinguishable stromal, endothelial, nephron, podocyte and nephron progenitor populations. Despite the congruence between developing mouse and human organoid, our analysis suggested limited nephron maturation and the presence of  off target populations in human kidney organoids, including unidentified stromal populations and evidence of neural clusters. This may reflect unique human kidney populations, mixed cultures or aberrant differentiation in vitro. Analysis of clusters within the mouse data revealed novel insights into progenitor maintenance and cellular maturation in the major renal lineages and will serve as a roadmap to refine directed differentiation approaches in human iPSC-derived kidney organoids.",

    "abstract": "While ciliates of the genus Stentor are known for their ability to regenerate when their cells are damaged or even fragmented, the physical and molecular mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. To identify genes involved in the regenerative capability of Stentor cells, RNA sequencing of individual Stentor polymorphus cell fragments was performed. After splitting a cell over the anterior-posterior axis, the posterior fragment has to regenerate the oral apparatus, while the anterior part needs to regenerate the hold fast. Altogether, differential expression analysis of both posterior and anterior S. polymorphus cell fragments for four different post-split time points revealed over 10,000 up-regulated genes throughout the regeneration process. Among these, genes involved in cell signaling, microtubule-based movement and cell cycle regulation seemed to be particularly important during cellular regeneration. We identified roughly nine times as many up-regulated genes in regenerating S. polymorphus posterior fragments as compared to anterior fragments, indicating that regeneration of the anterior oral apparatus is a complex process that involves many genes. Our analyses identified several expanded groups of genes such as dual-specific tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinases and MORN domain containing proteins that seemingly act as key-regulators of cellular regeneration. In agreement with earlier morphological and cell biological studies, our differential expression analyses indicate that cellular regeneration and vegetative division share many similarities.",
