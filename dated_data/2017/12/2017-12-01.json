    "abstract": "The alignment among three or more nucleotides/amino-acids sequences at the same time is known as Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), an NP-hard optimization problem. The time complexity of finding an optimal alignment raises exponentially when the number of sequences to align increases. In this work, we deal with a multiobjective version of the MSA problem where the goal is to simultaneously optimize the accuracy and conservation of the alignment. A parallel version of the Hybrid Multiobjective Memetic Metaheuristics for Multiple Sequence Alignment is proposed. In order to evaluate the parallel performance of our proposal, we have selected a pull of datasets with different number of sequences (up to 1000 sequences) and study its parallel performance against other well-known parallel metaheuristics published in the literature, such as MSAProbs, T-Coffee, Clustal {Omega}, and MAFFT. The comparative study reveals that our parallel aligner is around 25 times faster than the sequential version with 32 cores, obtaining a parallel efficiency around 80%.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of high-throughput technologies measuring high-dimensional biological data, there is a pressing need for visualization tools that reveal the structure and emergent patterns of data in an intuitive form. We present PHATE, a visualization method that captures both local and global nonlinear structure in data by an information-geometric distance between datapoints. We perform extensive comparison between PHATE and other tools on a variety of artificial and biological datasets, and find that it consistently preserves a range of patterns in data including continual progressions, branches, and clusters. We define a manifold preservation metric DEMaP to show that PHATE produces quantitatively better denoised embeddings than existing visualization methods. We show that PHATE is able to gain unique insight from a newly generated scRNA-seq dataset of human germ layer differentiation. Here, PHATE reveals a dynamic picture of the main developmental branches in unparalleled detail, including the identification of three novel subpopulations. Finally, we show that PHATE is applicable to a wide variety of datatypes including mass cytometry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, Hi-C, and gut microbiome data, where it can generate interpretable insights into the underlying systems.",

    "abstract": "Butterflies have evolved different color patterns on their dorsal and ventral wing surfaces to serve different signaling functions, yet the developmental mechanisms controlling surface-specific patterning are still unknown. Here, we mutate both copies of the transcription factor apterous in Bicyclus anynana butterflies using CRISPR/Cas9 and show that apterous A functions both as a repressor and modifier of ventral wing color patterns, as well as a promoter of dorsal sexual ornaments in males. We propose that the surface-specific diversification of wing patterns in butterflies proceeded via the co-option of apterous A into various gene regulatory networks involved in the differentiation of discrete wing traits. Further, interactions between apterous and sex-specific factors such as doublesex may have contributed to the origin of sexually dimorphic surface-specific patterns. Finally, we discuss the evolution of eyespot pattern diversity in the family Nymphalidae within the context of developmental constraints due to apterous regulation.\\n\\nSignificance statementButterflies have evolved different wing patterns on their dorsal and ventral wing surfaces that serve different signaling functions. We identify the transcription factor, apterous A, as a key regulator of this surface-specific differentiation in butterflies. We also show a role for apterous A in restricting the developmental origin of a novel trait, eyespots, to just the ventral wing surface. Dorsal-ventral differentiation of tissues is not just restricted to butterfly wings but occurs in many other organs and organisms from arthropods to humans. Thus, we believe that our work will be of interest to a diverse group of biologists and layman alike interested in the role of development in shaping biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Behavior is used to assess memory and cognitive deficits in animals like Fmrl-null mice that model Fragile X Syndrome, but behavior is a proxy for unknown neural events that define cognitive variables like recollection. We identified an electrophysiological signature of recollection in mouse dorsal CA1 hippocampus. During a shocked-place avoidance task, slow gamma (SG: 30-50 Hz) dominates mid-frequency gamma (MG: 70-90 Hz) oscillations 2-3 seconds before successful avoidance, but not failures. Wild-type but not Fmrl-null mice rapidly adapt to relocating the shock; concurrently, SG/MG maxima (SGdominance) decrease in wild-type but not in cognitively inflexible Fmrl-null mice. During SGdominance, putative pyramidal cell ensembles represent distant locations; during place avoidance, these are avoided places. During shock relocation, wild-type ensembles represent distant locations near the currently-correct shock zone but Fmrl-null ensembles represent the formerly-correct zone. These findings indicate that recollection occurs when CA1 slow gamma dominates mid-frequency gamma, and that accurate recollection of inappropriate memories explains Fmrl-null cognitive inflexibility.",

    "abstract": "The postdoctoral research position is an essential step on the academic career track, and the biomedical research enterprise has become heavily dependent on postdoctoral scholars to conduct experimental research. Monitoring postdoc population trends is important for crafting and evaluating policies that affect this critical population. The tool most use for understanding the trends of the biological sciences postdoc population is the Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (GSS) administered by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics. To determine how well institutions tracked their postdocs, we analyzed the yearly changes in the biological sciences postdoc population at institutions surveyed by the GSS from 1980 to 2015. We find examples of large changes in the biological sciences postdoc population at one or a few institutions most years from 1980 to 2015. Most universities could not explain the data presented in the GSS, and for those that provided an explanation, the most common causes were improved institutional policies and more robust tracking of their postdocs. These large changes, unrelated to hiring or layoffs, sometimes masked population trends in the broader biological sciences postdoc population. We propose the adoption of a unified definition and titles for postdocs and the creation of an index to better assess biological sciences postdoc population trends.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decision-making is biased by previous events, including the history of preceding choices: Observers tend to repeat (or alternate) their judgments of the sensory environment more often than expected by chance. Computational models postulate that these so-called choice history biases result from the accumulation of internal decision signals across trials. Here, we provide psychophysical evidence for such a mechanism and its adaptive utility. Male and female human observers performed different variants of a challenging visual motion discrimination task near psychophysical threshold. In a first experiment, we decoupled categorical perceptual choices and motor responses on a trial-by-trial basis. Choice history bias was explained by previous perceptual choices, not motor responses, highlighting the importance of internal decision signals in action-independent formats. In a second experiment, observers performed the task in stimulus environments containing different levels of autocorrelation and providing no external feedback about choice correctness. Despite performing under overall high levels of uncertainty, observers adjusted both the strength and the sign of their choice history biases to these environments. When stimulus sequences were dominated by either repetitions or alternations, the individual degree of this adjustment of history bias was about as good a predictor of individual performance as individual perceptual sensitivity. The history bias adjustment scaled with two proxies for observers confidence about their previous choices (accuracy and reaction time). Taken together, our results are consistent with the idea that action-independent, confidence-modulated decision variables are accumulated across choices in a flexible manner that depends on decision-makers model of their environment.\\n\\nSignificance statementDecisions based on sensory input are often influenced by the history of ones preceding choices, manifesting as a bias to systematically repeat (or alternate) choices. We here provide support for the idea that such choice history biases arise from the context-dependent accumulation of a quantity referred to as the decision variable: the variables sign dictates the choice and its magnitude the confidence about choice correctness. We show that choices are accumulated in an actionindependent format and a context-dependent manner, weighted by the confidence about their correctness. This confidence-weighted accumulation of choices enables decision-makers to flexibly adjust their behavior to different sensory environments. The bias adjustment can be as important for optimizing performance as ones sensitivity to the momentary sensory input.",

The analysis resulted in 33 discriminable modules which participate in varied functions including energy consumption, synaptic functions and housekeeping functions such as translation and splicing. Based on the identified modules, we trained a neuron maturity index (NMI) model for the quantification of maturation states of single neurons or purified bulk neurons. Applied to multiple single neuron transcriptome data sets of neuron development in humans and mice, the NMI model made estimation of neuron maturity states which were significantly correlated with the neuron maturation trajectories in both species, implying the reproducibility and conservation of the identified transcriptome transition.\\n\\nConclusionWe identified 33 functional modules whose activities were significantly correlated with single neuron maturity states, which may play important roles in the neuron maturation process.",

    "abstract": "Many studies that aim to detect model-free and model-based influences on behavior employ two-stage behavioral tasks of the type pioneered by Daw and colleagues in 2011. Such studies commonly modify existing two-stage decision paradigms in order to better address a given hypothesis, which is an important means of scientific progress. It is, however, critical to fully appreciate the impact of any modified or novel experimental design features on the expected results. Here, we use two concrete examples to demonstrate that relatively small changes in the two-stage task design can substantially change the pattern of actions taken by model-free and model-based agents as a function of the reward outcomes and transitions on previous trials. In the first, we show that, under specific conditions, purely model-free agents will produce the reward by transition interactions typically thought to characterize model-based behavior on a two-stage task. The second example shows that model-based agents behavior is driven by a main effect of transition-type in addition to the canonical reward by transition interaction whenever the reward probabilities of the final states do not sum to one. Together, these examples emphasize the task-dependence of model-free and model-based behavior and highlight the benefits of using computer simulations to determine what pattern of results to expect from both model-free and model-based agents performing a given two-stage decision task in order to design choice paradigms and analysis strategies best suited to the current question.",

    "abstract": "Infection with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of liver disease and cancer in humans. HBVs (family Hepadnaviridae) have been associated with mammals for millions of years. Recently, the Smc5/6 complex, known for its essential housekeeping functions in genome maintenance, was identified as an antiviral restriction factor of human HBV. The virus has however developed a counteraction mechanism by degrading the complex via its regulatory HBx protein. Whether the antiviral activity of the Smc5/6 complex against hepadnaviruses is an important and evolutionary-conserved function is unknown. Here, we used a combined evolutionary and functional approach to address this question. We first performed phylogenetic and positive selection analyses of the six Smc5/6 complex subunits and found that they have been highly conserved in primates and mammals. Yet, the Smc6 subunit showed marks of adaptive evolution, potentially reminiscent of virus-host \\\"arms-race\\\" We then functionally tested the HBx from six very divergent hepadnaviruses now naturally infecting primates, rodents, and bats. Despite little sequence homology, we demonstrate that these HBx efficiently degraded mammalian Smc5/6 complexes, independently of the host species and of the sites under positive selection. Importantly, all also rescued the replication of an HBx-deficient HBV in primary human hepatocytes. These findings point to an evolutionary-conserved requirement for Smc5/6 inactivation by HBx, showing that the Smc5/6 antiviral activity has been an important defense mechanism against hepadnaviruses in mammals. Interestingly, Smc5/6 may further be a restriction factor of other yet unidentified viruses that have driven some of its adaptation.\\n\\nImportanceInfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) led to 887000 human deaths in 2015. HBV has been co-evolving with mammals for millions of years. Recently, the Smc5/6 complex, known for its essential housekeeping functions, was identified as a restriction factor of human HBV antagonized by the regulatory HBx protein. Here, we address whether the antiviral activity of Smc5/6 is an important evolutionary-conserved function. We found that all six subunits of Smc5/6 have been conserved in primates with only Smc6 showing signatures of \\\"evolutionary arms-race\\\" Using evolutionary-guided functional assays that include infections of primary human hepatocytes, we demonstrate that HBx from very divergent mammalian HBVs could all efficiently antagonize Smc5/6, independently of the host species and sites under positive selection. These findings show that the Smc5/6 antiviral activity against HBV is an important function in mammals. It also raises the intriguing possibility that Smc5/6 restricts other, yet unidentified viruses.",

In addition to direct effects of the environment, carry-over effects from previous life history stages can influence mosquito traits relevant to disease transmission. While this has been explored in a laboratory setting, the net effect of temperature-mediated carry-over effects due to relevant environmental variation in the larval stage is ambiguous. Here, we use data collected from a semi-field experiment investigating dengue dynamics in Aedes albopictus across a natural environmental gradient to parameterize a dengue transmission model. We reared Ae. albopictus across three different land classes characterized by their proportion of impervious surface. Emerged females were offered a dengue infectious bloodmeal, kept at a constant 27 {degrees}C, and assayed for infection, dissemination, and infectiousness 21 days post infection. Incorporating carry-over effects of larval environment on measures of vector competence resulted in lower predicted dengue transmission potential across land class and season, however a strong positive relationship with larval environmental temperature remained. Given the significant impact of carry-over effects, future mechanistic models of disease transmission should include both direct and carry-over effects of environmental temperature.",

However, theoretical models suggest that the antigenic evolution of influenza is best explained by postulating the existence of highly immunogenic epitopes of limited variability. Here we report the identification of such an epitope of limited variability in the head domain of the H1 haemagglutinin protein. We show that the epitope mediates immunity to historical influenza strains not previously seen by a cohort of young children. Furthermore, vaccinating mice with these epitope conformations can induce immunity to all the human H1N1 influenza strains that have circulated since 1918. The identification of epitopes of limited variability offers a mechanism by which a universal influenza vaccine can be created; these vaccines would also have the potential to protect against newly emerging influenza strains.",

Existing methods utilize genotypic data and summary statistics to identify putative disease genes, but cannot distinguish pleiotropy from causal mediation and are limited by overly strong assumptions about the data. To overcome these limitations, we develop Causal Multivariate Mediation within Extended Linkage disequilibrium (CaMMEL), a novel Bayesian inference framework to jointly model multiple mediated and unmediated effects relying only on summary statistics. We show in simulation that CaMMEL accurately distinguishes between mediating and pleiotropic genes unlike existing methods. We applied CaMMEL to Alzheimers disease (AD) and found 206 causal genes in sub-threshold loci (p < 10-4). We prioritized 21 genes which mediate at least 5% of local genetic variance, disrupting innate immune pathways in AD.",

Here, we use dynamic functional network connectivity method to examine resting state functional network changes over aging process. In general, the features of dynamic functional states are generally varying across ages, such as the frequency of expression and the amount of time spent in the certain state. Increasing age is associated with less variability of functional state across time at rest period. From age point of view, examining the age-related difference of topology index revealed 19-30 age range has the significant largest global efficiency, largest local efficiency of default-mode network (DMN), cognitive control network (CCN) and salience network (SN). As for functional states, one state displayed the whole positive connectivity, in the meantime, it has the largest global efficiency and local efficiency of three subnetworks. Besides, the frequency of another state was negatively correlated to the box block (The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale subset, which is thought to evaluate fine motor skills, processing speed, and visuospatial ability), while positively correlated with age, and the box block was inversely correlated to age. The results suggested that cognitive aging may be characterized by the dynamic functional network connectivity. Taken together, these findings suggested the importance of a dynamic approach to understanding cognitive aging in lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Retinal prostheses for treating incurable blindness are designed to electrically stimulate surviving retinal neurons, causing them to send artificial visual signals to the brain. However, electrical stimulation generally cannot precisely reproduce typical patterns of neural activity in the retina. Therefore, an electrical stimulus must be selected so as to produce a neural response as close as possible to the desired response. This requires a technique for computing the distance between a desired response and an achievable response that is meaningful in terms of the visual signal being conveyed. We propose a method to learn a metric on neural responses directly from recorded light responses of a population of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the primate retina. The learned metric produces a measure of similarity of RGC population responses that accurately reflects the similarity of visual inputs. Using data from electrical stimulation experiments, we demonstrate that the learned metric could produce improvements in the performance of a retinal prosthesis.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant splicing is a hallmark of leukemias with mutations in splicing factor (SF)-encoding genes. Here we investigated its prevalence in pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL), where SFs are not mutated. By comparing them to normal pro-B cells, we found thousands of aberrant local splice variations (LSVs) per sample, with 279 LSVs in 241 genes present in every comparison. These genes were enriched in RNA processing pathways and encoded ~100 SFs, e.g. hnRNPA1. hnRNPA1 3UTR was pervasively misspliced, yielding the transcript subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Thus, we knocked it down in B-lymphoblastoid cells, identified 213 hnRNPA1-dependent splicing events, and defined the hnRNPA1 splicing signature in pediatric leukemias. One of its elements was DICER1, a known tumor suppressor gene; its LSVs were consistent with reduced translation of DICER1 mRNA. Additionally, we searched for LSVs in other leukemia and lymphoma drivers and discovered 81 LSVs in 41 genes. 77 LSVs were confirmed using two large independent B-ALL RNA-seq datasets. In fact, the twenty most common B-ALL drivers showed higher prevalence of aberrant splicing than of somatic mutations. Thus, post-transcriptional deregulation of SF can drive widespread changes in B-ALL splicing and likely contribute to disease pathogenesis.",

These statistical characterizations of the gene expression distribution are critical for understanding expression variation and for selecting marker genes for population heterogeneity. However, scRNA-seq data is noisy, with each cell typically sequenced at low coverage, thus making it difficult to infer properties of the gene expression distribution from raw counts. Based on a re-examination of 9 public data sets, we propose a simple technical noise model for scRNA-seq data with Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI). We develop DESCEND, a method that deconvolves the true cross-cell gene expression distribution from observed scRNA-seq counts, leading to improved estimates of properties of the distribution such as dispersion and burstiness. DESCEND can adjust for cell-level covariates such as cell size, cell cycle and batch effects. DESCENDs noise model and estimation accuracy are further evaluated through comparisons to RNA FISH data, through data splitting and simulations, and through its effectiveness in removing known batch effects. We demonstrate how DESCEND can clarify and improve downstream analyses such as finding differentially bursty genes, identifying cell types, and selecting differentiation markers.",

We performed a case-control analysis to identify drivers of immune activation and disease risk. Among 49 infants who developed TB disease over the first two years of life, and 129 matched controls who remained healthy, we found the cytomegalovirus (CMV) stimulated IFN-{gamma} response at age 4-6 months to be associated with CD8+ T-cell activation (Spearmans rho, p=6x10-8). A CMV specific IFN-{gamma} response was also associated with increased risk of developing TB disease (Conditional Logistic Regression, p=0.043, OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.02-4.83), and shorter time to TB diagnosis (Log Rank Mantel-Cox p=0.037). CMV positive infants who developed TB disease had lower expression of natural killer cell associated gene signatures and a lower frequency of CD3-CD4-CD8-lymphocytes. We identified transcriptional signatures predictive of risk of TB disease among CMV ELISpot positive (AUROC 0.98, accuracy 92.57%) and negative (AUROC 0.9, accuracy 79.3%) infants; the CMV negative signature validated in an independent infant study (AUROC 0.71, accuracy 63.9%).

    "abstract": "Primary cilia play a vital role in cellular sensing and signaling [1]. An essential component of ciliogenesis is intraflagellar transport (IFT), which first requires IFT-protein recruitment, IFT-protein-motor-protein assembly, axonemal engagement of IFT-protein complexes, and transition zone (TZ) gating [2-9]. The mechanistic understanding of these processes at the ciliary base was largely missing, because it is exceedingly challenging to observe the motion of IFT proteins in this crowded region using conventional microscopy. Here, we report short trajectory tracking of IFT proteins at the base of mammalian primary cilia by optimizing single-particle tracking photoactivated localization microscopy (sptPALM) [10, 11], balancing the imaging requirements of tracking speed, tracking duration, and localization precision for IFT88-mEOS4b in live human retinal pigment epithelial (hTERT-RPE-1) cells. Intriguingly, we found that mobile IFT proteins \\\"switched gears\\\" multiple times from the distal appendages (DAPs) to the ciliary compartment (CC), moving slowly in the DAPs, relatively fast in the proximal TZ, slowly again in the distal TZ, and then much faster in the CC.

    "abstract": "{beta}- and {gamma}-cytoplasmic-actin are nearly indistinguishable in their amino acid sequence, but are encoded by different genes that play non-redundant biological roles. The key determinants that drive their functional distinction are unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that {beta}- and {gamma}-actin functions are defined by their nucleotide, rather than their amino acid sequence, using targeted editing of the mouse genome. Although previous studies have shown that disruption of {beta}-actin gene critically impacts cell migration and mouse embryogenesis, we demonstrate here that generation of a mouse lacking {beta}-actin protein by editing {beta}-actin gene to encode {gamma}-actin protein, and vice versa, does not affect cell migration and/or organism survival. Our data suggest that the essential in vivo function of {beta}-actin is provided by the gene sequence independent of the encoded protein isoform. We propose that this regulation constitutes a global \\\"silent code\\\" mechanism that controls the functional diversity of protein isoforms.",

To study the factors that influence receptor phosphorylation, we have coupled Single Molecule Pull-down (SiMPull) measurements with rule-based modeling of EGFR signaling. Using SiMPull, we quantified the phosphorylation state of thousands of individual receptors. These measurements enabled the first direct detection of multisite phosphorylation on full-length EGFR and revealed that the extent of phosphorylation varies by tyrosine site and is dependent on the relative abundance of signaling partners that limit access by tyrosine phosphatases. We also evaluated the impact of oncogenic mutations and ligands with varying affinity on phosphorylation kinetics. Simulations highlight the importance of dimer lifetimes on EGFR phosphorylation and signaling output.",

    "abstract": "Amino acids are essential metabolites but can also be toxic when present at high levels intracellularly. Substrate-induced down-regulation of amino acid transporters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is thought to be a mechanism to avoid this toxicity. It has been shown that unregulated uptake by the general amino acid permease Gap1 causes cells to become sensitive to amino acids. Here, we show that overexpression of eight other amino acid transporters (Agp1, Bap2, Can1, Dip5, Gnp1, Lyp1, Put4 or Tat2) also induces a growth defect when specific single amino acids are present at concentrations of 0.5-5 mM. We can now state that all proteinogenic amino acids, as well as the important metabolite ornithine, are growth inhibitory to S. cerevisiae when transported into the cell at high enough levels. Measurements of initial transport rates and cytosolic pH show that toxicity is due to amino acid accumulation and not to the influx of co-transported protons. The amino acid sensitivity phenotype is a useful tool that reports on the in vivo activity of transporters and has allowed us to identify new transporter-specific substrates.",

Localization, timing of interactions and changes in cellular structure are all crucial to ensure correct assembly, function and regulation of protein complexes1-4. Live cell imaging can reveal protein distributions and dynamics but experimental and theoretical challenges prevented its use to produce quantitative data and a model of mitosis that comprehensively integrates information and enables analysis of the dynamic interactions between the molecular parts of the mitotic machinery within changing cellular boundaries.\\n\\nTo address this, we generated a 4D image data-driven, canonical model of the morphological changes during mitotic progression of human cells. We used this model to integrate dynamic 3D concentration data of many fluorescently knocked-in mitotic proteins, imaged by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy-calibrated microscopy5. The approach taken here in the context of the MitoSys consortium to generate a dynamic protein atlas of human cell division is generic. It can be applied to systematically map and mine dynamic protein localization networks that drive cell division in different cell types and can be conceptually transferred to other cellular functions.",

Using ChIA-PET data as benchmark, we demonstrated that Lollipop accurately predicts CTCF-mediated chromatin interactions both within and across cell-types, and outperforms other methods based only on CTCF motif orientation. Predictions were confirmed computationally and experimentally by Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C). Moreover, our approach reveals novel determinants of CTCF-mediated chromatin wiring, such as gene expression within the loops.

    "abstract": "Genetic evidence has revealed that the ancestors of modern human populations outside of Africa and their hominin sister groups, notably the Neanderthals, exchanged genetic material in the past. The distribution of these introgressed sequence-tracts along modern-day human genomes provides insight into the ancient structure and migration patterns of these archaic populations. Furthermore, it facilitates studying the selective processes that lead to the accumulation or depletion of introgressed genetic variation. Recent studies have developed methods to localize these introgressed regions, reporting long regions that are depleted of Neanderthal introgression and enriched in genes, suggesting negative selection against the Neanderthal variants. On the other hand, enriched Neanderthal ancestry in hair- and skin-related genes suggests that some introgressed variants facilitated adaptation to new environments. Here, we present a model-based method called diCal-admix and apply it to detect tracts of Neanderthal introgression in modern humans. We demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy through extensive simulations. We use our method to detect introgressed regions in modern human individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project, using a high coverage genome from a Neanderthal individual from the Altai mountains as reference. Our introgression detection results and findings concerning their functional implications are largely concordant with previous studies, and are consistent with weak selection against Neanderthal ancestry. We find some evidence that selection against Neanderthal ancestry was due to higher genetic load in Neanderthals, resulting from small effective population size, rather than Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities. Finally, we investigate the role of the X-chromosome in the divergence between Neanderthals and modern humans.",

    "abstract": "Valproic acid (VPA) and lithium are widely used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. However, the underlying mechanism of action of these drugs is not clearly understood. We used RNA-Seq analysis to examine the global profile of gene expression in a rat serotonergic cell line (RN46A) after exposure to these two mood stabilizer drugs. Numerous genes were differentially regulated in response to VPA (log2 fold change [&ge;] 1.0; i.e. odds ratio of [&ge;] 2, at FDR <5%), but only two genes (Dynlrb2 and Cdyl2) showed significant differential regulation after exposure of the cells to lithium, with the same analysis criteria. Both of these genes were also regulated by VPA. Many of the differentially expressed genes had functions of potential relevance to mood disorders or their treatment, such as several serpin family genes (including neuroserpin), Nts (neurotensin), Maob (monoamine oxidase B) and Ap2b1, which is important for synaptic vesicle function. Pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of Gene Ontology terms such as extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, cell adhesion and chemotaxis. This study in a cell line derived from the raphe nucleus has identified a range of genes and pathways that provide novel insights into the therapeutic action of the commonly used mood stabilizer drugs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance is a major global public health threat. In some cases the evolution of resistance to one antimicrobial seemingly results in enhanced sensitivity to another (known as  collateral sensitivity). This largely underexplored phenomenon represents a fascinating evolutionary paradigm that opens new therapeutic possibilities for patients infected with pathogens unresponsive to classical treatments. Intrinsic resistance to {beta}-lactams in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb, the causative agent of tuberculosis) has traditionally curtailed the use of these low-cost and easy-to-administer drugs for tuberculosis treatment. Recently, {beta}-lactam sensitivity has been reported in strains resistant to classical tuberculosis drug therapy, leading to a resurgence of interest in using {beta}-lactams in the clinic. Unfortunately though, there remains a limited understanding of the mechanisms driving {beta}-lactam sensitivity.\\n\\nMethodsWe used a novel combination of systems biology and computational approaches to characterize the molecular underpinnings of {beta}-lactam sensitivity in Mtb. We performed differential gene expression and coexpression analyses of genes previously associated with {beta}-lactam sensitivity and genes associated with resistance to classical tuberculosis drugs. Protein-protein interaction and gene regulatory network analyses were used to validate regulatory interactions between these genes, and random walks through the networks identified key mediators of these interactions. Further validation was obtained using functional in silico knockout of gene pairs.\\n\\nResultsOur results reveal up regulation of the key regulatory inhibitor of {beta}-lactamase production, blal, following treatment with classical drugs. Co-expression and network analyses showed direct co-regulation between genes associated with {beta}-lactam sensitivity and those associated with resistance to classical tuberculosis treatment. blal and its downstream genes (sigC and atpH) were found to be key mediators of these interactions.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results support the hypothesis that Mtb {beta}-lactam sensitivity is a collateral consequence of the evolution of resistance to classical tuberculosis drugs, mediated through changes to transcriptional regulation. These findings support continued exploration of {beta}-lactams for the treatment of tuberculosis, particularly for patients infected with strains resistant to classical therapies that are otherwise difficult to treat. Importantly, this work also highlights the potential of systems-level and network biology approaches to improve our understanding of collateral drug sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Given that the dearth of new antibiotic development loads an existential burden on successful infectious disease therapy1, health organizations are calling for alternative approaches to combat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Here, we report a drug-free photonic approach to eliminate MRSA through photobleaching of staphyloxanthin, an indispensable membrane-bound antioxidant of S. aureus2-5. The photobleaching process, uncovered through a transient absorption imaging study and quantitated by absorption spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, decomposes staphyloxanthin and sensitizes MRSA to reactive oxygen species attack. Consequently, staphyloxanthin bleaching by low-level blue light eradicates MRSA synergistically with external or internal reactive oxygen species. The effectiveness of this synergistic therapy is validated in MRSA culture, MRSA-infected macrophage cells, S. aureus biofilms, and a mouse wound infection model. Collectively, these findings highlight broad applications of staphyloxanthin photobleaching for treatment of MRSA infections.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing puzzle in perception concerns the subjective impression of vivid color experience in the periphery. While peripheral color processing is not entirely insensitive, the subjective vividness seems unsupported by the relative paucity of representation in the periphery. Inspired by the flashed face distortion effect, in which peripheral faces are perceived as somewhat exaggerated or distorted when they are preceded by flashes of other faces in the same location, we attempted to create an equivalent illusion in the domain of color. The hypothesis is that under temporal overload, patches of colorful dots may be perceived as more exaggerated in terms of saturation. We confirmed this hypothesis with the observation of a significant effect of modest magnitude, which was replicated in a second experiment. These results suggest that subjective inflation of perceived color saturation does occur in the periphery, when the perceptual system is sufficiently occupied temporally and spatially. We discuss the relationship between the observed effects with previous findings of liberal detection biases in the unattended periphery.",
