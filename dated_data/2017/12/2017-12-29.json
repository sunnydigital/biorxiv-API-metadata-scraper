    "abstract": "Summary (Abstract)Macromolecular crowding has a profound impact on reaction rates and the physical properties of the cell interior, but the mechanisms that regulate crowding are poorly understood. We developed Genetically Encoded Multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs) to dissect these mechanisms. GEMs are homomultimeric scaffolds fused to a fluorescent protein. GEMs self-assemble into bright, stable fluorescent particles of defined size and shape. By combining tracking of GEMs with genetic and pharmacological approaches, we discovered that the mTORC1 pathway can tune the effective diffusion coefficient of macromolecules [&ge;]15 nm in diameter more than 2-fold without any discernable effect on the motion of molecules [&ge;]5 nm. These mTORCI-dependent changes in crowding and rheology affect phase-separation both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results establish a role for mTORCI in controlling both the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm and the phase-separation of biopolymers.",

    "abstract": "The relevance of interspecific resource competition in the context of community assembly by herbivorous insects is a well-known topic in ecology. Most previous studies focused on local species assemblies, that shared host plants. Few studies evaluated species pairs within a single taxon when investigating the effects of host plant sharing at the regional scale. Herein, we explore the effect of plant sharing on the geographical co-occurrence patterns of 232 butterflies distributed across the Japanese archipelago; we use two spatial scales (10 x 10 km and 1 x 1 km grids) to this end. We considered that we might encounter one of two predictable patterns in terms of the relationship between co-occurrence and host sharing among butterflies. On the one hand, host sharing might promote distributional exclusivity attributable to interspecific resource competition. On the other hand, sharing of host plants may promote co-occurrence attributable to filtering by resource niche. At both grid scales, we found significant negative correlations between host use similarity and distributional exclusivity. Our results support the hypothesis that the butterfly co-occurrence pattern across the Japanese archipelago is better explained by filtering via resource niche rather than interspecific resource competition.",

Consequently, we conducted the largest ever longitudinal study of the hormonal correlates of womens preferences for facial masculinity (N=584). Analyses showed no compelling evidence that preferences for facial masculinity were related to changes in womens salivary steroid hormone levels. Furthermore, both within-subject and between-subject comparisons showed no evidence that oral contraceptive use decreased masculinity preferences. However, women generally preferred masculinized over feminized versions of mens faces, particularly when assessing mens attractiveness for short-term, rather than long-term, relationships.

    "abstract": "In all chromosome conformation capture based experiments the accuracy with which contacts are detected varies considerably because of the uneven distribution of restriction sites along genomes. In addition, repeated sequences as well as homologous, large identical regions remain invisible to the assay because of the ambiguities they introduce during the alignment of the sequencing reads along the genome. As a result, the investigation of homologs during meiosis prophase through 3C studies has been limited. Here, we redesigned and reassembled in yeast a 145kb region with regularly spaced restriction sites for various enzymes. Thanks to this Syn-3C design, we enhanced the signal to noise ratio and improved the visibility of the entire region. We also improved our understanding of Hi-C data and definition of resolution. The redesigned sequence is now distinguishable from its native homologous counterpart in an isogenic diploid strain. As a proof of principle, we track the establishment of homolog pairing during meiotic prophase in a synchronized population. This provides new insights on the individualization and pairing of homologs, as well as on their internal restructuration into arrays of loops during meiosis prophase. Overall, we show the interest of redesigned genomic regions to explore complex biological questions otherwise difficult to address.",

    "abstract": "Sexual dimorphism has been reported in the prevalence, onset and progression of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. We hypothesize that immunological signaling in the developing brain, notably the complement cascade underlying microglial synaptic pruning, could be one mechanism for this dimorphism. Here we show that genes differentially expressed between male and female normal cortical development are enriched for pathways associated with the activation of the innate immune system, complement cascade and phagocytic processes. Specifically, the male brain is enriched for the expression of genes associated with phagocytic function of microglia through complement-dependent synaptic pruning especially at the developmental stages before birth. Our results suggest the existence of a common regulatory module involved in both prenatal immune activation in males and postnatal immune activation in females. The activation of immune pruning pathways at different stages of normal male and female development could provide valuable insights about critical periods of plasticity and refinement in the human cortex that could explain the different vulnerabilities of males and females to neurological disorders.",

First we developed a method to reconstruct atomic details of DNA structures from a 3-site per nucleotide CG model, which uses a DNA fragment library. Next, for the protein-DNA interface, we referred to the sidechain orientations in the known structure of the target interface when available. The other parts are modeled by existing tools. We confirmed the accuracy of the protocol in various aspects including the structure deviation in the self-reproduction, the base pair reproducibility, atomic contacts at the protein-DNA interface, and feasibility of the posterior AA simulations.",

    "abstract": "MotivationLong non-coding RNAs(lncRNAs) can indirectly regulate mRNAs expression levels by sequestering microRNAs (miRNAs), and act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) or as sponges. Previous studies identified lncRNA-mediated sponge interactions in various cancers including the breast cancer. However, breast cancer subtypes are quite distinct in terms of their molecular profiles; therefore, ceRNAs are expected to be subtype-specific as well.\\n\\nResultsTo find lncRNA-mediated ceRNA interactions in breast cancer subtypes, we develop an integrative approach. We conduct partial correlation analysis and kernel independence tests on patient gene expression profiles and further refine the candidate interactions with miRNA target information. We find that although there are sponges common to multiple subtypes, there are also distinct subtype-specific interactions. Functional enrichment of mRNAs that participate in these interactions highlights distinct biological processes for different subtypes. Interestingly, some of the ceRNAs also reside in close proximity in the genome; for example, those involving HOX genes, HOTAIR, miR-196a-1 and miR-196a-2. We also discover subtype-specific sponge interactions with high prognostic potential. For instance, when grouping is based on the expression patterns of specific sponge interactions, patients differ significantly in their survival distributions. If on the other hand, patients are grouped based on the individual RNA expression profiles of the sponge participants, they do not exhibit a significant difference in survival. These results can help shed light on subtype-specific mechanisms of breast cancer, and the methodology developed herein can help uncover sponges in other diseases.",

    "abstract": "Endogenously cueing a stimulus for attention enhances sensory processing of the attended stimulus, and efficiently selects information from the attended stimulus for guiding behavioral decisions. Yet, it is unknown if these sensory and decisional components of endogenous attention are under the control of common, overlapping or distinct mechanisms. Here, we tested human observers in a multi-alternative visuospatial attention task with probabilistic spatial cues, whose predictive validity varied across spatial locations. Observers behavioral choices were analyzed with a multidimensional signal detection model, derived from Bayesian decision theory. The model effectively decoupled attentions effects on perceptual sensitivity from those on decisional thresholds (bias), and revealed striking dissociations between them. Sensitivity was highest at the cued location, and not significantly different among uncued locations, suggesting a spotlight-like allocation of sensory resources at the cued location. On the other hand, bias varied systematically with endogenous cue validity, suggesting a graded distribution of decision thresholds across all locations. Cueing-induced modulations of sensitivity and bias were uncorrelated within and across subjects. Finally, bias selectively correlated with key measures of decision-making: reaction times were strongly correlated with bias, cueing-induced benefits in reaction times were correlated with bias changes independently of sensitivity changes, and subjects who exhibited higher bias, rather than higher sensitivity, toward the cued location produced more optimal behavioral decisions. Our model and findings demonstrate that endogenous cueing of attention does not engage a unitary selection mechanism, but rather involves the operation of dissociable sensory enhancement and decisional selection processes.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe capacity for selective attention allows us to engage efficiently with the most important objects in the world around us. Attention affects the way we perceive important stimuli and also affects how we make behavioral decisions about these stimuli. In this study, we test human observers on a multiple alternative attention task and show that attentions effects on perceptual processing and decision-making can be dissociated. Specifically, attentions sensory effects alone are in line with the conventional notion of an attentional \\\"spotlight\\\". These insights are obtained with a novel Bayesian decision model, which we propose as a powerful tool for teasing apart component processes of cognitive phenomena, and could aid the search for the neural correlates of these phenomena.",

We previously showed that 15d-PGJ2 mediated anti-inflammatory responses are dependent on the translational inhibition through its interaction with eIF4A. Binding of 15d-PGJ2 to eIF4A specifically blocks the interaction between eIF4G and eIF4A leads to the formation of stress granules (SGs), which cluster mRNAs with inhibited translation. Here we show that the binding between 15d-PGJ2 and eIF4A specifically blocks the interaction between the MIF4G domain of eIF4G and eIF4A. To reveal the mechanism of this interaction, we used computational simulation-based docking studies and identified that the carboxyl tail of 15d-PGJ2 could stabilize the binding of 15d-PGJ2 to eIF4A through arginine 295 of eIF4A, which is the first suggestion that the 15d-PGJ2 tail play a physiological role. Interestingly, the putative 15d-PGJ2 binding site on eiF4A is conserved across many species, suggesting a biological role.

    "abstract": "Neurons communicate through Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release at presynaptic active zones (AZs). Neurotransmitter release properties play a key role in defining information flow in circuits and are tuned during multiple forms of plasticity. Despite their central role in determining neurotransmitter release properties, little is known about how Ca2+ channel levels are modulated to calibrate synaptic function. We used CRISPR to tag the Drosophila CaV2 Ca2+ channel Cacophony (Cac) and investigated the regulation of endogenous Ca2+ channels during homeostatic plasticity in males in which all endogenous Cac channels are tagged. We found that heterogeneously distributed Cac is highly predictive of neurotransmitter release probability at individual AZs and differentially regulated during opposing forms of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Specifically, Cac levels at AZ are increased during chronic and acute presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP), and live imaging during acute expression of PHP reveals proportional Ca2+ channel accumulation across heterogeneous AZs. In contrast, endogenous Cac levels do not change during presynaptic homeostatic depression (PHD), implying that the reported reduction in Ca2+ influx during PHD is achieved through functional adaptions to pre-existing Ca2+ channels. Thus, distinct mechanisms bi-directionally modulate presynaptic Ca2+ levels to maintain stable synaptic strength in response to diverse challenges, with Ca2+ channel abundance providing a rapidly tunable substrate for potentiating neurotransmitter release over both acute and chronic timescales.",

    "abstract": "Nucleosomes cover most of the genome and are thought to be displaced by transcription factors (TFs) in regions that direct gene expression. However, the modes of interaction between TFs and nucleosomal DNA remain largely unknown. Here, we use nucleosome consecutive affinity-purification systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (NCAP-SELEX) to systematically explore interactions between the nucleosome and 220 TFs representing diverse structural families. Consistently with earlier observations, we find that the vast majority of TFs have less access to nucleosomal DNA than to free DNA. The motifs recovered from TFs bound to nucleosomal and free DNA are generally similar; however, steric hindrance and scaffolding by the nucleosome result in specific positioning and orientation of the motifs. Many TFs preferentially bind close to the end of nucleosomal DNA, or to periodic positions at its solvent-exposed side. TFs often also bind nucleosomal DNA in a particular orientation, because the nucleosome breaks the local rotational symmetry of DNA. Some TFs also specifically interact with DNA located at the dyad position where only one DNA gyre is wound, whereas other TFs prefer sites spanning two DNA gyres and bind specifically to each of them. Our work reveals striking differences in TF binding to free and nucleosomal DNA, and uncovers a rich interaction landscape between the TFs and the nucleosome.",

Here, nuclear rupture and DNA breaks caused by constricted migration are quantified in different phases of cell cycle - which is effectively repressed. Cancer lines with varying levels of contact inhibition and lamina proteins exhibit diverse frequencies of nuclear lamina rupture after migration, with prerupture dilation of gene-edited RFP-Lamin-B1 preceding DNA repair factor leakage in pressure-controlled distension. Post-migration rupture indeed associates with mis-localized DNA repair factors and increased DNA breaks as quantified by pan-nucleoplasmic foci of {gamma}H2AX, with foci counts always suppressed in late cell cycle. When contact-inhibited cells migrate through large pores into sparse microenvironments, cells re-enter cell cycle consistent with release from contact inhibition. In contrast, constricting pores effectively delay re-entry, but the excess DNA damage nonetheless exceeds any cell cycle dependence. Partial depletion of topoisomerase does not strongly affect cell cycle or the excess DNA damage, consistent with weak dependencies on replication stress.

    "abstract": "Ever since Pagets seed-and-soil and Ewings connectivity hypotheses to explain tumor metastasis (1,2), it has become clear that cancer progression can be envisaged as an ecological phenomenon. This connection has flourished during the past two decades (3-7), giving rise to important insights into the ecology and evolution of cancer progression, with therapeutic implications (8-10). Here, we take a metapopulation view of metastasis (i.e. the migration to and colonization of, habitat patches) and represent it as a bipartite network, distinguishing source patches, or organs that host a primary tumor, and acceptor patches, or organs colonized ultimately from the source through metastasis. Using 20,326, biomedical records obtained from literature, we show that: (i) the network structure of cancer ecosystems is non-random, exhibiting a nested subset pattern as has been found both in the distribution of species across islands and island-like habitats (11-13), and in the distribution of among species interactions across different ecological networks (14-16); (ii) similar to ecological networks, there is a heterogeneous distribution of degree (i.e., number of connections associated with a source or acceptor organ); (iii) there is a significant correlation between metastatic incidence (or the frequency with which tumor cells from a source organ colonize an acceptor one) and arterial blood supply, suggesting that more irrigated organs have a higher probability of developing metastasis or being invaded; (iv) there is a positive correlation between metastatic incidence and acceptor organ degree (or number of different tumor-bearing source organs that generate metastasis in a given acceptor organ), and a negative one between acceptor organ degree and number of stem cell divisions, implying that there are preferred sink organs for metastasis and that this could be related to average acceptor organ cell longevity; (v) there is a negative association between organ cell turnover and source organ degree, implying that organs with rapid cell turnovers tend to generate more metastasis, a process akin to the phenomenon of propagule pressure in ecology (17); and (vi) the cancer ecosystem network exhibits a modular structure in both source and acceptor patches, suggesting that some of them share more connections among themselves than with the rest of the network. We show that both niche-related processes occurring at the organ level as well as spatial connectivity and propagule pressure contribute to metastaticspread and result in a non-random cancer network, which exhibits a truncated power law degree distribution, clustering and a nested subset structure. The similarity between the cancer network and ecological networks highlights the importance of ecological approaches in increasing our understanding of patterns in cancer incidence and dynamics, which may lead to new strategies to control tumor spread within the human ecosystem.",

Several studies have reported a role for folate-dependent 1-carbon (1C) metabolism in stem cells, however, its exact mode of action and how it interacts with other cues is largely unknown. Here, we report a link between the Eph:ephrin cell-cell communication pathway and 1C metabolism in controlling differentiation of neural stem cells. Transcriptional and functional analyses following ephrin stimulation revealed alterations in folate metabolism-related genes and enzymatic activity. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that Eph-B forward signaling alters the methylation state of H3K4 by regulating 1C metabolism, and locks neural stem cells in a differentiation-ready state.

We confirm previous reports of individual and cross-disorder SNP-heritability for major psychiatric disorders and perform a cross-disorder genome-wide association study. We identify four novel genome-wide significant loci encompassing variants predicted to regulate genes expressed in radial glia and interneurons in the developing neocortex during midgestation. This epoch is supported by partitioning cross-disorder SNP-heritability which is enriched at regulatory chromatin active during fetal neurodevelopment. These findings indicate that dysregulation of genes that direct neurodevelopment by common genetic variants results in general liability for many later psychiatric outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The advent of sequencing technologies and the consequent computational analysis of genomes has confirmed the evidence that DNA sequences contain a relevant amount of repetitions. A particularly important category of repeating sequences is that of tandem repeats (TRs). TRs are short, almost identical sequences that lie adjacent to each other. The abundance of TRs in eukaryotic genomes has suggested that they play a role in many cellular processes and, indeed, are also involved in the onset and progress of several genetic disorders.\\n\\nBuilding upon the idea that similar sequences can be easily displayed using graphical methods, we formalized the structure that TRs induce in dot plot matrices where a sequence is compared with itself. We further observed that a compact representation of these matrices can be built and searched in linear time in the size of the input sequence. Exploiting this observation, we developed an algorithm fast enough to be suitable for whole-genome discovery of tandem repeats.\\n\\nWe compared our algorithm with seven state of the art methods using as a gold standard five collections of tandem repeats: pathology-linked, forensic, for population analysis, genealogic-oriented, and variable TRs in regulatory regions. In addition, we run our algorithm on seven reference genomes to test the suitability of our approach for whole-genome analysis. Experiments show that our method: is always more accurate than the other methods, and completes the analysis of the biggest available reference genome in about one day running at a rate of 0.98Gbp/h on a standard workstation.",

    "abstract": "Testing for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) is an important component in almost all analyses of population genetic data. Genetic markers that violate HWE are often treated as special cases; for example, they may be flagged as possible genotyping errors or they may be investigated more closely for evolutionary signatures of interest. The presence of population structure is one reason why genetic markers may fail a test of HWE. This is problematic because almost all natural populations studied in the modern setting show some degree of structure. Therefore, it is important to be able to detect deviations from HWE for reasons other than structure. To this end, we extend statistical tests of HWE to allow for population structure, which we call a test of \\\"structural HWE\\\" (sHWE). Additionally, our new test allows one to automatically choose tuning parameters and identify accurate models of structure. We demonstrate our approach on several important studies, provide theoretical justification for the test, and present empirical evidence for its utility. We anticipate the proposed test will be useful in a broad range of analyses of genome-wide population genetic data.",

Here we present the first cultivated thermophilic representative with a sequenced genome, which allows to search for adaptive strategies and for traits that shape the evolution of Thaumarchaeota. Candidatus Nitrosocaldus cavascurensis has been cultivated from a hot spring in Ischia, Italy. It grows optimally at 68{degrees}C under chemolithoautotrophic conditions on ammonia or urea converting ammonia stoichiometrically into nitrite with a generation time of approximately 25h. Phylogenetic analyses based on ribosomal proteins place the organism as a sister group to all known mesophilic AOA. The 1.58 Mb genome of Ca. N. cavascurensis harbors an amoAXCB gene cluster encoding ammonia monooxygenase, genes for a 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway for autotrophic carbon fixation, but also genes that indicate potential alternative energy metabolisms. Although a bona fide gene for nitrite reductase is missing, the organism is sensitive to NO-scavenging, underlining the importance of this compound for AOA metabolism. Ca. N. cavascurensis is distinct from all other AOA in its gene repertoire for replication, cell division and repair. Its genome has an impressive array of mobile genetic elements and other recently acquired gene sets, including conjugative systems, a provirus, transposons and cell appendages. Some of these elements indicate recent exchange with the environment, whereas others seem to have been domesticated and might convey crucial metabolic traits.",

Our data demonstrate that killing activity from phage derived bacteriocins of P. syringae (R-type syringacins) is widespread. Despite a high overall diversity of bacteriocin activity, strains can broadly be classified into five main killing types and two main sensitivity types. Furthermore, we show that killing activity switches frequently between strains, and that switches correlate with localized recombination of two genes that together encode the proteins that specify bacteriocin targeting. Lastly, we demonstrate that phage derived bacteriocin killing activity can be swapped between strains simply through expression of these two genes in trans. Overall, our study characterizes extensive diversity of killing activity for phage derived bacteriocins of P. syringae across strains and highlights the power of localized recombination to alter phenotypes that mediate strain interactions during evolution of natural populations and communities.",

However, in the field of written language processing, it is unclear whether semantics of a word or low-level visual features affect early neural processing advantages. The current study aimed to investigate the role of semantic content on reward and loss associations. Participants completed a learning session to associate either words (Experiment 1, N=24) or pseudowords (Experiment 2, N=24) with different monetary outcomes (gain-associated, neutral or loss-associated). Gain-associated stimuli were learned fastest. Behavioural and neural response changes based on the associated outcome were further investigated in separate test sessions. Responses were faster towards gain- and loss-associated than neutral stimuli if they were words, but not pseudowords. Early P1 effects of associated outcome occurred for both pseudowords and words. Specifically, loss-association resulted in increased P1 amplitudes to pseudowords, compared to decreased amplitudes to words. Although visual features are likely to explain P1 effects for pseudowords, the inversed effect for words suggests that semantic content affects associative learning, potentially leading to stronger associations.\\n\\nHighlights- Neural mechanisms of gain/loss association to pseudowords and words were investigated\\n- Loss effects can be observed for the P1 component\\n- Words and pseudowords differ in the direction of loss effects\\n- Semantic content may play a role during word association\\n- Low-level visual features may play a role during pseudoword association",

These length-dependent transcriptional changes are modest in Mecp2-mutant samples, but, given the low sensitivity of high-throughput transcriptome profiling technology, the statistical significance of these results needs to be re-evaluated. Here, we show that the apparent length-dependent trends previously observed in MeCP2 microarray and RNA-Sequencing datasets, particularly in genes with low fold-changes, disappeared after accounting for baseline variability estimated from randomized control samples. As we found no similar bias with NanoString technology, this long-gene bias seems to be particular to PCR amplification-based platforms.

    "abstract": "Intra-protein residue-level contact prediction has drawn a lot of attentions in recent years and made very good progress, but much fewer methods are dedicated to inter-protein contact prediction, which are important for understanding how proteins interact at structure and residue level. Direct coupling analysis (DCA) is popular for intra-protein contact prediction, but extending it to inter-protein contact prediction is challenging since it requires too many interlogs (i.e., interacting homologs) to be effective, which cannot be easily fulfilled especially for a putative interacting protein pair in eukaryotes. We show that deep learning, even trained by only intra-protein contact maps, works much better than DCA for inter-protein contact prediction. We also show that a phylogeny-based method can generate a better multiple sequence alignment for eukaryotes than existing genome-based methods and thus, lead to better inter-protein contact prediction. Our method shall be useful for protein docking, protein interaction prediction and protein interaction network construction.",

    "abstract": "Much of the ecological, taxonomic and biodiversity research relies on understanding of phylogenetic relationships among organisms. There are multiple available classification systems that all suffer from differences in naming, incompleteness, presence of multiple non-monophyletic entities and poor correspondence of divergence times. These issues render taxonomic comparisons across the main groups of eukaryotes and all life in general difficult at best. By using the monophyly criterion, roughly comparable time of divergence and information from multiple phylogenetic reconstructions, I propose an alternative classification system for the domain Eukarya to improve hierarchical taxonomical comparability for animals, plants, fungi and multiple protist groups. Following this rationale, I propose 32 kingdoms of eukaryotes that are treated in 10 subdomains. These kingdoms are further separated into 43, 115, 140 and 353 taxa at the level of subkingdom, phylum, subphylum and class, respectively (http://dx.doi.org/10.15156/BIO/587483). Most of the names have been used previously or these were deduced from those of the type taxa to be able to unambiguously link genera to higher taxonomic levels. In the era of phylogenomics, understanding about the phylogenetic relationships among organisms is rapidly increasing. Classifications systems must keep pace with this race to serve the research community by consistent improvements in precision in terms of taxonomic resolution and maintaining monophyly of the ingredient taxa.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a simple and computationally efficient method for fitting the admixture model of genetic population structure, called ALStructure. The strategy of ALStructure is to first estimate the low-dimensional linear subspace of the population admixture components and then search for a model within this subspace that is consistent with the admixture models natural probabilistic constraints. Central to this strategy is the observation that all models belonging to this constrained space of solutions are risk-minimizing and have equal likelihood, rendering any additional optimization unnecessary. The low-dimensional linear subspace is estimated through a recently introduced principal components analysis method that is appropriate for genotype data, thereby providing a solution that has both principal components and probabilistic admixture interpretations. Our approach differs fundamentally from other existing methods for estimating admixture, which aim to fit the admixture model directly by searching for parameters that maximize the likelihood function or the posterior probability. We observe that ALStructure typically outperforms existing methods both in accuracy and computational speed under a wide array of simulated and real human genotype datasets. Throughout this work we emphasize that the admixture model is a special case of a much broader class of models for which algorithms similar to ALStructure may be successfully employed.",

The neural pathways that coordinate internal and external cues to motivate food seeking behaviors are only partly known. Drosophila that are food deprived increase locomotor activity, are more efficient in locating a discrete source of nutrition, and are willing to overcome adversity to obtain food. Here we developed a semi-naturalistic assay and show that two distinct dopaminergic neural circuits regulate food-seeking behaviors. One group, the PAM neurons, functions in food deprived flies while the other functions in well fed flies, and both promote food seeking. These satiation state-dependent circuits converge on dopamine D1 receptor-expressing Kenyon cells of the mushroom body, where neural activity promotes food seeking behavior independent of satiation state. These findings provide evidence for active food seeking in well-fed flies that is separable from hunger-driven seeking.",

Cholinergic inputs shift cortical dynamics from synchronous to asynchronous and improves the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of sensory response. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of these changes remain unclear. Using simultaneous extracellular and whole cell patch recordings in layer 4 barrel cortex we show that activation of the cholinergic system has a differential effect on ongoing and sensory evoked activities. Cholinergic activation eliminated the large and correlated spontaneous synaptic fluctuations in membrane potential while sparing the synaptic response to whisker stimulation. This differential effect of cholinergic activation provides a unified explanation for the increased SNR of sensory response and for the reduction in both trial to trial variability and noise correlations as well as explaining the shift into desynchronized cortical state which are the hallmarks of arousal and attention.",

    "abstract": "The diversification rate hypothesis (DRH) proposes that spatial patterns of species richness result from spatial variation in net diversification rates. We developed an approach using a time-calibrated phylogeny and distributional data to estimate the maximum explanatory power of the DRH, over a given time period, to current species richness in an area. We used this approach to study species richness patterns of a large family of suboscine birds across South America. The maximum explanatory power of the DRH increased with the duration of the time period considered and grain size; it ranged from 13 - 37 fold local increases in species richness for T = 33 Ma to less than 2-fold increases for T [&le;] 10 Ma. For large grain sizes ([&le;] 8{degrees} x 8{degrees}) diversification rate over the last 10 Ma could account for all the spatial variance in species richness, but for smaller grain sizes commonly used in biogeographical studies (1{degrees} x 1{degrees}), it could only explain < 16% of this variance. Thus, diversification since the Late Miocene, often thought to be a major determinant of Neotropical diversity, had a limited imprint on spatial richness patterns at small grain sizes. Further application of our approach will help determine the role of the DRH in explaining current spatial patterns of species richness.\\n\\nNote to readersThis manuscript has been seen by a few researchers, some of whom suggested that before publishing our work in a peer-reviewed journal we should conduct simulations to demonstrate that our methods properly estimate the contribution of variance in diversification rates to spatial variation in species richness. Although we believe that our approach derives logically from theory and statistics and is therefore valid, we understand that it is rather unique and see why some readers would think that an independent validation is necessary. Unable to complete such validation in the near future, however, we decided to make this manuscript available as a preprint to share our ideas and hopefully stimulate discussion on what we believe is a most interesting topic. We also hope to receive feedback that may enable us to improve our work for publication in a journal at a later date.",

    "abstract": "An important question in many biological applications, is to estimate or classify gene activity states (active or inactive) based on genome-wide transcriptomics data. Recently, we proposed a Bayesian method, titled MultiMM, which showed superior results compared to existing methods. In short, MultiMM performed better than existing methods on both simulated and real gene expression data, confirming well-known biological results and yielding better agreement with fluxomics data. Despite these promising results, MultiMM has numerous limitations. First, MultiMM leverages co-regulatory models to improve activity state estimates, but information about co-regulation is incorporated in a manner that assumes that networks are known with certainty. Second, MultiMM assumes that genes that change states in the dataset can be distinguished with certainty from those that remain in one state. Third, the model can be sensitive to extreme measures (outliers) of gene expression. In this manuscript, we propose a modified Bayesian approach, which addresses these three limitations by improving outlier handling and by explicitly modeling network and other uncertainty yielding improved gene activity state estimates when compared to MultiMM.",

    "abstract": "Polyomaviruses (PyVs) can cause serious disease in immunosuppressed hosts. Several pathogenic PyVs encode microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNAs that regulate gene expression via RNA silencing. Despite recent advances in understanding the activities of PyV miRNAs, the biological functions of PyV miRNAs during in vivo infections are mostly unknown. Studies presented here use murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) as a model to assess the roles of the PyV miRNAs in a natural host. This analysis reveals that a MuPyV mutant that is unable to express miRNAs has enhanced viral DNA loads in select tissues at late times after infection, indicating that during infection of a natural host, PyV miRNAs function to reduce viral replication during the persistent phase of infection. Additionally, MuPyV miRNAs promote viruria during the acute phase of infection as evidenced by a defect in shedding during infection with the miRNA mutant virus. The viruria defect of the miRNA mutant virus could be rescued by infecting Rag2-/-mice. These findings implicate miRNA activity in both the persistent and acute phases of infection and suggest a role for MuPyV miRNA in evading the adaptive immune response.\\n\\nImportanceMicroRNAs are expressed by diverse viruses, but for only a few is there any understanding of their in vivo function. PyVs can cause serious disease in immunocompromised hosts. Therefore, increased knowledge of how these viruses interact with the immune response is of possible clinical relevance. Here we show a novel activity for a viral miRNA in promoting virus shedding. This work indicates that in addition to any role for the PyV miRNA in long-term persistence, that it also has biological activity during the acute phase. As this mutant phenotype is alleviated by infection of mice lacking an effective adaptive immune response, our work also connects the in vivo activity of a PyV miRNA to the immune response. Given that PyV-associated disease is associated with alterations in the immune response, our findings may help to better understand how the balance between PyV and the immune response becomes altered in pathogenic states.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCoherence notions have a long history in statistics, as rhetorical devices that support the critical examination of statistical doctrines and practices. Within the special domain of dose-finding methodology, a widely-discussed coherence criterion has been advanced as a means to guard the conceptual integrity of formal dose-finding designs from ad hoc tinkering. This is not, however, the only possible coherence criterion relevant to dose finding. Indeed, a new coherence criterion emerges naturally when the near-universal practice of cohort-wise dose escalation is examined from a clinical perspective.\\n\\nMethodsThe practice of enrolling drug-naive patients into an escalation cohort is considered from a realistic perspective that acknowledges patients heterogeneity with respect to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. A new coherence criterion thereby emerges, requiring that an escalation dose be tried preferentially in participants who have already tolerated a lower dose, rather than in new enrollees who are drug-naive. The logical implications of this  precautionary coherence (PC) criterion are worked out in the setting of a 3+3 design. A  3+3/PC design that satisfies this criterion is described and visualized. A simulation study is performed, evaluating the long-run performance of this new design, relative to optimal 1-size-fits-all dosing.\\n\\nResultsUnder the PC criterion, the 3+3 dose-escalation design necessarily transmutes into a dose titration design. Two simple rules suffice to enable abandonment of low starting doses, and termination of escalation. The process of conducting the 3+3/PC trial itself models the application of a dose titration algorithm (DTA) that carries over readily into clinical care. The 3+3/PC trial also yields an interval-censored  dose-survival curve having a semantics that should prove familiar to oncology trialists. Simulated 3+3/PC trials yield DTAs over a median of 6 dose levels, achieving 50% improved population-level efficacy compared to optimal 1-size-fits-all dosing.\\n\\nConclusionsDose individualization can be accomplished within a trial conducted along  algorithmic lines resembling those of the inveterate 3+3 design. The dose-survival curve arising from this  3+3/PC design has semantics that should prove familiar and conceptually accessible to oncology trialists, and also seems capable of supporting more formal statistical treatments of the design. In the presence of sufficient heterogeneity in individualized optimal dosing, a 3+3/PC trial outperforms any conceivable 1-size-fits-all dose-finding design. This fact eliminates the rationale for the latter designs, and should put an end to the further development and promulgation of 1-size-fits-all dose finding.",

In the insect olfactory system encoding of odor information undergoes a transition from a dense spatio-temporal population code in the antennal lobe to a sparse code in the mushroom body. However, the exact mechanisms shaping odor representations and their role in sensory processing are incompletely identified. Here, we investigate the transformation from dense to sparse odor representations in a spiking model of the insect olfactory system, focusing on two ubiquitous neural mechanisms: spike-frequency adaptation at the cellular level and lateral inhibition at the circuit level. We find that cellular adaptation is essential for sparse representations in time (temporal sparseness), while lateral inhibition regulates sparseness in the neuronal space (population sparseness). The interplay of both mechanisms shapes dynamical odor representations, which are optimized for discrimination of odors during stimulus onset and offset. In addition, we find that odor identity is stored on a prolonged time scale in the adaptation levels but not in the spiking activity of the principal cells of the mushroom body, providing a testable hypothesis for the location of the so-called odor trace.",

    "abstract": "Myopia (nearsightedness) is an increasingly common cause of irreversible visual impairment. The ocular structures with greatest impact on refractive error are corneal curvature and axial length. Emmetropic eyes range in size within and across species, yet possess a balance between corneal curvature and axial length that is under genetic control. This scaling goes awry in myopia: 1 mm axial elongation is associated with ~3 Dioptres (D) myopia. Evidence that eye size prior to onset is a risk factor for myopia is conflicting. We applied Mendelian randomisation to test for a causal effect of eye size on refractive error. Genetic variants associated with corneal curvature identified in emmetropic eyes (22,180 individuals) were used as instrumental variables and tested for association with refractive error (139,697 individuals). A genetic risk score for the variants was tested for association with corneal curvature and axial length in an independent sample (315 emmetropes). The genetic risk score explained 2.3% (P=0.007) and 2.7% (P=0.002) of the variance in corneal curvature and axial length, respectively, in the independent sample, confirming these variants are predictive of eye size in emmetropes. The estimated causal effect of eye size on refractive error was + 1.41 D (95% CI. 0.65 to 2.16) less myopic refractive error per mm flatter cornea (P<0.001), corresponding to +0.48 D (95% CI. 0.22 to 0.73) more hypermetropic refractive error for an eye with a 1mm longer axial length. These results do not support the hypothesis that a larger eye size is a risk factor for myopia. We conclude the genetic determinants of normal eye size are not shared with those influencing susceptibility to myopia.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest class of cell surface receptors conveying extracellular information into intracellular signals. Many GPCRs have been shown to be able to oligomerize and it is firmly established that Class C GPCRs (e.g. metabotropic glutamate receptors) function as obligate dimers. However, the oligomerization capability of the larger Class A GPCRs (e.g. comprising the {beta}-adrenergic receptors ({beta}-ARs)) is still, despite decades of research, highly debated.\\n\\nHere we assess the oligomerization behavior of three prototypical Class A GPCRs, the {beta}1-ARs, {beta}2-ARs, and muscarinic M2Rs in single, intact cells. We combine two image correlation spectroscopy methods based on molecular brightness, i.e. the analysis of fluorescence fluctuations over space and over time, and thereby provide an assay able to robustly and precisely quantify the degree of oligomerization of GPCRs. In addition, we provide a comparison between two labelling strategies, namely C-terminally-attached fluorescent proteins and N-terminally-attached SNAP-tags, in order to rule out effects arising from potential fluorescent protein-driven oligomerization. The degree of GPCR oligomerization is expressed with respect to a set of previously reported as well as newly established monomeric or dimeric control constructs. Our data reveal that all three prototypical GPRCs studied display, under unstimulated conditions, a prevalently monomeric fingerprint. Only the {beta}2-AR shows a slight degree of oligomerization.\\n\\nFrom a methodological point of view, our study suggests three key aspects. First, the combination of two image correlation spectroscopy methods allows addressing cells transiently expressing high concentrations of membrane receptors, far from the single molecule regime, at a density where the kinetic equilibrium should favor dimers and higher-order oligomers. Second, our methodological approach, allows to selectively target cell membrane regions devoid of artificial oligomerization hot-spots (such as vesicles). Third, our data suggest that the {beta}1-AR appears to be a superior monomeric control than the widely used membrane protein CD86.\\n\\nTaken together, we suggest that our combined image correlation spectroscopy method is a powerful approach to assess the oligomerization behavior of GPCRs in intact cells at high expression levels.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer consists of highly heterogeneous tumors, whose cell of origin and driver oncogenes resulted difficult to be uniquely defined. Here we report that MYC acts as tumor reprogramming factor in mammary epithelial cells by inducing an alternative epigenetic program, which triggers loss of cell identity and activation of oncogenic pathways. Over-expression of MYC induces transcriptional repression of lineage-specifying transcription factors, causing decommissioning of luminal-specific enhancers. MYC-driven dedifferentiation supports the onset of a stem cell-like state by inducing the activation of de novo enhancers, which drive the transcriptional activation of oncogenic pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the MYC-driven epigenetic reprogramming favors the formation and maintenance of tumor initiating cells endowed with metastatic capacity. This study supports the notion that MYC-driven tumor initiation relies on cell reprogramming, which is mediated by the activation of MYC-dependent oncogenic enhancers, thus establishing a therapeutic rational for treating basal-like breast cancers.",

    "abstract": "The Centromere Binding Factor 3 (CBF3) complex binds the third Centromere DNA Element in organisms with point centromeres, such as S. cerevisiae. It is the only essential centromere binding complex as it facilitates genetic specification of point centromeres. It is therefore the most fundamental complex of the kinetochore in these organisms and its association with centromere DNA allows association of all other kinetochore components. We have determined the atomic structure of the core complex of CBF3, comprising 3 of its 4 components, using cryo-EM. The architecture of the complex is 'U'-shaped, with a deep, strongly basic channel that is narrow at one end and wide at the other. Combining our structure and in vitro assays, we present a model for its association with centromere DNA.",

    "abstract": "Both female and male sea urchins accumulate the major yolk protein (MYP) in the nutritive phagocytes of immature gonads before gametogenesis, and MYP is the most abundant protein in the coelomic fluid of both sexes. In females, MYP in the coelomic fluid is taken up by the nutritive phagocytes and transported to the growing oocytes. This study examined quantitative changes of MYP in the coelomic fluid of both sexes during the reproductive cycle of wild sea urchins, Mesocentrotus nudus. Levels of MYP in the coelomic fluid of females increased and reached a peak at the histological pre-mature stage of gonad activity (i.e. Stage 3), and positive correlation between the MYP level and the gonadosomatic index (GSI) was observed. In male sea urchins the level of MYP in the coelomic fluid increased at the pre-mature stage, though positive correlation between the MYP level and GSI was not observed. These results indicate that MYP in the coelomic fluid is suitable as a biomarker of the onset and progression of sexual maturity in female sea urchins.",
