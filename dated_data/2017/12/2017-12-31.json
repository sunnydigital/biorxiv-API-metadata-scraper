    "abstract": "Neuron activity accompanies synapse formation and maintenance, but how early circuit activity contributes to behavior development is not well understood. Here, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans egg-laying motor circuit as a model to understand how coordinated cell and circuit activity develops and drives a robust two-state behavior in adults. Using calcium imaging in behaving animals, we find the serotonergic Hermaphrodite Specific Neurons (HSNs) and vulval muscles show rhythmic calcium transients in L4 larvae before eggs are produced. HSN activity in L4 is tonic and lacks the alternating burst-firing/quiescent pattern seen in egg-laying adults. Vulval muscle activity in L4 is initially uncoordinated but becomes synchronous as the anterior and posterior muscle arms meet at HSN synaptic release sites. However, coordinated muscle activity does not require presynaptic HSN input. Using reversible silencing experiments, we show that neuronal and vulval muscle activity in L4 is not required for the onset of adult behavior. Instead, the accumulation of eggs in the adult uterus renders the muscles sensitive to HSN input. Sterilization or acute electrical silencing of the vulval muscles inhibits presynaptic HSN activity, and reversal of muscle silencing triggers a homeostatic increase in HSN activity and egg release that maintains ~12-15 eggs in the uterus. Feedback of egg accumulation depends upon the vulval muscle postsynaptic terminus, suggesting a retrograde signal sustains HSN synaptic activity and egg release. Our results show that egg-laying behavior in C. elegans is driven by a homeostat that scales serotonin motor neuron activity in response to postsynaptic muscle feedback.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe functional importance of early, spontaneous neuron activity in synapse and circuit development is not well understood. Here we show that in the nematode C. elegans, the serotonergic Hermaphrodite Specific Neurons (HSNs) and postsynaptic vulval muscles show activity during circuit development, well before the onset of adult behavior. Surprisingly, early activity is not required for circuit development or the onset of adult behavior, and the circuit remains unable to drive egg laying until fertilized embryos are deposited into the uterus. Egg accumulation potentiates vulval muscle excitability, but ultimately acts to promote burst firing in the presynaptic HSNs during which eggs are laid. Our results suggest that mechanosensory feedback acts at three distinct steps to initiate, sustain, and terminate C. elegans egg-laying circuit activity and behavior.",

    "abstract": "Although we understand many aspects of how small proteins (number of residues less than about hundred) fold, it is a major challenge to understand how large proteins self-assemble. To partially overcome this challenge, we performed simulations using the Self-Organized Polymer model with Side Chains (SOP-SC) in guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), using the Molecular Transfer Model (MTM), to describe the folding of the 110-residue PDZ3 domain. The simulations reproduce the folding thermodynamics accurately including the melting temperature (Tm), the stability of the folded state with respect to the unfolded state. We show that the calculated dependence of ln kobs (kobs is the relaxation rate) has the characteristic Chevron shape. The slopes of the Chevron plots are in good agreement with experiments. We show that PDZ3 folds by four major pathways populating two metastable intermediates, in accord with the kinetic partitioning mechanism. The structure of one of the intermediates, populated after polypeptide chain collapse, is structurally similar to an equilibrium intermediate. Surprisingly, the connectivities between the intermediates and hence, the fluxes through the pathways depend on the concentration of GdmCl. The results are used to predict possible outcomes for unfolding of PDZ domain subject to mechanical forces. Our study demonstrates that, irrespective of the size or topology, simulations based on MTM and SOP-SC offer a framework for describing the folding of proteins, mimicking precisely the conditions used in experiments.",

In mild Alzheimers Disease, but not early mild cognitive impairment, characteristic brain atrophy was detected in FreeSurfer estimates of cortical thickness and subcortical and hippocampal subfield volumes. By contrast, functional connectivity analysis detected earlier significant changes. In early mild cognitive impairment these changes involved medial temporal lobe regions of transentorhinal, perirhinal and entorhinal cortices (associated with the earliest stages of neurofibrillary changes in Alzheimers Disease), hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and temporal pole, and cortical regions comprising or co-activated with the default-mode network, including rostral and medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and inferior temporal cortex. Key findings include: a) focal and bilaterally symmetric spatial organization of affected medial temporal lobe regions; b) mutual hyperconnectivity bilaterally involving ventral medial temporal lobe structures (temporal pole, uncus); and c) dorsal medial temporal lobe hypoconnectivity with anterior and posterior midline default-mode network nodes. These findings position medial temporal lobe resting state functional connectivity as a candidate biomarker of an Alzheimers Disease pathophysiological cascade, potentially in advance of clinical biomarkers, and coincident with biomarkers of the earliest stages of Alzheimers neuropathology.

    "abstract": "MotivationGenomic selection (GS) is a new breeding strategy by which the phenotypes of quantitative traits are usually predicted based on genome-wide markers of genotypes using conventional statistical models. However, the GS prediction models typically make strong assumptions and perform linear regression analysis, limiting their accuracies since they do not capture the complex, non-linear relationships within genotypes, and between genotypes and phenotypes.\\n\\nResultsWe present a deep learning method, named DeepGS, to predict phenotypes from genotypes. Using a deep convolutional neural network, DeepGS uses hidden variables that jointly represent features in genotypic markers when making predictions; it also employs convolution, sampling and dropout strategies to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional marker data. We used a large GS dataset to train DeepGS and compare its performance with other methods. In terms of mean normalized discounted cumulative gain value, DeepGS achieves an increase of 27.70%~246.34% over a conventional neural network in selecting top-ranked 1% individuals with high phenotypic values for the eight tested traits. Additionally, compared with the widely used method RR-BLUP, DeepGS still yields a relative improvement ranging from 1.44% to 65.24%. Through extensive simulation experiments, we also demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of DeepGS for the absent of outlier individuals and subsets of genotypic markers. Finally, we illustrated the complementarity of DeepGS and RR-BLUP with an ensemble learning approach for further improving prediction performance.\\n\\nAvailabilityDeepGS is provided as an open source R package available at https://github.com/cma2015/DeepGS.",

    "abstract": "We performed a genome-wide scan for recombination-mediated interlocus gene conversion and deletion events among a set of orthologous Alu loci in the Great Apes, and were surprised to discover an extreme excess of such events in the gorilla lineage versus other lineages. Gorilla events, but not events in other Great Apes, are strongly associated with a 15 bp motif commonly found in Alu sequences. This result is consistent with evolutionarily transient targeting of the motif by PRDM9, which induces double strand breaks and crossovers during meiosis at specific but rapidly changing sequence motifs. The motif is preferentially found in conversion recipients but not donors, and is substantially depleted in gorillas, consistent with loss of PRDM9 targets by meiotic drive. Recombination probability falls of exponentially with distance between loci, is reduced slightly by sequence divergence, and drops substantially with recipient divergence from the target motif. We identified 16 other high-copy motifs in human, often associated with transposable elements, with lineage-specific depletion and nearby gene conversion signatures, consistent with transient roles as PRDM9 targets. This work strengthens our understanding of recombination-mediated events in evolution and highlights the potential for interactions between PRDM9 and repetitive sequences to cause rapid change in the genome.",

    "abstract": "Uncovering common principles by which diverse modalities of information are processed is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. In mammalian brain, thalamus is the central processing station for inputs from sensory systems, subcortical motor systems, and cortex; a function subserved by over 30 defined nuclei1,2. Multiple thalamic nuclei send convergent information to each region of the forebrain, but whether there is a conserved architecture across the set of thalamic pathways projecting to each forebrain area has remained unresolved3-5. To uncover organizational principles of thalamic pathways, we produced a near-comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of thalamus. This revealed a common logic for thalamic nuclei serving all major cortical modalities. We found that almost all nuclei belong to one of three major profiles, with a given cortical area getting input from each of these profiles. These profiles lie on a single axis of variance aligned with the mediolateral axis of thalamus, and this axis is strongly enriched in genes encoding receptors and ion channels. We further show that each projection profile exhibits different electrophysiological signatures. Single-cell profiling revealed that rather than forming discrete classes, thalamic neurons lie on a spectrum, with intermediate cells existing between profiles. Thus, in contrast to canonical models of thalamus that suggest it is a switchboard primarily concerned with routing distinct modalities of information to distinct cortical regions, we show that the thalamocortical system is more akin to a molecularly-defined  filter bank repeatedly applied across modality. Together, we reveal striking covariation in the organization of thalamic pathways serving all input modalities and output targets, establishing a simple and comprehensive thalamic functional architecture.",

    "abstract": "Recent research provides evidence for a functional role of brain oscillations for perception. For example, auditory temporal resolution seems to be linked to individual gamma frequency of auditory cortex. Individual gamma frequency not only correlates with performance in between-channel gap detection tasks but can be modulated via auditory transcranial alternating current stimulation. Modulation of individual gamma frequency is accompanied by an improvement in gap detection performance. Aging changes electrophysiological frequency components and sensory processing mechanisms. Therefore, we conducted a study to investigate the link between individual gamma frequency and gap detection performance in elderly people using auditory transcranial alternating current stimulation. In a within-subject design, nine participants were electrically stimulated with two individualized transcranial alternating current stimulation frequencies: 3 Hz above their individual gamma frequency (experimental condition) and 4 Hz below their individual gamma frequency (control condition) while they were performing a between-channel gap detection task. As expected, individual gamma frequencies correlated significantly with gap detection performance at baseline and in the experimental condition, transcranial alternating current stimulation modulated gap detection performance. In the control condition, stimulation did not modulate gap detection performance. In addition, in elderly, the effect of transcranial alternating current stimulation on auditory temporal resolution seems to be dependent on endogenous frequencies in auditory cortex: elderlies with slower individual gamma frequencies and lower auditory temporal resolution profit from auditory transcranial alternating current stimulation and show increased gap detection performance during stimulation. Our results strongly suggest individualized transcranial alternating current stimulation protocols for successful modulation of performance.",

    "abstract": "Plant cell infection is tightly controlled by cell surface receptor-like kinases (RLKs) Alike other RLKs the Medicago truncatula entry receptor LYK3 laterally segregates into membrane nanodomains in a stimulus-dependent manner. Although nanodomain localization arises as a generic feature of plant membrane proteins, molecular mechanisms underlying such dynamic transitions and their functional relevance remained poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that actin and the flotillin protein FLOT4 form the primary and indispensable core of a specific nanodomain. Infection-dependent induction of the remorin protein and secondary molecular scaffold SYMREM1 results in subsequent recruitment of ligand-activated LYK3 and its stabilization within these membrane subcompartments. Reciprocally, the majority of this LYK3 receptor pool is destabilized at the plasma membrane and undergoes rapid endocytosis in symrem1 mutants upon rhizobial inoculation resulting in premature abortion of host cell infections. These data reveal that receptor recruitment into nanodomains is indispensable for their function during host cell infection.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTPattern recognition receptors control the cellular entry of pathogenic as well as symbiotic microbes. While ligand-induced changes in receptor mobility at the plasma membrane and their localization in membrane nanodomains appears as a general feature, the molecular mechanism and the biological relevance of this phenomenon remained unknown. Here, we show that immobilization of the symbiotic cell entry receptor LYK3 in nanodomains requires the presence of actin and the two molecular scaffold proteins FLOT4 and SYMREM1. While FLOT4 forms the initial core structure, infection-induced expression and subsequent physical interaction of SYMREM1 with LYK3 stabilizes the activated receptors in membrane nanodomains. This recruitment prevents its stimulus-dependent endocytosis and ensures progression of the primary infection thread into root cortical cells.",

    "abstract": "Plants obtain elements from the soil through genetic and biochemical pathways responsive to physiological state and environment. Most perturbations affect multiple elements which leads the ionome, the full complement of mineral nutrients in an organism, to vary as an integrated network rather than a set of distinct single elements. To examine the genetic basis of covariation in the accumulation of multiple elements, we analyzed maize kernel ionomes from Intermated B73 x Mo17 (IBM) recombinant inbred populations grown in 10 environments. We compared quantitative trait loci (QTL) determining single-element variation to QTL that predict variation in principal components (PCs) of multiple-element covariance. Single-element and multivariate approaches detected partially overlapping sets of loci. In addition to loci co-localizing with single-element QTL, multivariate traits within environments were controlled by loci with significant multi-element effects not detectable using single-element traits. Gene-by-environment interactions underlying multiple-element covariance were identified through QTL analyses of principal component models of ionome variation. In addition to interactive effects, growth environment had a profound effect on the elemental profiles and multi-element phenotypes were significantly correlated with specific environmental variables.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA multivariate approach to the analysis of element accumulation in the maize kernel shows that elements are not regulated independently. By describing relationships between element accumulation we identified new genetic loci invisible to single-element approaches. The mathematical combinations of elements distinguish groups of plants based on environment, demonstrating that observed variation derives from interactions between genetically controlled factors and environmental variables. These results suggest that successful application of ionomics to improve human nutrition and plant productivity requires simultaneous consideration of multiple-element effects and variation of such effects in response to environment.",

Determining cell density and timing of morphological and biochemical changes is important for a proper understanding of the role of astrocytes in physiological and pathological conditions. One of the most important of such analyses is astrocytes count within a complex tissue environment in microscopy images. The most widely used approaches for the quantification of microscopy images data are either manual stereological cell counting or semi-automatic segmentation techniques. Detecting astrocytes automatically is a highly challenging computational task, for which we currently lack efficient image analysis tools. In this study, we developed a fast and fully automated software that assesses the number of astrocytes using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). The method highly outperforms state-of-the-art image analysis and machine learning methods and provides detection accuracy and precision comparable to that of human experts. Additionally, the runtime of cell detection is significantly less than other three analyzed computational methods, and it is faster than human observers by orders of magnitude. We applied DCNN-based method to examine the number of astrocytes in different brain regions of rats with opioid-induced hyperalgesia/tolerance (OIH/OIT) as morphine tolerance is believed to activate glial cells in the brain. We observed strong positive correlation between manual cell detection and DCNN-based analysis method for counting astrocytes in the brains of experimental animals.",

One of the main challenges when analyzing scRNA-seq data is the presence of zeros or dropout events, which may mislead downstream analyses. To compensate the dropout effect, several methods have been developed to impute gene expression since the first Bayesian-based method being proposed in 2016. However, these methods have shown very diverse characteristics in terms of model hypothesis and imputation performance. Thus, large-scale comparison and evaluation of these methods is urgently needed now. To this end, we compared eight imputation methods, evaluated their power in recovering original real data, and performed broad analyses to explore their effects on clustering cell types, detecting differentially expressed genes, and reconstructing lineage trajectories in the context of both simulated and real data.

Circular RNAs and microRNAs interact to form a circular sponge that have been shown to regulate messenger RNAs and hence regulating gene expression. The kinetics by which these non-coding RNAs interact together affecting gene expression are crucial to understand the mechanism of their regulatory function. Herein, we developed AFCMEasyModel as a user-friendly shiny app that enables users to modify regulation parameters of a competing endogenous RNA network based on interaction between circular RNAs and microRNAs in the simulation environment to form a sponge complex.

    "abstract": "MMP-14 and MMP-9 are two well established cancer targets for which no specific clinically relevant inhibitor is available. Using a powerful combination of computational design and yeast surface display technology, we engineered such an inhibitor starting from a non-specific MMP inhibitor, N-TIMP2. The engineered purified N-TIMP2 variants showed enhanced specificity towards MMP-14 and MMP-9 relative to a panel of off-target MMPs. MMP-specific N-TIMP2 sequence signatures were obtained that could be understood from the structural perspective of MMP/N-TIMP2 interactions. Our MMP-9 inhibitor exhibited 1000-fold preference for MMP-9 vs. MMP-14, which is likely to translate into significant differences under physiological conditions. Our results provide new insights regarding evolution of promiscuous proteins and optimization strategies for design of inhibitors with single-target specificities.",

    "abstract": "As tissues develop, they are subjected to a variety of mechanical forces. Some of these forces, such as those required for morphogenetic movements, are instrumental to the development and sculpting of tissues. However, mechanical forces can also lead to accumulation of substantial tensile stress, which if maintained, can result in tissue damage and impair tissue function. Despite our extensive understanding of force-guided morphogenesis, we have only a limited understanding of how tissues prevent further morphogenesis, once shape is determined after development. Buffering forces to prevent cellular changes in response to fluctuations of mechanical stress is critical during the lifetime of an adult organism. Here, through the development of a novel tissue-stretching device, we uncover a mechanosensitive pathway that regulates tissue responses to mechanical stress through the polarization of Myosin II across the tissue. Mechanistically, this process is independent of conserved Rho-kinase signaling but is mediated by force-induced linear actin polymerization and depolymerization via the formin Diaphanous and actin severing protein Cofilin, respectively. Importantly, these stretch-induced actomyosin cables stiffen the tissue to limit changes in cell shape and to protect the tissue from further mechanical damage prior to stress dissipation. This tissue rigidification prevents fractures in the tissue from propagating by confining the damage locally to the injured cells. Overall this mechanism of force-induced changes in tissue mechanical properties provides a general model of force buffering that rapidly protects tissues from physical damage to preserve tissue shape.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of migratory cell populations within tumours represents a critical early stage during cancer metastasis. We have previously reported one such population, marked by CD66, in cervical cancers. It is unclear what broad mechanisms regulate such migratory populations. Here, we describe the role of a Suv39H1-low heterochromatin state as a driver of cervical cancer migratory populations. Cervical cancer cells sorted based on migratory ability in vitro show low Suv39H1, and Suv39H1 knockdown enhances cell migration. Histopathology shows the emergence of migratory Suv39H1low populations in advanced carcinoma progression. Meta-analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that Suv39H1-low tumours show migration and CD66 expression signatures, and correlate with lower patient survival. Lastly, genome-wide profiling of migrated populations using RNA-Seq and H3K9me3 ChIP-Seq reveals Suv39H1-linked transcriptome alterations and a broad loss of H3K9me3, suggesting an increase in chromatin plasticity in migrated populations. The understanding of such chromatin based regulation in migratory populations may prove valuable in efforts to develop anti-metastatic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Recent widespread shallow coral reef loss has led to calls for more holistic approaches to coral reef management, requiring inclusion of all ecosystems interacting with coral reefs in management plans. Yet almost all current reef management is biased towards shallow reefs, and overlooks that many reef species can also be found on mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs; reefs 30 -150 m). This study presents the first detailed quantitative characterisation of MCEs off Cozumel, in the Mexican Caribbean and provides insights into their general state. We investigate whether MCEs within the marine park have similar ecological communities to mesophotic reefs outside protection, despite widely recognised shallow reef impacts outside the protected area. Results show some taxon specific differences in MCE benthic communities between sites within the protected area and areas outside; although overall communities are similar. Regardless of protection and location, and in contrast to shallow reefs, all observed Cozumel MCEs were continuous reefs dominated by calcareous macroalgae, sponges, octocorals, and black corals. Hard corals were present on MCEs, but at low abundance. We found that 42.5 % of fish species recorded on Cozumel could be found on both shallow reefs and MCEs, including many commercially-important fish species. This suggest that MCEs may play a role in supporting fish populations. However, regardless of protection status and depth we found that large-body fishes (>500 mm) were nearly absent at all studied sites. MCEs should be incorporated into the existing shallow-reef focused management plan in Cozumel, with well informed and implemented fisheries and harvesting regulations.",

This range in abathic distance is similar to that of the vergence resting position distance. Further, the conics orientation is specified by the eyes version angle, integrating binocular geometry with eye movement.

Many, but not all glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of xyloglucan have been identified. Here, we report the identification of an hitherto elusive xyloglucan:arabinopyranosyltransferase. This glycosyltransferase was isolated from the moss Physcomitrella patens, where it acts as a Xyloglucan \\\"D\\\"-side-chain Transferase (XDT). Heterologous expression of XDT in the Arabidopsis thaliana double mutant mur3.1 xlt2, where xyloglucan consists of a xylosylated glucan without further glycosyl substituents, results in the production of the arabinopyranose-containing \\\"D\\\" side chain as characterized by oligosaccharide mass profiling, glycosidic linkage analysis, and NMR analysis. In addition, expression of a related Physcomitrella glycosyltransferase hortholog of XLT2 leads to the production of the galactose-containing \\\"L\\\" side chain. The presence of the \\\"D\\\" and \\\"L\\\" xyloglucan side chains in PpXDT mur3.1 xlt2 and PpXLT2 mur3.1 xlt2 transgenic plants, respectively, rescue the dwarfed phenotype of untransformed mur3.1 xlt2 mutants to nearly wild-type height.

    "abstract": "In recent decades, the biomedical literature has witnessed an increasing number of authors per article together with a concomitant increase of authors claiming to have contributed equally. In this study, we analyzed over 3000 publications from 1995-2017 claiming equal contributions for authors sharing the first author position for author number, gender, and gender position. The frequency of dual pairings contributing equally was male-male > mixed gender > female-female. For mixed gender pairs males were more often at the first position although the disparity has lessened in the past decade. Among author associations claiming equal contribution and containing three or more individuals, males predominated in both the first position and number of gender exclusive groupings. Our results show a disequilibrium in gender ratios among authors who contributed equally from expected ratios had the ordering been done randomly or alphabetical. Given the importance of the first author position in assigning credit for a publication, the finding of fewer than expected females in associations involving shared contributions raises concerns about women not receiving their fair share of expected credit. The results suggest a need for journals to request clarity on the method used to decide author order among individuals claiming to have made equal contributions to a scientific publication.",

In the present study, we focused on characterizing immunomodulatory effects of caffeine on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs).\\n\\nMethodsThe effect of caffeine on gene expression profiles was initially evaluated using RNA sequencing data. Validation experiments were performed to confirm the results and examine dose-dependent effects of caffeine on PBMCs from healthy subjects. Gene expression levels were measured by real-time quantitative PCR, and cytokine production was determined using a multiplex cytokine assay.\\n\\nResultsCaffeine at high doses showed a robust downregulatory effect of immune-related genes in PBMCs. Functional annotation analysis of downregulated genes revealed significant enrichment in cytokine activity and in genes related to several autoimmune diseases including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Dose-dependent validation experiments showed significant downregulation at the mRNA levels of key inflammatory genes including STAT1, TNF, and PPARG. TNF and PPARG were suppressed even with the lowest caffeine dose tested, which corresponds to the serum concentration of caffeine after administration of one cup of coffee. Cytokine levels of IL-8, MIP-1{beta}, IL-6, IFN-{gamma}, GM-CSF, TNF, IL-2, IL-4, MCP-1, and IL-10 were decreased significantly with caffeine treatment.\\n\\nConclusionOur findings indicate potential downregulatory effects of caffeine on key inflammatory genes and cytokines, which play important role in autoimmunity. Further studies exploring therapeutic or disease-modulating potential of caffeine in autoimmune diseases and exploring the mechanisms involved are warranted.",
