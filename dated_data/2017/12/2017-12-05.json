    "abstract": "Salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) plays a crucial role in various aspects of metabolism, as well as in skeletal development. In the course of investigating metabolic defects in the Sik3-deficient mice (Sik3-/-), we observed that circadian rhythmicity of the metabolisms was phase-delayed. Sik3-/- mice also displayed other abnormalities in circadian rhythms, including lengthening of the period, impaired entrainment to the light-dark cycle, phase variation in locomotor activities, and aberrant physiological rhythms. Ex vivo suprachiasmatic nucleus slices from Sik3-/- mice exhibited destabilized and desynchronized molecular rhythms among individual neurons. In cultured cells, Sik3-knockdown resulted in cycle-to-cycle fluctuations of the circadian periodicity. Expression levels of PER2, an essential clock protein, were elevated in Sik3-knockdown cells but down-regulated in Sik3-overexpressing cells, which could be ascribed to a phosphorylation-dependent decrease in PER2 protein stability. Collectively, our results indicate that SIK3 plays key roles in murine circadian rhythms by facilitating phosphorylation-dependent destabilization of PER2.",

    "abstract": "Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) form both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric ion channels that are activated by extracellular protons and are involved in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including pain and anxiety. ASIC proteins can form both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric ion channels. The ASIC3 subunit has been shown to be of particular importance in the peripheral nervous system with pharmacological and genetic manipulations demonstrating a role in pain. Naked mole-rats, despite having functional ASICs, are insensitive to acid as a noxious stimulus and show diminished avoidance of acidic fumes, ammonia and carbon dioxide. Here we cloned naked mole-rat ASIC3 (nmrASIC3) and used a cell surface biotinylation assay to demonstrate that it traffics to the plasma membrane, but using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology we observed that nmrASIC3 is insensitive to both protons and the non-proton ASIC3 agonist 2-Guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ). However, in line with previous reports of ASIC3 mRNA expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, we found that the ASIC3 antagonist APETx2 reversibly inhibits ASIC-like currents in naked mole-rat DRG neurons. We further show that like the proton-insensitive ASIC2b and ASIC4, nmrASIC3 forms functional, proton sensitive heteromers with other ASIC subunits. An amino acid alignment of ASIC3s between 9 relevant rodent species and human identified unique sequence differences that might underlie the proton insensitivity of nmrASIC3. However, introducing nmrASIC3 differences into rat ASIC3 (rASIC3) produced only minor differences in channel function, and replacing nmrASIC3 sequence with that of rASIC3 did not produce a proton-sensitive ion channel. Our observation that nmrASIC3 forms nonfunctional homomers may reflect a further adaptation of the naked mole-rat to living in an environment with high-carbon dioxide levels.",

    "abstract": "DksA and ppGpp are the central players in the Escherichia coli stringent response and mediate a complete reprogramming of the transcriptome from one optimized for rapid growth to one adapted for survival during nutrient limitation. A major component of the response is a reduction in ribosome synthesis, which is accomplished by the synergistic action of DksA and ppGpp bound to RNA polymerase (RNAP) inhibiting transcription of rRNAs. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structures of E. coli RNAP holoenzyme in complex with DksA alone and with ppGpp. The structures show that DksA accesses the template strand at the active site and the downstream DNA binding site of RNAP simultaneously and reveal that binding of the allosteric effector ppGpp reshapes the RNAP-DksA complex. The structural data support a model for transcriptional inhibition in which ppGpp potentiates the destabilization of open complexes on rRNA promoters by DksA. We also determined the structure of RNAP-TraR complex, which reveals the mechanism of ppGpp-independent transcription inhibition by TraR. This work establishes new ground for understanding the pleiotropic effects of DksA and ppGpp on transcriptional regulation in proteobacteria.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDksA has two modes of binding to RNA polymerase\\nC_LIO_LIDksA is capable of inhibiting the catalysis and influences the DNA binding of RNAP\\nC_LIO_LIppGpp acts as an allosteric effector of DksA function\\nC_LIO_LIppGpp stabilizes DksA in a more functionally important binding mode\\nC_LI",

The angles of these phasors are used to localize the center of the single fluorescent emitter, and the ratio of the magnitudes of the two phasors is a measure for astigmatism, which can be used to obtain depth information (z-direction).

    "abstract": "During the first weeks of life, microbial colonization of the gut impacts human immune system maturation and other developmental processes. In premature infants, aberrant colonization has been implicated in the onset of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening intestinal disease. To study the premature infant gut colonization process, genome-resolved metagenomics was conducted on 343 fecal samples collected during the first three months of life from 35 premature infants housed in a neonatal intensive care unit, 14 of which developed NEC, and metaproteomic measurements were made on 87 samples. Microbial community composition and proteomic profiles remained relatively stable on the time scale of a week, but the proteome was more variable. Although genetically similar organisms colonized many infants, most infants were colonized by distinct strains with metabolic profiles that could be distinguished using metaproteomics. Microbiome composition correlated with infant, antibiotics administration, and NEC diagnosis. Communities were found to cluster into seven primary types, and community type switched within infants, sometimes multiple times. Interestingly, some communities sampled from the same infant at subsequent time points clustered with those of other infants. In some cases, switches preceded onset of NEC; however, no species or community type could account for NEC across the majority of infants. In addition to a correlation of protein abundances with organism replication rates, we found that organism proteomes correlated with overall community composition. Thus, this genome-resolved proteomics study demonstrates that the contributions of individual organisms to microbiome development depend on microbial community context.\\n\\nImportance\\n\\nHumans are colonized by microbes at birth, a process that is important to health and development. However, much remains to be known about the fine-scale microbial dynamics that occur during the colonization period. We conducted a genome-resolved study of microbial community composition, replication rates, and proteomes during the first three months of life of both healthy and sick premature infants. Infants were found to be colonized by similar microbes, but each underwent a distinct colonization trajectory.\\n\\nInterestingly, related microbes colonizing different infants were found to have distinct proteomes, indicating that microbiome function is not only driven by which organisms are present, but also largely depends on microbial responses to the unique set of physiological conditions in the infant gut.",

Here, the transcriptomic consequences of ZIKV infection were studied systematically firstly in human peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages with high density RNA-sequencing. Analyses of the ZIKV genome revealed that the virus underwent genetic diversification and differential mRNA abundance was found in host cells during infection. Notably, there was a significant change in the cellular response with crosstalk between monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells as one of the highly identified pathway. Immune-phenotyping of peripheral blood from ZIKV-infected patients further confirmed the activation of NK cells during acute infection. ZIKV infection in peripheral blood cells isolated from healthy donors led to the induction of IFN{gamma} and CD107a -- two key markers of NK-cell function. Depletion of CD14+ monocytes from peripheral blood resulted in a reduction of these markers and reduced priming of NK cells during infection. This was complemented by the immunoproteomic changes observed. Mechanistically, ZIKV infection preferentially counterbalances monocyte and/or NK-cell activity, with implications for targeted cytokine immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Precise estimation of genetic substitution patterns is critical for accurate reconstruction of pathogen phylogenies. Few studies of viral evolution account for variations of mutation rate across a single gene. This is especially true when considering evolution of segmented viruses where individual segments are short, encoding for few proteins. However, the structural and functional partitions of these proteins could provide valuable information for more accurate inference of viral evolution, due to the disparate immune selection pressure on different functional domains. Accurately reconstructed evolutionary features on specific functional domains can in turn provide biological information on viral protein and immune targets for vaccine design. In this study we developed and evaluated a structurally informed partitioning scheme that accounts for rate variation among immunogenic head and stalk domains of the surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza viruses. We evaluated the model fit and performance of four different models - HKY, SRD06 codon, HKY with a structurally informed partitioning scheme, SRD06 with a structurally informed partitioning scheme on pandemic A/H1N1pdm09, seasonal A/H1N1postpdm, A/H3N2, B-Yamagata-like and Victoria-like lineages, and two highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses H5Nx and H7N9. Results showed that structurally informed partitioning with SRD06 performed better for all datasets with decisively statistical support. Significantly faster nucleotide substitution rates for head domain, compared to stalk domain was observed and may provide insight for stalk derived broadly-reactive vaccine design. Taken together, integrating a functionally informed partitioning scheme based on protein structures of immune targets allows for significant improvement of phylogenetic analysis and providing important biological insights.",

    "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neural organoids have revolutionized in vitro modelling of human neurological disorders. Cell-intrinsic morphogenesis processes displayed within these tissues could serve as the basis for ex vivo manufacture of brain and spinal cord tissues with biomimetic anatomy and physiology. However, we must first understand how to control their emergent properties starting at the genesis of neural organoid formation, i.e. emergence of polarized neuroepithelium. In vivo, all CNS tissues develop from a singular neuroepithelial tube. Yet, current protocols yield organoids with multiple neuroepithelial rings, a.k.a. neural rosettes, each acting as independent centers of morphogenesis and thereby impeding coordinate tissue development. We discovered that the morphology of hPSC-derived neural tissues is a critical biophysical parameter for inducing singular neural rosette emergence. Tissue morphology screens conducted using micropatterned array substrates and an automated image analysis determined that circular morphologies of 200-250 and 150m diameter are optimal for inducing singular neural rosette emergence within 80-85% forebrain and 73.5% spinal tissues, respectively. The discrepancy in optimal circular morphology for Pax6+/N-cadherin+ neuroepithelial forebrain versus spinal tissues was due to previously unknown differences in ROCK-mediated cell contractility. The singular neuroepithelium induced within geometrically confined tissues persisted as the tissues morphed from a 2-D monolayer to multilayered 3-D hemispherical aggregate. Upon confinement release using clickable micropatterned substrates, the tissue displayed radial outgrowth with maintenance of a singular neuroepithelium and peripheral neuronal differentiation. Thus, we have quantitatively defined a pertinent biophysical parameter for effectively inducing a singular neuroepithelium emergence within morphing hPSC-derived neural tissues.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHuman pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neural organoids display emergent properties that, if harnessed, could serve as the basis for ex vivo manufacture of brain and spinal cord tissues with biomimetic macroscale anatomy and physiology. Their chaotic terminal structure arises from uncontrolled morphogenesis at their genesis, resulting in spontaneous induction of multiple neuroepithelial morphogenesis centers,a.k.a. neural rosettes. Here, we determined that neural tissue morphology is a pertinent biophysical parameter for controlling subsequent morphogenesis, and identified discrete circular tissue morphologies as optimal and effective at inducing singular neural rosette emergence within forebrain and spinal neural tissues. Thus, we developed an approach to reproducibly control the initial stage of hPSC-derived neural tissue morphogenesis enabling their manufacture with a biomimetic nascent CNS anatomy.",

    "abstract": "Protein adopts multitude of flexible and rapidly interconverting conformers, many which are governed by specific protein-interaction domains. ApoA1, a key player involved in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) regulation exists in structurally diverse forms with varying degree of cholesterol association, and each state is associated with different functional properties. While disc-shaped HDL and its oligomeric ApoA1 protein components have been the focus of several investigations, structural properties of monomeric ApoA1 are poorly understood. Here, we undertook large-scale structural analysis of ApoA1 in apo and cholesterol-bound forms using tens of independent simulations with total computing time exceeding 50 s. Examination of multiple lipid-free trajectories of monomeric ApoA1 revealed a common conformation, with distinct spatial proximity between N- and C-terminal domains. With incorporation of physiologically known cholesterol concentration ({approx}100 cholesterol molecules) in ApoA1 simulations, the monomeric protein spontaneously formed an open circular topology. Remarkably, these drastic structural perturbations are driven by specific binding site at C-terminal and a novel cholesterol binding site at the N-terminal. We proposed a mechanism of stage-wise opening of ApoA1 and demonstrated that less cholesterol concentration around interaction sites or mutation within N-terminal binding sites does not lead to open bell-shaped topology. The kinetic barriers between open and closed-states also showed an ensemble of loosely packed helix bundle (H1-H7; H4-H7) that posed as a slow-intermediate step. Lastly we performed complementary experiments, including ITC and CD measurements to confirm that structural changes are induced by ligand association and not driven by random hydrophobic effect. Collectively, our study suggests a previously unknown mechanism of cholesterol sequestering by ApoA1 that could directly aid in developing modulators for cholesterol efflux with chronic cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "The majority of genetic loci underlying common disease risk act through changing genome regulation, and are routinely linked to expression quantitative trait loci, where gene expression is measured using bulk populations of mature cells. A crucial step that is missing is evidence of variation in the expression of these genes as cells progress from a pluripotent to mature state. This is especially important for cardiovascular disease, as the majority of cardiac cells have limited properties for renewal postneonatal. To investigate the dynamic changes in gene expression across the cardiac lineage, we generated RNA-sequencing data captured from 43,168 single cells progressing through in vitro cardiac-directed differentiation from pluripotency. We developed a novel and generalized unsupervised cell clustering approach and a machine learning method for prediction of cell transition. Using these methods, we were able to reconstruct the cell fate choices as cells transition from a pluripotent state to mature cardiomyocytes, uncovering intermediate cell populations that do not progress to maturity, and distinct cell trajectories that terminate in cardiomyocytes that differ in their contractile forces. Second, we identify new gene markers that denote lineage specification and demonstrate a substantial increase in their utility for cell identification over current pluripotent and cardiogenic markers. By integrating results from analysis of the single cell lineage RNA-sequence data with population-based GWAS of cardiovascular disease and cardiac tissue eQTLs, we show that the pathogenicity of disease-associated genes is highly dynamic as cells transition across their developmental lineage, and exhibit variation between cell fate trajectories. Through the integration of single cell RNA-sequence data with population-scale genetic data we have identified genes significantly altered at cell specification events providing insights into a context-dependent role in cardiovascular disease risk. This study provides a valuable data resource focused on in vitro cardiomyocyte differentiation to understand cardiac disease coupled with new analytical methods with broad applications to single-cell data.",

    "abstract": "The advent of next generation sequencing methods has led to an increasing availability of large, multi-tissue datasets which contain gene expression measurements across different tissues and individuals. In this setting, variation in expression levels arises due to contributions specific to genes, tissues, individuals, and interactions thereof. Classical clustering methods are illsuited to explore these three-way interactions, and struggle to fully extract the insights into transcriptome complexity and regulation contained in the data. Thus, to exploit the multi-mode structure of the data, new methods are required. To this end, we propose a new method, called MultiCluster, based on constrained tensor decomposition which permits the investigation of transcriptome variation across individuals and tissues simultaneously. Through simulation and application to the GTEx RNA-seq data, we show that our tensor decomposition identifies three-way clusters with higher accuracy, while being 11x faster, than the competing Bayesian method. For several age-, race-, or gender-related genes, the tensor projection approach achieves increased significance over single-tissue analysis by two orders of magnitude. Our analysis finds gene modules consistent with existing knowledge while further detecting novel candidate genes exhibiting either tissue-, individual-, or tissue-by-individual specificity. These identified genes and gene modules offer bases for future study, and the uncovered multi-way specificities provide a finer, more nuanced snapshot of transcriptome variation than previously possible.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we apply Information-Theoretic (IT) model averaging to characterize a set of complex interactions in a longitudinal study on cognitive decline. Prior research has identified numerous genetic (including sex), education, health and lifestyle factors that predict abnormal cognitive decline.Traditional model selection approaches (e.g., backward or stepwise selection), attempt to find models that best fit the observed data; these techniques risk interpretations that only the selected predictors are important. In reality, several models may fit similarly well but result in different conclusions (e.g., about size and significance of parameter estimates), and inference from a single model chosen after a selection procedure can lead to overly simplistic conclusions. Here we utilize longitudinal cognitive data from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimers Prevention to examine the effects of sex and the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 allele (non-modifiable factors), and reading literacy achievement (modifiable) on cognitive decline. For each outcome, we applied IT model averaging to a model set with combinations of interactions among sex, APOE, literacy, and age. For a list-learning test, model-averaged results showed better performance for women vs men, with faster decline among men; increased literacy was associated with better performance, particularly among men. APOE had less effect in this age range (~40-70). These results illustrate the utility of the IT approach and point to verbal ability as a potential modifier of decline. Whether the protective effect of literacy is due to educational attainment or intrinsic verbal intellectual ability is the topic of ongoing work.",

Currently, the incorporation of new ncAAs requires a cumbersome engineering process composed of several positive and negative selection rounds to select the appropriate PylRS/tRNAPyl pair. Our fast and sensitive engineering approach required only a single FACS selection round to identify 110 orthogonal PylRS variants for the aminoacylation of 20 ncAAs. Pocket-substrate relationship from these variants led to the design of a highly promiscuous PylRS (HpRS), which catalyzed the aminoacylation of 31 structurally diverse lysine derivatives bearing clickable, fluorinated, fluorescent, and biotinylated entities. The high speed and sensitivity of our approach provides a competitive alternative to existing screening methodologies, and delivers insights into the complex PylRS-substrate interactions to facilitate the generation of additional promiscuous variants.",

    "abstract": "Lateral gene transfer (LGT) into multicellular eukaryotes with differentiated tissues, particularly gonads, continues to be met with skepticism by many prominent evolutionary and genomic biologists. A detailed examination of 26 animal genomes identifed putative LGTs in invertebrate and vertebrate genomes, concluding that there are fewer predicted LGTs in vertebrates/chordates than invertebrates, but there is still evidence of LGT into chordates, including humans. More recently, a reanalysis a subset of these putative LGTs into vertebrates concluded that there is not horizontal gene transfer in the human genome. One of the genes in dispute is an N-acyl-aromatic-L-amino acid amidohydrolase (ENSG00000132744), which encodes ACY3, which was initially identified as a putative bacteria-chordate LGT but was later debunked has a significant BLAST match to a more recently deposited genome of Saccoglossus kowalevskii, a flatworm, Metazoan, and hemichordate. Using BLAST searches, HMM searches, and phylogenetics to better understand the evidence for lateral gene transfer, gene loss, and rate variation in ACY3/ASPA homologues, the most parsimonious explanation for the distribution of ACY3/ASPA genes in eukaryotes likely involves both gene loss and lateral gene transfer, albeit lateral gene transfer that occurred hundreds of millions of years ago prior to the divergence of gnathostomes and even longer and prior to the divergence of bilateria. Given the many known, well-characterized, and adaptive lateral gene transfers from bacteria to insects and nematodes, lateral gene transfers at these time scales in the ancestors of humans is expected.",

    "abstract": "It is well-established that whether information will be remembered or not depends on the extent to which the learning context is reinstated during post-encoding rest and/or at retrieval. It has yet to be determined, however, if the fundamental importance of reinstatement to memory extends to periods of spontaneous neurocognitive activity prior to learning. We thus asked whether memory performance can be predicted by the extent to which spontaneous pre-encoding neural patterns resemble patterns elicited during encoding. Individuals studied and retrieved lists of words while undergoing fMRI-scanning. Multivoxel hippocampal patterns during resting periods prior to encoding resembled hippocampal patterns at encoding most strongly for items that were subsequently remembered. Furthermore, across subjects, the magnitude of similarity correlated with a behavioural measure of episodic recall. The results indicate that the neural scaffold of a memory trace is spontaneously laid even before ever perceiving the to-be-encoded information.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIt is well-established that memory performance depends on the degree to which the learning-context is reinstated during post-learning rest or during retrieval. However, does memory also depend on the context prior to learning--namely, on processes occurring spontaneously before ever perceiving the to-be-learned information? To answer this question, we scanned participants using fMRI while they were learning and recalling word-lists and, crucially, also during resting periods before each list. Patterns of brain activity in memory-related regions which were elicited spontaneously during these resting periods resembled patterns during learning. Furthermore, the greater this resemblance, the better was memory performance. We demonstrate that memory can be predicted by the degree to which patterns of neural activity prior to learning are reinstated during learning.",

    "abstract": "Protein interactions are fundamental building blocks of biochemical reaction systems underlying cellular functions. The complexity and functionality of these systems emerge not only from the protein interactions themselves but also from the dependencies between these interactions, e.g., allosteric effects, mutual exclusion or steric hindrance. Therefore, formal models for integrating and using information about such dependencies are of high interest. We present an approach for endowing protein networks with interaction dependencies using propositional logic, thereby obtaining constrained protein interaction networks (\\\"constrained networks\\\"). The construction of these networks is based on public interaction databases and known as well as text-mined interaction dependencies. We present an efficient data structure and algorithm to simulate protein complex formation in constrained networks. The efficiency of the model allows a fast simulation and enables the analysis of many proteins in large networks. Therefore, we are able to simulate perturbation effects (knockout and overexpression of single or multiple proteins, changes of protein concentrations). We illustrate how our model can be used to analyze a partially constrained human adhesome network. Comparing complex formation under known dependencies against without dependencies, we find that interaction dependencies limit the resulting complex sizes. Further we demonstrate that our model enables us to investigate how the interplay of network topology and interaction dependencies influences the propagation of perturbation effects. Our simulation software CPINSim (for Constrained Protein Interaction Network Simulator) is available under the MIT license at http://github.com/BiancaStoecker/cpinsimandviaBioconda (https://bioconda.github.io).\\n\\nAuthor summaryProteins are the main molecular tools of cells. They do not act individually, but rather collectively in order to peform complex cellular actions. Recent years have led to a relatively good understanding about which proteins may interact, both in general and in specific conditions, leading to the definition of protein interaction networks. However, the reality is more complex, and protein interactions are not independent of each other. Instead, several potential interaction partners of a specific protein may compete for the same binding domain, making all of these interactions mutually exclusive. Additionally, a binding of a protein to another one can enable or prevent their interactions with other proteins, even if those interactions are mediated by different domains. Hence, understanding how the dependencies (or constraints) of protein interactions affect the behaviour of the system is an important and timely goal, as data is now becoming available. Here we present a mathematical framework to formalize such interaction constraints and incorporate them into the simulation of protein complex formation. With our framework, we are able to better understand how perturbations of single proteins (knockout or overexpression) impact other proteins in the network.",

    "abstract": "Evolution of morphogenesis is generally associated with changes in genetic regulation. Here we report evidence indicating that dorsal closure, a conserved morphogenetic process in dipterans, evolved as the consequence of rearrangements in epithelial organization rather than signaling regulation. In Drosophila melanogaster, dorsal closure consists of a two-tissue system where the contraction of extraembryonic amnioserosa and a JNK/Dpp-dependent epidermal actomyosin cable result in microtubule-dependent seaming of the epidermis. We find that dorsal closure in Megaselia abdita, a three-tissue system comprising serosa, amnion and epidermis, differs in morphogenetic rearrangements despite conservation of JNK/Dpp signaling. In addition to an actomyosin cable, M. abdita dorsal closure is driven by the rupture and contraction of the serosa and the consecutive microtubule-dependent seaming of amnion and epidermis. Our study indicates that the evolutionary transition to a reduced system of dorsal closure involves simplification of the seaming process without changing the signaling pathways of closure progression.\\n\\nImpact StatementEvolutionary reduction in tissue number involves the simplification of the seaming process but not signaling during epithelial fusion.",

    "abstract": "Insulin and insulin-like growth factor signalling regulates a broad spectrum of growth and metabolic responses to a variety of internal and environmental stimuli. Such responses can be tailored to the environment so that changes in insulin signalling result in distinct physiological responses to different stimuli. For example, the inhibition of insulin-like signalling by osmotic stress or by starvation of C. elegans results in physiologically distinct states and patterns of gene expression. How does insulin-like signalling elicit different responses to different environmental stimuli? We report that neurohormonal signalling involving the C. elegans cytosolic sulfotransferase SSU-1 controls developmental arrest in response to osmotic stress but not to starvation; that SSU-1 functions in a single pair of sensory neurons to control signalling via the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-1; that signalling controlled by SSU-1 acts antagonistically to insulin-like signalling; and that the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, a downstream effector of insulin-like signalling, enters the nucleus in response to osmotic stress but activates gene expression only if SSU-1 is active. We propose that neurohormonal signalling controlled by one or more cytosolic sulfotransferases similarly regulates the specificity of responses to changes in insulin signalling during periods of environmental stress in other organisms and that abnormalities in such sulfotransferase-controlled neurohormonal signalling might contribute to human disorders that involve insulin signalling, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

Although microtitre plates have the potential to enable high-throughput phenotypic testing of M. tuberculosis, they can be difficult to read and interpret.

The plate used here has serial dilutions of 14 anti-tuberculosis drugs, thereby permitting the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to be elucidated. The two participating laboratories each inoculated ten 96-well plates with the standard H37Rv reference strain and, after two weeks incubation, measured the MICs for all 14 drugs on each plate and took a photograph. By analysing the images, we demonstrate that AMyGDA is reproducible, and that the MICs measured are comparable to those measured by a laboratory scientist. AMyGDA software will be used by the Comprehensive Resistance Prediction for Tuberculosis: an International Consortium (CRyPTIC) to measure the drug susceptibility profile of a large number (> 30,000) of samples of M. tuberculosis from patients over the next few years.",

We used single cell transcriptional profiling and axonal reconstructions to identify two types of PT neuron. Both types share projections to multiple targets in the basal ganglia and brainstem. One type projects to thalamic regions that connect back to motor cortex. In a delayed-response task, these neurons produced early preparatory activity that persisted until the movement. The second type projects to motor centers in the medulla and produced late preparatory activity and motor commands. These results indicate that two motor cortex output neurons are specialized for distinct roles in motor control.",

    "abstract": "Several authors have suggested a deep symmetry between the psychological processes that underlie our ability to remember the past and make predictions about the future. The judgment of recency (JOR) task measures temporal order judgments for the past by presenting pairs of probe stimuli; participants choose the probe that was presented more recently. We performed a short-term relative JOR task and introduced a novel judgment of imminence (JOI) task to study temporal order judgments for the future. In the JOR task, participants were presented with a sequence of stimuli and asked to choose which of two probe stimuli was presented closer to the present. In the JOI task, participants were trained on a probabilistic sequence. After training, the sequence was interrupted with probe stimuli. Participants were asked to choose which of two probe stimuli was expected to be presented closer to the present. Replicating prior work on JOR, we found that RT results supported a backward self-terminating search model operating on a temporally-organized representation of the past. We also showed that RT distributions are consistent with this model and that the temporally-organized representation is compressed. Critically, results for the JOI task probing expectations of the future were mirror-symmetric to results from memory, suggesting a forward self-terminating search model operating on a temporally-organized representation of the future.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) with non-protein or small peptide-coding potential transcripts are emerging regulatory molecules. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies and novel bioinformatics tools, a tremendous number of lncRNAs has been identified in several plant species. Recent reports demonstrated roles of plant lncRNAs such as development and environmental response. Here, we reported a genome-wide discovery of ~8,000 barley lncRNAs and measured their expression pattern upon excessive boron (B) treatment. According to the tissue-based comparison, leaves have a greater number of B-responsive differentially expressed lncRNAs than the root. Functional annotation of the coding transcripts, which were co-expressed with lncRNAs, revealed that molecular function of the ion transport, establishment of localization, and response to stimulus significantly enriched only in the leaf. On the other hand, 32 barley endogenous target mimics (eTM) as lncRNAs, which potentially decoy the transcriptional suppression activity of 18 miRNAs, were obtained. Presented data including identification, expression measurement, and functional characterization of barley lncRNAs suggest that B-stress response might also be regulated by lncRNA expression via cooperative interaction of miRNA-eTM-coding target transcript modules.",

    "abstract": "There are more than 26 million peer-reviewed biomedical research items according to Medline/PubMed. This breadth of information is indicative of the progress in biomedical sciences on one hand, but an overload for scientists performing literature searches on the other. A major portion of scientific literature search is to find statements, numbers and protocols that can be cited to build an evidence-based narrative for a new manuscript. Because science builds on prior knowledge, such information has likely been written out and cited in an older manuscript. Thus, Cited Statements, pieces of text from scientific literature supported by citing other peer-reviewed publications, carry significant amount of condensed information on prior art. Based on this principle, we propose a literature search service, SciRide Finder (finder.sciride.org), which constrains the search corpus to such Cited Statements only. We demonstrate that Cited Statements can carry different information to this found in titles/abstracts and full text, giving access to alternative literature search results than traditional search engines. We further show how presenting search results as a list of Cited Statements allows researchers to easily find information to build an evidence-based narrative for their own manuscripts.",

To study how sarcomeres are built, we performed transcriptome sequencing of developing Drosophila flight muscles and identified 40 distinct expression profile clusters. Strikingly, two clusters are strongly enriched for sarcomeric components. Temporal gene expression together with detailed morphological analysis enabled us to define two distinct phases of sarcomere development, which both require the transcriptional regulator Spalt major. During the sarcomere formation phase, 1.8 m long immature sarcomeres assemble myofibrils that spontaneously contract. During the sarcomere maturation phase, these sarcomeres grow to their final 3.2 m length and 1.5 m diameter and acquire stretch-sensitivity. Interestingly, the final number of myofibrils per flight muscle fiber is determined at the onset of the first phase. Together, this defines a biphasic mode of sarcomere and myofibril morphogenesis - a new concept that may also apply to vertebrate muscle or heart development.",

    "abstract": "O_LIUnderstanding how changes in biodiversity will impact the stability and functioning of ecosystems is a central challenge in ecology. Food-web approaches have been advocated to link community composition with ecosystem functioning by describing the fluxes of energy among species or trophic groups. However, estimating such fluxes remains problematic because current methods become unmanageable as network complexity increases.\\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a generalisation of previous indirect estimation methods assuming a steady state system [1, 2, 3]: the model estimates energy fluxes in a top-down manner assuming system equilibrium; each nodes losses (consumption and physiological) balances its consumptive gains. Jointly, we provide theoretical and practical guidelines to use the fluxweb R package (available on CRAN at https://bit.ly/2OC0uKF).\\nWe also present how the framework can merge with the allometric theory of ecology [4] to calculate fluxes based on easily obtainable organism-level data (i.e. body masses and species groups -eg, plants animals), opening its use to food webs of all complexities. Physiological losses (metabolic losses or losses due to death other than from predation within the food web) may be directly measured or estimated using allometric relationships based on the metabolic theory of ecology, and losses and gains due to predation are a function of ecological efficiencies that describe the proportion of energy that is used for biomass production.\\nC_LIO_LIThe primary output is a matrix of fluxes among the nodes of the food web. These fluxes can be used to describe the role of a species, a function of interest (e.g. predation; total fluxes to predators), multiple functions, or total energy flux (system throughflow or multitrophic functioning). Additionally, the package includes functions to calculate network stability based on the Jacobian matrix, providing insight into how resilient the network is to small perturbations at steady state.\\nC_LIO_LIOverall, fluxweb provides a flexible set of functions that greatly increase the feasibility of implementing food-web energetic approaches to more complex systems. As such, the package facilitates novel opportunities for mechanistically linking quantitative food webs and ecosystem functioning in real and dynamic natural landscapes.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In genetic association analysis, a joint test of multiple distinct phenotypes can increase power to identify sets of trait-associated variants within genes or regions of interest. Existing multi-phenotype tests for rare variants make specific assumptions about the patterns of association with underlying causal variants and the violation of these assumptions can reduce power to detect association. Here we develop a general framework for testing pleiotropic effects of rare variants on multiple continuous phenotypes using multivariate kernel regression (Multi-SKAT). Multi-SKAT models effect sizes of variants on the phenotypes through a kernel matrix and performs a variance component test of association. We show that many existing tests are equivalent to specific choices of kernel matrices with the Multi-SKAT framework. To increase power of detecting association across tests with different kernel matrices, we developed a fast and accurate approximation of the significance of the minimum observed p-value across tests. To account for related individuals, our framework uses random effects for the kinship matrix. Using simulated data and amino acid and exome-array data from the METSIM study, we show that Multi-SKAT can improve power over single-phenotype SKAT-O test and existing multiple phenotype tests, while maintaining type I error rate.\\n\\nGrant NumbersThis research was conducted with support from the following grants from National Institute of Health: O_LIR01 HG008773 (D.D. and S.L.)\\nC_LIO_LIR01 LM012535 (D.D. and S.L.)\\nC_LIO_LIR01 HG000376 (L.S. and M.B.)\\nC_LIO_LIU01 DK062370 (L.S. and M.B.)\\nC_LI",

Gene promoters that become hypermethylated in aging and cancer share a common chromatin signature in ES cells. In addition, there is also global DNA hypomethylation in both processes. However, any similarities of the regions where this loss of DNA methylation occurs is currently not well characterized, nor is it known whether such regions also share a common chromatin signature in aging and cancer.\\n\\nResultsTo address this issue we analysed TCGA DNA methylation data from a total of 2,311 samples, including control and cancer cases from patients with breast, kidney, thyroid, skin, brain and lung tumors and healthy blood, and integrated the results with histone, chromatin state and transcription factor binding site data from the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects. We identified 98,857 CpG sites differentially methylated in aging, and 286,746 in cancer. Hyper- and hypomethylated changes in both processes each had a similar genomic distribution across tissues and displayed tissue-independent alterations. The identified hypermethylated regions in aging and cancer shared a similar bivalent chromatin signature. In contrast, hypomethylated DNA sequences occurred in very different chromatin contexts. DNA hypomethylated sequences were enriched at genomic regions marked with the activating histone posttranslational modification H3K4me1 in aging, whilst in cancer, loss of DNA methylation was primarily associated with the repressive H3K9me3 mark.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results suggest that the role of DNA methylation as a molecular link between aging and cancer is more complex than previously thought.",

This study examined if patients with first episode psychosis and schizophrenia had altered TSPO levels as compared to healthy control subjects.\\n\\nMethodsPubMed was searched for studies comparing patients with psychosis to healthy controls using second-generation TSPO radioligands. The outcome measure was distribution volume (VT), an index of TSPO levels, in frontal cortex (FC), temporal cortex (TC) and hippocampus (HIP).

The sequenced viruses are 3,409 and 3,413 nt long, including two partially overlapping ORFs encoding a putative coat protein and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP).

    "abstract": "One of the most controversial practices in resting-state fMRI functional connectivity studies is whether or not to regress out the global average brain signal (GS) during artifact removal. Some groups have argued that it is absolutely essential to regress out the GS in order to fully remove head motion, respiration, and other global imaging artifacts. Others have argued that removing the GS distorts the resulting correlation matrices, qualitatively alters the results of group comparisons, and impairs relationships to behavior. At the core of this argument is the assessment of dimensionality in terms of the number of brain networks with uncorrelated time series. If the dimensionality is high, then the distortions due to GS removal could be effectively negligible. In the current paper, we examine the dimensionality of resting-state fMRI data using principal component analyses (PCA) and network clustering analyses. In two independent datasets (Set 1: N=62, Set 2: N=32), scree plots of the eigenvalues level off at or prior to 10 principal components, with prominent elbows at 3 and 7 components. While network clustering analyses have previously demonstrated that numerous networks can be distinguished with high thresholding of the voxel-wise correlation matrices, lower thresholding reveals a lower-dimensional hierarchical structure, with the first prominent branch at 2 networks (corresponding to the previously described \\\"task-positive\\\"/\\\"task-negative\\\" distinction) and further stable subdivisions at 4, 7 and 17. Since inter-correlated time series within these larger branches do not cancel to zero when averaged, the hierarchical nature of the correlation structure results in much lower effective dimensionality. Consistent with this, partial correlation analyses revealed that network-specific variance remains present in the GS at each level of the hierarchy, accounting for at least 18-20% of the overall GS variance in each dataset. These results demonstrate that GS regression is expected to remove substantial portions of neurogenic brain signals along with artifacts. We highlight alternative means of controlling for residual global artifacts when not removing the GS.",

    "abstract": "Visual selective attention operates through top-down mechanisms of signal enhancement and suppression, mediated by -band oscillations. The effects of such top-down signals on local processing in primary visual cortex (V1) remain poorly understood. In the present work, we characterize the interplay between large-scale interactions and local activity changes in V1 that orchestrates selective attention, using Granger-causality and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) analysis of EEG source signals. The task required participants to either attend to or ignore oriented gratings. Results from time-varying, directed connectivity analysis revealed frequency specific effects of attentional selection: bottom-up {gamma}-band influences from visual areas increased rapidly in response to attended stimuli while distributed top-down -band influences originated from parietal cortex in response to ignored stimuli. Importantly, the results revealed a critical interplay between top-down parietal signals and -{gamma} PAC in visual areas. Parietal -band influences disrupted the -{gamma} coupling in visual cortex, which in turn reduced the amount of {gamma}-band outflow from visual areas. Our results are a first demonstration of how directed interactions affect cross-frequency coupling in downstream areas depending on task demands. These findings suggest that parietal cortex realizes selective attention by disrupting cross-frequency coupling at target regions, which prevents them from propagating task-irrelevant information.",

Transcriptomics of developing limbs shows diversity in the patterns of genetic differentiation of digits, although the anterior-most digit of the pentadactyl limb has a unique, conserved expression profile. Further, we identify a core set of transcription factors that are differentially expressed among the digits of amniote limbs; their spatial expression domains, however, vary between species. In light of these results, we reevaluate the frame shift hypothesis of avian wing evolution and conclude that only the identity of the anterior-most digit has shifted position, suggesting a 1,3,4 digit identity in the bird wing.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial-resistant infections are increasing across Asia. Aiming to evaluate antimicrobial access and practices in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) of Vietnam, we mapped pharmacy locations and used a simulated client method to calculate antimicrobial sales for paediatric diarrheal disease. We additionally evaluated healthcare choices for parents and caregivers when their children experienced diarrhoea. District 8 (population 396,175) of HCMC had 301 pharmacies (one for every 1,316 people), with a density of 15.8 pharmacies/km2. A wide range of different treatments (n=57) were sold for paediatric diarrheal disease, with 8% (3/37) and 22% (8/37) of the sampled pharmacies selling antimicrobials for watery and mucoid diarrhoea, respectively. Despite the apparent abundance of pharmacies, the majority of caregivers chose to take their child to a specialized hospital, with 81% (319/396) and 88% (347/396) of responders selecting this as their first, second, or third choice for watery and mucoid diarrhoea, respectively. Lastly, by combining denominators derived from caregiver interviews and diarrheal incidence figures, we calculated that 16% (2,359/14,427) of watery or mucoid diarrhoea episodes of the District 8 population aged 1 to <5 years would receive an antimicrobial for diarrhoea annually, but antimicrobial prescribing was almost ten times greater in hospitals than in the community. Our novel mixed-methods approach found that, whilst antimicrobials are commonly available for paediatric diarrhoea in the community of HCMC, usage is greater in hospitals. The observed non-standardized approach to diarrheal treatments is indicative of poor recommendations. We advocate better guidelines, training and dissemination of information regarding antimicrobials and their use in this location.",

    "abstract": "The fast evolution of pathogenic viruses has allowed for the development of phylodynamic approaches that extract information about the epidemiological characteristics of viral genomes. Thanks to advances in whole genome sequencing, they can be applied to slowly evolving bacterial pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\\n\\nIn this study, we investigate the epidemiological dynamics underlying two M. tuberculosis outbreaks using phylodynamic methods. The first outbreak occurred in the Swiss city of Bern (1993-2012) and was caused by a drug-susceptible strain belonging to the phylogenetic M. tuberculosis Lineage 4. The second outbreak was caused by a multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain of Lineage 2, imported from the Wat Tham Krabok (WTK) refugee camp in Thailand into California.\\n\\nThere is little temporal signal in the Bern data set and moderate temporal signal in the WTK data set. We estimate an evolutionary rate of 0.0039 per single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) per year for Bern and 0.0024 per SNP per year for WTK. Nevertheless, due to its high sampling proportion (90%) the Bern outbreak allows robust estimation of epidemiological parameters despite the poor temporal signal. Conversely, theres much uncertainty in the epidemiological estimates concerning the WTK outbreak, which has a small sampling proportion (9%). Our results suggest that both outbreaks peaked around 1990, although the Bernese outbreak was only detected in 1993, and the WTK outbreak around 2004. Furthermore, individuals were infected for a significantly longer period (around 9 years) in the WTK outbreak than in the Bern outbreak (4-5 years).\\n\\nOur work highlights both the limitations and opportunities of phylodynamic analysis of outbreaks involving slowly evolving pathogens: (i) estimation of the evolutionary rate is difficult on outbreak time scales and (ii) a high sampling proportion allows quantification of the age of the outbreak based on the sampling times, and thus allows for robust estimation of epidemiological parameters.",
