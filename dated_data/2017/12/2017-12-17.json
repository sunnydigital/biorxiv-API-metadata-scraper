    "abstract": "Chemotaxis allows bacteria to sense gradients in their environment and respond by directing their swimming. Aer is a receptor that, instead of responding to a specific chemoattractant, allows bacteria to sense cellular energy levels and move towards favourable environments. In Pseudomonas, the number of apparent Aer homologs differs between the only two species it had been characterized in, P. aeruginosa and P. putida. Here we combined bioinformatic approaches with deletional mutagenesis in P. pseudoalcaligenes KF707 to further characterize Aer. It was determined that the number of Aer homologs varies between 0-4 throughout the Pseudomonas genus, and they were phylogenetically classified into 5 subgroups. We also used sequence analysis to show that these homologous receptors differ in their HAMP signal transduction domains. Genetic analysis also indicated that some Aer homologs have likely been subject to horizontal transfer. P. pseudoalcaligenes KF707 was unique among species for having three Aer homologs as well as the receptors CttP and McpB. Phenotypic characterization in this species showed the most prevalent homolog of Aer was key, but not essential for energy-taxis. This study demonstrates that energy-taxis in Pseudomonas varies between species and provides a new naming convention and associated phylogenetic details for Aer chemoreceptors.",

    "abstract": "Identifying adaptive loci can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying local adaptation. Genotype-environment association (GEA) methods, which identify these loci based on correlations between genetic and environmental data, are particularly promising. Univariate methods have dominated GEA, despite the high dimensional nature of genotype and environment. Multivariate methods, which analyze many loci simultaneously, may be better suited to these data since they consider how sets of markers covary in response to environment. These methods may also be more effective at detecting adaptive processes that result in weak, multilocus signatures. Here, we evaluate four multivariate methods, and five univariate and differentiation-based approaches, using published simulations of multilocus selection. We found that Random Forest performed poorly for GEA. Univariate GEAs performed better, but had low detection rates for loci under weak selection. Constrained ordinations showed a superior combination of low false positive and high true positive rates across all levels of selection. These results were robust across the demographic histories, sampling designs, sample sizes, and levels of population structure tested. The value of combining detections from different methods was variable, and depended on study goals and knowledge of the drivers of selection. Reanalysis of genomic data from gray wolves highlighted the unique, covarying sets of adaptive loci that could be identified using redundancy analysis, a constrained ordination. Although additional testing is needed, this study indicates that constrained ordinations are an effective means of detecting adaptation, including signatures of weak, multilocus selection, providing a powerful tool for investigating the genetic basis of local adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsCisplatin reacts with DNA, and thereby likely generates a characteristic pattern of somatic mutations, called a mutational signature. Despite widespread use of cisplatin in cancer treatment and its role in contributing to secondary malignancies, its mutational signature has not been delineated. We hypothesize that cisplatins mutational signature can serve as a biomarker to identify cisplatin mutagenesis in suspected secondary malignancies. Knowledge of which tissues are at risk of developing cisplatin-induced secondary malignancies could lead to guidelines for non-invasive monitoring for secondary malignancies after cisplatin chemotherapy.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed whole genome sequencing of 10 independent clones of cisplatin-exposed MCF-10A and HepG2 cells, and delineated the patterns of single- and dinucleotide mutations in terms of flanking sequence, transcription strand bias, and other characteristics. We used the mSigAct signature presence test and non-negative matrix factorization to search for cisplatin mutagenesis in hepatocellular carcinomas and esophageal adenocarcinomas.\\n\\nResultsAll clones showed highly consistent patterns of single- and dinucleotide substitutions. The proportion of dinucleotide substitutions was high: 8.1% of single nucleotide substitutions were part of dinucleotide substitutions, presumably due to cisplatins propensity to form intra-and inter-strand crosslinks between purine bases in DNA. We identified likely cisplatin exposure in 9 hepatocellular carcinomas and 3 esophageal adenocarcinomas. All hepatocellular carcinomas for which clinical data were available and all esophageal cancers indeed had histories of cisplatin treatment.\\n\\nConclusionsWe experimentally delineated the single- and dinucleotide mutational signature of cisplatin. This signature enabled us to detect previous cisplatin exposure in human hepatocellular carcinomas and esophageal adenocarcinomas with high confidence.",

    "abstract": "Genome wide screens are widely believed to have identified the great majority of genes required for centriole duplication. However, seeking to clarify the partners of the Drosophila cartwheel protein Sas6, we identified Gorab, a known trans-Golgi associated protein that is mutated in the human wrinkly skin disease, gerodermia osteodysplastica. We now report that Gorab is present not only in the trans-Golgi but also in association with Sas6 at the core of the centriole. Flies lacking Gorab show defects in centriole duplication in many tissues and are also uncoordinated due to basal body defects in sensory cilia, which lose their 9-fold symmetry. We demonstrate the separation of centriole and Golgi functions of Drosophila Gorab in two ways: First, we have created Gorab variants that are unable to localize to trans-Golgi but can still rescue the centriole and cilia defects of gorab null flies. Secondly, we show that expression of C-terminally tagged Gorab disrupts Golgi functions in cytokinesis of male meiosis, a dominant phenotype overcome by a second mutation preventing Golgi targeting. We discuss the tissue specific requirement of Gorab for centriole duplication in the context of its split functions.",

    "abstract": "The stability of long-term memories is enhanced by reactivation during sleep. Correlative evidence has linked memory reactivation with thalamocortical sleep spindles, although their functional role is poorly understood. Our initial study replicated this correlation but also demonstrated a novel rhythmicity to spindles, such that spindles are less likely to occur immediately following other spindles. We leveraged this rhythmicity to test the role of spindles in memory by using real-time spindle tracking to present cues inside versus outside the presumptive refractory period; as predicted, cues presented in the refractory period led to better memory. Our findings reveal a previously undescribed neural mechanism whereby spindles segment sleep into two distinct substates: prime opportunities for reactivation and gaps that segregate reactivation events.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe characteristic timing of sleep spindles regulates when memories can be reactivated during sleep.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in our capacity to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to human kidney tissue are moving the field closer to novel approaches for renal replacement. Such protocols have relied upon our current understanding of the molecular basis of mammalian kidney morphogenesis. To date this has depended upon population based-profiling of non-homogenous cellular compartments. In order to improve our resolution of individual cell transcriptional profiles during kidney morphogenesis, we have performed 10x Chromium single cell RNA-seq on over 6000 cells from the E18.5 developing mouse kidney, as well as more than 7000 cells from human iPSC-derived kidney organoids. We identified 16 clusters of cells representing all major cell lineages in the E18.5 mouse kidney. The differentially expressed genes from individual murine clusters were then used to guide the classification of 16 cell clusters within human kidney organoids, revealing the presence of distinguishable stromal, endothelial, nephron, podocyte and nephron progenitor populations. Despite the congruence between developing mouse and human organoid, our analysis suggested limited nephron maturation and the presence of  off target populations in human kidney organoids, including unidentified stromal populations and evidence of neural clusters. This may reflect unique human kidney populations, mixed cultures or aberrant differentiation in vitro. Analysis of clusters within the mouse data revealed novel insights into progenitor maintenance and cellular maturation in the major renal lineages and will serve as a roadmap to refine directed differentiation approaches in human iPSC-derived kidney organoids.",

    "abstract": "RNAi-elicited gene silencing is heritable and can persist for multiple generations after its initial induction in C. elegans. However, the mechanism by which parental-acquired trait-specific information from RNAi is inherited by the progenies is not fully understood. Here, we identified a cytoplasmic Argonaute protein, WAGO-4, necessary for the inheritance of RNAi. WAGO-4 exhibits asymmetrical translocation to the germline during early embryogenesis, accumulates at the perinuclear foci in the germline, and is required for the inheritance of exogenous RNAi targeting both germline- and soma-expressed genes. WAGO-4 binds to 22G-RNAs and their mRNA targets. Interestingly, WAGO-4-associated endogenous 22G-RNAs target the same cohort of germline genes as CSR-1 and contain untemplated addition of uracil at the 3 ends. The poly(U) polymerase CDE-1 is required for the untemplated uridylation of 22G-RNAs and inheritance of RNAi. Therefore, we conclude that, in addition to the nuclear RNAi pathway, the cytoplasmic RNAi machinery also promotes RNAi inheritance.",

    "abstract": "Plant cells have multiple strategies to adapt to environmental stresses. Rice endosperms form chalkiness in a part of the tissue under heat conditions during the grain-filling stage, although nitrogen supply reduces chalky rice. Air spaces formed in the cells cause an irregular light reflection and create chalkiness, yet what exactly occurs remains unclear at cell level. Through on-site cell-specific analysis, we show that heat-treated cells adjust osmotically and retard protein synthesis to preserve protein storage vacuoles in the cytosol, resulting in air space formation. Application of nitrogen enhances heat tolerance to sustain protein body and amyloplast development during strong osmotic adjustment, which diminishes air spaces to avoid chalkiness. Hence, we conclude that rice endosperm cells could alter organelle compartments spatially during the heat adaptation, depending on the available nitrogen level. Our findings provide new insight into the cellular mechanism of rice chalky formation as a strategy for heat acclimation.",

KRAS mutations occur in ~ 25% of patients with lung cancer, and the presence of these mutations is associated with poor prognosis. Efforts to directly target KRAS or associated downstream MAPK or the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways have seen little or no benefits. One probable reason for the lack of progress in targeting KRAS-mutant tumors is the co-occurrence of other cell survival pathways and mechanisms.\\n\\nMethod and resultsTo identify other potential cell survival pathways in subsets of KRAS-mutant tumors, I performed unsupervised machine learning on somatic mutations in metastatic lung cancer from 725 patient samples. I identified 67 other genes that were mutated in at least 10% of the samples with KRAS alterations. This gene list was enriched with genes involved in the MAPK, AKT and STAT3 pathways, cell-cell adhesion, DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. I also identified 160 overlapping subsets of 3 or more genes that code for oncogenic or oncosuppressive proteins that were mutated in at least 10% of KRAS-mutant tumors.\\n\\nConclusionsIn this study, I identified genes that are co-mutated in KRAS-mutant lung cancer.

This prediction was never tested, although DG place cells remap across similar environments without memory tasks. We confirm this prior finding, then demonstrate that DG place fields do not remap across spatial tasks that require DG-dependent memory discrimination. Instead of remapping, place-discriminating discharge is observed transiently amongst DG place cells, particularly where memory discrimination is most necessary. The DG network signals memory discrimination by expressing distinctive sub-second network patterns of co-firing amongst principal cells at memory discrimination sites. This is accompanied by increased coupling of discharge from excitatory principal cells and inhibitory interneurons. Instead of remapping, these findings identify that memory discrimination is signaled by sub-second patterns of correlated discharge within the dentate network.\\n\\neTOC blurbvan Dijk and Fenton report that dentate gyrus place cells signal memory discrimination not by remapping, but by variable sub-second patterns of coordinated place cell network discharge and enhanced discharge coupling between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, at sites of memory discrimination.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDentate gyrus-dependent memory discrimination does not require place cell remapping\\nC_LIO_LIDentate neural correlates of pattern discrimination are transient, lasting seconds\\nC_LIO_LISub-second dentate network discharge correlations signal memory discrimination\\nC_LIO_LIDentate excitatory-inhibitory coupling is increased at memory discrimination sites\\nC_LI",
