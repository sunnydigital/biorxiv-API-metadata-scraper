    "abstract": "Many multicellular systems problems can only be understood by studying how cells move, grow, divide, interact, and die. Tissue-scale dynamics emerge from systems of many interacting cells as they respond to and influence their microenvironment. The ideal \\\"virtual laboratory\\\" for such multicellular systems simulates both the biochemical microenvironment (the \\\"stage\\\") and many mechanically and biochemically interacting cells (the \\\"players\\\" upon the stage).\\n\\nPhysiCell--physics-based multicellular simulator--is an open source agent-based simulator that provides both the stage and the players for studying many interacting cells in dynamic tissue microenvironments. It builds upon a multi-substrate biotransport solver to link cell phenotype to multiple diffusing substrates and signaling factors. It includes biologically-driven sub-models for cell cycling, apoptosis, necrosis, solid and fluid volume changes, mechanics, and motility \\\"out of the box.\\\" The C++ code has minimal dependencies, making it simple to maintain and deploy across platforms. PhysiCell has been parallelized with OpenMP, and its performance scales linearly with the number of cells. Simulations up to 105-106 cells are feasible on quad-core desktop workstations; larger simulations are attainable on single HPC compute nodes.\\n\\nWe demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on the dynamics of hanging drop tumor spheroids and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. We demonstrate stochastic motility, chemical and contact-based interaction of multiple cell types, and the extensibility of PhysiCell with examples in synthetic multicellular systems (a \\\"cellular cargo delivery\\\" system, with application to anti-cancer treatments), cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology. PhysiCell is a powerful multicellular systems simulator that will be continually improved with new capabilities and performance improvements. It also represents a significant independent code base for replicating results from other simulation platforms. The PhysiCell source code, examples, documentation, and support are available under the BSD license at http://PhysiCell.MathCancer.org and http://PhysiCell.sf.net.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThis paper introduces PhysiCell: an open source, agent-based modeling framework for 3-D multicellular simulations. It includes a standard library of sub-models for cell fluid and solid volume changes, cycle progression, apoptosis, necrosis, mechanics, and motility. PhysiCell is directly coupled to a biotransport solver to simulate many diffusing substrates and cell-secreted signals. Each cell can dynamically update its phenotype based on its microenvironmental conditions. Users can customize or replace the included sub-models.\\n\\nPhysiCell runs on a variety of platforms (Linux, OSX, and Windows) with few software dependencies. Its computational cost scales linearly in the number of cells. It is feasible to simulate 500,000 cells on quad-core desktop workstations, and millions of cells on single HPC compute nodes. We demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on hanging drop tumor spheroids (HDS) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. We demonstrate contact- and chemokine-based interactions among multiple cell types with examples in synthetic multicellular bioengineering, cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology.\\n\\nWe developed PhysiCell to help the scientific community tackle multicellular systems biology problems involving many interacting cells in multi-substrate microenvironments. PhysiCell is also an independent, cross-platform codebase for replicating results from other simulators.",

    "abstract": "Sparse graphical models are frequently used to explore both static and dynamic functional brain networks from neuroimaging data. However, the practical performance of the models has not been studied in detail for brain networks. In this work, we have two objectives. First, we compare several sparse graphical model estimation procedures and several selection criteria under various experimental settings, such as different dimensions, sample sizes, types of data, and sparsity levels of the true model structures. We discuss in detail the superiority and deficiency of each combination. Second, in the same simulation study, we show the impact of autocorrelation and whitening on the estimation of functional brain networks. We apply the methods to a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set. Our results show that the best sparse graphical model, in terms of detection of true connections and having few false-positive connections, is the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimating method in combination with the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and cross-validation (CV) selection method. In addition, the presence of autocorrelation in the data adversely affects the estimation of networks but can be helped by using the CV selection method. These results question the validity of a number of fMRI studies where inferior graphical model techniques have been used to estimate brain networks.",

    "abstract": "From foraging for food to learning complex games, many aspects of human behaviour can be framed as a search problem with a vast space of possible actions. Under finite search horizons, optimal solutions are generally unobtainable. Yet how do humans navigate vast problem spaces, which require intelligent exploration of unobserved actions? Using a variety of bandit tasks with up to 121 arms, we study how humans search for rewards under limited search horizons, where the spatial correlation of rewards (in both generated and natural environments) provides traction for generalization. Across a variety of diifferent probabilistic and heuristic models, we find evidence that Gaussian Process function learning--combined with an optimistic Upper Confidence Bound sampling strategy--provides a robust account of how people use generalization to guide search. Our modelling results and parameter estimates are recoverable, and can be used to simulate human-like performance, providing insights about human behaviour in complex environments.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are organized as tubular networks in the cell and undergo fission and fusion. While several of the molecular players involved in mediating mitochondrial dynamics have been identified, the precise cellular cues that initiate fission or fusion remain largely unknown. In fission yeast, mitochondria are organized along microtubule bundles. Here, we employed deletions of kinesin-like proteins to perturb microtubule dynamics, and determined that cells with long microtubules exhibited long, but fewer mitochondria, whereas cells with short microtubules exhibited short, but several mitochondria due to reduced mitochondrial fission in the former and elevated fission in the latter. Correspondingly, upon onset of closed mitosis in fission yeast, wherein interphase microtubules assemble to form the spindle within the nucleus, we measured increased mitochondrial fission. We determined that the consequent rise in the mitochondrial copy number was necessary to reduce partitioning errors while stochastically partitioning mitochondria between daughter cells. We discovered that the association of mitochondria with microtubules physically impeded the assembly of the fission protein Dnm1 around mitochondria, resulting in inhibition of mitochondrial fission. Taken together, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for regulation of mitochondrial fission that is dictated by the interaction between mitochondria and the microtubule cytoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "When performing bioforensic casework, it is important to be able to reliably detect the presence of a particular organism in a metagenomic sample, even if the organism is only present in a trace amount. For this task, it is common to use a sequence classification program that determines the taxonomic affiliation of individual sequence reads by comparing them to reference database sequences. As metagenomic data sets often consist of millions or billions of reads that need to be compared to reference databases containing millions of sequences, such sequence classification programs typically use search heuristics and databases with reduced sequence diversity to speed up the analysis, which can lead to incorrect assignments. Thus, in a bioforensic setting where correct assignments are paramount, assignments of interest made by \\\"first-pass\\\" classifiers should be confirmed using the most precise methods and comprehensive databases available. In this study we present a O_SCPLOWBLASTC_SCPLOW-based method for validating the assignments made by less precise sequence classification programs, with optimal parameters for filtering of O_SCPLOWBLASTC_SCPLOW results determined via simulation of sequence reads from genomes of interest, and we apply the method to the detection of four pathogenic organisms. The software implementing the method is open source and freely available.",

Studies have shown BrlR plays an important role in high level drug tolerance of P. aeruginosa in biofilm. Its drug tolerance ability can be enhanced by 3',5'-cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP). Here, we show the apo structure of BrlR and the direct binding between GyrI-like domain of BrlR and P. aeruginosa toxin pyocyanin. Furthermore, pyocyanin can enhance the binding between BrlR and DNA in vitro. These findings suggest BrlR can serve as the binding partner for both c-di-GMP and pyocyanin.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNarcolepsy Type 1 is a chronic sleep disorder caused by a deficiency of orexin (hypocretin). In addition to sleep regulation, orexin is important for motivated control processes. Weight gain and obesity are common in narcolepsy. However, the neurocognitive processes associated with food-related control and overeating in orexin-deficient patients are unknown. We explored the neural correlates of general and food-related attentional control in narcolepsy patients (n=23) and healthy BMI-matched controls (n=20). In secondary analyses, we included patients with idiopathic hypersomnia (n=15) to assess sleepiness-related influences.\\n\\nMethodsWe measured attentional bias to food words with a Food Stroop task and general executive control with a Classic Stroop task during fMRI. Moreover, with correlational analyses, we assessed the relative contribution of the neural findings on the Food Stroop and Classic Stroop tasks to spontaneous snack intake.\\n\\nResultsRelative to healthy controls, narcolepsy patients showed enhanced ventral medial prefrontal cortex responses and connectivity with motor cortex during the Food Stroop task, but attenuated dorsal medial prefrontal cortex responses during the Classic Stroop task. The ventral medial prefrontal cortex responses on the Food Stroop task, not the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex responses on the Classic Stroop task, were a significant predictor of snack intake. Comparing the narcolepsy patients with idiopathic hypersomnia patients revealed similar results.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that orexin deficiency is associated with decreased dorsal medial prefrontal cortex responses during general executive control and enhanced ventral medial prefrontal cortex responses during food-driven attention, with the latter predicting increases in food intake.\\n\\nStatement of SignificancePatients with orexin (hypocretin) deficient narcolepsy type-1 often suffer from obesity as well as increased food craving, in addition to the sleep symptoms. However, whether and how orexin deficiency relates to neural differences in food-directed attention is unclear. We employed a Food Stroop task during fMRI and provide experimental evidence that the ventral medial prefrontal cortex responds more strongly to food words in narcolepsy patients than in controls. The hypothesis that this mechanism contributes to weight problems in narcolepsy is strengthened by the observation that ventral medial prefrontal cortex responses during the Food Stroop task were predictive of snack intake. These mechanistic data might thus advance the development of treatment targets for obesity in narcolepsy.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity forecasts are important for conservation, management, and evaluating how well current models characterize natural systems. While the number of forecasts for biodiversity is increasing, there is little information available on how well these forecasts work. Most biodiversity forecasts are not evaluated to determine how well they predict future diversity, fail to account for uncertainty, and do not use time-series data that captures the actual dynamics being studied. We addressed these limitations by using best practices to explore our ability to forecast the species richness of breeding birds in North America. We used hindcasting to evaluate six different modeling approaches for predicting richness. Hindcasts for each method were evaluated annually for a decade at 1,237 sites distributed throughout the continental United States. All models explained more than 50% of the variance in richness, but none of them consistently outperformed a baseline model that predicted constant richness at each site. The best practices implemented in this study directly influenced the forecasts and evaluations. Stacked species distribution models and \\\"naive\\\" forecasts produced poor estimates of uncertainty and accounting for this resulted in these models dropping in the relative performance compared to other models. Accounting for observer effects improved model performance overall, but also changed the rank ordering of models because it did not improve the accuracy of the \\\"naive\\\" model. Considering the forecast horizon revealed that the prediction accuracy decreased across all models as the time horizon of the forecast increased. To facilitate the rapid improvement of biodiversity forecasts, we emphasize the value of specific best practices in making forecasts and evaluating forecasting methods.",

    "abstract": "The human zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24 is an integral membrane protein critical for the final step in the biogenesis of the nuclear scaffold protein lamin A, encoded by LMNA. After farnesylation and carboxyl methylation of its C-terminal CAAX motif, the lamin A precursor, prelamin A, undergoes proteolytic removal of its modified C-terminal 15 amino acids by ZMPSTE24. Mutations in LMNA or ZMPSTE24 that impede this prelamin A cleavage step cause the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and the related progeroid disorders mandibuloacral dysplasia-type B (MAD-B) and restrictive dermopathy (RD). Here we report a \\\"humanized yeast\\\" system to assay ZMPSTE24-dependent cleavage of prelamin A and examine the eight known disease-associated ZMPSTE24 missense mutations. All show diminished prelamin A processing and fall into three classes, with defects in activity, protein stability, or both. Notably, some ZMPSTE24 mutants can be rescued by deleting the E3 ubiquitin ligase Doa10, involved in ER-associated degradation of misfolded membrane proteins, or by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which may have important therapeutic implications for some patients. We also show that ZMPSTE24-mediated prelamin A cleavage can be uncoupled from the recently discovered role of ZMPSTE24 in clearance of ER membrane translocon-clogged substrates. Together with the crystal structure of ZMPSTE24, this \\\"humanized yeast system\\\" can guide structure-function studies to uncover mechanisms of prelamin A cleavage, translocon unclogging, and membrane protein folding and stability.",

Prdm9, the only known vertebrate hybrid sterility gene causes failure of meiotic chromosome synapsis and infertility in male hybrids between mouse strains derived from two mouse subspecies. Within species Prdm9 determines the sites of programmed DNA double-strand breaks and meiotic recombination hotspots. To investigate the relation between Prdm9-controlled meiotic arrest and asynapsis, we inserted random stretches of consubspecific homology on several autosomal pairs in sterile hybrids and analyzed their ability to form synaptonemal complexes and rescue male fertility. Twenty-seven or more Mb of consubspecific homology fully restored synapsis in a given autosomal pair and we predicted that two symmetric DSBs or more per chromosome are necessary for successful meiosis. We hypothesize that impaired recombination between evolutionary diverged homologous chromosomes could function as one of the mechanisms of hybrid sterility occurring in various sexually reproducing species.",

We characterized the internal structure of fighting behaviors by developing a machine learning pipeline that measures and classifies the behavior of individual unmarked animals on a sub-second timescale. This allowed us to quantify several previously hidden features of zebrafish fighting strategies. We found strong correlations between the velocity of the attacker and the defender indicating a dynamic matching of approach and avoidance efforts consistent with the cumulative assessment model of aggression. While velocity matching was ubiquitous, the spatial dynamics of attacks showed phase-specific differences. Contest phase attacks were characterized by a paradoxical side-ways attraction of the retreating animal towards the attacker suggesting that the defender combines avoidance maneuvers with display maneuvers. Post-resolution attacks lacked display-like features and the the defender was avoidance-focused. From the perspective of the winner, game theory modeling further suggested that highly energetically costly post resolution attacks occurred because the winner was trying to increase its relative dominance over the loser. Overall, the rich structure of zebrafish motor coordination during fighting indicates a greater complexity and layering of strategies than has previously been recognized.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial binary division requires the accurate placement of the division machinery. FtsZ, the vital component of the division machinery, can assemble into filaments and self-organize into a ring structure (Z-ring) at the proper site for cell division. Thus, understanding how bacteria control the spatiotemporal formation of the FtsZ ring is crucial for small molecule and nanoparticle antibacterial drug discovery. MapZ, a recently identified FtsZ regulator in Streptococcaceae, has been found to localize at the mid-cell and position the FtsZ ring. However, the mechanism is still unclear. Here, by using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, super-resolution imaging, and single molecule tracking, we investigated the mechanism by which MapZ regulates the FtsZ ring position. The results show that FtsZ exhibites dynamic treadmilling motion in S. mutans. Importantly, depletion of MapZ leads to an unconstrained movement of treadmilling FtsZ filaments and a shorter lifetime of the constricting FtsZ ring. Furthermore, by revealing that MapZ forms an immobile ring-like nanostructure at the division site, our study suggests that MapZ forms a stable ring that acts as a nanotrack to guide and restrict treadmilling FtsZ filaments in S. mutans, representing a novel way in which bacteria control the division.",

    "abstract": "Human eyes are never stable, even during attempts of maintaining gaze on a visual target. Considering transient response characteristics of retinal ganglion cells, a certain amount of motion of the eyes is required to efficiently encode information and to prevent neural adaptation. However, excessive motion of the eyes leads to insufficient exposure to the stimuli which creates blur and reduces visual acuity. Normal miniature eye movements fall in between these extremes but it is unclear if they are optimally tuned for seeing fine spatial details. We used a state-of-the-art retinal imaging technique with eye tracking to address this question. We sought to determine the optimal gain (stimulus/eye motion ratio) that corresponds to maximum performance in an orientation discrimination task performed at the fovea. We found that miniature eye movements are tuned, but may not be optimal, for seeing fine spatial details.",

    "abstract": "Genetic changes causing dramatic brain size expansion in human evolution have remained elusive. Notch signaling is essential for radial glia stem cell proliferation and a determinant of neuronal number in the mammalian cortex. We find three paralogs of human-specific NOTCH2NL are highly expressed in radial glia cells. Functional analysis reveals different alleles of NOTCH2NL have varying potencies to enhance Notch signaling by interacting directly with NOTCH receptors. Consistent with a role in Notch signaling, NOTCH2NL ectopic expression delays differentiation of neuronal progenitors, while deletion accelerates differentiation. NOTCH2NL genes provide the breakpoints in typical cases of 1q21.1 distal deletion/duplication syndrome, where duplications are associated with macrocephaly and autism, and deletions with microcephaly and schizophrenia. Thus, the emergence of hominin-specific NOTCH2NL genes may have contributed to the rapid evolution of the larger hominin neocortex accompanied by loss of genomic stability at the 1q21. 1 locus and a resulting recurrent neurodevelopmental disorder.",

    "abstract": "Surface color appearance depends on both local surface chromaticity and global context. How are these inter-dependencies supported by cortical networks? Combining functional imaging and psychophysics, we examined if color from long-range filling-in engages distinct pathways from responses caused by a field of uniform chromaticity. We find that color from filling-in is best classified and best correlated with appearance by two dorsal areas, V3A and V3B/KO. In contrast, a field of uniform chromaticity is best classified by ventral areas hV4 and LO. Dynamic causal modeling revealed feedback modulation from area V3A to areas V1 and LO for filling-in, contrasting with feedback from LO modulating areas V1 and V3A for a matched uniform chromaticity. These results indicate a dorsal stream role in color filling-in via feedback modulation of area V1 coupled with a cross-stream modulation of ventral areas suggesting that local and contextual influences on color appearance engage distinct neural networks.",

We present TF2Exp, the first gene-based framework (to our knowledge) to predict the impact of altered TF binding on personalized gene expression based on cis-regulatory variants. Using data from lymphoblastoid cell lines, TF2Exp models achieved suitable performance for 3,060 genes. Alterations within DNase I hypersensitive, CTCF-bound, and tissue-specific TF-bound regions were the greatest contributors to the models. Our cis-regulatory variant-based TF2Exp models performed as well as the state-of-the-art SNP-based models, both in cross-validation and external validation. In addition, unlike SNP-based models, our TF2Exp models have the unique advantages to evaluate impact of uncommon variants and distinguish the functional roles of variants in linkage disequilibrium, showing broader utility for future human genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "Interneurons have diverse morphological and physiological characteristics that potentially contribute to the emergence of powerful computational properties of cortical networks. We investigate the functional role of inhibitory subnetworks in the arguably most common network motif of cortical microcircuits: ensembles of pyramidal cells (PCs) with lateral inhibition, commonly referred to as Winner-Take-All networks. Recent theoretical work has shown that spike-timing-dependent plasticity installs in this network motif an important and ubiquitously useful self-organization process: The emergence of sparse codes and Bayesian inference for repeatedly occurring high-dimensional input patterns. However, this link has so far only been established for strongly simplified models with a symbolic implementation of lateral inhibition, rather than through the interaction of PCs with known types of interneurons. We close this gap in this article, and show that the interaction of PCs with two types of inhibitory networks, that reflect salient properties of somatic-targeting neurons (e.g. basket cells) and dendritic-targeting neurons (e.g. Martinotti cells), provides a good approximation to the theoretically optimal lateral inhibition needed for the self-organization of these network motifs. We provide a step towards unraveling the functional roles of interacting networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons from the perspective of emergent neural computation.",

Surprisingly, by studying particles in holes in 3D from over 1,000 tomograms, we have determined that the vast majority of particles (approximately 90%) are adsorbed to an air-water interface. The implications of this observation are wide-ranging, with potential ramifications regarding protein denaturation, conformational change, and preferred orientation. We also show that fiducial-less cryo-electron tomography on single particle grids may be used to determine ice thickness, optimal single particle collection areas and strategies, particle heterogeneity, and de novo models for template picking and single particle alignment.",

    "abstract": "Mechanotransduction is likely to be an important mechanism of signalling in thin, elongated cells like neurons. Maintenance of pre-stress or rest tension may facilitate mechanotransduction in these cells. In recent years, functional roles for mechanical tension in neuronal development and physiology are beginning to emerge but the cellular mechanisms regulating neurite tension remain poorly understood. Active contraction of neurites is a potential mechanism of tension regulation. In this study, we have explored cytoskeletal mechanisms mediating active contractility of neuronal axons. We have developed a simple assay where we evaluate contraction of curved axons upon trypsin-mediated detachment. We show that curved axons undergo contraction and straighten upon de-adhesion. Axonal straightening was found to be actively driven by actomyosin contractility, while microtubules may subserve a secondary role. We find that while axons show a monotonous decrease in length upon contraction, subcellularly, the cytoskeleton shows a heterogeneous contractile response. Further, using an assay for spontaneous development of tension without trypsin-induced de-adhesion, we show that axons are intrinsically contractile. These experiments, using novel experimental approaches, implicate the axonal cytoskeleton in tension homeostasis. Our data suggest that while globally the axon behaves as a mechanical continuum, locally the cytoskeleton is remodelled heterogeneously.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic communities commonly display a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF) but the results have been mixed when assessed in bacterial communities. Habitat heterogeneity, a factor in eukaryotic BEFs, may explain these variable observations but it has not been thoroughly evaluated in bacterial communities. Here, we examined the impact of habitat on the relationship between diversity assessed based on richness, evenness, or phylogenetic diversity, and heterotrophic productivity. We sampled co-occurring free-living (more homogenous) and particle-associated (more heterogeneous) bacterial habitats in a freshwater, estuarine lake. Diversity measures, and not environmental variables, were the best predictors of particle-associated heterotrophic production. There was a strong, positive, linear relationship between particle-associated bacterial richness and heterotrophic productivity that strengthened with evenness. There were no observable BEF trends in free-living bacterial communities. Across both habitats, communities with more phylogenetically related taxa had higher per-capita heterotrophic production than communities of phylogenetically distantly related taxa. Our findings show that heterotrophic bacterial productivity is positively correlated with evenness and richness, negatively with phylogenetic diversity, and that BEF relationships are contingent on microhabitats. Our work adds to the understanding of the highly distinct contributions to community diversity and ecosystem functioning contributed by bacteria in free-living and particle-associated aquatic habitats.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe dietary methylamines choline, carnitine and phosphatidylcholine are used by the gut microbiota to produce a range of metabolites, including trimethylamine (TMA). However, little is known about the use of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) by this consortium of microbes.\\n\\nRESULTSA feeding study using deuterated TMAO in C57BL6/J mice demonstrated microbial conversion of TMAO to TMA, with uptake of TMA into the bloodstream and its conversion to TMAO. Microbial activity necessary to convert TMAO to TMA was suppressed in antibiotic-treated mice, with deuterated TMAO being taken up directly into the bloodstream. In batch-culture fermentation systems inoculated with human faeces, growth of Enterobacteriaceae was stimulated in the presence of TMAO. Human-derived faecal and caecal bacteria (n = 66 isolates) were screened on solid and liquid media for their ability to use TMAO, with metabolites in spent media analysed by 1H-NMR. As with the in vitro fermentation experiments, TMAO stimulated the growth of Enterobacteriaceae; these bacteria produced most TMA from TMAO. Caecal/small intestinal isolates of Escherichia coli produced more TMA from TMAO than their faecal counterparts. Lactic acid bacteria produced increased amounts of lactate when grown in the presence of TMAO, but did not produce large amounts of TMA. Clostridia (sensu stricto), bifidobacteria and coriobacteria were significantly correlated with TMA production in the mixed fermentation system but did not produce notable quantities of TMA from TMAO in pure culture.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSReduction of TMAO by the gut microbiota (predominantly Enterobacteriaceae) to TMA followed by host uptake of TMA into the bloodstream from the intestine and its conversion back to TMAO by host hepatic enzymes is an example of metabolic retroconversion. TMAO influences microbial metabolism depending on isolation source and taxon of gut bacterium.\\n\\nCorrelation of metabolomic and abundance data from mixed microbiota fermentation systems did not give a true picture of which members of the gut microbiota were responsible for converting TMAO to TMA; only by supplementing the study with pure culture work and additional metabolomics was it possible to increase our understanding of TMAO bioconversions by the human gut microbiota.",

We show that running sequentially through a list of N fluctuating items takes Nlog(N) time to accurately find the max, prohibitively slow for large N. The power of computation in the brain is ascribed to its parallelism, yet it is theoretically unclear whether, even on an elemental task like the max operation, leaky and noisy neurons can perform a distributed computation that cuts the required time by a factor of N, a benchmark for parallel computation. We show that conventional winner-take-all circuit models fail to realize the parallelism benchmark and worse, in the presence of noise altogether fail to produce a winner when N is large. If, however, neurons are equipped with a second nonlinearity so that weakly active neurons cannot contribute inhibition to the circuit, the network matches the accuracy of the serial strategy but does so N times faster, partially self-adjusting integration time for task difficulty and number of options and saturating the parallelism benchmark without parameter fine-tuning. Finally, in the regime of few choices (small N), the same circuit predicts Hick's law of decision making; thus Hick's law behavior is a symptom of efficient parallel computation. Our work shows that distributed computation that saturates the parallelism benchmark is possible in networks of noisy and finite-memory neurons.",

Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme vs. median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug response.

    "abstract": "Even if a species phenotype does not change over evolutionary time, the underlying mechanism may change, as distinct molecular pathways can realize identical phenotypes. Here we use linear system theory to explore the consequences of this idea, describing how a gene network underlying a conserved phenotype evolves, as the genetic drift of small changes to these molecular pathways cause a population to explore the set of mechanisms with identical phenotypes. To do this, we model an organisms internal state as a linear system of differential equations for which the environment provides input and the phenotype is the output, in which context there exists an exact characterization of the set of all mechanisms that give the same input-output relationship. This characterization implies that selectively neutral directions in genotype space should be common and that the evolutionary exploration of these distinct but equivalent mechanisms can lead to the reproductive incompatibility of independently evolving populations. This evolutionary exploration, or system drift, is expected to proceed at a rate proportional to the amount of intrapopulation genetic variation divided by the effective population size (Ne). At biologically reasonable parameter values this could lead to substantial interpopulation incompatibility, and thus speciation, on a time scale of Ne generations. This model also naturally predicts Haldanes rule, thus providing a concrete explanation of why heterogametic hybrids tend to be disrupted more often than homogametes during the early stages of speciation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with widespread brain damage, including abnormalities in frontal and limbic brain regions. In a prior study of neuronal circuitry connecting the frontal lobes and limbic system structures in abstinent alcoholic men, we demonstrated decreases in white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) on diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). In the present study, we examined sex differences in alcoholism-related abnormalities of white matter connectivity. Methods: dMRI scans were acquired from 49 abstinent alcoholic individuals (26 women) and 41 nonalcoholic controls (22 women). Tract-based spatial statistical tools were used to estimate regional FA of white matter tracts and to determine sex differences and their relation to measures of alcoholism history. Results: Sex-related differences in white matter connectivity were observed in association with alcoholism: Compared to nonalcoholic men, alcoholic men had diminished FA in portions of the corpus callosum, the superior longitudinal fasciculi II and III, and the arcuate fasciculus and extreme capsule. In contrast, alcoholic women had higher FA in these regions. Sex differences also were observed for correlations between corpus callosum FA and length of sobriety. Conclusions: Sexual dimorphism in white matter microstructure in abstinent alcoholics may implicate underlying differences in the neurobehavioral liabilities for developing alcohol abuse disorders, or for sequelae following abuse.",

    "abstract": "Focused ultrasound has been shown to be effective at stimulating neurons in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro preparations. Ultrasonic neuromodulation is the only non-invasive method of stimulation that could reach deep in the brain with high spatial-temporal resolution, and thus has potential for use in clinical applications and basic studies of the nervous system. Understanding the physical mechanism by which energy in a high acoustic frequency wave is delivered to stimulate neurons will be important to optimize this technology. Two primary candidates for a physical mechanism are radiation force, the delivery of momentum by the acoustic wave, and cavitation, oscillating gas bubbles. We imaged the isolated salamander retina during ultrasonic stimuli that drive ganglion cell activity and observed micron scale displacements consistent with radiation force. We recorded ganglion cell spiking activity with a planar multielectrode array and changed the acoustic carrier frequency across a broad range (0.5 - 43 MHz), finding that increased stimulation occurs at higher acoustic frequencies, a result that is consistent with radiation force but not cavitation. A quantitative radiation force model can explain retinal responses, and could potentially explain previous in vivo results in the mouse, suggesting a new hypothesis to be tested in vivo. Finally, we found that neural activity was strongly modulated by the distance between the transducer and the electrode array showing the influence of standing waves on the response. We conclude that radiation force is the physical mechanism underlying ultrasonic neurostimulation in the ex vivo retina, and that the control of standing waves is a new potential method to modulate these effects.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) alters cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuitry and susceptibility to an illusion of bodily awareness, the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI). Bodily awareness is thought to result from multisensory integration in a predominantly cortical network; the role of subcortical connections is unknown. We studied the effect of modulating cortico-subcortical circuitry on multisensory integration for bodily awareness in PD patients treated with subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) using the RHI experiment. Typically, synchronous visuo-tactile cues induce a false perception of touch on the rubber hand as if it were the subjects hand, whereas asynchronous visuo-tactile cues do not. However, we found that in the asynchronous condition, patients in the off-stimulation state did not reject the RHI as strongly as healthy controls; switching on STN-DBS partially  normalised their responses. Patients in the off-stimulation state also misjudged the position of their hand, indicating it to be closer to the rubber hand than controls. However, STN-DBS did not affect proprioceptive judgements or subsequent arm movements altered by the perceptual effects of the illusion. Our findings support the idea that the STN and subcortical connections have a key role in multisensory integration for bodily awareness. Decisionmaking in multisensory bodily illusions is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Endogenously cueing a stimulus for attention enhances sensory processing of the attended stimulus, and efficiently selects information from the attended stimulus for guiding behavioral decisions. Yet, it is unknown if these sensory and decisional components of endogenous attention are under the control of common, overlapping or distinct mechanisms. Here, we tested human observers in a multi-alternative visuospatial attention task with probabilistic spatial cues, whose predictive validity varied across spatial locations. Observers behavioral choices were analyzed with a multidimensional signal detection model, derived from Bayesian decision theory. The model effectively decoupled attentions effects on perceptual sensitivity from those on decisional thresholds (bias), and revealed striking dissociations between them. Sensitivity was highest at the cued location, and not significantly different among uncued locations, suggesting a spotlight-like allocation of sensory resources at the cued location. On the other hand, bias varied systematically with endogenous cue validity, suggesting a graded distribution of decision thresholds across all locations. Cueing-induced modulations of sensitivity and bias were uncorrelated within and across subjects. Finally, bias selectively correlated with key measures of decision-making: reaction times were strongly correlated with bias, cueing-induced benefits in reaction times were correlated with bias changes independently of sensitivity changes, and subjects who exhibited higher bias, rather than higher sensitivity, toward the cued location produced more optimal behavioral decisions. Our model and findings demonstrate that endogenous cueing of attention does not engage a unitary selection mechanism, but rather involves the operation of dissociable sensory enhancement and decisional selection processes.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe capacity for selective attention allows us to engage efficiently with the most important objects in the world around us. Attention affects the way we perceive important stimuli and also affects how we make behavioral decisions about these stimuli. In this study, we test human observers on a multiple alternative attention task and show that attentions effects on perceptual processing and decision-making can be dissociated. Specifically, attentions sensory effects alone are in line with the conventional notion of an attentional \\\"spotlight\\\". These insights are obtained with a novel Bayesian decision model, which we propose as a powerful tool for teasing apart component processes of cognitive phenomena, and could aid the search for the neural correlates of these phenomena.",

    "abstract": "In most animals, the brain controls the body via a set of descending neurons (DNs) that traverse the neck and terminate in post-cranial regions of the nervous system. This critical neural population is thought to activate, maintain and modulate locomotion and other behaviors. Although individual members of this cell class have been well-studied across species ranging from insects to primates, little is known about the overall connectivity pattern of DNs as a population. We undertook a systematic anatomical investigation of descending neurons in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and created a collection of over 100 transgenic lines targeting individual cell types. Our methods allowed us to describe the morphology of roughly half of an estimated 400 DNs and create a comprehensive map of connectivity between the sensory neuropils in the brain and the motor neuropils in the ventral nerve cord. Like the vertebrate spinal cord, our results show that the fly nerve cord is a highly organized, layered system of neuropils, an organization that reflects the fact that insects are capable of two largely independent means of locomotion - walking and fight - using distinct sets of appendages. Our results reveal the basic functional map of descending pathways in flies and provide tools for systematic interrogation of sensory-motor circuits.",

    "abstract": "Various cold-adapted organisms produce antifreeze proteins (AFPs), which prevent to freeze of cell fluids by resisting the growth of the ice crystal. AFPs are currently being recognized in various organisms that are living in extremely low temperatures. AFPs have several important applications in increasing freeze tolerance of plants; maintain the tissue in frozen conditions and producing cold-hardy plants using transgenic technology. Substantial differences in the sequence and structure of the AFPs, pose a challenge for researcher to identify these proteins. In this paper, we proposed a novel method for identifying AFPs using support vector machine (SVM) by incorporating 4 types of features. Results on two benchmark datasets revealed the strength of the proposed method in AFP prediction. Also, according to the results on an independent test set, our method outperformed the current state-of-the-art methods. The further analysis showed the non-satisfactory performance of the BLAST in AFP detection: more than 62% of the BLAST searches have specificity less than 10% and there is no any BLAST search with sensitivity higher than 10%. These results reveal the urgent need for an accurate tool for AFP detection. In addition, the comparison results of the discrimination power of different feature types disclosed that evolutionary features and amino acid composition are the most contributing features in AFP detection. This method has been implemented as a stand-alone tool, namely afpCOOL, for various operating systems to predict AFPs with a user friendly graphical interface.\\n\\nAvailabilityafpCOOL is freely available at http://bioinf.modares.ac.ir:8080/AFPCOOL/page/afpcool.isp\\n\\nContactDr Zahiri zahiri@modares.ac.ir",

While our understanding of the physical principles behind this process is emerging, the molecular machinery required for the generation of these nanoclusters is unknown. Here, we show that ligand-mediated membrane receptor signaling triggers nanocluster formation. Both soluble and surface-tethered RGD ligands bind the {beta}1-integrin receptor and activate focal adhesion and src-kinases, resulting in RhoA signaling. This cascade ultimately triggers actin-nucleation via specific formins, driving nanoclustering of both GPI-APs and a model transmembrane protein with an actin-binding domain. Integrin signaling concurrently results in talin mediated activation of vinculin. This is necessary for the coupling of the dynamic actin machinery to the inner leaflet driving GPI-AP nanoclustering. Disruption of GPI-AP nanoclustering in either GPI-anchor remodeling mutants or in cells that express vinculin mutants, provide evidence that these nanoclusters are necessary for activating cell spreading, a hallmark of integrin function.",

However, such an ideal mouse model remains unavailable for collecting duct research. Here, we report a mouse model that meets these criteria. In this model, a cassette expressing ERT2CreERT2 (ECE) is inserted at the ATG of the endogenous Aqp2 locus to disrupt Aqp2 function and to express ECE under the control of the Aqp2 promoter. The resulting allele is named Aqp2ECE. There was no indication of a significant impact of disruption of a copy of Aqp2 on renal function and blood pressure control in adult Aqp2ECE/+ heterozygotes. Without tamoxifen, Aqp2ECE did not activate a Cre-dependent red fluorescence protein (RFP) reporter in adult kidneys. A single injection of tamoxifen (2 mg) to adult mice enables Aqp2ECE to induce robust RFP expression in the whole kidney 24h post injection, with the highest recombination efficiency of 95% in the inner medulla. All RFP-labeled cells expressed principal cell markers (Aqp2 & Aqp3), but not intercalated cell markers (V-ATPase B1B2, and carbonic anhydrase II). Hence, Aqp2ECE confers principal cell-specific tamoxifen-inducible recombination with absolute no leakiness, high inducibility, and complete fidelity in cell specificity, which should be an important tool for temporospatial control of target genes in the principal cells and for Aqp2+ lineage tracing in adult mice.",

Despite major reorganization of chromatin structure, the heterochromatic, transcriptionally-silent states of HML and HMR are successfully maintained throughout S-phase. Mutations of specific components of the replisome diminish the capacity to maintain silencing of HML and HMR through replication. Similarly, mutations in histone chaperones involved in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly reduce gene silencing. Bridging these observations, we determined that the PCNA unloading activity of Elg1 was important for coordinating DNA replication forks with the process of replication-coupled nucleosome assembly to maintain silencing of HML and HMR through S-phase. Collectively these data identified a mechanism by which chromatin reassembly is coordinated with DNA replication to maintain silencing through S-phase.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDNA replication poses a unique logistical challenge for the cell in that structural features of chromatin and their regulatory functions must be carefully coordinated with passage of replication machinery so faithful duplication of both the genome and its chromatin structures may be achieved.

    "abstract": "The external part of the globus pallidus (GPe) is a core nucleus of the basal ganglia (BG) whose activity is disrupted under conditions of low dopamine release, as in Parkinsons disease. Current models assume decreased dopamine release in the dorsal striatum results in deactivation of dorsal GPe, which in turn affects motor expression via a regulatory effect on other nuclei of the BG. However, recent studies in healthy and pathological animal models have reported neural dynamics that do not match with this view of the GPe as a relay in the BG circuit. Thus, the computational role of the GPe in the BG is still to be determined. We previously proposed a neural model that revisits the functions of the nuclei of the BG, and this model predicts that GPe encodes values which are amplified under a condition of low striatal dopaminergic drive. To test this prediction, we used an fMRI paradigm involving a within-subject placebo-controlled design, using the dopamine antagonist risperidone, wherein healthy volunteers performed a motor selection and maintenance task under low and high reward conditions. ROI-based fMRI analysis revealed an interaction between reward and dopamine drive manipulations, with increased BOLD activity in GPe in a high compared to low reward condition, and under risperidone compared to placebo. These results confirm the core prediction of our computational model, and provide a new perspective on neural dynamics in the BG and their effects on motor selection and motor disorders.",

In early mild cognitive impairment these changes involved medial temporal lobe regions of transentorhinal, perirhinal and entorhinal cortices (associated with the earliest stages of neurofibrillary changes in Alzheimers Disease), hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and temporal pole, and cortical regions comprising or co-activated with the default-mode network, including rostral and medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and inferior temporal cortex. Key findings include: a) focal and bilaterally symmetric spatial organization of affected medial temporal lobe regions; b) mutual hyperconnectivity bilaterally involving ventral medial temporal lobe structures (temporal pole, uncus); and c) dorsal medial temporal lobe hypoconnectivity with anterior and posterior midline default-mode network nodes. These findings position medial temporal lobe resting state functional connectivity as a candidate biomarker of an Alzheimers Disease pathophysiological cascade, potentially in advance of clinical biomarkers, and coincident with biomarkers of the earliest stages of Alzheimers neuropathology. Our results indicate that medial temporal lobe resting-state functional connectivity should be further investigated as a potential biomarker in the diagnosis of Alzheimers Disease.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIFunctional connectivity change seen before structural change in Alzheimers Disease\\nC_LIO_LIMedial temporal lobes mutually hyper-connect in mild cognitive impairment\\nC_LIO_LIMedial temporal lobe and default mode network decouple in mild cognitive impairment\\nC_LIO_LILoci of functional change in hippocampi are focal with bilaterally symmetric features\\nC_LIO_LINonmonotonic functional connectivity changes in Alzheimers Disease progression\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Advancing synthetic biology to the multicellular level requires the development of multiple orthogonal cell-to-cell communication channels to propagate information with minimal signal interference. The development of quorum sensing devices, the cornerstone technology for building microbial communities with coordinated system behaviour, has largely focused on reducing signal leakage between systems of cognate AHL/transcription factor pairs. However, the use of non-cognate signals as a design feature has received limited attention so far. Here, we demonstrate the largest library of AHL-receiver devices constructed to date with all cognate and non-cognate chemical signal interactions quantified and we develop a software tool that allows automated selection of orthogonal chemical channels. We use this approach to identify up to four orthogonal channels in silico and experimentally demonstrate the simultaneous use of three channels in co-culture. The development of multiple non-interfering cell-to-cell communication channels will facilitate the design of synthetic microbial consortia for novel applications including distributed bio-computation, increased bioprocess efficiency, cell specialisation, and spatial organisation.",

However, the required computations are frequently intractable or prohibitively expensive. Since people often encounter many closely related distributions, selective reuse of computations (amortized inference) is a computationally efficient use of the brains limited resources. We present three experiments that provide evidence for amortization in human probabilistic reasoning. When sequentially answering two related queries about natural scenes, participants responses to the second query systematically depend on the structure of the first query. This influence is sensitive to the content of the queries, only appearing when the queries are related. Using a cognitive load manipulation, we find evidence that people amortize summary statistics of previous inferences, rather than storing the entire distribution. These findings support the view that the brain trades off accuracy and computational cost, to make efficient use of its limited cognitive resources to approximate probabilistic inference.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing has been widely used to detect structural variations (SVs). However, the limited single molecule size makes it difficult to characterize large-scale SVs in a genome because they cannot fully cover such vast and complex regions. Recently, optical mapping in nanochannels has provided novel resolution to detect large-scale SVs by comparing the physical location of the nickase recognition sequence in genomes. Other than in humans, SVs discovered in plants by optical mapping have not been validated. To assess the accuracy of SV calling in plants by optical mapping, we selected two genetically diverse subspecies of the Trifolium model species, subterranean clover cvs. Daliak and Yarloop. The SVs discovered by BioNano optical mapping (BOM) were validated using Illumina short reads. In the analysis, BOM identified 12 large-scale regions containing deletions and 19 containing insertions in Yarloop. The 12 large-scale regions contained 71 small deletions when validated by Illumina short reads. The results suggest that BOM could detect the total size of deletions and insertions, but it could not precisely report the location and actual quantity of SVs in the genome. Nucleotide-level validation is crucial to confirm and characterize SVs reported by optical mapping. The accuracy of SV detection by BOM is highly dependent on the quality of reference genomes and the density of selected nickases.",

    "abstract": "Numerous interactions between plants and animals vary in their outcome between antagonism and mutualism, but it has proven to be difficult to quantify their final outcome. Interactions between plants and scatterhoarding animals provide a prime example of this phenomenon. Scatterhoarders consume large quantities of seeds (potentially reducing plant establishment), yet also disperse seeds and bury them in shallow caches (potentially improving recruitment). However, it has been rarely determined which role prevails for particular plant species. We demonstrate how plant-scatterhoarder interactions can be placed at the antagonism-mutualism continuum, with interactions between rodents and two oaks species (sessile oak Quercus petraea, and red oak Q. rubra) as an empirical example. Our approach consists of quantifying the net outcome of the interaction through assembling different vital rates (e.g. probability of seedling recruitment with and without rodents; near and far from conspecific trees; with and without seed pilferage) piecewise with a simple mathematical model. Our results indicate that during the period of the study, interactions between scatterhoarding rodents and both focal oaks were antagonistic. Even though acorn burial increased the likelihood of seedling establishment, this effect was not strong enough to compensate for the costs of seed predation. Furthermore, we found no evidence that the short-distance transportation that is usually provided by small mammals benefited early oak recruitment. Our study demonstrates how readily accessible field data can be used to gauge the outcomes in conditional mutualisms.",

We here analyzed published de novo mutations (DNMs) in ASD and controls. We found that DNMs in normal subjects occurred at positions bearing SNPs at least 3.45 fold more frequent than expected from the neutral theory, whereas DNMs in ASD were less frequent relative to those in controls, especially so for common SNPs with minor allele frequency >0.01. Among sites bearing both SNPs and DNMs, DNMs in controls occurred significantly more frequent than DNMs in ASD at reference allele sites bearing C or G nucleotides, indicating depletion of ASD associated DNMs in known regions of hypermutability or less functional constraints such as CpG sites. We also analyzed the nucleotide compositions of DNMs and the parity (1:1 ratio) of pyrimidines and purines. We found that DNMs in ASD showed overall lower AT content than that in controls. Parity violations and AT bias in DNMs occurred at expected frequency based on chance in both ASD and controls. These results show enrichment of DNMs at positions bearing SNP sites and C or G sites in normal subjects and less so in ASD, which is not expected from the neutral model, and indicate that DNMs are on average more deleterious in ASD than in controls.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory (EGT) was born from economic game theory through a series of analogies. Given this heuristic genealogy, a number of central objects of the theory (like strategies, players, and games) have not been carefully defined or interpreted. A specific interpretation of these terms becomes important as EGT sees more applications to understanding experiments in microscopic systems typical of oncology and microbiology. In this essay, I provide two interpretations of the central objects of games theory: one that leads to reductive games and the other to effective games. These interpretation are based on the difference between views of fitness as a property of individuals versus fitness as a summary statistic of (sub)populations. Reductive games are typical of theoretical work like agent-based models. But effective games usually correspond more closely to experimental work. However, confusing reductive games for effective games or vice-versa can lead to divergent results, especially in spatially structured populations. As such, I propose that we treat this distinction carefully in future work at the interface of EGT and experiment.",

However, there is a number of molecular mechanisms that may lead to at least a partial preservation of the function of genes carrying even drastic alleles. We performed a direct measurement of the strength of negative selection acting on nonsense alleles of protein-coding genes in the Zambian population of Drosophila melanogaster. Within those exons that carry nonsense mutations, negative selection, assayed by the ratio of missense over synonymous nucleotide diversity levels, appears to be absent, consistent with total loss of function. In other exons of nonsense alleles, negative selection was deeply relaxed but likely not completely absent, and the per site number of missense alleles declined significantly with the distance from the premature stop codon. This pattern may be due to alternative splicing which preserves function of some isoforms of nonsense alleles of genes.",

    "abstract": "For sexual selection within species to drive the evolution of reproductive isolation between lineages, sexually selected and reproductive isolating traits must both share underlying mechanisms and operate in the same direction. While some work has been done to evaluate mechanistic overlap, fewer studies have evaluated whether intraspecific sexually-selected variation is associated with elevated reproductive isolation between species. Here we evaluate this association by assessing the relationship between male reproductive success against conspecifics versus heterospecific males at each of two different mating stages. We find that male precopulatory performance (remating success following a conspecific versus a heterospecific first mating) was not associated between conspecific and heterospecific contexts, but postcopulatory success (sperm competition against conspecific versus heterospecific males) was modestly positively correlated. We discuss two lines of evidence that suggest this modest association is due to incomplete mechanistic overlap between postcopulatory competition in conspecific and heterospecific mating contexts. This study provides an explicit test of a necessary condition for sexual selection to drive speciation, and finds that while sexual selection is not individually sufficient to explain the magnitude of reproductive isolation in this system, it could nonetheless facilitate the evolution of isolation via postcopulatory sperm competition.",

Their recovery opens new opportunities to comprehend the remarkable diversity of pathogens and elucidate etiologies of unresolved CNS neurodegenerative infections.

Pathogenic GNAO1 variants result in early-onset neurological phenotypes, sometimes with distinct epilepsy or movement disorder, and sometimes with both mani-festations in the same patient. The existing extensive knowledge about G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling provides the input needed to describe quantitatively how mutations modify the GPCR signal. This in turn allows rational interpretation of distinct phenotypes arising from mutations in GNAO1. In this work we outline a model that enables understanding of clinical phenotypes at a molecular level. The mutations affecting the catalytic pocket of GNAO1, we show, result in the improper withdrawal of the signal, and give rise to epileptic phenotypes (EPs). The converse is not true - some pure EPs are caused by mutations with no obvious impact on catalysis. Mutations close to the interface with GNAO1s downstream effector block the signal propagation in that direction, and manifest as a movement disorder phenotype without epilepsy. Quantifying the reported reaction to therapy highlights the tendency of the latter group to be unresponsive to the therapies currently in use. We argue, however, that the majority of clinically described mutations can impact several aspects of GNAO1 function at once, resulting in the continuum of phenotypes observed in patients. The reasoning based on GNAO1 signaling model provides a precision medicine paradigm to aid clinicians in selecting effective categories of medication, and in addition, can suggest pragmatic targets for future therapies.",

The typical symptom associated with toxoplasmosis was anxiety, and the typical toxoplasmosis-associated disorders were autism (OR=4.86), schizophrenia (OR=3.34), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (OR=3.02), Asperger syndrome (OR=2.49), antisocial personality disorder (OR=1.81), OCD (OR=1.69), and anxiety disorder (OR=1.57). Borreliosis was associated only with symptoms of depression and with major depression (OR=1.65). The negative effects of borreliosis were detectable only in the Toxoplasma-infected subjects. Toxoplasmosis could play a substantial role in the etiopathogenesis of mental health disorders and its association with schizophrenia is the second strongest association, after autism.",

    "abstract": "As a fundamental dimension of internal state, biological sex modulates neural circuits to generate naturally occurring behavioral variation. Understanding how and why circuits are tuned by sex can provide important insights into neural and behavioral plasticity. Here, we find that sexually dimorphic behavioral responses to C. elegans ascaroside sex pheromones are implemented by the functional modulation of shared chemosensory circuitry. In particular, the sexual state of a single sensory neuron pair, ADF, determines the nature of an animal's behavioral response regardless of the sex of the rest of the body. Genetic feminization of ADF causes males to be repelled by, rather than attracted to, ascarosides, while masculinization of ADF is sufficient to make ascarosides attractive to hermaphrodites. Genetic sex modulates ADF function by tuning chemosensation: ADF is able to detect the ascaroside ascr#3 only in males, a consequence of cell-autonomous action of the master sexual regulator tra-1. Genetic sex regulates behavior in part through the conserved DMRT gene mab-3, whose male-specific expression in ADF promotes ascaroside attraction. The sexual modulation of ADF has a key role in reproductive fitness, as feminization or ablation of ADF renders males unable to use ascarosides to locate mates. These results demonstrate that DMRT genes can functionally modulate shared neural circuits; moreover, they reveal an adaptive mechanism in which chromosomal sex controls a cell-autonomous switch that tunes sensory function, determines behavioral valence, and promotes reproductive fitness.",

Here, we characterized a group A bZIP gene from  Kyoho grapevine, VlbZIP30, which was shown to be induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and dehydration stress. Overexpression of VlbZIP30 in transgenic Arabidopsis enhanced dehydration tolerance during seed germination, and in the seedling and adult stages. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a major proportion of ABA- and/or drought-responsive genes are transcriptionally regulated by VlbZIP30 during ABA or mannitol treatment at the cotyledon greening stage. We identified an A. thaliana G-box motif (CACGTG) and a potential grapevine G-box motif (MCACGTGK) in the promoters of the 39 selected A. thaliana genes up-regulated in the transgenic plants and in the 35 grapevine homologs, respectively. Subsequently, using two grapevine-related databases, we found that 74% and 84% (a total of 27 genes) of the detected grapevine genes were significantly up-regulated by ABA and drought stress, respectively, suggesting that these 27 genes involve in ABA or dehydration stress and may be regulated by VlbZIP30 in grapevine.

However, a detailed and complete description of S2 cell mitosis at the ultrastructural level is still missing. Here, we analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) a random sample of 144 cells undergoing mitosis, focusing on intracellular membrane and microtubule (MT) behavior. This unbiased approach allowed us to discover that S2 cells exhibit a characteristic behavior of intracellular membranes, involving the formation of a quadruple nuclear membrane in early prometaphase and its disassembly during late prometaphase. After nuclear envelope disassembly, the mitotic apparatus becomes encased by a discontinuous network of ER membranes that associate with mitochondria preventing their diffusion into the spindle area. We also observed a peculiar metaphase spindle organization. We found that kinetochores with attached k-fibers are almost invariably associated with lateral MT bundles that can be either interpolar bundles or k-fibers connected to a different kinetochore. This spindle organization is likely to favor chromosome alignment at metaphase and subsequent segregation during anaphase. In summary, we describe several previously unknown features of membrane and microtubule organization during S2 cell mitosis. The genetic determinants of these mitotic features of can now be investigated using an RNAi-based approach, which is particularly easy and efficient in S2 cells",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistant bacteria are critical public health concerns. Among the prime causative factors for the spread of antibiotic resistance is horizontal gene transfer (HGT). A useful model organism for investigating the relationship between HGT and antibiotic resistance is the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis, since the species possesses highly conjugative plasmids that readily disseminate antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors in nature. Unlike many commensal E. faecalis strains, the genomes of multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. faecalis clinical isolates are enriched for mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and lack CRISPR-Cas genome defense systems. CRISPR-Cas systems cleave foreign DNA in a programmable, sequence-specific manner and are disadvantageous for MGE-derived genome expansion. An unexplored facet of CRISPR biology in E. faecalis is that MGEs that are targeted by native CRISPR-Cas systems can be transiently maintained. Here, we investigate the basis for this \\\"CRISPR tolerance.\\\" We observe that E. faecalis can maintain self-targeting constructs that direct Cas9 to cleave the chromosome, but at a fitness cost. Interestingly, DNA repair genes were not up-regulated during self-targeting, but integrated prophages were strongly induced. We determined that low cas9 expression contributes to this transient non-lethality and use this knowledge to develop a robust CRISPR-assisted genome editing scheme. Our results suggest that E. faecalis has maximized the potential for DNA acquisition by attenuating its CRISPR machinery, thereby facilitating acquisition of potentially beneficial MGEs that may otherwise be restricted by genome defense.\\n\\nImportanceCRISPR-Cas has provided a powerful toolkit to manipulate bacteria, resulting in improved genetic manipulations and novel antimicrobials. These powerful applications rely on the premise that CRISPR-Cas chromosome targeting, which leads to double-stranded DNA breaks, is lethal. In this study, we show that chromosomal CRISPR targeting in Enterococcus faecalis is transiently non-lethal. We uncover novel phenotypes associated with this \\\"CRISPR tolerance\\\" and, after determining its genetic basis, develop a genome editing platform in E. faecalis with negligible off-target effects. Our findings reveal a novel strategy exploited by a bacterial pathogen to cope with CRISPR-induced conflicts to more readily accept DNA, and our robust CRISPR editing platform will help simplify genetic modifications in this organism.",

    "abstract": "The success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a pathogen relies on the ability to switch between active growth and non-replicating persistence, associated with latent TB infection. Resuscitation promoting factors (Rpfs) are essential for the transition of M. tuberculosis to dormancy and for emergence from the non-replicating persistent state. But these enzymes are double-edged swords, as their ability to degrade the cell wall, is potentially lethal to the bacterium itself. Hence, Rpf expression is tightly regulated. We have identified a novel regulatory element in the 5 untranslated region (UTR) of rpfB. We demonstrate that this element is a transcriptionally regulated RNA switch/riboswitch candidate, which is restricted to pathogenic mycobacteria, suggesting a role in virulence. Moreover, we have used translation start site mapping to re-annotate the RpfB start codon and identified and validated a ribosome binding site that is likely to be targeted by an RpfB antisense RNA. Finally, we show that rpfB is co-transcribed with downstream genes, ksgA and ispE. ksgA encodes a universally conserved methyl transferase involved in ribosome maturation and ispE encodes an essential ATP-dependent kinase involved in cell wall synthesis. This arrangement implies co-regulation of resuscitation, cell wall synthesis and ribosome maturation via the RNA switch. We propose that deregulation of this switch, associated with cell wall synthesis and ribosome function, presents a new target for anti-tuberculosis drug development.\\n\\nImportanceThis work describes the identification and characterisation of a novel regulatory RNA element/attenuator that controls cell wall synthesis and ribosome function in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of human tuberculosis (TB). By switching between two different conformations, this RNA switch can either enable or inhibit transcription of a tri-cistronic mRNA that encodes a cell-wall remodelling enzyme crucial for activation of latent TB, an RNA methytransferase that is important for ribosome function and a protein kinase essential for early steps in cell wall synthesis. This RNA switch is only present in a subset of pathogenic mycobacteria, and by regulating the expression of three genes associated with classical antimicrobial targets we believe that it offers a novel important target for future anti-tuberculosis drugs.",

Previously, we used electrophysiology to show that hygienic bees displayed significantly higher sensitivity to {beta}-ocimene when stimulated via their left antennae compared to their right. We repeated this assay using worker honey bees from a single hygienic colony and found, to our surprise, that the right antennae elicited higher sensitivity. We also previously attempted to identify a molecular basis for lateralization by using mass spectrometry-based proteomics to compare left and right antennal proteomes. Of the 1,845 proteins, none were differentially expressed. Here, we repeated this experiment but employed orthogonal peptide fractionation to increase proteome coverage to 3,114 proteins; however, still none were differentially expressed. Finally, we attempted to manipulate gene expression of a key antennal odorant binding protein linked to hygienic behaviour (OBP18) using RNA interference via antenna microinjection. We were not able to achieve long-lasting OBP18 knock-down, but comparing the proteomes of untreated, mock dsRNA-treated and OBP18 dsRNA-treated worker antennae revealed numerous off-target effects of the act of injecting alone.

    "abstract": "Complexity and heterogeneity are intrinsic to neurobiological systems, manifest in every process, at every scale, and are inextricably linked to the systems emergent collective behaviours and function. However, the majority of studies addressing the dynamics and computational properties of biologically inspired cortical microcircuits tend to assume (often for the sake of analytical tractability) a great degree of homogeneity in both neuronal and synaptic/connectivity parameters. While simplification and reductionism are necessary to understand the brains functional principles, disregarding the existence of the multiple heterogeneities in the cortical composition, which may be at the core of its computational proficiency, will inevitably fail to account for important phenomena and limit the scope and generalizability of cortical models. We address these issues by studying the individual and composite functional roles of heterogeneities in neuronal, synaptic and structural properties in a biophysically plausible layer 2/3 microcircuit model, built and constrained by multiple sources of empirical data. This approach was made possible by the emergence of large-scale, well curated databases, as well as the substantial improvements in experimental methodologies achieved over the last few years. Our results show that variability in single neuron parameters is the dominant source of functional specialization, leading to highly proficient microcircuits with much higher computational power than their homogeneous counterparts. We further show that fully heterogeneous circuits, which are closest to the biophysical reality, owe their response properties to the differential contribution of different sources of heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAt the population level, obesity has been reported to be positively associated with low-level chronic inflammation, and negatively associated with several indices of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). It is however not clear if obesity-associated inflammation is partly responsible for the observed negative associations between obesity and HRQOL. The present study investigates this question by testing the hypothesis that systemic inflammation is a mediator of the observed association between obesity and a specific HRQOL index called \\\"healthy days\\\", as measured via a subset of the CDC HRQOL-4 questionnaire.\\n\\nMethodsDemographic, body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP), inflammatory disease status, medication use, smoking, and HRQOL data were obtained from NHANES (2005-2008) and analyzed using sampling-weighted generalized linear models. Both main effects and interaction effects were analyzed to evaluate possible mediator-outcome confounding. Model robustness was tested via sensitivity analysis. Prior to model development, data was subjected to multiple imputation in order to mitigate information loss from survey non-response. Averaged results from the imputed datasets were reported in the form of odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI).\\n\\nResultsObesity (BMI >30kg/m2) was positively associated with poor physical healthy days (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.15-2.21) in unadjusted models.  Elevated and  clinically raised levels of the inflammation marker CRP were also positively associated with poor physical healthy days (OR= 1.61, 95% CI: 1.23-2.12, and OR= 2.45, 95% CI: 1.84-3.26, respectively); additionally  clinically raised CRP was positively associated with mental unhealthy days (OR= 1.66, 95% CI: 1.26-2.19). The association between obesity and physical HRQOL was rendered non-significant in models including CRP. Association between  elevated and  clinically raised CRP and physical unhealthy days remained significant even after adjustment for obesity or inflammation-modulating covariates (OR= 1.36, 95% CI :1.02-1.82, and OR= 1.75, 95% CI: 1.21-2.54, respectively).\\n\\nConclusionsSystemic inflammation is a significant mediator of the association between obesity and physical unhealthy days. and is also an independent determinant of physical and mental unhealthy days. Importantly, elevated inflammation below the clinical threshold is also negatively associated with physical healthy days and may warrant more attention from a population health perspective than currently appreciated.",

    "abstract": "mTOR inhibition extends lifespan and ameliorates aging-related pathologies including declining immune function in model organisms. The objective of this Phase 2a clinical trial was to determine if low dose mTOR inhibitor therapy enhanced immune function and thereby decreased infection rates in elderly subjects. The results indicate that 6 weeks of treatment with a low dose combination of a catalytic (BEZ235) plus an allosteric (RAD001) mTOR inhibitor (that selectively inhibits TORC1 downstream of mTOR) was safe, significantly decreased the rate of infections reported by elderly subjects for a year following study drug initiation, upregulated antiviral gene expression, and significantly improved influenza vaccination response. Thus selective TORC1 inhibition with a combination of BEZ235 and RAD001 may be efficacious as immunotherapy to reduce infections, a leading cause of death in the elderly.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryTreatment of elderly subjects with a low dose mTOR inhibitor regimen that selectively inhibits TORC1 significantly decreased infection rates",

    "abstract": "Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (TrxG) proteins are essential for maintaining epigenetic memory in both embryonic stem cells and differentiated cells. To date, how they are localized to hundreds of specific target genes within a vertebrate genome had remained elusive. Here, by focusing on short cis-acting DNA elements of single functions, we discovered, for the first time, to our knowledge, three classes of response elements in human genome: PcG response elements (PREs), MLL1/2-TrxG response elements (TREs) and PcG/TrxG response elements (P/TREs). We further demonstrated that, in contrast to their proposed roles in recruiting PcG proteins to PREs, YY1 and CpG islands are specifically enriched in TREs and P/TREs, but not in PREs. The three classes of response elements as unraveled in this study open new doors for a deeper understanding of PcG and TrxG mechanisms in vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "In animals and fungi, cytoplasmic dynein is a processive motor that plays dominant roles in various intracellular processes. In contrast, land plants lack cytoplasmic dynein but contain many minus-end-directed kinesin-14s. No plant kinesin-14 is known to produce processive motility as a homodimer. OsKCH2 is a plant-specific kinesin-14 with an N-terminal actin-binding domain and a central motor domain flanked by two predicted coiled-coils (CC1 and CC2). Here, we show that OsKCH2 specifically decorates preprophase band microtubules in vivo and transports actin filaments along microtubules in vitro. Importantly, OsKCH2 exhibits processive minus-end-directed motility on single microtubules as individual homodimers. We find that CC1 but not CC2 forms the coiled-coil for OsKCH2 dimerization. Instead, CC2 functions to enable OsKCH2 processivity by enhancing its binding to microtubules. Collectively, these results show that land plants have evolved unconventional kinesin-14 homodimers with inherent minus-end-directed processivity that may function to compensate for the loss of cytoplasmic dynein.",

    "abstract": "Collective cell migration contributes to morphogenesis, wound healing or tumor metastasis. Culturing epithelial monolayers on a substrate enables to quantify such tissue migration. By using narrow strips, we stabilise the front shape; by inhibiting cell division, we limit density increase and favor steady migration; by using long strips, we observe a confined cell monolayer migrating over days. A coherent collective movement propagates over millimeters; cells spread and density decreases from the monolayer bulk toward the front. Cell velocity ([~]micrometer per minute) increases linearly with cell radius, and does not depend explicitly on the distance to the front. Over ten periods of backwards propagating velocity waves, with wavelength [~]millimeter, are detected with a signal-to-noise ratio enabling for quantitative spatio-temporal analysis. Their velocity ([~]ten micrometers per minute) is ten times the cell velocity; it increases linearly with the cell radius. Their period ([~]two hours) is spatially homogeneous, and increases with the front density. When we inhibit the formation of lamellipodia, cell velocity drops while waves either disappear, or have a smaller amplitude and slower period. Our phenomenological model assumes that both cell and wave velocities are related with the activity of lamellipodia, and that the local stretching in the monolayer bulk modulates traction stresses. We find that parameter values close to the instability limit where waves appear yield qualitative and quantitative predictions compatible with experiments, including the facts that: waves propagate backwards; wave velocity increases with cell radius; lamellipodia inhibition attenuates, slows down or even suppresses the waves. Together, our experiments and modelling evidence the importance of lamellipodia in collective cell migration and waves.",

    "abstract": "The mortality rate of many complex multicellular organisms increase with age, which suggests that net aging damage is accumulative, despite remodeling processes. But how exactly do little mishaps in the cellular level accumulate and spread to become a systemic catastrophe? To address this question we present experiments with synthetic tissues, an analytical model consistent with experiments, and a number of implications that follow the analytical model. Our theoretical framework describes how shape, curvature and density influences the propagation of failure in a tissue subject to oxidative damage. We propose that aging is an emergent property governed by interaction between cells, and that intercellular processes play a role that are at least as important as intracellular ones.",

    "abstract": "Affinity maturation produces antibodies that bind antigens with high specificity by accumulating mutations in the antibody sequence. Mapping out the antibody-antigen affinity landscape can give us insight into the accessible paths during this rapid evolutionary process. By developing a carefully controlled null model for noninteracting mutations, we characterized epistasis in affinity measurements of a large library of antibody variants obtained by Tite-Seq, a recently introduced Deep Mutational Scan method yielding physical values of the binding constant. We show that representing affinity as the binding free energy minimizes epistasis. Yet, we find that epistatically interacting sites contribute substantially to binding. In addition to negative epistasis, we report a large amount of beneficial epistasis, enlarging the space of high-affinity antibodies as well as their mutational accessibility. These properties suggest that the degeneracy of antibody sequences that can bind a given antigen is enhanced by epistasis -- an important property for vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "Kidney organoids differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells hold great promise for understanding organogenesis, modeling disease and ultimately as a source of replacement tissue. Realizing the full potential of this technology will require better differentiation strategies based upon knowledge of the cellular diversity and differentiation state of all cells within these organoids. Here we analyze single cell gene expression in 45,227 cells isolated from 23 organoids differentiated using two different protocols. Both generate kidney organoids that contain a diverse range of kidney cells at differing ratios as well as non-renal cell types. We quantified the differentiation state of major organoid kidney cell types by comparing them against a 4,259 single nucleus RNA-seq dataset generated from adult human kidney, revealing immaturity of all kidney organoid cell types. We reconstructed lineage relationships during organoid differentiation through pseudotemporal ordering, and identified transcription factor networks associated with fate decisions. These results define impressive kidney organoid cell diversity, identify incomplete differentiation as a major roadblock for current directed differentiation protocols and provide a human adult kidney snRNA-seq dataset against which to benchmark future progress.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in pre-mRNA processing factors (PRPFs) cause 40% of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP), but it is unclear why mutations in ubiquitously expressed PRPFs cause retinal disease. To understand the molecular basis of this phenotype, we have generated RP type 11 (PRPF31-mutated) patient-specific retinal organoids and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Impaired alternative splicing of genes encoding pre-mRNA splicing proteins occurred in patient-specific retinal cells and Prpf31+/- mouse retinae, but not fibroblasts and iPSCs, providing mechanistic insights into retinal-specific phenotypes of PRPFs. RPE was the most affected, characterised by loss of apical-basal polarity, reduced trans-epithelial resistance, phagocytic capacity, microvilli, and cilia length and incidence. Disrupted cilia morphology was observed in patient-derived-photoreceptors that displayed progressive features associated with degeneration and cell stress.

They observed that neuroticism was associated with an increase in all-cause mortality, but that following adjustment for self-rated health neuroticism was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality. Further analyses stratified on self-rated health suggested that higher neuroticism was associated with reduced mortality only among those with fair or poor self-rated health.
