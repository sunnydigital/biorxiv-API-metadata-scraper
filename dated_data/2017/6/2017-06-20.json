    "abstract": "Mass cytometry or CyTOF is an emerging technology for high-dimensional multiparameter single cell analysis that overcomes many limitations of fluorescence-based flow cytometry. New methods for analyzing CyTOF data attempt to improve automation, scalability, performance, and interpretation of data generated in large studies. Assigning individual cells into discrete groups of cell types (gating) involves time-consuming sequential manual steps, untenable for larger studies. We introduce DeepCyTOF, a standardization approach for gating, based on deep learning techniques. DeepCyTOF requires labeled cells from only a single sample. It is based on domain adaptation principles and is a generalization of previous work that allows us to calibrate between a target distribution and a source distribution in an unsupervised manner. We show that Deep-CyTOF is highly concordant (98%) with cell classification obtained by individual manual gating of each sample when applied to a collection of 16 biological replicates of primary immune blood cells, even when measured accross several instruments. Further, DeepCyTOF achieves very high accuracy on the semi-automated gating challenge of the FlowCAP-I competition as well as two CyTOF datasets generated from primary immune blood cells: (i)14 subjects with a history of infection with West Nile virus (WNV), (ii) 34 healthy subjects of different ages. We conclude that deep learning in general, and DeepCyTOF specifically, offers a powerful computational approach for semi-automated gating of CyTOF and flow cytometry data.",

    "abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, contain a non-photosynthetic plastid known as the apicoplast that functions to produce essential metabolic compounds. It was previously reported that several members of the Clp family of chaperones and proteases localize to the apicoplast. In bacteria and in chloroplasts these proteins form complexes that degrade proteins in a proteasome-like manner to regulate key cellular processes, but their function in the apicoplast is completely unknown. In this study, we generated a conditional mutant of the P. falciparum apicoplast-targeted pfclpc gene and found that under normal conditions it localizes to the apicoplast. Knockdown of PfClpC results in growth inhibition and morphological defects, indicating that PfClpC is essential for parasite viability. Upon inhibition, PfClpC loses its apicoplast localization and appears in vesicle-like structures. Other apicoplast-targeted proteins also localize to these structures, suggesting that organelle integrity is compromised. Addition of isopentynyl pyrophosphate completely rescued the growth inhibition, indicating that the only essential function of PfClpC is related to the apicoplast. Moreover, cellular assays suggest that PfClpC inhibition interferes with the ability of the schizont-stage parasites to properly sort functional apicoplast organelles into daughter-merozoites. These data show that PfClpC is an essential gene that functions to maintain apicoplast integrity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe deadly human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, contains a unique organelle called the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid that produces vital metabolites. Members of the prokaryotic-derived Clp family were previously reported to localize to the apicoplast. In bacteria and plant chloroplasts, Clp homologs form a proteasome-like complex that degrade proteins but their function in parasite biology is unknown. Here we took a conditional knockdown approach to study an apicoplast localized Clp proteins, PfClpC, which we found to be essential for parasite viability. Inhibition of PfClpC results in a growth arrest phenotype that correlates with a reduced replication rate. We observed that PfClpC localizes to the apicoplast, however upon inhibition it is found dispersed in vesicle-like structures suggesting a complete breakdown of organelle integrity. Our ability to rescue the phenotype by adding an essential apicoplast-derived metabolite proved that the only essential function of PfClpC is linked to apicoplast function. Furthermore, we have found evidence supporting a role for PfClpC in apicoplast sorting into daughter cells. Therefore, we propose PfClpC as a potential drug target due to its essentiality, prokaryotic origin and absence from the human host.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoiesis is one of the best characterized biological systems but the connection between chromatin changes and lineage differentiation is not yet well understood. We have developed a bioinformatic workflow to generate a chromatin space that allows to classify forty-two human healthy blood epigenomes from the BLUEPRINT, NIH ROADMAP and ENCODE consortia by their cell type. This approach let us to distinguish different cells types based on their epigenomic profiles, thus recapitulating important aspects of human hematopoiesis. The analysis of the orthogonal dimension of the chromatin space identify 32,662 chromatin determinant regions (CDRs), genomic regions with different epigenetic characteristics between the cell types. Functional analysis revealed that these regions are linked with cell identities. The inclusion of leukemia epigenomes in the healthy hematological chromatin sample space gives us insights on the healthy cell types that are more epigenetically similar to the disease samples. Further analysis of tumoral epigenetic alterations in hematopoietic CDRs points to sets of genes that are tightly regulated in leukemic transformations and commonly mutated in other tumors. Our method provides an analytical approach to study the relationship between epigenomic changes and cell lineage differentiation. Method availability: https://github.com/david-juan/ChromDet",

In recent work (Soch et al., 2016: \\\"How to avoid mismodelling in GLM-based fMRI data analysis: cross-validated Bayesian model selection\\\", NeuroImage, vol. 141, pp. 469-489; DOI: 10.1016/j. neuroimage.2016.07.047), we have introduced cross-validated Bayesian model selection (cvBMS) to infer the best model for a group of subjects and use it to guide second-level analysis. While this is the optimal approach given that the same GLM has to be used for all subjects, there is a much more efficient procedure when model selection only addresses nuisance variables and regressors of interest are included in all candidate models. In this work, we propose cross-validated Bayesian model averaging (cvBMA) to improve parameter estimates for these regressors of interest by combining information from all models using their posterior probabilities. This is particularly useful as different models can lead to different conclusions regarding experimental effects and the most complex model is not necessarily the best choice. We find that cvBMS can prevent not detecting established effects and that cvBMA can be more sensitive to experimental effects than just using even the best model in each subject.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a chronically progressive neurodegenerative disease highly correlated to aging. Whether AD originates by targeting a localized brain area and propagates to the rest of the brain across disease-severity progression is a question with an unknown answer. Here, we aim to provide an answer to this question at the group-level by looking at differences in diffusion-tensor brain networks. In particular, making use of data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), four different groups were defined (all of them matched by age, sex and education level): G1 (N1=36, healthy control subjects, Control), G2 (N2=36, early mild cognitive impairment, EMCI), G3 (N3=36, late mild cognitive impairment, LMCI) and G4 (N4=36, AD). Diffusion-tensor brain networks were compared across three disease stages: stage I 3(Control vs EMCI), stage II (Control vs LMCI) and stage III (Control vs AD). The group comparison was performed using the multivariate distance matrix regression analysis, a technique that was born in genomics and was recently proposed to handle brain functional networks, but here applied to diffusion-tensor data. The results were three-fold: First, no significant differences were found in stage I. Second, significant differences were found in stage II in the connectivity pattern of a subnetwork strongly associated to memory function (including part of the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, fusiform gyrus, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and temporal pole). Third, a widespread disconnection across the entire AD brain was found in stage III, affecting more strongly the same memory subnetwork appearing in stage II, plus the other new subnetworks,including the default mode network, medial visual network, frontoparietal regions and striatum. Our results are consistent with a scenario where progressive alterations of connectivity arise as the disease severity increases and provide the brain areas possibly involved in such a degenerative process. Further studies applying the same strategy to longitudinal data are needed to fully confirm this scenario.",

Models of balancing selection were developed to account for the high and sometimes extreme levels of polymorphism found in many natural populations. Negative frequency-dependent selection may be the most powerful selective force maintaining balanced natural polymorphisms but it is also commonly misinterpreted. The aim of this review is to clarify the processes underlying negative frequency-dependent selection, describe classes of natural polymorphisms that can and cannot result from these processes, and discuss observational and experimental data that can aid in accurately identifying the processes that generated or are maintain diversity in nature. Finally, I consider the importance of accurately describing the processes affecting genetic diversity within populations as it relates to research progress.",

    "abstract": "Studies of animal personality attempt to uncover underlying or  latent personality traits that explain broad patterns of behaviour, often by applying latent variable statistical models (e.g. factor analysis) to multivariate data sets. Two integral, but infrequently confirmed, assumptions of latent variable models in animal personality are: i) behavioural variables are independent (i.e. uncorrelated) conditional on the latent personality traits they reflect (local independence), and ii) personality traits are associated with behavioural variables in the same way across individuals or groups of individuals (measurement invariance). We tested these assumptions using observations of aggression in four age classes (4 - 10 months, 10 months - 3 years, 3 - 6 years, over 6 years) of male and female shelter dogs (N = 4,743) in 11 different contexts. A structural equation model supported the hypothesis of two positively correlated personality traits underlying aggression across contexts: aggressiveness towards people and aggressiveness towards dogs (comparative fit index: 0.96; Tucker-Lewis index: 0.95; root mean square error of approximation: 0.03). Aggression across contexts was moderately repeatable (towards people: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.479; towards dogs: ICC = 0.303).\\n\\nHowever, certain contexts related to aggressiveness towards people (but not dogs) shared significant residual relationships unaccounted for by latent levels of aggressiveness.\\n\\nFurthermore, aggressiveness towards people and dogs in different contexts interacted with sex and age. Thus, sex and age differences in displays of aggression were not simple functions of underlying aggressiveness. Our results illustrate that the robustness of traits in latent variable models must be critically assessed before making conclusions about the effects of, or factors influencing, animal personality. Our findings are of concern because inaccurate  aggressive personality trait attributions can be costly to dogs, recipients of aggression and society in general.",

Here, we present Finding Orderings Robustly using k-means and Steiner trees (FORKS), an algorithm that pseudo-temporally orders cells and thereby infers bifurcating state trajectories. FORKS, which is a generic method, can be applied to both single-cell and bulk differentiation data. It is a semi-supervised approach, in that it requires the user to specify the starting point of the time course. We systematically benchmarked FORKS and eight other pseudo-time estimation algorithms on six benchmark datasets, and found it to be more accurate, more reproducible, and more memory-efficient than existing methods for pseudo-temporal ordering. Another major advantage of our approach is its robustness - FORKS can be used with default parameter settings on a wide range of datasets.",

The authors of this counterintuitive idea have published only verbal models to support their claims.\\n\\nHere we present the results of individual-based stochastic modelling of competition between two asexual species differing only by their evolvability. They show that, in changeable environments, less evolvable species could outperform their more evolvable competitors in a broad area of a parameter space, regardless of whether the conditions fluctuated periodically or aperiodically. Highly evolvable species prospered better nearly all the time; however, they sustained a higher probability of extinction during rare events of the rapid transient change of conditions.\\n\\nOur results offer an explanation of why sexually reproducing species, with their reduced capacity to respond adaptively to local or temporal environmental changes, prevail in most eukaryotic taxa in nearly all biotopes on the surface of Earth.

To investigate how reduced Chd8 gene dosage may disrupt brain development and predispose individuals to ASD, we generated a Chd8 heterozygous mouse model. In line with clinical observations, we found that Chd8 heterozygous mice displayed subtle brain hyperplasia and hypertelorism, coupled with increased postnatal brain weight. Chd8 heterozygous mice displayed anomalous behaviours, but autism-like social deficits, repetitive and restricted behaviours were not present. Only minor gene expression changes were observed in the embryonic neocortex at E12.5, with more pronounced gene expression changes in postnatal cortex at P5. Differentially expressed genes showed highly significant enrichment for known autism candidates. Amongst the down-regulated transcripts, genes involved in cell adhesion and axon guidance were particularly prominent, implicating impaired connectivity as a potential mechanism underlying the ASD phenotype. To probe this further, we performed resting state functional fMRI and found increased synchronised activity in cortico-hippocampal and auditory-parietal networks, hinting at impaired sensory processing. Together, these data show that Chd8 heterozygous mice recapitulate key clinical features found in patients with CHD8 mutations and show a unique combination of behavioural phenotypes, which may be underpinned by a distinctive disruption of brain connectivity and sensory processing.",

    "abstract": "The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis predicts that early-life environmental exposures can be detrimental to later-life health, and that mismatch between the pre- and postnatal environment may contribute to the growing non-communicable disease (NCD) epidemic. Within this is an increasingly recognised role for epigenetic mechanisms; epigenetic modifications can be influenced by, e.g., nutrition, and can alter gene expression in mothers and offspring. Currently, there are no whole-genome transcriptional studies of response to nutritional alteration. Thus, we sought to explore how nutrition affects the expression of genes involved in epigenetic processes in Drosophila melanogaster. We manipulated Drosophila food macronutrient composition at the F0 generation, mismatched F1 offspring back to a standard diet, and analysed the transcriptome of the F0 - F3 generations by RNA-sequencing. At F0, the altered (high protein, low carbohydrate, HPLC) diet increased expression of genes involved in epigenetic processes, with coordinated downregulation of genes involved in immunity, neurotransmission and neurodevelopment, oxidative stress and metabolism. Upon reversion to standard nutrition, mismatched F1 and F2 generations displayed multigenerational inheritance of altered gene expression. By the F3 generation, gene expression had reverted to F0 (matched) levels. These nutritionally-induced gene expression changes demonstrate that dietary alteration can upregulate epigenetic genes, which may influence the expression of genes with broad biological functions. Further, the multigenerational inheritance of the gene expression changes in F1 and F2 mismatched generations suggests a predictive adaptive response (PAR) to maternal nutrition. Our findings may help to understand the interaction between maternal diet and future offspring health, and have direct implications for the current NCD epidemic.",

    "abstract": "Murine models describe a defined host/pathogen interaction for urinary tract infection, but human cell studies are scant. Although recent human urothelial organoid models are promising, none demonstrate long-term tolerance to urine, the natural substrate of the tissue and of the uropathogens that live there. We developed a novel human organoid from progenitor cells which demonstrates key structural hallmarks and biomarkers of the urothelium. After three weeks of transwell culture with 100% urine at the apical interface, the organoid stratified into multiple layers. The apical surface differentiated into enlarged and flattened umbrella-like cells bearing characteristic tight junctions, structures resembling asymmetric unit membrane plaques, and a glycosaminoglycan layer. The apical cells also expressed apical cytokeratin-20, a spatial feature of the mammalian urothelium. Urine itself was necessary for full development, and undifferentiated cells were urine-tolerant despite the lack of membrane plaques and a glycosaminoglycan layer. Infection with Enterococcus faecalis revealed the expected invasive outcome, including urothelial sloughing and the formation of intracellular colonies similar to those previously observed in patient cells. This new biomimetic model could help illuminate invasive behaviours of uropathogens, and serve as a reproducible test bed for disease formation, treatment and resolution in patients.",

    "abstract": "G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest and most diverse group of membrane receptors in eukaryotes, and detects a wide array of physiological cues in the human body. We describe a new molecular device that couples CRISPR-Cas9 programmed genome regulation to natural and synthetic extracellular signals via GPCRs. The design of our synthetic device, named CRISPR ChaCha, displays superior performance over an architecture proposed by the previously reported Tango system. Using a parsimonious mathematical model and gene-reporter assays, we find that CRISPR ChaCha can recruit and activate multiple Cas9 molecules for each GPCR molecule. We also characterize key molecular features that modulate CRISPR ChaCha performance. We adopt the design to diverse GPCRs that sense synthetic and natural ligands including chemokines, mitogens, and fatty acids, and observe efficient conversion of signals to customizable genetic programs in mammalian cells, including regulation of endogenous genes. The new class of CRISPR-coupled GPCRs provides a robust and efficient platform for engineering cells with novel behaviors in response to the diverse GPCR ligand repertoire.",

However, the biological function of GSN and its mechanism in NKTCL remain unclear. We found GSN overexpression significantly suppressed cell proliferation, colony formationand invasion and promoted apoptosis of YTS cells. Moreover, the upregulation of GSN significantly decreased the protein levels of PI3K and p-AKT. Interestingly, blocking the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway significantly inhibited cell proliferation and invasion and promoted apoptosis of YTS cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that GSN can suppress cell proliferation and invasion and promote apoptosis of YTS cells, which is likely to be mediated at least partially through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Regulation is central to the functional versatility of cytoplasmic dynein, a motor involved in intracellular transport, cell division, and neurodevelopment. Previous work established that Lis1, a conserved and ubiquitous regulator of dynein, binds to its motor domain and induces a tight microtubule-binding state in dynein. The work we present here--a combination of biochemistry, single-molecule assays, cryo-electron microscopy and in vivo experiments--led to the surprising discovery that Lis1 has two opposing modes of regulating dynein, being capable of inducing both low and high affinity for the microtubule. We show that these opposing modes depend on the stoichiometry of Lis1 binding to dynein and that this stoichiometry is regulated by the nucleotide state of dyneins AAA3 domain. We present data on the in vitro and in vivo consequences of abolishing the novel Lis1-induced weak microtubule-binding state in dynein and propose a new model for the regulation of dynein by Lis1.",

    "abstract": "Individual recognition is important for modulating social interactions but it is not clear to what extent this ability depends on experience gained through repeated interactions with different individuals. In wild tortoises, evidence of social interactions is limited to behaviours performed years after hatching, in the context of mating. To investigate the presence of abilities of individual recognition at the onset of life in tortoises, we used hatchlings of two species (Testudo marginata, Testudo graeca) reared with a single conspecific as unique social experience. When located in a novel environment together with the familiar conspecific, tortoises reached the average distance expected by random trajectories. On the contrary, tortoises tested with an unfamiliar conspecific first explored the mate, then actively kept a distance significantly larger than expected by chance. These results show spontaneous abilities of individual recognition in a non-social species at the onset of life, and active avoidance of unfamiliar conspecifics. We suggest that this predisposed behaviour might be adaptive for young tortoises dispersal.",

These calculations are at odds with experimental results where MicroED structures have been determined from significantly thicker crystals. Here we systematically evaluate the influence of thickness on the accuracy of MicroED intensities and the ability to determine structures from protein crystals one micrometer thick. To do so, we compare ab initio structures of a human prion protein segment determined from thin crystals to those determined from crystals up to one micrometer thick. We also compare molecular replacement solutions from crystals of varying thickness for a larger globular protein, proteinase K. Our results indicate that structures can be reliably determined from crystals at least an order of magnitude thicker than previously suggested by simulation, opening the possibility for an even broader range of MicroED experiments.\\n\\nSummaryAtomic resolution protein structures can be determined by MicroED from crystals that surpass the theoretical maximum thickness limit by an order of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Molecular basis of toxin gene diversity among snakes is poorly understood. Lack of whole genome sequence information for most snakes makes studies on toxin genes and their orthologous counterparts difficult. One of the challenges in studying snake genomes is the acquisition of biological material from live animals, especially from the venomous ones. Additionally, in certain geographies, Government permission is required to handle live snakes making the process cumbersome and time-consuming. Here, we report comparative sequence analyses of toxin genes from Russells viper (Daboia russelii) using whole-genome sequencing data obtained from the skin exuviate. In addition to the comparative analyses of 46 toxin-associated proteins, we present evidence of unique sequence motifs in five key toxin-associated protein domains; nerve growth factor (NGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), Kunitz/Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz BPTI), cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins (CAP) and cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP). We compared the venom-associated domains from Russells viper with those from both venomous and non-venomous vertebrates and invertebrates. The in silico study on structures identified V11 and T35 in the NGF domain; F23 and A29 in the PDGF domain; N69, K2 and A5 in the CAP domain; and Q17 in the CRISP domain to be responsible for differences in the largest pockets across the protein domain structures in New World vipers, Old World vipers and elapids. Similarly, residues F10, Y11 and E20 appear to play an important role in the protein structures across the kunitz protein domain of viperids and elapids. Our study sheds light on the uniqueness of these key toxin-associated proteins and their evolution in vipers.\\n\\nData deposition: Russells viper sequence data is deposited in the NCBI SRA database under the accession number SRR5506741 and the GenBank accession numbers for the individual venom-associated genes is provided in Table S1.",

Then, we experimented with our own software and tested how easy it would be to start from our implementation to reproduce the results, hence attempting to estimate the robustness of the reproducibility.

    "abstract": "Fluorescent fusion proteins open a direct and unique window onto protein function. However, they also introduce the risk of perturbation of the function of the native protein. Successful applications of fluorescent fusions therefore rely on a careful assessment and minimization of the side effects. Such insight, however, is still lacking for many applications of fluorescent fusions. This is particularly relevant in the study of the internal dynamics of motor protein complexes, where both the chemical and mechanical reaction coordinates can be affected. Fluorescent proteins fused to the stator of the bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) complex have previously been used to successfully unveil the internal subunit dynamics of the motor. Here we report the effects of three different fluorescent proteins fused to the stator, all of which altered BFM behavior. The torque generated by individual stators was reduced while their stoichiometry in the complex remained unaffected. MotB fusions decreased the rotation-direction switching frequency of single motors and induced a novel BFM behavior: a bias-dependent asymmetry in the speed attained in the two rotation directions. All these effects could be mitigated by the insertion of a linker at the fusion point. These findings provide a quantitative account of the effects of fluorescent fusions on BFM dynamics and their alleviation--new insights that advance the use of fluorescent fusions to probe the dynamics of protein complexes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMuch of what is known about the biology of proteins was discovered by fusing them to fluorescent proteins that allow detection of their location. But the label comes at a cost: the presence of the tag can alter the behavior of the protein of interest in unforeseen, yet biologically relevant ways. These side effects limit the depth to which fluorescent proteins can be used to probe protein function. One of the systems that has been successfully studied with fluorescent fusions for which these effects have not been addressed are dynamic protein complexes that carry out mechanical work. We examined how fluorescent proteins fused to a component of the bacterial flagellar motor complex impacts its function. Our findings show that the fusion proteins altered biologically relevant dynamical properties of the motor, including induction of a novel mechanical behavior, and demonstrate an approach to alleviate this. These results advance our ability to dissect the bacterial flagellar motor, and the internal dynamics of protein complexes in general, with fluorescent fusion proteins while causing minimal perturbation.",

    "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITP) are lipid carrier proteins that are involved in replenishing the phosphatidylinositol lipid molecules on the plasma membranes. Transitions between the open and closed state conformations are necessary steps in the mechanism of lipid transfer by PITP. The apo (open state) conformation is assumed to occur at the membrane surface during the lipid exchange while the lipid bound (closed state) conformation is required for transfer activity. The transfer of phosphatidylinositol by PITP is controlled by the phosphorylation of S166 in its regulatory region. We wanted to decipher the molecular basis for structure-function relationship between the open-closed-phosphorylated states of PITP. We used all-atom Molecular Dynamics Simulations to study the conformational dynamics in each of these states. Our study shows that the open state is highly dynamic and its transition to closed state would stabilize PITP. We observed restricted conformational sampling of the phosphorylated state which provide basis for its decreased lipid transfer activity. Further, using analysis of residue-residue contact maps and hydrogen bond interactions we discuss the impact of phosphorylation on the global conformation of PITP. Overall, our work provides insights into the structural dynamics in each state and their functional significance.",

    "abstract": "Most breast cancer deaths are caused by metastasis and treatment options beyond radiation and cytotoxic drugs, which have severe side effects, and hormonal treatments, which are or become ineffective for many patients, are urgently needed. This study reanalyzed existing data from three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using a novel computational biostatistics approach (muGWAS), which had been validated in studies of 600-2000 subjects in epilepsy and autism. MuGWAS jointly analyzes several neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms while incorporating knowledge about genetics of heritable diseases into the statistical method and about GWAS into the rules for determining adaptive genome-wide significance.\\n\\nResults from three independent GWAS of 1000-2000 subjects each, which were made available under the National Institute of Healths \\\"Up For A Challenge\\\" (U4C) project, not only confirmed cell-cycle control and receptor/AKT signaling, but, for the first time in breast cancer GWAS, also consistently identified many genes involved in endo-/exocytosis (EEC), most of which had already been observed in functional and expression studies of breast cancer. In particular, the findings include genes that translocate (ATP8A1, ATP8B1, ANO4, ABCA1) and metabolize (AGPAT3, AGPAT4, DGKQ, LPPR1) phospholipids entering the phosphatidylinositol cycle, which controls EEC. These novel findings suggest scavenging phospholipids via alpha-cyclodextrins (CD) as a novel intervention to control local spread of cancer, packaging of exosomes (which prepare distant microenvironment for organ-specific metastases), and endocytosis of {beta}1 integrins (which are required for spread of metastatic phenotype and mesenchymal migration of tumor cells).\\n\\nBeta-cyclodextrins ({beta}CD) have already been shown to be effective in in vitro and animal studies of breast cancer, but exhibits cholesterol-related ototoxicity. The smaller CDs also scavenges phospholipids, but cannot fit cholesterol. An in-vitro study presented here confirms hydroxypropyl (HP)-CD to be twice as effective as HP{beta}CD against migration of human cells of both receptor negative and estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer.\\n\\nIf the previous successful animal studies with {beta}CDs are replicated with the safer and more effective CDs, clinical trials of adjuvant treatment with CDs are warranted. Ultimately, all breast cancer are expected to benefit from treatment with HPCD, but women with triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) will benefit most, because they have fewer treatment options and their cancer advances more aggressively.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms mediate diverse gene expression programs in growth and development. Yet whether any can permanently alter the genome is unknown. Here we report a protein-based epigenetic element, a prion, formed by the conserved DNA helicase Mph1/FANCM. [MPH1+] provides resistance to DNA damage, a gain-of-function trait that requires helicase activity and interactions with other DNA repair proteins. Strikingly, the intrinsically disordered regions of Mph1 and human FANCM that are required for prion phenotypes do not resemble known prions. [MPH1+] reduces mitotic mutation rates, but promotes meiotic crossovers, driving phenotypic diversification in wild outcrosses. Remarkably, [MPH1+] is induced by stresses in which the prion is beneficial. Thus, [MPH1+] fuels a quasi-Lamarckian form of inheritance that promotes survival of the current generation and diversification of the next.",

    "abstract": "Background: Puberty is a complex biopsychosocial process that is linked to an array of psychiatric and medical disorders that emerge in adolescence and persist across the lifespan. Although the pubertal process is driven by neuroendocrine changes, few quantitative genetic studies have directly measured puberty-relevant hormones. Hair samples can now be assayed for accumulation of hormones over several months. In contrast to more conventional salivary measures, hair measures are not confounded by diurnal variation or hormonal reactivity.\\n\\nMethods: In an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of 1,286 child and adolescent twins and multiples from 672 unique families, we estimated genetic and environmental influences on concentrations of testosterone, DHEA, and progesterone in hair across the period of 8 to 18 years of age.\\n\\nResults: We identified sex-specific developmental windows of maximal heritability in each hormone. Peak heritability for DHEA occurred at age 9.8 years for males and 10.0 years for females. Peak heritability for testosterone occurred at age 12.5 and 15.2 years for males and females, respectively. Peak heritability for male progesterone occurred at 11.2 years, while the heritability of female progesterone remained uniformly low.\\n\\nConclusion: This is the first study of genetic influences on pubertal hormone concentrations in human hair and is the largest of the heritability of pubertal hormones in any form. The identification of specific developmental windows when genetic signals for hormones are maximized has critical implications for well-informed models of hormone-behavior associations in childhood and adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signalling regulates self-renewal and lineage selection within the mouse epidermis. Although the transcriptional response of keratinocytes that receive a Wnt signal is well characterised, little is known about the mechanism by which keratinocytes in proximity to the Wntreceiving cell are co-opted to undergo a change in cell fate. To address this, we performed single-cell mRNA-Seq on mouse keratinocytes co-cultured with and without the presence of beta-catenin activated neighbouring cells. We identified seven distinct cell states in cultures that had not been exposed to the beta-catenin stimulus and show that the stimulus redistributes wild type subpopulation proportions. Using temporal single-cell analysis we reconstruct the cell fate changes induced by neighbour Wnt activation. Gene expression heterogeneity was reduced in neighbouring cells and this effect was most dramatic for protein synthesis associated genes. The changes in gene expression were accompanied by a shift from a quiescent to a more proliferative stem cell state. By integrating imaging and reconstructed sequential gene expression changes during the state transition we identified transcription factors, including Smad4 and Bcl3, that were responsible for effecting the transition in a contact-dependent manner. Our data indicate that non cell-autonomous Wnt/beta-catenin signalling decreases transcriptional heterogeneity and further our understanding of how epidermal Wnt signalling orchestrates regeneration and self-renewal.",

    "abstract": "Similarly to its homologs in other bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa partitioning protein ParB facilitates segregation of newly replicated chromosomes. Lack of ParB is not lethal but results in increased frequency of anucleate cells production, longer division time, cell elongation, altered colony morphology and defective swarming and swimming motility. Unlike in other bacteria, inactivation of parB leads to major changes of the transcriptome, suggesting that, directly or indirectly, ParB plays a role in regulation of gene expression in this organism.\\n\\nParB overproduction affects growth rate, cell division and motility in a similar way as ParB deficiency. To identify primary ParB targets, here we analysed the impact of a slight increase in ParB level on P. aeruginosa transcriptome. ParB excess, which does not cause changes in growth rate and chromosome segregation, significantly alters the expression of 176 loci. Most notably, the mRNA level of genes adjacent to high affinity ParB binding sites parS1-4 close to oriC is reduced. Conversely, in cells lacking either parB or functional parS sequences the orfs adjacent to parS3 and parS4 are upregulated, indicating that direct ParB-parS3/parS4 interactions repress the transcription in this region. In addition, increased ParB level brings about repression or activation of numerous genes including several transcriptional regulators involved in SOS response, virulence and adaptation. Overall, our data support the role of partitioning protein ParB as a transcriptional regulator in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

Synaptic dysfunction hypotheses for how intellectual disabilities like cognitive inflexibility arise in FXS, predict impaired neural coding in the absence of FMRP. We tested the prediction by comparing hippocampus place cells in wild-type and FXS-model mice. Experience-driven CA1 synaptic function and synaptic plasticity changes are excessive in Fmr1-null mice, but CA1 place fields are normal. However, Fmr1-null discharge relationships to local field potential oscillations are abnormally weak, stereotyped, and homogeneous; also discharge coordination within Fmr1-null place cell networks is weaker and less reliable than wild-type. Rather than disruption of single-cell neural codes, these findings point to invariant tuning of single-cell responses and inadequate discharge coordination within neural ensembles as a pathophysiological basis of cognitive inflexibility in FXS.",

Sex differences in pain sensitivity and chronic pain prevalence are well established.

    "abstract": "A central goal in theoretical neuroscience is to predict the response properties of sensory neurons from first principles. Several theories have been proposed to this end. \\\"Efficient coding\\\" posits that neural circuits maximise information encoded about their inputs. \\\"Sparse coding\\\" posits that individual neurons respond selectively to specific, rarely occurring, features. Finally, \\\"predictive coding\\\" posits that neurons preferentially encode stimuli that are useful for making predictions. Except in special cases, it is unclear how these theories relate to each other, or what is expected if different coding objectives are combined. To address this question, we developed a unified framework that encompasses these previous theories and extends to new regimes, such as sparse predictive coding. We explore cases when different coding objectives exert conflicting or synergistic effects on neural response properties. We show that predictive coding can lead neurons to either correlate or decorrelate their inputs, depending on presented stimuli, while (at low-noise) efficient coding always predicts decorrelation. We compare predictive versus sparse coding of natural movies, showing that the two theories predict qualitatively different neural responses to visual motion. Our approach promises a way to explain the observed diversity of sensory neural responses, as due to a multiplicity of functional goals performed by different cell types and/or circuits.",

    "abstract": "The current paradigm of treatment for dental caries (tooth decay) in primary teeth is dangerous, fails to reach many children, and suffers high recurrence. Acceptance of the paradigm arises from a misperception that untreated caries in primary teeth is a threat to life. We show a linear relationship between age and deaths in the United States from 1999 through 2015 caused by dental caries, pulpal / periapical abscess, or facial cellulitis. The intercept of 6 years coincides with emergence of the first permanent tooth: it appears that caries in primary teeth is not a threat to life. Thus, treatment goals should be to avoid pain, which is not possible with operative dentistry, as it causes pain. Medical management of caries is a distinct treatment philosophy which employs topical minimally invasive therapies that treat the disease, and is not merely prevention. Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a central agent to enable effective non-invasive treatment. The announcement of FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation suggests that SDF will become the first FDA approved drug for treating the disease dental caries. Since our last review, 4 clinical trials have been completed, which inform an update to the application protocol and frequency regimen. Suggestions from these studies are to skip the rinsing step due to demonstration of safety and concern of diminished effectiveness by dilution, and to start patients with an intensive regimen of multiple applications over the first few weeks. Breakthroughs in elucidating the impact of SDF on tooth structure and the plaque microbiome inform potential opportunities for bioengineering and understanding caries arrest, respectively. Dentists have been surprised by preference of this treatment over traditional invasive approaches. Renewed interest in this old material has delivered progress to optimize the judicious use of SDF, and enable a revolution in caries management - particularly for primary teeth.\\n\\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYAnesthesia is inappropriate for first-line treatment of early childhood caries now that safe topical treatments such as silver diamine fluoride are available.",

To quantify such traits from images of root systems, researchers often have to choose between automated tools (that are prone to error and extract only a limited number of architectural traits) or semi-automated ones (that are highly time consuming).\\n\\nFindingsWe trained a Random Forest algorithm to infer architectural traits from automatically-extracted image descriptors. The training was performed on a subset of the dataset, then applied to its entirety. This strategy allowed us to (i) decrease the image analysis time by 73% and (ii) extract meaningful architectural traits based on image descriptors.

However, many cases of naturally-occurring DNA methylation variations have been reported, whereby the altered expression of differentially methylated genes is responsible for agronomically important traits. The ability to manipulate plant methylomes to generate populations of epigenetically distinct individuals could provide invaluable resources for breeding and research purposes. Here we describe \\\"epimutagenesis\\\", a novel method to rapidly generate variation of DNA methylation through random demethylation of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. This method involves the expression of a human Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzyme, and results in widespread hypomethylation that can be inherited to subsequent generations, mimicking mutants in the maintenance DNA methyltransferase met1.

    "abstract": "We present here a software suite (ORIGAMI) that facilitates the rapid acquisition and analysis of ion mobility data following collisional activation. ORIGAMI was developed for use on Waters Synapt instruments where data acquisition is achieved by interfacing WREnS (Waters Research Enabled Software) and MassLynx. Two components are presented, the first is ORIGAMIMS which enables activation of ions by sequential increase of collision voltages prior to ion mobility analysis. We demonstrate the use of ORIGAMI on the tetrameric assemblies formed by the proteins concanavalin A (103 kDa) and alcohol dehydrogenase (143 kDa). Activation is performed in the trap collision cell of the Synapt TriWave assembly, where the collision voltage can be ramped from 0-200 V. All of the acquired data is recorded in a single file which simplifies data acquisition. This substantially decreases the time needed to perform a typical activated IM-MS experiment on a single protein charge state from approx. 2 hours to ~25 minutes. Following data acquisition the data is analysed in the second component, ORIGAMIANALYSE, which allows the user to visualise the effect of activation on the mobility of the parent ion, as well as on any produced fragment ion. The user can export the data in the form of heat maps, waterfall or wire plots. In addition, tools implemented in ORIGAMI enable easy data extraction from single or multiple MassLynx .raw files, in-depth interrogation of large datasets, statistical analysis and figure creation capabilities. We demonstrate the use of ORIGAMI on concanavalin A and alcohol dehydrogenase acquired using the traditional protocols and the ORIGAMIMS method.\\n\\nHighlights- New methodology for faster acquisition and data analysis following activation of ions separated by ion mobility mass spectrometry\\n- Software package capable of simultaneous analysis of multiple MassLynx .raw files\\n- Visualization of the change in mobility of parent and fragment ions following activation\\n- Easy extraction, data processing and extensive plotting tools",

The latter include, among others, segmental deletions duplications, translocations and inversions. The result is a highly complex, patient-specific cancer karyotype. Using high-throughput technologies of deep sequencing and microarrays it is possible to interrogate a cancer genome and produce chromosomal copy number profiles and a list of breakpoints (\\\"jumps\\\") relative to the normal genome. This information is very detailed but local, and does not give the overall picture of the cancer genome. One of the basic challenges in cancer genome research is to use such information to infer the cancer karyotype.\\n\\nWe present here an algorithmic approach, based on graph theory and integer linear programming, that receives segmental copy number and breakpoint data as input and produces a cancer karyotype that is most concordant with them.

Under our base scenario, designed according to observations in real data, the algorithm correctly inferred 69% of the karyotypes.

Monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs are long thought to share 100% of their genomic information. However, genetic differences in the form of postzygotic somatic variants have been reported recently both in typically developing (TD) and in clinically discordant MZ pairs. Here, we sought to investigate the contribution of CNVs in 100 twin pairs enriched for NDD phenotypes with a particular focus on MZ pairs discordant for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using the PsychChip array. In our collection, no postzygotic de novo CNVs were found in 55 MZ twin pairs, including the 13 pairs discordant for ASD. When analyzing the burden of rare CNVs among pairs concordant and discordant for ASD/NDD in comparison with typically developed (TD) pairs, no differences were found. However, we did detect a higher rate of CNVs overlapping genes involved in disorders of the nervous system in MZ pairs discordant and concordant for ASD in comparison with TD pairs (p=0.02). Our results are in concordance with earlier findings that postzygotic de novo CNV events are typically rare in genomic DNA derived from saliva or blood and, in the majority of MZ twins, do not explain the discordance of NDDs. Still, studies investigating postzygotic variation in MZ discordant twins using DNA from different tissues and single cells and higher resolution genomics are needed in the future.",

Sixty permutations of performance metric and automated segmentation technique were evaluated. Vein identification improvements that were both large and significant (Cohens d>0.80, p<0.05) were found in 77% of the permutations, compared to no improvement in 5%.\\n\\nConclusionThe accuracy of automated venograms derived from the composite vein image was overwhelmingly superior to venograms derived from SWI or QSM alone.",

    "abstract": "Finding a sought visual target object requires combining visual information about a scene with a remembered representation of the target to create a \\\"target match\\\" signal that indicates when a target is in view. Target match signals have been reported to exist within high-level visual brain areas including inferotemporal cortex (IT), where they are mixed with representations of image and object identity. However, these signals are not well understood, particularly in the context of the real-world challenge that the objects we search for typically appear at different positions, sizes, and within different background contexts. To investigate these signals, we recorded neural responses in IT as two rhesus monkeys performed a delayed-match-to-sample object search task in which target objects could appear at a variety of identity-preserving transformations. Consistent with the existence of behaviorally-relevant target match signals in IT, we found that IT contained a linearly separable target match representation that reflected behavioral confusions on trials in which the monkeys made errors. Additionally, target match signals were highly distributed across the IT population, and while a small fraction of units reflected target match signals as target match suppression, most units reflected target match signals as target match enhancement. Finally, we found that the potentially detrimental impact of target match signals on visual representations was mitigated by target match modulation that was approximately (albeit imperfectly) multiplicative. Together, these results support the existence of a robust, behaviorally-relevant target match representation in IT that is configured to minimally interfere with IT visual representations.",

    "abstract": "Many neuroimaging studies collect functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in a longitudinal manner. However, the current network modeling literature lacks a general framework for analyzing functional connectivity (FC) networks in fMRI data obtained from a longitudinal study. In this work, we build a novel longitudinal FC network model using a variance components approach. First, for all subjects visits, we account for the autocorrelation inherent in the fMRI time series data using a non-parametric technique. Second, we use a generalized least squares approach to estimate 1) the within-subject variance component shared across the population, 2) the FC network, and 3) the FC networks longitudinal trend. Our novel method for longitudinal FC networks seeks to account for the within-subject dependence across multiple visits, the variability due to the subjects being sampled from a population, and the autocorrelation present in fMRI data, while restricting the number of parameters in order to make the method computationally feasible and stable. We develop a permutation testing procedure to draw valid inference on group differences in baseline FC and change in FC over time between a set of patients and a comparable set of controls. To examine performance, we run a series of simulations and apply the model to longitudinal fMRI data collected from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database.",

We explore the use of persistent homology, a topological method applied across the scales of a function, to overcome these limitations. The described method isolates subsets of shape features and measures the spatial relationship of neighboring pixel densities in a shape. We apply the method to the analysis of 182,707 leaves, both published and unpublished, representing 141 plant families collected from 75 sites throughout the world. By measuring leaves from throughout the seed plants using persistent homology, a defined morphospace comparing all leaves is demarcated. Clear differences in shape between major phylogenetic groups are detected and estimates of leaf shape diversity within plant families are made. This approach does not only predict plant family, but also the collection site, confirming phylogenetically invariant morphological features that characterize leaves from specific locations. The application of a persistent homology method to measure leaf shape allows for a unified morphometric framework to measure plant form, including shape and branching architectures.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGene regulatory variation has been proposed to play an important role in the adaptation of plants to environmental stress. In the central highlands of Mexico, farmer selection has generated a unique group of maize landraces adapted the challenges of the highland niche. In this study, gene expression in Mexican highland maize and a reference maize breeding line were compared to identify evidence of regulatory variation in stress-related genes. It was hypothesised that local adaptation in Mexican highland maize would be associated with a transcriptional signature observable even under benign conditions.\\n\\nMethodsAllele specific expression analysis was performed using the seedling-leaf transcriptome of an F1 individual generated from the cross between the highland adapted Mexican landrace Palomero Toluqueno and the reference line B73, grown under benign conditions. Results were compared with a published dataset describing the transcriptional response of B73 seedlings to cold, heat, salt and UV treatments.\\n\\nResultsA total of 2386 genes were identified to show allele specific expression. Of these, 277 showed an expression difference between Palomero Toluqueno and B73 alleles that mirrored the response of B73 cold, heat, salt and/or UV treatments, and, as such, were considered to display a constitutive stress response. Constitutive stress response candidates included genes associated with plant hormone signaling and a number of transcription factors. Construction of a gene co-expression network revealed further signaling and stress-related genes to be among the potential targets of the transcription factors candidates.\\n\\nDiscussionConstitutive activation of responses may represent the best strategy when stresses are severe but predictable. Expression differences observed here between PT and B73 alleles indicate the presence of cis-acting regulatory variation linked to stress-related genes in PT. Considered alongside gene annotation and population data, allele specific expression analysis of plants grown under benign conditions provides an attractive strategy to identify functional variation potentially linked to local adaptation.",

Through random forest modeling we identified differences in the healthy and colorectal cancer virome.

We have developed Specter, an open-source software tool that uses linear algebra to deconvolute DIA mixture spectra directly in terms of a spectral library, circumventing the problems associated with typical fragment correlation-based approaches.

We investigated mechanical properties of cells expressing constitutively active, oncogenic Ras (RasV12) in adherent and suspended states. To do this, we utilized atomic force microscopy and a microfluidic optical stretcher. We found that adherent cells stiffen and suspended cells soften with the expression of constitutively active Ras. The effect on adherent cells was reversed when contractility was inhibited with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632, resulting in softer RasV12 cells. Our findings suggest that increased ROCK activity as a result of Ras has opposite effects on suspended and adhered cells.

Biochemical and biophysical guidance cues act in tandem to guide migration and morphogenesis into distinct cellular patterns. It has been shown that various cell types will express different configurations of cellular adhesion molecules known as cadherins and integrins. Cocultured in vitro experiments have focused on revealing the extensive genetic expression profiles that modulate embryogenesis whilst overlooking the physical cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions that influence organization. We demonstrate that NIH3T3 and MDCK cells undergo a spontaneous phase separation when cocultured in vitro and that this phenomenon occurs through purely physical binding energies. A Monte Carlo simulation model of a mixture of cells with different cell-cell and cell-substrate binding energies reveals that the spontaneous phase separation occurs due to the minimization of interfacial free energy within the system. Cell-cell and cell-substrate binding plays a critical role in cell organization and is capable of phase separating different populations of cells in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Learning, a process by which animals modify their behavior as a result of experience, allows organisms to synthesize information from their surroundings to acquire resources and predict danger. Here we show that prior encounter with the odor of pathogenic bacteria prepares Caenorhabditis elegans to survive actual exposure to the pathogen by increasing HSF-1-dependent expression of genes encoding molecular chaperones. Learning-mediated enhancement of chaperone gene expression requires serotonin. Serotonin primes HSF-1 to enhance the expression of molecular chaperone genes by promoting its localization to RNA polymerase II-enriched nuclear loci, even prior to transcription. HSF-1-dependent chaperone gene expression ensues, however, only if and when animals encounter the pathogen. Thus, learning equips C. elegans to better survive environmental dangers by pre-emptively and specifically initiating transcriptional mechanisms throughout the whole organism. These studies provide one plausible basis for the protective role of environmental enrichment in disease.",

The nuclear localization of {beta}-catenin is the defining step in pathway activation. However, despite intensive investigation, the mechanisms regulating {beta}-catenin nuclear transport remain undefined. In a patient with congenital heart disease and heterotaxy, a disorder of left-right patterning, we previously identified the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, RAPGEF5. Here, we demonstrate that RAPGEF5 regulates left-right patterning via Wnt signaling. In particular, RAPGEF5, regulates the nuclear translocation of {beta}-catenin independently of both {beta}-catenin cytoplasmic stabilization and the importin {beta}1/Ran mediated transport system. We propose a model whereby RAPGEF5 activates the nuclear GTPases, Rap1/2, to facilitate the nuclear transport of {beta}-catenin, defining a parallel nuclear transport pathway to Ran.

    "abstract": "The process of speciation involves populations diverging over time until they are genetically and reproductively isolated. Hybridization between nascent species was long thought to directly oppose speciation. However, the amount of interspecific genetic exchange (introgression) mediated by hybridization remains largely unknown, although recent progress in genome sequencing has made measuring introgression more tractable. A natural place to look for individuals with admixed ancestry (indicative of introgression) is in regions where species co-occur. In west Africa, D. santomea and D. yakuba hybridize on the island of Sao Tome, while D. yakuba and D. teissieri hybridize on the nearby island of Bioko. In this report, we quantify the genomic extent of introgression between the three species of the Drosophila yakuba clade (D. yakuba, D. santomea), D. teissieri). We sequenced the genomes of 86 individuals from all three species. We also developed and applied a new statistical framework, using a hidden Markov approach, to identify introgression. We found that introgression has occurred between both species pairs but most introgressed segments are small (on the order of a few kilobases). After ruling out the retention of ancestral polymorphism as an explanation for these similar regions, we find that the sizes of introgressed haplotypes indicate that genetic exchange is not recent (>1,000 generations ago). We additionally show that in both cases, introgression was rarer on X chromosomes than on autosomes which is consistent with sex chromosomes playing a large role in reproductive isolation. Even though the two species pairs have stable contemporary hybrid zones, providing the opportunity for ongoing gene flow, our results indicate that genetic exchange between these species is currently rare.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYEven though hybridization is thought to be pervasive among animal species, the frequency of introgression, the transfer of genetic material between species, remains largely unknown. In this report we quantify the magnitude and genomic distribution of introgression among three species of Drosophila that encompass the two known stable hybrid zones in this genetic model genus. We obtained whole genome sequences for individuals of the three species across their geographic range (including their hybrid zones) and developed a hidden Markov model-based method to identify patterns of genomic introgression between species. We found that nuclear introgression is rare between both species pairs, suggesting hybrids in nature rarely successfully backcross with parental species. Nevertheless, some D. santomea alleles introgressed into D. yakuba have spread from Sao Tome to other islands in the Gulf of Guinea where D. santomea is not found. Our results indicate that in spite of contemporary hybridization between species that produces fertile hybrids, the rates of gene exchange between species are low.",

    "abstract": "The interplay of gene flow, genetic drift, and local selective pressure is a dynamic process that has been well studied from a theoretical perspective over the last century. Wright and Haldane laid the foundation for expectations under an island-continent model, demonstrating that an island-specific beneficial allele may be maintained locally if the selection coefficient is larger than the rate of migration of the ancestral allele from the continent. Subsequent extensions of this model have provided considerably more insight. Yet, connecting theoretical results with empirical data has proven challenging, owing to a lack of information on the relationship between genotype, phenotype, and fitness. Here, we examine the demographic and selective history of deer mice in and around the Nebraska Sand Hills, a system in which variation at the Agouti locus affects cryptic coloration that in turn affects the survival of mice in their local habitat. We first genotyped 250 individuals from eleven sites along a transect spanning the Sand Hills at 660,000 SNPs across the genome. Using these genomic data, we found that deer mice first colonized the Sand Hills following the last glacial period. Subsequent high rates of gene flow have served to homogenize the majority of the genome between populations on and off the Sand Hills, with the exception of the Agouti pigmentation locus. Furthermore, mutations at this locus are strongly associated with the pigment traits that are strongly correlated with local soil coloration and thus responsible for cryptic coloration.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLinked-Read sequencing technology has recently been employed successfully for de novo assembly of multiple human genomes, however the utility of this technology for complex plant genomes is unproven. We evaluated the technology for this purpose by sequencing the 3.5 gigabase (Gb) diploid pepper (Capsicum annuum) genome with a single Linked-Read library. Plant genomes, including pepper, are characterized by long, highly similar repetitive sequences. Accordingly, significant effort is used to ensure the sequenced plant is highly homozygous and the resulting assembly is a haploid consensus. With a phased assembly approach, we targeted a heterozygous F1 derived from a wide cross to assess the ability to derive both haplotypes for a pungency gene characterized by a large insertion/deletion.\\n\\nResultsThe Supernova software generated a highly ordered, more contiguous sequence assembly than all currently available C. annuum reference genomes. Eighty-four percent of the final assembly was anchored and oriented using four de novo linkage maps. A comparison of the annotation of conserved eukaryotic genes indicated the completeness of assembly. The validity of the phased assembly is further demonstrated with the complete recovery of both 2.5 kb insertion/deletion haplotypes of the PUN1 locus in the F1 sample that represents pungent and non-pungent peppers.\\n\\nConclusionsThe most contiguous pepper genome assembly to date has been generated through this work which demonstrates that Linked-Read library technology provides a rapid tool to assemble de novo complex highly repetitive heterozygous plant genomes. This technology can provide an opportunity to cost-effectively develop high-quality reference genome assemblies for other complex plants and compare structural and gene differences through accurate haplotype reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscience is experiencing a data revolution in which simultaneous recording of many hundreds or thousands of neurons is revealing structure in population activity that is not apparent from single-neuron responses. This structure is typically extracted from trial-averaged data. Single-trial analyses are challenging due to incomplete sampling of the neural population, trial-to-trial variability, and fluctuations in action potential timing. Here we introduce Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (LFADS), a deep learning method to infer latent dynamics from single-trial neural spiking data. LFADS uses a nonlinear dynamical system (a recurrent neural network) to infer the dynamics underlying observed population activity and to extract  de-noised single-trial firing rates from neural spiking data. We apply LFADS to a variety of monkey and human motor cortical datasets, demonstrating its ability to predict observed behavioral variables with unprecedented accuracy, extract precise estimates of neural dynamics on single trials, infer perturbations to those dynamics that correlate with behavioral choices, and combine data from non-overlapping recording sessions (spanning months) to improve inference of underlying dynamics. In summary, LFADS leverages all observations of a neural populations activity to accurately model its dynamics on single trials, opening the door to a detailed understanding of the role of dynamics in performing computation and ultimately driving behavior.",

    "abstract": "Behavior is used to assess memory and cognitive deficits in animals like Fmrl-null mice that model Fragile X Syndrome, but behavior is a proxy for unknown neural events that define cognitive variables like recollection. We identified an electrophysiological signature of recollection in mouse dorsal CA1 hippocampus. During a shocked-place avoidance task, slow gamma (SG: 30-50 Hz) dominates mid-frequency gamma (MG: 70-90 Hz) oscillations 2-3 seconds before successful avoidance, but not failures. Wild-type but not Fmrl-null mice rapidly adapt to relocating the shock; concurrently, SG/MG maxima (SGdominance) decrease in wild-type but not in cognitively inflexible Fmrl-null mice. During SGdominance, putative pyramidal cell ensembles represent distant locations; during place avoidance, these are avoided places. During shock relocation, wild-type ensembles represent distant locations near the currently-correct shock zone but Fmrl-null ensembles represent the formerly-correct zone. These findings indicate that recollection occurs when CA1 slow gamma dominates mid-frequency gamma, and that accurate recollection of inappropriate memories explains Fmrl-null cognitive inflexibility.",

    "abstract": "Habit formation is a behavioral adaptation that automates routine actions. Habitual behavior correlates with broad reconfigurations of dorsolateral striatal (DLS) circuit properties that increase gain and shift pathway timing. The mechanism(s) for these circuit adaptations are unknown and could be responsible for habitual behavior. Here we find that a single class of interneuron, fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs), modulates all of these habit-predictive properties. Consistent with a role in habits, FSIs are more excitable in habitual mice compared to goal-directed and acute chemogenetic inhibition of FSIs in DLS prevents the expression of habitual lever pressing. In vivo recordings further reveal a previously unappreciated selective modulation of SPNs based on their firing patterns; FSIs inhibit most SPNs but paradoxically promote the activity of a subset displaying high fractions of gamma-frequency spiking. These results establish a microcircuit mechanism for habits and provide a new example of how interneurons mediate experience-dependent behavior.",

    "abstract": "Stress is a well-known cause of reproductive dysfunction in many species, including birds, rodents, and humans. However, little is known of the genomic basis for this dysfunction and how it may differ between the sexes. Using the classic reproductive model of the rock dove (Columba livia), we conducted the most in-depth investigation to date of how stress affects all gene transcription of a biological system essential for facilitating reproduction - the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. The HPG transcriptome responded to stress in both sexes, but females exhibited more differential expression than males, and these stress responsive genes were mostly unique to females. This result may be due to 1) fluctuations in the female endocrine environment to facilitate ovulation and follicle maturation, and 2) their evolutionary history. We offer a vital genomic foundation on which sex-specific reproductive dysfunction can be studied, as well as novel gene targets for genetic intervention and therapy investigations.",

Here, we generated and fully characterized a library of synthetic complex promoters for the global regulators, CRP and IHF, in Escherichia coli, formed by a weak -35/-10 consensus sequence preceded by four combinatorial binding sites for these TFs. We found that while cis-elements for CRP preferentially activate promoters when located immediately upstream of the promoter consensus, binding sites for IHF mainly function as \\\"UP\\\" elements and stimulate transcription in several different architectures in the absence of this protein. However, the combination of CRP- and IHF-binding sites resulted in emergent properties in these complex promoters, where the activity of combinatorial promoters cannot be predicted from the individual behavior of its components.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAn organisms protein interactome, or complete network of protein-protein interactions, defines the protein complexes that drive cellular processes. Techniques for studying protein complexes have traditionally applied targeted strategies such as yeast two-hybrid or affinity purification-mass spectrometry to assess protein interactions. However, given the vast number of protein complexes, more scalable methods are necessary to accelerate interaction discovery and to construct whole interactomes. We recently developed a complementary technique based on the use of protein correlation profiling (PCP) and stable isotope labeling in amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to assess chromatographic co-elution as evidence of interacting proteins. Importantly, PCP-SILAC is also capable of measuring protein interactions simultaneously under multiple biological conditions, allowing the detection of treatment-specific changes to an interactome. Given the uniqueness and high dimensionality of co-elution data, new tools are needed to compare protein elution profiles, control false discovery rates, and construct an accurate interactome.\\n\\nResultsHere we describe a freely available bioinformatics pipeline, PrInCE, for the analysis of co-elution data. PrInCE is a modular, open-source library that is computationally inexpensive, able to use label and label-free data, and capable of detecting tens of thousands of protein-protein interactions. Using a machine learning approach, PrInCE offers greatly reduced run time, better performance, prediction of protein complexes, and greater ease of use over previous bioinformatics tools for co-elution data. PrInCE is implemented in Matlab (version R2015b). Source code and standalone executable programs for Windows and Mac OSX are available at https://github.com/fosterlab/PrInCE, where usage instructions can be found. An example dataset and output are also provided for testing purposes.\\n\\nConclusionsPrInCE is the first fast and easy-to-use data analysis pipeline that predicts interactomes and protein complexes from co-elution data. PrInCE allows researchers without bioinformatics proficiency to analyze high-throughput co-elution datasets.",

To facilitate further discovery, we have created the \\\"Cancer LncRNA Census\\\" (CLC), a manually-curated and strictly-defined compilation of lncRNAs with causative roles in cancer. CLC has two principle applications: first, as a resource for training and benchmarking de novo identification methods; and second, as a dataset for studying the fundamental properties of these genes.\\n\\nCLC Version 1 comprises 122 lncRNAs implicated in 29 distinct cancers. LncRNAs are included based on functional or genetic evidence for causative roles in cancer progression. All belong to the GENCODE reference annotation, to enable integration across projects and datasets. For each entry, the evidence type, biological activity (oncogene or tumour suppressor), source reference and cancer type are recorded. Supporting its usefulness, CLC genes are significantly enriched amongst de novo predicted driver genes from PCAWG. CLC genes are distinguished from other lncRNAs by a series of features consistent with biological function, including gene length, high expression and sequence conservation of both exons and promoters. We identify a trend for CLC genes to be co-localised with known protein-coding cancer genes along the human genome. Finally, by integrating data from transposon-mutagenesis functional screens, we show that mouse orthologues of CLC genes tend also to be cancer genes.\\n\\nThus CLC represents a valuable resource for research into long non-coding RNAs in cancer. Their evolutionary and genomic properties have implications for understanding disease mechanisms and point to conserved functions across ~80 million years of evolution.",

Answers have been limited by the difficulty of directly measuring growth at the single cell level. Here we report direct measurement of single cell volumes over complete cell division cycles. The volume added across the cell cycle was independent of cell birth size, a size homeostasis behavior called \\\"adder\\\". Single-cell growth curves revealed that the homeostatic behavior relied on adaptation of G1 duration as well as growth rate modulations. We developed a general mathematical framework that characterizes size homeostasis behaviors. Applying it on datasets ranging from bacteria to mammalian cells revealed that a near-adder is the most common type of size control, but only mammalian cells achieve it using modulation of both cell growth rate and cell-cycle progression.",

In contrast, the anterior piriform cortex (APC) lacks topology for odor identity and appears homogenous in terms of afferent and intracortical excitatory circuitry. Here, we show that an increasing rostral-caudal (RC) gradient of inhibition onto pyramidal cells is commensurate with a decrease in active neurons along the RC axis following exploration of a novel odor environment. This inhibitory gradient is supported by somatostatin interneurons that provide an opposing, rostrally-biased, gradient of inhibition to interneurons. Optogenetic or chemogenetic modulation of somatostatin cells neutralizes the inhibitory gradient onto pyramidal cells. This suggests a novel circuit mechanism whereby opposing spatial gradients of inhibition and disinhibition regulate neural activity along the RC-axis. These findings challenge our current understanding of the spatial profiles of neural circuits and odor processing within APC.",

    "abstract": "Bdelloid rotifers are microscopic invertebrates thought to have evolved for millions of years without sexual reproduction. They have attracted the attention of biologists puzzled by the maintenance of sex among nearly all other eukaryotes. Bdelloid genomes have an unusually high proportion of horizontally acquired non-metazoan genes. This well-substantiated finding has invited speculation that homologous horizontal transfer between rotifers also may occur, perhaps even 'replacing' sex. A 2016 study in Current Biology claimed to supply evidence for this hypothesis. The authors sampled rotifers of the genus Adineta from natural populations and sequenced one mitochondrial and four nuclear loci. For several samples, species assignments were incongruent among loci, which the authors interpreted as evidence of \\\"interspecific genetic exchanges\\\". Here, we use sequencing chromatograms supplied by the authors to demonstrate that samples treated as individuals actually contained two or more divergent mitochondrial and ribosomal sequences, indicating contamination with DNA from additional animals belonging to the supposed \\\"donor species\\\". We also show that \\\"exchanged\\\" molecules share only 75% sequence homology, a degree of divergence incompatible with established mechanisms of recombination and genomic features of Adineta. These findings are parsimoniously explained by cross-contamination of tubes with animals or DNA from different species. Given the proportion of tubes contaminated in this way, we show by calculation that evidence for \\\"intraspecific horizontal exchange\\\" in the same dataset is explained by contamination with conspecific DNA. On the clear evidence of these analyses, the 2016 study provides no reliable support for the hypothesis of horizontal genetic transfer between or within these bdelloid species.",

The architecture of individual subnetworks, and thus the super-network, are determined by competition among particular PUF proteins to bind mRNAs, their affinities for binding elements, and the abundances of the proteins. The super-network responds dramatically: the remaining network can either expand or contract. These strikingly opposite outcomes are determined by an interplay between the relative abundance of the RNAs and proteins, and their affinities for one another. The diverse interplay between overlapping RNA-protein networks provides versatile opportunities for regulation and evolution.",
