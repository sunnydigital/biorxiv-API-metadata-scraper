    "abstract": "BackgroundPsychiatric disorders are multigenic diseases with complex etiology contributing significantly to human morbidity and mortality. Although clinically distinct, several disorders share many symptoms suggesting common underlying molecular changes exist that may implicate important regulators of pathogenesis and new therapeutic targets.\\n\\nResultsWe compared molecular signatures across brain regions and disorders in the transcriptomes of postmortem human brain samples. We performed RNA sequencing on tissue from the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens from three groups of 24 patients each diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder, and from 24 control subjects, and validated the results in an independent cohort. The most significant disease differences were in the anterior cingulate cortex of schizophrenia samples compared to controls. Transcriptional changes were assessed in an independent cohort, revealing the transcription factor EGR1 as significantly down regulated in both cohorts and as a potential regulator of broader transcription changes observed in schizophrenia patients. Additionally, broad down regulation of genes specific to neurons and concordant up regulation of genes specific to astrocytes was observed in SZ and BPD patients relative to controls. We also assessed the biochemical consequences of gene expression changes with untargeted metabolomic profiling and identified disruption of GABA levels in schizophrenia patients.\\n\\nConclusionsWe provide a comprehensive post-mortem transcriptome profile of three psychiatric disorders across three brain regions. We highlight a high-confidence set of independently validated genes differentially expressed between schizophrenia and control patients in the anterior cingulate cortex and integrate transcriptional changes with untargeted metabolite profiling.",

    "abstract": "Decisions are accompanied by a feeling of confidence, i.e., a belief about the decision being correct. Confidence accuracy is critical, notably in high-stakes situations such as medical or financial decisionmaking. Here, we investigated how incentive motivation influences confidence accuracy by combining a perceptual task with a confidence incentivization mechanism. Importantly, by varying the magnitude and valence (gains or losses) of monetary incentives, we orthogonalized their motivational and affective components. Corroborating theories of rational decision-making and motivation, our results first reveal that the motivational value of incentives improves aspects of confidence accuracy. However, in line with a value-confidence interaction hypothesis we further show that the affective value of incentives concurrently biases confidence reports, thus degrading confidence accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that the motivational and affective effects of incentives differentially impact how confidence builds on perceptual evidence. Altogether, these findings may provide new hints about confidence miscalibration in healthy or pathological contexts.",

    "abstract": "The skyline plot is a graphical representation of historical effective population sizes as a function of time. Past population sizes for these plots are estimated from genetic data, without a priori assumptions on the mathematical function defining the shape of the demographic trajectory. Because of this flexibility in shape, skyline plots can, in principle, provide realistic descriptions of the complex demographic scenarios that occur in natural populations. Currently, demographic estimates needed for skyline plots are estimated using coalescent samplers or a composite likelihood approach. Here, we provide a way to estimate historical effective population sizes using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework. We assess its performance using simulated and actual microsatellite datasets. Our method correctly retrieves the signal of contracting, constant and expanding populations, although the graphical shape of the plot is not always an accurate representation of the true demographic trajectory, particularly for recent changes in size and contracting populations. Because of the flexibility of ABC, similar approaches can be extended to other types of data, to multiple populations, or to other parameters that can change through time, such as the migration rate.",

    "abstract": "The selection of amino acid identities that encode new interactions between two-component signaling (TCS) proteins remains a significant challenge. Recent work constructed a co-evolutionary landscape that can be used to select mutations to maintain signal transfer interactions between partner TCS proteins without introducing signal transfer between non-partners (crosstalk). A bigger challenge is to introduce mutations between non-natural partner TCS proteins using the landscape to enhance, suppress, or have a neutral effect on their basal signal transfer rates. This study focuses on the selection of mutations to a response regulator (RR) from Bacilus subtilis and its effect on phosphotransfer with a histidine kinase (HK) from Escherichia Coli. Twelve single-point mutations of the RR protein are selected from the landscape and experimentally expressed to directly test the theoretical predictions on the effect of signal transfer. Differential Scanning Calorimetry is used to monitor any protein stability effects caused by the mutations, which could be detrimental to proper protein function. Of these proteins, seven mutants successfully perturb phosphoryl transfer activity in the computationally predicted manner between the TCS proteins. Furthermore, brute-force exhaustive mutagenesis approaches indicate that only 1% of mutations result in enhanced activity. In comparison, of the six mutations predicted to enhance phosphotransfer, two mutations exhibit a significant enhancement while two mutations are comparable to the wild-type. Thus co-evolutionary landscape theory offers significant improvement over traditional large-scale mutational studies in the efficiency of selecting mutations for protein engineering and design.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCryptic genetic variation (CGV) is the hidden genetic variation that can be unlocked by perturbing normal conditions. CGV can drive the emergence of novel complex phenotypes through changes in gene expression. Although our theoretical understanding of CGV has thoroughly increased over the past decade, insight into polymorphic gene expression regulation underlying CGV is scarce. Here we investigated the transcriptional architecture of CGV in response to rapid temperature changes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We analyzed regulatory variation in gene expression (and mapped eQTL) across the course of a heat stress and recovery response in a recombinant inbred population.\\n\\nResultsWe measured gene expression over three temperature treatments: i) control, ii) heat stress, and iii) recovery from heat stress. Compared to control, exposure to heat stress affected the transcription of 3305 genes, whereas 942 were affected in recovering worms. These affected genes were mainly involved in metabolism and reproduction. The gene expression pattern in recovering worms resembled both the control and the heat stress treatment. We mapped eQTL using the genetic variation of the recombinant inbred population and detected 2626 genes with an eQTL in the heat stress treatment, 1797 in the control, and 1880 in the recovery. The cis-eQTL were highly conserved across treatments. A considerable fraction of the trans-eQTL (40-57%) mapped to 19 treatment specific trans-bands. In contrast to cis-eQTL, trans-eQTL were highly environment specific and thus cryptic. Approximately 67% of the trans-eQTL were only induced in a single treatment, with heat-stress showing the most unique trans-eQTL.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results illustrate the highly dynamic pattern of CGV across three different environmental conditions that can be evoked by a stress response over a relatively short time-span (2 hours) and that CGV is mainly determined by response related trans regulatory eQTL.",

    "abstract": "Each individual cell produces its own set of transcripts, which is the combined result of genetic variation, transcription regulation and post-transcriptional processing. Due to this combinatorial nature, obtaining the exhaustive set of full-length transcripts for a given species is a never-ending endeavor. Yet, each RNA deep sequencing experiment produces a variety of transcripts that depart from the reference transcriptome and should be properly identified. To address this challenge, we introduce a k-mer-based software protocol for capturing local RNA variation from a set of standard RNA-seq libraries, independently of a reference genome or transcriptome. Our software, called DE-kupl, analyzes k-mer contents and detects k-mers with differential abundance directly from the raw data files, prior to assembly or mapping. This enables to retrieve the virtually complete set of unannotated variation lying in an RNA-seq dataset. This variation is subsequently assigned to biological events such as differential lincRNAs, antisense RNAs, splice and polyadenylation variants, introns, expressed repeats, and SNV-harboring or exogenous RNA. We applied DE-kupl to public RNA-seq datasets, including an Epythelial-Mensenchymal Transition model and different human tissues. DE-kupl identified abundant novel events and showed excellent reproducibility when applied to independent deep sequencing experiments. DE-kupl is a new paradigm for analyzing differential RNA-seq data with no preconception on target events, which can also provide fresh insights into existing RNA-seq repositories.",

While the application of molecular biological methods and bioinformatics has brought about an ever deepening and sharpening static description of the molecular and cellular components of the system, a unifying theoretical understanding of the laws governing the dynamics of the system is still lacking.\\n\\nWe have recently developed a quantitative model for the description of antibody homeostasis as defined by the dimensions of antigen concentration, antigen-antibody interaction affinity and antibody concentration. In this paper we develop the concept of a novel thermodynamic representation of multiple molecular interactions in a system, the fountain energy landscape of binding. We show that the hypersurface of the binding fountain corresponds to the antibody-antigen interaction network projected onto an energy landscape defined by conformational entropy and free energy of binding. We demonstrate that thymus independent and thymus dependent antibody responses show distinct patterns of changes in the energy landscape. Overall, the binding fountain energy landscape concept allows a systems biological, thermodynamic perception of the functioning of the clonal humoral immune system.",

    "abstract": "Optimal mating decisions depend on stable signaling systems because any independent changes in either the signal or its perception could carry a fitness cost. However, since the perception and production of specific mating signals are often mediated by different tissues and cell types, the genetic and cellular mechanisms that drive and maintain their coupling on the evolutionary and physiological timescales remain unknown for most animal species. Here, we show that in Drosophila melanogaster, sensory perception and synthesis of an inhibitory mating pheromone is regulated by the action of Gr8a, a member of the Gustatory receptor gene family. Particularly, Gr8a acts as a pheromone chemoreceptor in the sensory system of males and females, and, independently regulates pheromone synthesis in the male fat body and oenocytes. These data provide a relatively simple molecular explanation for how genetic coupling allows for the robust and stable flow of social information at the population level.",

    "abstract": "Proteins perform their functions in solution but their structures are most frequently studied inside crystals. Here we probe how the crystal packing alters microsecond dynamics, using solid-state NMR measurements and multi-microsecond MD simulations of different crystal forms of ubiquitin. In particular, NEar-Rotary-resonance Relaxation Dispersion (NERRD) experiments probe angular backbone motion, while Bloch-McConnell Relaxation Dispersion data report on fluctuations of the local electronic environment. These experiments and simulations reveal that the packing of the protein can significantly alter the thermodynamics and kinetics of local conformational exchange. Moreover, we report small-amplitude reorientational motion of protein molecules in the crystal lattice with a [~]3-5{degrees} amplitude on a tens-of-microseconds time scale in one of the crystals, but not in others. An intriguing possibility arises that overall motion is to some extent coupled to local dynamics. Our study highlights the importance of considering the packing when analyzing dynamics of crystalline proteins.",

The majority of animal studies (72%) yielded evidence for an anti-tumor effect of KDs.

Evidence for pro-tumor effects was lacking completely.\\n\\nConclusionsFeasibility of KDs for cancer patients has been shown in various contexts. The probability of achieving an anti-tumor effect seems greater than that of causing serious side effects when offering KDs to cancer patients.

The model describes reinforcing feedback between an ATRA-inducible signalsome complex involving many proteins including Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and the activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. We decomposed the effective model into three modules; a signal initiation module that sensed and transformed an ATRA signal into program activation signals; a signal integration module that controlled the expression of upstream transcription factors; and a phenotype module which encoded the expression of functional differentiation markers from the ATRA-inducible transcription factors. We identified an ensemble of effective model parameters using measurements taken from ATRA-induced HL-60 cells. Using these parameters, model analysis predicted that MAPK activation was bistable as a function of ATRA exposure. Conformational experiments supported ATRA-induced bistability. Additionally, the model captured intermediate and phenotypic gene expression data. Knockout analysis suggested Gfi-1 and PPAR$[gamma] were critical to the ATRA-induced differentiation program. These findings, combined with other literature evidence, suggested that reinforcing feedback is central to hyperactive signaling in a diversity of cell fate programs.",

    "abstract": "Long-germ insects, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, pattern their segments simultaneously, whereas short germ insects, such as the beetle Tribolium castaneum, pattern their segments sequentially, from anterior to posterior. While the two modes of segmentation at first appear to be very different, many details of segmentation gene expression are surprisingly similar between long-germ and short-germ species. Collectively, these observations hint that insect segmentation may involve fairly conserved patterning mechanisms, which occur within an evolutionarily malleable spatiotemporal framework. Based on genetic and comparative evidence, we now propose that, in both Drosophila and Tribolium embryos, the temporal progression of the segmentation process is regulated by a temporal sequence of Caudal, Dichaete, and Odd-paired expression. These three transcription factors are broadly expressed in segmenting tissues, providing spatiotemporal information that intersects with the information provided by periodically-expressed segmentation genes such as the pair-rule factors. However, they are deployed differently in long-germ versus short-germ insects, acting as simple timers in Drosophila, but as smooth, retracting wavefronts in Tribolium, compatible with either gap gene-based or oscillator-based generation of periodicity, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The multiple types of high throughput genomics data create a potential opportunity to identify driver pattern in ovarian cancer, which will acquire some novel and clinical biomarkers for appropriate diagnosis and treatment to cancer patients. However, it is a great challenging work to integrate omics data, including somatic mutations, Copy Number Variations (CNVs) and gene expression profiles, to distinguish interactions and regulations which are hidden in drug response dataset of ovarian cancer. To distinguish the candidate driver genes and the corresponding driving pattern for resistant and sensitive tumor from the heterogeneous data, we combined gene co-expression modules and mutation modulators and proposed the identification driver patterns method. Firstly, co-expression network analysis is applied to explore gene modules for gene expression profiles via weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Secondly, mutation matrix is generated by integrating the CNVs and somatic mutations, and a mutation network is constructed from this mutation matrix. The candidate modulators are selected from the significant genes by clustering the vertex of the mutation network. At last, regression tree model is utilized for module networks learning in which the achieved gene modules and candidate modulators are trained for the driving pattern identification and modulator regulatory exploring. Many of the candidate modulators identified are known to be involved in biological meaningful processes associated with ovarian cancer, which can be regard as potential driver genes, such as CCL11, CCL16, CCL18, CCL23, CCL8, CCL5, APOB, BRCA1, SLC18A1, FGF22, GADD45B, GNA15, GNA11 and so on, which can help to facilitate the discovery of biomarkers, molecular diagnostics, and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Imaging single molecules in living cells and reconstituted cell systems has resulted in a new understanding of the dynamics of nuclear pore complex functions over the last decade. It does, however, fall short on providing insights into the functional relationships between the pore and nucleocytoplasmic cargo in three-dimensional space. This limited ability is the result of insufficient resolution of optical microscopes along the optical axis and limited fluorescent signal due to the short timescales involved in nuclear transport (fractions of a second). To bypass current technological limitations, it was suggested that highly time-resolved 2D single molecule data could be interpreted as projected cargo locations and could subsequently be transformed into a spatial cargo distribution by assuming cylindrical symmetry 1. Such cargo distributions would provide valuable insights into the NPC-mediated transport in cells. This method, termed 3D-SPEED, has attracted large interest inside and beyond the nuclear pore field, but has also been sharply critiqued for a lack of critical evaluation. Here we present such an evaluation, testing the robustness, reconstruction quality and model-dependency.",

    "abstract": "Alkyl gallates showed elicitor activities on tobacco in both whole plants and cell suspensions. Methyl gallate (MG), ethyl gallate (EG) and n-propyl gallate (PG) infiltration into tobacco leaves induced hypersensitive reaction-like lesions and topical production of autofluorescent compounds revealed under UV light. When sprayed on tobacco plants at 5 mM, EG promoted upregulation of defence-related genes such as the antimicrobial PR1, {beta}-1,3-glucanase PR2, chitinase PR3 and osmotin PR5 target genes. Tobacco BY-2 cells challenged with EG underwent cell death in 48 h, significantly reduced in the presence of the protease inhibitor aprotinin. The three alkyl gallates all caused alkalinisation of the BY-2 extracellular medium, whereas gallic acid did not trigger any pH variation. Using EGTA or LaCl3, we showed that Ca2+ mobilisation occurred in BY-2 cells elicited with EG. Overall, our findings are the first evidence of alkyl gallate elicitor properties with early perception events on plasma membrane, potential hypersensitive reactions and PR-related downstream defence responses in tobacco.\\n\\nHighlights- Alkyl gallates elicited defence reactions in tobacco\\n- Alkyl gallates induced local biochemical changes in tobacco leaves\\n- Alkyl gallates caused modification of plasma membrane properties\\n- Ethyl gallate led to defence transcript accumulation and dose-dependent cell death associated with hypersensitive response\\n- Alkyl gallates are novel elicitor agents well-suited to crop protection schemes.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy numbers fluctuate over time due to stochastic cellular dynamics. Understanding mtDNA dynamics and the accumulation of mutations is vital for understanding mitochondrial-related diseases. Here, we use stochastic modelling to derive general results for the impact of cellular control on mtDNA populations, the cost to the cell of different mtDNA states, and the optimisation of therapeutic control of mtDNA populations. We provide theoretical evidence that an increasing mtDNA variance can increase the energetic cost of maintaining a tissue, that intermediate levels of heteroplasmy can be more detrimental than ho-moplasmy even for a dysfunctional mutant, that het-eroplasmy distribution (not mean alone) is crucial for the success of gene therapies, and that long-term rather than short intense gene therapies are more likely to beneficially impact mtDNA populations. New experiments validate our predictions on heteroplasmy dependence of therapeutic outcomes.",

To achieve whole-brain recording with the ability to detect both small synaptic potentials and action potentials, we developed a voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging technique based on a double-sided microscope that can image two sides of a nervous system simultaneously. We applied this system to the segmental ganglia of the medicinal leech. Double-sided VSD imaging enabled simultaneous recording of membrane potential events from almost all of the identifiable neurons. Using data obtained from double-sided VSD imaging we analyzed neuronal dynamics in both sensory processing and generation of behavior and constructed functional maps for identification of neurons contributing to these processes.",

    "abstract": "Meiosis is one of the most dramatic differentiation programs accompanied by a striking change in gene expression profiles, whereas a number of meiosis-specific transcripts are expressed untimely in mitotic cells. The entry of meiosis will be blocked as the accumulation of meiosis-specific mRNAs during the mitotic cell in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. A YTH domain containing protein Mmi1 was identified as a pivotal effector in a post-transcriptional event termed selective elimination of meiosis-specific mRNAs, Mmi1 can recognize and bind a class of meiosis-specific transcripts expressed inappropriately in mitotic cells, which contain a conservative motif called DSR as a mark to remove them in cooperation with nuclear exosomes. Here we report the 1.6 [A] resolution crystal structure of the YTH domain of Mmi1 binds to high-affinity RNA targets r(A1U2U3A4A5A6C7A8) containing DSR core motif. Our structure observations, supported by site-directed mutations of key residues illustrate the mechanism for specific recognition of DSR-RNA by Mmi1. Moreover, different from other YTH domain family proteins, Mmi1 YTH domain has a distinctive function although it has a similar fold as other ones.",

In the present study, we found that senkyunolide A (SenA) has neuroprotective effects in corticosterone (Cort)-induced depression cell model in PC12 cells. Firstly, we found that SenA protects Cort-induced cell injury in PC12 cells. In addition, SenA attenuates Cort-induced the reduction of phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activities, and the increase of p-PP2A, -syn and p--syn-Ser129 levels. Furthermore, PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) decreased, and PP2A activator D-erythro-Sphingosine (SPH) increased Cort-induced cell apoptosis. Importantly, we also found that the neuroprotective effects of SenA in Cort-induced cell injury via modulating -syn levels. Collectively, our results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of SenA in Cort-induced depression cell model via modulating PP2A activities and -syn levels, and bring a breakthrough to the anti-depression mechanisms for natural compound SenA.",

    "abstract": "The role that vitamin D plays in pulmonary function remains uncertain. Epidemiological studies reported mixed findings for the association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and pulmonary function. We conducted the largest cross-sectional meta-analysis of the 25(OH)D- pulmonary function association to date, based on nine European ancestry (EA) cohorts (n=22,838) and five African ancestry (AA) cohorts (n=4,290) in the CHARGE Consortium. Data were analyzed using linear models by cohort and ancestry. Effect modification by smoking status (current/former/never) was tested. Results were combined using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Mean (SD) serum 25(OH)D was 68 (29) nmol/L for EAs and 49 (21) nmol/L for AAs. For each 1 nmol/L higher 25(OH)D, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) was higher by 1.1 mL in EAs (95% CI: 0.9,1.3; P=2.5x10-21) and 1.8 mL (95% CI: 1.1,2.5; P=1.6x10-7) in Aas (Prace difference=0.06), and forced vital capacity (FVC) was higher by 1.3 mL in EAs (95% CI: 1.0,1.6; P=1.1x10-20) and 1.5 mL (95% CI: 0.8,2.3; P=1.2x10-4) in AAs (Prace difference=0.56). Among EAs, the 25(OH)D-FVC association was stronger in smokers: per 1nmol/L higher 25(OH)D, FVC was higher by 1.7 mL (95% CI: 1.1,2.3) for current smokers and 1.7 mL (95% CI: 1.2,2.1) for former smokers, compared to 0.8 mL (95% CI: 0.4,1.2) for never smokers. In summary, the 25(OH)D associations with FEV1 and FVC were positive in both ancestries. In EAs, a stronger association was observed for smokers compared to never smokers, which supports the importance of vitamin D in vulnerable populations.\\n\\nCohort FundingThis work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant number R21 HL125574 funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) (co-Principal Investigators [co-PIs]: DBH and PAC).

    "abstract": "The theory of trade-off suggest that limited resources should lead to trade-off in resource intensive traits such as immunity related and sexually selected traits in males. Alternatively, sexual exaggerations can also act as an honest indicator of underlying immunocompetence, leading to positive correlations between these traits. Several studies have addressed this question using experimental evolution. However, they have rarely used ecologically relevant pathogens and fitness measurement (e.g., measuring post-infection survivorship) to find correlations between sexual selection and immunity. Here we attempt to address this caveat by evolving populations of Drosophila melanogaster under differential sexual selection. After more than hundred generations, we infected virgin and mated males from each population with three pathogenic bacteria: Pseudomonas entomophila (Pe), Staphylococcus succinus (Ss) and Providentia rettgeri (Pr). Fitness was measured as either post-infection survivorship (Pe and Ss) or bacterial clearance ability (Pr). Contrary to expectations, sexual selection had no evolutionary effect on male fitness against any of the pathogens. Moreover, mating had a beneficial effect against Pe and Pr, but no effect against Ss, suggesting pathogen specific phenotypic correlations between mating and immunity. Following these results, we discuss the significance of using ecologically relevant pathogens and quantifying host fitness while studying sexual selection-immunity correlations.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive DNA sequences are subject to gene silencing in various animal species. Under specific circumstances repetitive DNA sequences can escape such silencing. For example, when exogenously added, extrachromosomal DNA sequences that are stably inherited in multicopy repetitive arrays in the nematode C. elegans are frequently silenced in the germline, whereas such silencing often does not occur in the soma. This indicates that somatic cells might utilize factors that prevent repetitive DNA silencing. Indeed, such \\\"anti-silencing\\\" factors have been revealed through genetic screens that identified mutant loci in which repetitive transgenic arrays are aberrantly silenced in the soma. We describe here a novel locus, pals-22 (for protein containing ALS2CR12 domain), required to prevent silencing of repetitive transgenes in neurons and other somatic tissue types. pals-22 deficiency also severely impacts animal vigor and confers phenotypes reminiscent of accelerated aging. We find that pals-22 is a member of a large family of divergent genes (39 members), defined by the presence of an ALS2CR12 domain. While gene family members are highly divergent, they show striking patterns of genomic clustering. The family expansion appears C. elegans-specific and has not occurred to the same extent in other nematode species. Previous transcriptome analysis has revealed that most of the pals genes are induced under stress conditions or upon infection by intracellular parasites. The transgene silencing phenotype observed upon loss of cytoplasmically localized PALS-22 protein depends on the biogenesis of small RNAs, since silencing is abolished in the RNAi defective mutant rde-4, suggesting that pals-22 might regulate RNAi dependent silencing in the cytoplasm of neurons and other tissues. We speculate that the pals gene family may be part of a species-specific cellular defense mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Behavioural assessments of shelter dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) typically comprise standardised test batteries conducted at one time point but test batteries have shown inconsistent predictive validity. Longitudinal behavioural assessments offer an alternative. We modelled longitudinal observational data on shelter dog behaviour using the framework of behavioural reaction norms, partitioning variance into personality (i.e. inter-individual differences in behaviour), plasticity (i.e. individual differences in behavioural change) and predictability (i.e. individual differences in residual intra-individual variation). We analysed data on 3,263 dogs interactions (N = 19,281) with unfamiliar people during their first month after arrival at the shelter. Accounting for personality, plasticity (linear and quadratic trends) and predictability improved the predictive accuracy of the analyses compared to models quantifying personality and/or plasticity only. While dogs were, on average, highly sociable with unfamiliar people and sociability increased over days since arrival, group averages were unrepresentative of all dogs and predictions made at the individual level entailed considerable uncertainty. Effects of demographic variables (e.g. age) on personality, plasticity and predictability were observed. Behavioural repeatability was higher one week after arrival compared to arrival day. Our results highlight the value of longitudinal assessments on shelter dogs and identify measures that could improve the predictive validity of behavioural assessments in shelters.",

    "abstract": "Resolving the correct structure and succession of highly similar sequence stretches is one of the main open problems in genome assembly. For non haploid genomes this includes determining the sequences of the different haplotypes. For all but the smallest genomes it also involves separating different repeat instances. In this paper we discuss methods for resolving such problems in third generation long reads by classifying alignments between long reads according to whether they represent true or false read overlaps. The main problem in this context is the high error rate found in such reads, which greatly exceeds the amount of difference between the similar regions we want to separate. Our methods can separate read classes stemming from regions with as little as 1% difference.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWModern infectious disease outbreak surveillance produces continuous streams of sequence data which require phylogenetic analysis as data arrives. Current software packages for Bayesian phy-logenetic inference are unable to quickly incorporate new sequences as they become available, making them less useful for dynamically unfolding evolutionary stories. This limitation can be addressed by applying a class of Bayesian statistical inference algorithms called sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to conduct online inference, wherein new data can be continuously incorporated to update the estimate of the posterior probability distribution. In this paper we describe and evaluate several different online phylogenetic sequential Monte Carlo (OPSMC) algorithms. We show that proposing new phylogenies with a density similar to the Bayesian prior suffers from poor performance, and we develop  guided proposals that better match the proposal density to the posterior. Furthermore, we show that the simplest guided proposals can exhibit pathological behavior in some situations, leading to poor results, and that the situation can be resolved by heating the proposal density. The results demonstrate that relative to the widely-used MCMC-based algorithm implemented in MrBayes, the total time required to compute a series of phylogenetic posteriors as sequences arrive can be significantly reduced by the use of OPSMC, without incurring a significant loss in accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Soil surface communities dominated by mosses, lichens and cyanobacteria (biocrusts) cover most of the soil surface between vegetation patches in drylands worldwide, and are known to affect soil wetting and drying after rainfall events. While ongoing climate change is already warming and changing rainfall patterns of drylands in many regions, little is known on how these changes may affect the hydrological behaviour of biocrust-covered soils. We used eight years of continuous soil moisture and rainfall data from a climate change experiment in central Spain to explore how biocrusts modify soil water gains and losses after rainfall events under simulated changes in temperature (2.5{o}C warming) and rainfall (33% reduction). Both rainfall amount and biocrust cover increased soil water gains after rainfall events, whereas experimental warming, rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture decreased them. Initial moisture, maximum temperature and biocrust cover, by means of enhancing potential evapotranspiration or soil darkening, increased the drying rates and enhanced the exponential behaviour of the drying events. Meanwhile, the warming treatment reduced the exponential behaviour of these events. The effects of climate change treatments on soil water gains and losses changed through time, with important differences between the first two years of the experiment and after five years since its setup. These effects were mainly driven by the important reductions in biocrust cover and diversity observed under warming. Our results highlight the importance of long term studies to understand soil moisture responses to ongoing climate change in drylands.",

    "abstract": "Sociobiology has revolutionized our understanding of interactions between organisms. Interactions may present a social dilemma where the interests of individual actors do not align with those of the group as a whole. Viewed through a sociobiological lens, nearly all interactions can be described in terms of their costs and benefits and a number of them then resemble a social dilemma. Numerous experimental systems, from bacteria to mammals, have been proposed as models for studying such dilemmas. Here we make use of the external immune system of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, to investigate how the experimental duration can affect whether the external secretion comprises a social dilemma or not. Some beetles (secretors) produce a costly quinone-rich external secretion that inhibits microbial growth in the surrounding environment, providing the secretors with direct personal benefits. However, since the antimicrobial secretion acts in the environment of the beetle it is potentially also advantageous to other beetles (non-secretors), who avoid the cost of producing the secretion. We test experimentally if the secretion qualifies as a public good. We find that in the short term, costly quinone secretion can be interpreted as a public good presenting a social dilemma where the presence of secretors increases the fitness of the group. In the long run, the benefit to the group of having more secretors vanishes and actually becomes detrimental to the group. Therefore, in such semi-natural environmental conditions, it turns out that qualifying a trait as social can be a matter of timing.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of proteostasis is critical for organismal health. Here we describe a novel pathway that promotes proteostasis, identified through the analysis of C. elegans genes upregulated by intracellular infection. We named this distinct transcriptional signature the Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR), and it includes upregulation of several predicted ubiquitin ligase complex components such as the cullin cul-6. Through a forward genetic screen we found pals-22, a gene of previously unknown function, to be a repressor of the cul-6/Cullin gene and other IPR gene expression. Interestingly, pals-22 mutants have increased thermotolerance and reduced levels of stress-induced polyglutamine aggregates, likely due to upregulated IPR expression. We found the enhanced stress resistance of pals-22 mutants to be dependent on cul-6, suggesting that pals-22 mutants have increased activity of a CUL-6/Cullin-containing ubiquitin ligase complex. pals-22 mutant phenotypes are distinct from the well-studied heat shock and insulin signaling pathways, indicating that the IPR is a novel pathway that protects animals from proteotoxic stress.",

    "abstract": "The genomes of ancient humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans contain many alleles that influence disease risks. Using genotypes at 3180 disease-associated loci, we estimated the disease burden of 147 ancient genomes. After correcting for missing data, genetic risk scores were generated for nine disease categories and the set of all combined diseases. These genetic risk scores were used to examine the effects of different types of subsistence, geography, and sample age on the number of risk alleles in each ancient genome. On a broad scale, hereditary disease risks are similar for ancient hominins and modern-day humans, and the GRS percentiles of ancient individuals span the full range of what is observed in present day individuals. In addition, there is evidence that ancient pastoralists may have had healthier genomes than hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists. We also observed a temporal trend whereby genomes from the recent past are more likely to be healthier than genomes from the deep past. This calls into question the idea that modern lifestyles have caused genetic load to increase over time. Focusing on individual genomes, we find that the overall genomic health of the Altai Neandertal is worse than 97% of present day humans and that Otzi the Tyrolean Iceman had a genetic predisposition to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular diseases. As demonstrated by this work, ancient genomes afford us new opportunities to diagnose past human health, which has previously been limited by the quality and completeness of remains.",

    "abstract": "With few exceptions, the marked advances in knowledge about the genetic basis for schizophrenia have not converged on findings that can be confidently used for precise experimental modeling. Applying knowledge of the cellular taxonomy of the brain from single-cell RNA-sequencing, we evaluated whether the genomic loci implicated in schizophrenia map onto specific brain cell types. The common variant genomic results consistently mapped to pyramidal cells, medium spiny neurons, and certain interneurons but far less consistently to embryonic, progenitor, or glial cells. These enrichments were due to distinct sets of genes specifically expressed in each of these cell types. Many of the diverse gene sets associated with schizophrenia (including antipsychotic targets) implicate the same brain cell types. Our results provide a parsimonious explanation: the common-variant genetic results for schizophrenia point at a limited set of neurons, and the gene sets point to the same cells. While some of the genetic risk is associated with GABAergic interneurons, this risk largely does not overlap with that from projecting cells.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have analyzed large scale data sets of gene expression to identify genes associated with inter-individual variation in phenotypes ranging from cancer sub-types to drug sensitivity, promising new avenues of research in personalized medicine. However, gene expression data alone is limited in its ability to reveal cis-regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypic differences. In this study, we develop a new probabilistic model, called pGENMi, that integrates multi-omics data to investigate the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying inter-individual variation of a specific phenotype - that of cell line response to cytotoxic treatment. In particular, pGENMi simultaneously analyzes genotype, DNA methylation, gene expression and transcription factor (TF)-DNA binding data, along with phenotypic measurements, to identify TFs regulating the phenotype. It does so by combining statistical information about expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and expression-correlated methylation marks (eQTMs) located within TF binding sites, as well as observed correlations between gene expression and phenotype variation. Application of pGENMi to data from a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines treated with 24 drugs, in conjunction with ENCODE TF ChIP data, yielded a number of known as well as novel TF-drug associations. Experimental validations by TF knock-down confirmed 41% of the predicted and tested associations, compared to a 12% confirmation rate of tested non-associations (controls). Extensive literature survey also corroborated 62% of the predicted associations above a stringent threshold. Moreover, associations predicted only when combining eQTL and eQTM data showed higher precision compared to an eQTL-only or eQTM-only analysis with the same method, further demonstrating the value of multi-omic integrative analysis.",

Mechanisms mediating perceptual stability have primarily been examined in motion regions of the dorsal visual pathway. Here we examined whether motion responses in human scene regions are encoded in eye- or world centered reference frames. We recorded brain responses in human participants using fMRI while they performed a well-controlled visual pursuit paradigm previously used to examine dorsal motion regions. In addition, we examined effects of content by using either natural scenes or their Fourier scrambles. We found that parahippocampal place area (PPA) responded to motion only in world- but not in eye-centered coordinates, regardless of scene content. The occipital place area (OPA) responded to both, objective and retinal motion equally, and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) had no motion responses but responded to pursuit. Only PPAs objective motion responses were higher during scenes than scrambled images, although there was a similar trend in OPA. These results indicate a special role of PPA in representing its content in real-world coordinates. Our results question a strict subdivision of dorsal \\\"what\\\" and ventral \\\"where\\\" streams, and suggest a role of PPA in contributing to perceptual stability.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms that link diet and body weight are not fully understood. A diet high in fat often leads to obesity, and this in part is the consequence of diet-induced injury to specific hypothalamic nuclei. It has been suggested that a diet high in fat leads to cell loss in the lateral hypothalamus, which contains specific populations of neurones that are essential for regulating energy homoeostasis; however, we do not know which cell types are affected by the diet. We studied the possibility that high-fat diet leads to a reduction in orexin/hypocretin (O/H) and/or melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) immunoreactivity in the lateral hypothalamus. We quantified immuno-labelled O/H and MCH cells in brain sections of mice fed a diet high in fat for up to 12 weeks starting at 4 weeks of age and found that this diet did not modify the number of O/H- or MCH-immunoreactive neurones. By contrast, there were fewer O/H- (but not MCH-) immunoreactive cells in geneticallyobese db/db mice compared to wild-type mice. Non-obese, heterozygous db/+ mice also had fewer O/H-immunoreactive cells. Differences in the number of O/H-immunoreactive cells were only a function of the db genotype but not of diet or body weight. Our findings show that the lateral hypothalamus is affected differently in genetic and in diet-induced obesity, and support the idea that hypothalamic neurones involved in energy balance regulation are not equally sensitive to the effects of diet.",

The hypothalamus and mesolimbic dopamine system are key mediators of these behaviors, yet regulation of appetitive and consummatory behaviors outside of these regions is not well understood. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is implicated in feeding and reward behavior, but the specific neural players and circuit mechanisms that positively regulate these behaviors remain unclear. Here, we define the neuronal mechanisms by which the CeA promotes consumption of food. We show, using in vivo activity manipulations and Ca2+ imaging, that CeA GABAergic neurons expressing the serotonin receptor 2a (Htr2a) modulate food consumption in multiple contexts, promote positive reinforcement and are active in vivo during eating. We demonstrate using electrophysiology, anatomical tracing methods and in vivo optogenetics that both intra-CeA and long-range circuit mechanisms underlie these functional effects. Finally, we show that CeAHtr2a neurons are poised to regulate food consumption through inputs from feeding-relevant brain regions. Our study highlights a mechanism by which defined CeA neural circuits positively regulate food consumption.",

These systems have globally attracting steady states when unforced, so they might have been considered \\\"uninteresting\\\" from a dynamical standpoint. However, when subject to a periodic excitation, strange attractors arise via a period-doubling cascade. Quantitative analyses of the corresponding discrete chaotic trajectories are conducted numerically by computing largest Lyapunov exponents, power spectra, and autocorrelation functions. To gain insight into the geometry of the strange attractors, the phase portraits of the corresponding iterated maps are interpreted as scatter plots for which marginal distributions are additionally evaluated. The lack of entrainment to external oscillations, in even the simplest biochemical networks, represents a level of additional complexity in molecular biology, which has previously been insufficiently recognized but is plausibly biologically important.",

    "abstract": "Despite prolonged interest in comparing brain size and behavioral proxies of  intelligence across taxa, the adaptive and cognitive significance of brain size variation remains elusive. Central to this problem is the continued focus on hominid cognition as a benchmark, and the assumption that behavioral complexity has a simple relationship with brain size. Although comparative studies of brain size have been criticized for not reflecting how evolution actually operates, and for producing spurious, inconsistent results, the causes of these limitations have received little discussion. We show how these issues arise from implicit assumptions about what brain size measures and how it correlates with behavioral and cognitive traits. We explore how inconsistencies can arise through heterogeneity in evolutionary trajectories and selection pressures on neuroanatomy or neurophysiology across taxa. We examine how interference from ecological and life history variables complicates interpretations of brain-behavior correlations, and point out how this problem is exacerbated by the limitations of brain and cognitive measures. These considerations, and the diversity of brain morphologies and behavioral capacities, suggest that comparative brain-behavior research can make greater progress by focusing on specific neuroanatomical and behavioral traits within relevant ecological and evolutionary contexts. We suggest that a synergistic combination of the  bottom up approach of classical neuroethology and the  top down approach of comparative biology/psychology within closely related but behaviorally diverse clades can limit the effects of heterogeneity, interference, and noise. We argue this shift away from broad-scale analyses of superficial phenotypes will provide deeper, more robust insights into brain evolution.",

    "abstract": "We are moving into the age of  Big Data in biomedical research and bioinformatics. This trend could be encapsulated in this simple formula: D = S x F, where the volume of data generated (D) increases in both dimensions: the number of samples (S) and the number of sample features (F). Frequently, a typical bioinformatics problem (e.g. classification) includes redundant and irrelevant features that can result, in the worst-case scenario, in false positive results. Then, Feature Selection (FS) constitutes an enormous challenge. Despite the number and diversity of algorithms available, the proper choice of an approach for facing a specific problem often falls in a  grey zone. In this study, we select a subset of FS methods to develop an efficient workflow and an R package for bioinformatics machine learning problems. We cover relevant issues concerning FS, ranging from domains problems to algorithm solutions and computational tools. Finally, we use seven different proteomics and gene expression datasets to evaluate the workflow and guide the FS process.",

    "abstract": "In clinical trials, individuals are matched for demographic criteria, paired, and then randomly assigned to treatment and control groups to determine a drugs efficacy. The successful completion of pilot trials is a prerequisite to larger and more expensive Phase III trials. One of the chief causes for the irreproducibility of results across pilot to Phase III trials is population stratification bias caused by the uneven distribution of ancestries in the treatment and control groups. Pair Matcher (PaM) addresses stratification bias by optimising pairing assignments a priori- and\\\\or posteriori to the trial using both genetic and demographic criteria. Using simulated and real datasets, we show that PaM identifies ideal and near-ideal pairs that are more genetically homogeneous than those identified based on racial criteria or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) alone. Homogenising the treatment (or case) and control groups can be expected to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of the study. PaMs ability to infer the ancestry of the participants further allows identifying subgroup of responders and developing a precision medicine approach to treatment. PaM is simple to execute, fast, and can be used for clinical trials and association studies. PaM is freely available via R scripts and a web interface.",

    "abstract": "The recent findings confirm that bacteria communicate each other through chemical and electrical signals. Bacteria use chemical signaling molecules which are called as quorum sensing molecules(QSMs) or autoinducers. Moreover, the ion channels in bacteria conduct a long-range electrical signaling within biofilm communities through propagated waves of potassium ions and biofilms attracts other bacterial species too. Both communication process are used by bacteria to make their own survival strategies. In this article, we model this bacterial communication mechanism by complex Ginzburg- Landau equation and discuss the formation of patterns depending on kinematic viscosity associated with internal noise. Again, the potassium wave propagation is described by the non-linear Schrodinger equation in a dissipative environment. By adding perturbation to non-linear Schrodinger equation one arrives at Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. In this paper we emphasize that at the cellular level(bacteria) we use Complex Ginzburg - Landau equation as a perturbed Nonlinear Schrodinger equation to understand the bacterial communication as well as pattern formation in Biofilms for certain range of kinematic viscosity which can be tested in laboratory experiment. Here, the perturbation is due to the existence of non thermal fluctuations associated to the finite size of the bacteria. It sheds new light on the relevance of quantum formalism in understanding the cell to cell communication.",

We present a method, iSAFE, that uses a statistic derived solely from population genetics signals to pinpoint the favored mutation even when the signature of selection extends to 5Mbp. iSAFE was tested extensively on simulated data and in human populations from the 1000 Genomes Project, at 22 loci with previously characterized selective sweeps. For 14 of the 22 loci, iSAFE ranked the previously characterized candidate mutation among the 13 highest scoring (out of [~] 21, 000 variants). Three loci did not show a strong signal. For the remaining loci, iSAFE identified previously unreported mutations as being favored. In these regions, all of which involve pigmentation related genes, iSAFE identified identical selected mutations in multiple non-African populations suggesting an out-of-Africa onset of selection.

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100034). Despite being able to conclusively demonstrate local adaptation, we are still often unable to objectively determine the climatic drivers of local adaptation. Given the rapid rate of global change, understanding the climatic drivers of local adaptation is vital. Not only will this tell us which climate axes matter most to population fitness, but such knowledge is critical to inform management strategies such as translocation and targeted gene flow. While simple assessments of geographic trait variation are useful, geographic variation (and its associations with environment) may represent plastic, rather than evolved, differences. Additionally, the vast number of trait-environment combinations makes it difficult to determine which aspects of the environment populations adapt to. Here we argue that by incorporating a measure of landscape connectivity as a proxy for gene flow, we can differentiate between trait-environment relationships underpinned by genetic differences versus those that reflect phenotypic plasticity. By doing so, we can rapidly shorten the list of trait-environment combinations that may be of adaptive significance. We demonstrate how this reasoning can be applied using data on geographic trait variation in a lizard species from Australia's Wet Tropics rainforest. Our analysis reveals an overwhelming signal of local adaptation for the traits and environmental variables we investigated. Our analysis also allows us to rank environmental variables by the degree to which they appear to be driving local adaptation. Although encouraging, methodological issues remain: we point to these issue in the hope that the community can rapidly hone the methods we sketch here. The promise is a rapid and general approach to identifying the environmental drivers of local adaptation.",

In this paper, we develop expressions for the distribution and expectation of the number of p-th cousins in a sample from a population of size N under two diploid Wright-Fisher models. We also develop simple asymptotic expressions for large values of N. For example, the expected proportion of individuals with at least one p-th cousin in a sample of K individuals, for a diploid dioecious Wright-Fisher model, is approximately 1 - e-(22p-1)K/N. Our results show that a substantial fraction of individuals in the sample will have at least a second cousin if the sampling fraction (K/N) is on the order of 10-2. This confirms that, for large cohort samples, relatedness among individuals cannot easily be ignored.",

    "abstract": "Sexual isolation, a reproductive barrier, can prevent interbreeding between diverging populations or species. Sexual isolation can have a clear genetic basis; however, it may also result from learned mate preferences that form via sexual imprinting. Here, we demonstrate that two sympatric species of mice--the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and its sister species, the cotton mouse (P. gossypinus)--hybridize only rarely in the wild despite co-occurrence in the same habitat and lack of any measurable intrinsic postzygotic barriers in laboratory crosses. We present evidence that strong conspecific mating preferences in each species result in significant sexual isolation. We find that these preferences are learned in at least one species: P. gossypinus sexually imprints on its parents, but in P. leucopus, additional factors influence mating preferences. Our study demonstrates that sexual imprinting contributes to reproductive isolation that reduces hybridization between otherwise interfertile species, supporting the role for learning in mammalian speciation.",

Exceptions to this universal plastid genome architecture are very few and include the dinoflagellates where genes are located on DNA minicircles. Here we report on the highly deviant chloroplast genome of Cladophorales green algae, which is entirely fragmented into hairpin plasmids. Short and long read high-throughput sequencing of DNA and RNA demonstrated that the chloroplast genes of Boodlea composita are encoded on 1-7 kb DNA contigs with an exceptionally high GC-content, each containing a long inverted repeat with one or two protein-coding genes and conserved non-coding regions putatively involved in replication and/or expression. We propose that these contigs correspond to linear single-stranded DNA molecules that fold onto themselves to form hairpin plasmids. The Boodlea chloroplast genes are highly divergent from their corresponding orthologs. The origin of this highly deviant chloroplast genome likely occurred before the emergence of the Cladophorales, and coincided with an elevated transfer of chloroplast genes to the nucleus. A chloroplast genome that is composed only of linear DNA molecules is unprecedented among eukaryotes and highlights unexpected variation in the plastid genome architecture.",

MMF treatment results in lymphopenia via the depletion of purines required for DNA synthesis. While the primary effect of MMF treatment is thought to be via the depletion of lymphocytes, MMF has also been associated with innate immune defects, including neutropenia and neutrophil dysplasia. Here, we address the question of MMF specific effects on neutrophils in an in vivo model of neutrophil inflammation in zebrafish. We find that, following tissue injury, MMF increases resolution of neutrophilic inflammation via increased neutrophil apoptosis. Critically, we identify that the effect of MMF is distinct from DNA synthesis inhibition by using the competitive inhibitor of purine nucleotide incorporation, azathioprine. Therefore, we propose that increased neutrophil cell death during inflammatory insult may play a role in neutrophil defects associated with MMF treatment.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between microbes are central to the dynamics of microbial communities. Understanding these interactions is essential for the characterization of communities, yet challenging to accomplish in practice. There are limited available tools for characterizing diffusion-mediated, contact-independent microbial interactions. A practical and widely implemented technique in such characterization involves the simultaneous co-culture of distinct bacterial species and subsequent analysis of relative abundance in the total population. However, distinguishing between species can be logistically challenging. In this paper, we present a low-cost, vertical membrane, co-culture plate to quantify contact-independent interactions between distinct bacterial populations in co-culture via real-time optical density measurements. These measurements can be used to facilitate the analysis of the interaction between microbes that are physically separated by a semipermeable membrane yet able to exchange diffusible molecules. We show that diffusion across the membrane occurs at a sufficient rate to enable effective interaction between physically separate cultures. Two bacterial species commonly found in the cystic fibrotic lung, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia, were co-cultured to demonstrate how this plate may be implemented to study microbial interactions. We have demonstrated that this novel co-culture device is able to reliably generate real-time measurements of optical density data that can be used to characterize interactions between microbial species.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence shows that mutations in several driver genes can cause aberrant methylation patterns, a hallmark of cancer. In light of these findings, we hypothesized that the landscapes of tumor genomes and epigenomes are tightly interconnected. We measured this relationship using principal component analyses and methylation-mutation associations applied at the nucleotide level and with respect to genome-wide trends. We found a few mutated driver genes were associated with genome-wide patterns of aberrant hypomethylation or CpG island hypermethylation in specific cancer types. We identified associations between 737 mutated driver genes and site-specific methylation changes. Moreover, using these mutation-methylation associations, we were able to distinguish between two uterine and two thyroid cancer subtypes. The driver gene mutation-associated methylation differences between the thyroid cancer subtypes were linked to differential gene expression in JAK-STAT signaling, NADPH oxidation, and other cancer-related pathways. These results establish that driver-gene mutations are associated with methylation alterations capable of shaping regulatory network functions. In addition, the methodology presented here can be used to subdivide tumors into more homogeneous subsets corresponding to their underlying molecular characteristics, which could improve treatment efficacy.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMutations that alter the function of driver genes by changing DNA nucleotides have been recognized as a key player in cancer progression. Recent evidence showed that DNA methylation, a molecular signature that is used for controlling gene expression and that consists of cytosine residues with attached methyl groups in the context of CG dinucleotides, is also highly dysregulated in cancer and contributes to carcinogenesis. However, whether those methylation alterations correspond to mutated driver genes in cancer remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed 4,302 tumors from 18 cancer types and demonstrated that driver gene mutations are inherently connected with the aberrant DNA methylation landscape in cancer. We showed that those driver gene-associated methylation patterns can classify heterogeneous tumors in a cancer type into homogeneous subtypes and have the potential to influence the genes that contribute to tumor growth. This finding could help us to better understand the fundamental connection between driver gene mutations and DNA methylation alterations in cancer and to further improve the cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStaphylococcus aureus is a frequent cause of both infections globally. Colonization with the organism is known to increase the risk of developing infections and occurs in roughly one third of the general population. While many factors influence colonization, it has been demonstrated other members of the microbiome influence colonization with S. aureus. Here, we assessed the nasal and oropharyngeal microbiomes of healthy participants in relation to S. aureus colonization in a cross-sectional study using 16s rRNA sequencing of the v1-v3 region. As livestock workers have also been shown to be at an increased risk of carriage, we have also assessed microbiota differences in colonization status in a population of livestock workers.\\n\\nResultsIn both the nares and oropharynx, there were no microbiota differentially abundant between colonized and non-colonized persons. However, there was a significant difference in the beta diversity (Bray-Curtis distances) between carriers and non-carriers (P=0.002). When considering carriage stratified by livestock exposure, there were a number of differences. Most notably, colonized livestock workers had significantly more Porphyomonas (2-fold change = -8.54, P = 0.03) than the non-colonized livestock workers.\\n\\nConclusionsS. aureus is a frequent colonizer of the human upper respiratory tract, including the nares and oropharynx and causes a wide range of infections. Livestock workers are at increased risk for carriage. Interventions such as improving oral hygiene may lead to decreased S. aureus carriage by reducing other bacterial species such as Porphyomonas. Larger, longitudinal studies are needed to better explore what microorganisms may be associated with S. aureus colonization.",

    "abstract": "Little information exists on the microbiomes of livestock workers. A cross-sectional, epidemiological study was conducted enrolling 59 participants (26 of which had livestock contact) in Iowa. Participants were enrolled in one of four ways: from an existing prospective cohort study (n=38), from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources Animal Feeding Operations database (n=17), through Iowa county fairs (n=3), and through snowball sampling (n=1). We collected two sets of swabs from the nares and oropharynx of each participant. The first set of swabs was used to assess the microbiome via 16s rRNA sequencing and the second was used to culture S. aureus. We observed livestock workers to have greater diversity in their microbiomes compared to those with no livestock contact. In the nares, there were 26 operational taxonomic units found to be different between livestock workers and non-livestock workers with the greatest difference seen with Streptococcus and Proteobacteria. In the oropharynx, livestock workers with swine exposure were more likely to carry several pathogenic organisms. The results of this study are the first to characterize the livestock worker nasal and oropharyngeal microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "Methods177 adults and 86 minors comprising 95 family units were enrolled from two counties in Iowa and followed up for 52 weeks. Random effects logistic regression was used to test the effect of different risk factors on the probability of an individual falling into a different S. aureus colonization categories. Additionally, the frequency of S. aureus colonization events and familial transmission events were calculated.\\n\\nResultsThe number of positive environmental sites within a participants house was associated with being a persistent carrier compared to being a non-carrier or intermittent carrier. Age, sharing bath towels, and the number of positive environmental sites within a participants house were associated with being a persistent or intermittent carrier. Colonization events per year were 3.95 for adults and 3.04 for minors. Duration of colonization was longest for persistent carriers (92.3 days for adults and 97.8 days for minors), and intermittent carriers had the most colonization events.\\n\\nConclusionsThe average duration of colonization was significantly different when comparing intermittent carriers and non-carriers. We have also established estimates of the duration of colonization and the frequency of transmission events among family units in a non-healthcare population.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe 2015-2017 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas has driven efforts to strengthen surveillance systems and to develop interventions, testing, and travel recommendations. In the continental U.S. and Hawaii, where limited transmission has been observed, detecting local transmission is a key public health objective. We assessed the effectiveness of three general surveillance strategies for this situation: testing all pregnant women twice during pregnancy, testing blood donations, and testing symptomatic people who seek medical care in an emergency department (ED).\\n\\nMethodsWe developed a simulation model for each surveillance strategy and simulated different transmission scenarios with varying population sizes and infection rates. We then calculated the probability of detecting transmission, the number of tests needed, and the number of false positive test results.\\n\\nResultsThe probability of detecting ZIKV transmission was highest for testing ED patients with Zika symptoms, followed by pregnant women and blood donors, in that order. The magnitude of the difference in probability of detection between strategies depended on the incidence of infection. Testing ED patients required fewer tests and resulted in fewer false positives than surveillance among pregnant women. The optimal strategy identified was to test ED patients with at least two Zika virus disease symptoms. This case definition resulted in a high probability of detection with relatively few tests and false positives.\\n\\nDiscussionIn the continental U.S. and Hawaii, where local ZIKV transmission is rare, optimizing the probability of detecting infections while minimizing resource usage is particularly important. Local surveillance strategies will be influenced by existing public health system infrastructure, but should also consider the effectiveness of different approaches. This analysis demonstrated differences across strategies and indicated that testing symptomatic ED patients is generally a more efficient strategy for detecting transmission than routine testing of pregnant women or blood donors.",

    "abstract": "The visualization of endogenous proteins in living cells is a major challenge. A fundamental requirement for spatiotemporally precise imaging is a minimal disturbance of protein function at high signal-to-background ratio. Current approaches for visualization of native proteins in living cells are limited by dark emitting, bulky fluorescent proteins and uncontrollable expression levels. Here, we demonstrate the labeling of endogenous proteins using nanobodies with site-specifically engineered bright organic fluorophores, named fluorobodies. Their fast and fine-tuned intracellular transfer by microfluidic cell squeezing allowed for low background, low toxicity, and high-throughput. Multiplexed imaging of distinct cellular structures was facilitated by specific protein targeting, culminating in live-cell super-resolution imaging of protein networks. The high-throughput delivery of engineered nanobodies will open new avenues in visualizing native cellular structures with unprecedented accuracy in cell-based screens.",

    "abstract": "Cnidarian nervous systems are traditionally described as diffuse nerve nets lacking true organization. However, there are examples of stereotypical structure in the nerve nets of multiple cnidarian species that suggest nerve nets are organized. We previously demonstrated that the NvashA target gene NvLWamide-like is expressed in a small subset of the Nematostella nerve net and speculated that observing a few neurons within the developing nerve net would provide a better indication of potential stereotypy. Here we document NvLWamide-like expression more systematically. NvLWamide-like is initially expressed in the typical neurogenic salt and pepper pattern within the ectoderm at the gastrula stage, and expression expands to include endodermal salt and pepper expression at the planula larval stage. Expression persists in both ectoderm and endoderm in adults. We generated an NvLWamide-like::mCherry transgenic reporter line to visualize the neural architecture. NvLWamide-like is expressed in six neural subtypes identifiable by neural morphology and location. Upon completing development the numbers of neurons in each neural subtype are minimally variable between animals and the projection patterns of each subtype are consistent. Between the juvenile polyp and adult stages the number of neurons for each subtype increases. We conclude that cnidarian nerve nets are organized, develop in a stereotyped fashion, and that one aspect of generating the adult nervous system is to modify the juvenile nervous system by increasing neural number proportionally with size.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes are man-sized vesicles shed by all cells, including cancer cells. Exosomes can serve as novel liquid biopsies for diagnosis of cancer with potential prognostic value. The exact mechanism/s associated with sorting or enrichment of cellular components into exosomes are still largely unknown. We reported Glypican-1 (GPC1) on the surface of cancer exosomes and provided evidence for the enrichment of GPC1 in exosomes from patients with pancreatic cancer1. Several different laboratories have validated this novel conceptual advance and reproduced the original experiments using multiple antibodies from different sources. These include anti-GPC1 antibodies from ThermoFisher (PA5-28055 and PA-5-24972)1,2, Sigma (SAB270028), Abnova (MAB8351, monoclonal antibodies clone E9E)3, EMD Millipore (MAB2600-monoclonal antibodies)4, SantaCruz5, and R&D Systems (BAF4519)2. This report complements such independent findings and report on the specific detection of Glypican-1 on the exosomes derived from the serum of pancreas cancer patients using multiple antibodies. Additionally, the specificity of the antibodies to GPC1 was determined by western blot and Protein Simple analyses of pancreatic cancer cells and their exosomes. Interestingly, our results highlight a specific enrichment of high molecular weight GPC1 on exosomes, potentially contributed by heparan sulfate and other glycosylation modifications.",
