    "abstract": "To understand how genomic heterogeneity of glioblastoma (GBM) contributes to the poor response to therapy, which is characteristic of this disease, we performed DNA and RNA sequencing on GBM tumor samples and the neurospheres and orthotopic xenograft models derived from them. We used the resulting data set to show that somatic driver alterations including single nucleotide variants, focal DNA alterations, and oncogene amplification in extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) elements were in majority propagated from tumor to model systems. In several instances, ecDNAs and chromosomal alterations demonstrated divergent inheritance patterns and clonal selection dynamics during cell culture and xenografting. Longitudinal patient tumor profiling showed that oncogenic ecDNAs are frequently retained after disease recurrence. Our analysis shows that extrachromosomal elements increase the genomic heterogeneity during tumor evolution of glioblastoma, independent of chromosomal DNA alterations.",

    "abstract": "The history of maize has been characterized by major demographic events including changes in population size associated with domestication and range expansion as well as gene flow with wild relatives. The interplay between demographic history and selection has shaped diversity across maize populations and genomes. Here, we investigate these processes based on high-depth resequencing data from 31 maize landraces spanning the pre-Columbian distribution of maize as well as four wild progenitor individuals (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) from the Balsas River Valley in Mexico. Genome-wide demographic analyses reveal that maize domestication and spread resulted in pronounced declines in effective population size due to both a protracted bottleneck and serial founder effects, while, concurrently, parviglumis experienced population growth. The cost of maize domestication and spread was an increase in deleterious alleles in the domesticate relative to its wild progenitor. This cost is particularly pronounced in Andean maize, which appears to have experienced a more dramatic founder event when compared to other maize populations. Introgression from the wild teosinte Zea mays ssp. mexicana into maize in the highlands of Mexico and Guatemala is found found to decrease the prevalence of deleterious alleles, likely due to the higher long-term effective population size of wild maize. These findings underscore the strong interaction between historical demography and the efficiency of selection species- and genome-wide and suggest domesticated species with well-characterized histories may be particularly useful for understanding this interplay.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCytokines are critical to human disease and are attractive therapeutic targets given their widespread influence on gene regulation and transcription. Defining the downstream regulatory mechanisms influenced by cytokines is central to defining drug and disease mechanisms. One promising strategy is to use interactions between expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and cytokine levels to define target genes and mechanisms.\\n\\nResultsIn a clinical trial for anti-IL-6 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus we measured interferon (IFN) status, anti-IL-6 drug exposure and genome-wide gene expression at three time points (379 samples from 157 individuals). First, we show that repeat transcriptomic measurements increases the number of cis eQTLs identified compared to using a single time point by 64%. Then, after identifying 4,818 cis-eQTLs, we observed a statistically significant enrichment of in vivo eQTL interactions with IFN status (p<0.001 by permutation) and anti-IL-6 drug exposure (p<0.001). We observed 210 and 72 interactions for IFN and anti-IL-6 respectively (FDR<20%). Anti-IL-6 interactions have not yet been described while 99 of the IFN interactions are novel. Finally, we found transcription factor binding motifs interrupted by eQTL interaction SNPs, pointing to key regulatory mediators of these environmental stimuli and therefore potential therapeutic targets for autoimmune diseases. In particular, genes with IFN interactions are enriched for ISRE binding site motifs, while those with anti-IL-6 interactions are enriched for IRF4 motifs.\\n\\nConclusionThis study highlights the potential to exploit clinical trial data to discover in vivo eQTL interactions with therapeutically relevant environmental variables.",

    "abstract": "Lateral gene transfers between ancient species contain information about the relative timing of species diversification. Specifically, the ancestors of a donor species must have existed before the descendants of the recipient species. Hence, the detection of a transfer event can be translated into a time constraint between nodes of a phylogeny if the donor and recipient can be identified. When a set of transfers is detected by interpreting the phylogenetic discordance between gene trees and a species tree, the set of all deduced time constraints can be used to rank the species tree, i.e. order totally its internal nodes. Unfortunately lateral gene transfer detection is challenging and current methods produce a significant proportion of false positives. As a result, often, no ranking of the species tree is compatible with the full set of time constraints deduced from predicted transfers. Here we propose a method, implemented in a software called MaxTiC (Maximum Time Consistency), which takes as input a species tree and a series of (possibly inconsistent) time constraints between its internal nodes, weighted by confidence scores. MaxTiC outputs a ranked species tree compatible with a subset of constraints with maximum cumulated confidence score. We extensively test the method on simulated datasets, under a wide range of conditions that we compare to measures on biological datasets. In most conditions the obtained ranked tree is very close to the real one, confirming the potential of dating the history of life with transfers by maximizing time consistency. MaxTiC is freely available, distributed along with a documentation and several examples: https://github.com/ssolo/ALE/tree/master/maxtic.",

    "abstract": "The scholars comprising journal editorial boards play a critical role in defining the trajectory of knowledge in their field. Nevertheless, studies of editorial board composition remain rare, especially those focusing on journals publishing research in the increasingly globalized fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Using metrics for quantifying the diversity of ecological communities, we quantified international representation on the 1985-2014 editorial boards of twenty-four environmental biology journals. Over the course of three decades there were 3831 unique scientists based in 70 countries that served as editors. The size of the editorial community increased over time - there were 420% more editors serving in 2014 than in 1985 - as did the number of countries in which editors were based. Nevertheless, editors based outside the  Global North (the group of economically developed countries with high per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that collectively concentrate most global wealth) were extremely rare. Furthermore, 67.06% of all editors were based in either the USA or UK. Consequently, Geographic Diversity - already low in 1985 - remained unchanged through 2014. We argue that this limited geographic diversity can detrimentally affect the creativity of scholarship published in journals, the progress and direction of research, the composition of the STEM workforce, and the development of science in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and much of Asia (i.e., the  Global South).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRed hair is associated with pain sensitivity, and more so in women than in men. Hair redness may thus interact with a female-specific factor. We tested this hypothesis on a large sample of Czech and Slovak respondents. They were asked about the natural redness and darkness of their hair, their natural eye color, their physical and mental health (24 categories), and other personal attributes (height, weight, number of children, lifelong number of sexual partners, frequency of smoking).\\n\\nResultsWe found that red-haired women did worse than other women in ten health categories and better in only three. In particular, they were more prone to colorectal, cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancer. Cancer risk increased steadily with increasing hair redness except for the reddest shade. Red-haired men showed a balanced pattern of health effects, doing better than other men in three categories and worse in three. Number of children was the only category where both male and female redheads did better than other respondents. We also confirmed earlier findings that red hair is naturally more frequent in women than in men.\\n\\nConclusionRed-haired women had higher fecundity and sexual attractiveness, but this selective advantage seems offset by worse health outcomes and therefore lower viability. The resulting equilibrium between these two counterbalancing forces might explain why red hair has remained less common than other hair and eye colors. Of the  new hair and eye colors, red hair diverges the most from the ancestral state of black hair and brown eyes. It is the most sexually dimorphic variant, not only in population frequency but also in health outcomes. This sexual dimorphism seems to have resulted from a selection pressure that acted primarily on early European women and which led to a general and apparently rapid diversification of hair and eye colors.",

    "abstract": "Wing dimorphisms have long served as models for examining the ecological and evolutionary tradeoffs associated with alternative morphologies [1], yet the mechanistic basis of morph determination remains largely unknown. Here we investigate the genetic basis of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) wing dimorphism, wherein males exhibit one of two alternative morphologies that differ dramatically in a set of correlated traits that inclused the presence or absence of wings [2-4]. Unlike the environmentally-induced asexual female aphid wing polyphenism [5], the male wing polymorphism is genetically determined by a single uncharacterized locus on the X chromosome called aphicarus (\\\"aphid\\\" plus \\\"Icarus\\\", api) [6, 7]. Using recombination and association mapping, we localized api to a 130kb region of the pea aphid genome. No nonsynonymous variation in coding sequences strongly associated with the winged and wingless phenotypes, indicating that api is likely a regulatory change. Gene expression level profiling revealed an aphid-specific gene from the region expressed at higher levels in winged male embryos, coinciding with the expected stage of api action. Comparison of the api region across biotypes (pea aphid populations specialized to different host plants that began diverging ~16,000 years ago [8, 9]) revealed that the two alleles were likely present prior to biotype diversification. Moreover, we find evidence for a recent selective sweep of a wingless allele since the biotypes diversified. In sum, this study provides insight into how adaptive, complex traits evolve within and across natural populations.",

    "abstract": "The sequence of the chicken genome, like several other draft genome sequences, is presently not fully covered. Gaps, contigs assigned with low confidence and uncharacterized chromosomes result in gene fragmentation and imprecise gene annotation. Transcript abundance estimation from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data relies on read quality, library complexity and expression normalization. In addition, the quality of the genome sequence used to map sequencing reads and the gene annotation that defines gene features must also be taken into account. Partially covered genome sequence causes the loss of sequencing reads from the mapping step, while an inaccurate definition of gene features induces imprecise read counts from the assignment step. Both steps can significantly bias interpretation of RNA-seq data. Here, we describe a dual transcript-discovery approach combining a genome-guided gene prediction and a de novo transcriptome assembly. This dual approach enabled us to increase the assignment rate of RNA-seq data by nearly 20% as compared to when using only the chicken reference annotation, contributing therefore to a more accurate estimation of transcript abundance. More generally, this strategy could be applied to any organism with partial genome sequence and/or lacking a manually-curated reference annotation in order to improve the accuracy of gene expression studies.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory gene expression following genotoxic cancer therapy is well documented, yet the events underlying its induction remain poorly understood. Inflammatory cytokines modify the tumor microenvironment by recruiting immune cells and are critical for both local and systemic (abscopal) tumor responses to radiotherapy1. An enigmatic feature of this phenomenon is its delayed onset (days), in contrast to the acute DNA damage responses that occur in minutes to hours. Such dichotomous kinetics implicate additional rate limiting steps that are essential for DNA-damage induced inflammation. Here, we show that cell cycle progression through mitosis following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) leads to the formation of micronuclei, which precede activation of inflammatory signaling and are a repository for the pattern recognition receptor cGAS. Inhibiting progression through mitosis or loss of pattern recognition by cGAS-STING impaired interferon signaling and prevented the regression of abscopal tumors in the context of ionizing radiation and immune checkpoint blockade in vivo. These findings implicate temporal modulation of the cell cycle as an important consideration in the context of therapeutic strategies that combine genotoxic agents with immune checkpoint blockade.",

    "abstract": "Effective targeting of cancer stem cells (CSCs) requires neutralization of self-renewal and chemoresistance, however these phenotypes are often regulated by distinct molecular mechanisms. Here we report the ability to target both of these phenotypes via CD55, an intrinsic cell surface complement inhibitor, which was identified in a comparative analysis between CSCs and non-CSCs in endometrioid cancer models. In this context, CD55 functions in a complement-independent manner and required lipid raft localization for CSC maintenance and cisplatin resistance. CD55 regulated self-renewal and core pluripotency genes via ROR2/JNK signaling and in parallel cisplatin resistance via LCK signaling, which induced DNA repair genes. Targeting LCK signaling via saracatinib, an inhibitor currently undergoing clinical evaluation, sensitized chemoresistant cells to cisplatin. Collectively, our findings identify CD55 as a unique signaling node that drives self-renewal and therapeutic resistance via a bifurcating signaling axis and provide an opportunity to target both signaling pathways in endometrioid tumors.\\n\\nSUMMARYCD55 is a membrane complement regulatory protein that attenuates complement-mediated cytotoxicity.

    "abstract": "Signaling pathways initiated at the membrane establish and maintain cell fate during development and can be harnessed in the nucleus to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from differentiated cells. Yet, the impact of extracellular signaling on reprogramming to pluripotency has not been systematically addressed. Here, we screen a lentiviral library encoding {small tilde}100 million secreted and membrane-bound antibodies and identify multiple antibodies that can replace Sox2/c-Myc or Oct4 during reprogramming. We show that one Sox2-replacing antibody initiates reprogramming by antagonizing the membrane-associated protein Basp1, thereby inducing nuclear factors WT1 and Esrrb/Lin28 independent of Sox2. By successively manipulating this pathway we identify three new methods to generate iPSCs. This study expands current knowledge of reprogramming methods and mechanisms and establishes unbiased selection from autocrine antibody libraries as a powerful orthogonal platform to discover new biologics and pathways regulating pluripotency and cell fate.",

    "abstract": "Plant distributions can be limited by habitat-biased herbivory, but the proximate causes of such biases are rarely known. Distinguishing plant-centric from herbivore-centric mechanisms driving differential herbivory between habitats is difficult without experimental manipulation of both plants and herbivores. Here we tested alternative hypotheses driving habitat-biased herbivory in bittercress (Cardamine cordifolia), which is more abundant under shade of shrubs and trees (shade) than in nearby meadows (sun) where herbivory is intense from the specialist fly Scaptomyza nigrita. This system has served as a textbook example of habitat-biased herbivory driving a plants distribution across an ecotone, but the proximate mechanisms underlying differential herbivory are still unclear. First, we found that higher S. nigrita herbivory in sun habitats contrasts sharply with their preference to attack plants from shade habitats in laboratory choice experiments. Second, S. nigrita strongly preferred leaves in simulated sun over simulated shade habitats, regardless of plant source habitat. Thus, herbivore preference for brighter, warmer habitats overrides their preference for more palatable shade plants. This promotes the sun-biased herbivore pressure that drives the distribution of bittercress into shade habitats.",

We find that aged Drosophila are more susceptible to enteric viral infections and that this increase in susceptibility is due to the aged microbiota, since depletion of the microbiota or reconstitution with a young microbiome suppressed infection. Metagenomic analysis of the aged microbiome revealed dysbiosis with an increased abundance in reactive oxygen species (ROS) producing pathways. This aged microbiota drives intestinal ROS production and we could restore immune function in old flies by reducing ROS genetically or pharmacologically. Moreover, we found that reconstitution of old flies with a cocktail of commensals, including L. fructivorans and heat-killed A. pomorum, could fully restore immunity. Altogether, these findings provide a mechanistic link between age-dependent dysbiosis and antiviral immunity and show that we can restore innate protection in aged animals, suggesting that this is a treatable and reversible state.",

    "abstract": "Here we seek to test the extent to which laboratory enrichments mimic natural community processes and the degree to which the initial structure of a community determines its response to a press disturbance via the addition of environmentally-relevant carbon compounds. By utilizing aerobic substrate arrays to examine the effect of carbon amendment on microbial communities taken from six distinct environments (soil from a temperate prairie and forest, tropical forest soil, subalpine forest soil, and surface water and soil from a palustrine emergent wetland), we examined how carbon amendment and inoculum source shape the composition of the community in each enrichment. Dilute subsamples from each environment were used to inoculate 96-well microtiter plates containing triplicate wells amended with one of 31 carbon sources from 6 different classes of organic compound (phenols, polymers, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, amines, amino acids). After incubating each well aerobically in the dark for 72 hours, we analyzed the composition of the microbial communities on the substrate arrays as well as the initial inocula by sequencing 16S rRNA gene amplicons using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Comparisons of alpha and beta diversity in these systems showed that, while the composition of the communities that grow to inhabit the wells in each substrate array diverges sharply from that of the original community in the inoculum, these enrichment communities are still is strongly affected by the inoculum source. We found most enrichments were dominated by one or several OTUs most closely related to aerobes or facultative anaerobes from the Proteobacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, and Ralstonia) or Bacteroidetes (e.g. Chryseobacterium). Comparisons within each substrate array based on the class of carbon source further show that the communities inhabiting wells amended with a carbohydrate differ significantly from those enriched with a phenolic compound. Niche selection therefore seems to play a strong role in shaping the communities in the substrate arrays, although some stochasticity is seen whereby several replicate wells within a single substrate array display strongly divergent community compositions. Overall, the use of highly parallel substrate arrays offers a promising path forward to study the response of microbial communities to a changing environment.",

    "abstract": "Dormancy is a bet-hedging strategy that allows organisms to persist through conditions that are sub-optimal for growth and reproduction by entering a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity. Dormancy allows a population to maintain a reservoir of genetic and phenotypic diversity (i.e., a seed bank) that can contribute to the long-term survival of a population. This strategy can be potentially adaptive and has long been of interest to ecologists and evolutionary biologists. However, comparatively little is known about how dormancy influences the fundamental evolutionary forces of genetic drift, mutation, selection, recombination, and gene flow. Here, we investigate how seed banks affect the processes underpinning evolution by reviewing existing theory, implementing novel simulations, and determining how and when dormancy can influence evolution as a population genetic process. We extend our analysis to examine how seed banks can alter macroevolutionary processes, including rates of speciation and extinction. Through the lens of population genetic theory, we can understand the extent that seed banks influence microbial evolutionary dynamics.",

In recent years, blue light-activated engineered anion conducting channelrhodopsins (eACRs) have been developed, improved, and were successfully applied in vivo. We asked whether the approaches used to create eACRs can be transferred to other well-characterized cation-conducting channelrhodopsins (CCRs) to obtain eACRs with a broad spectrum of biophysical properties. We generated 22 variants using two conversion strategies applied to 11 CCRs and screened them for membrane expression, photocurrents and anion selectivity. We obtained two novel eACRs, Phobos and Aurora, with blue-and red-shifted action spectra and photocurrents similar to existing eACRs. Furthermore, step-function mutations greatly enhanced the cellular operational light sensitivity due to a slowed-down photocycle. These bistable eACRs can be reversibly toggled between open and closed states with brief light pulses of different wavelengths. All new eACRs reliably inhibited action potential firing in pyramidal CA1 neurons. In Drosophila larvae, eACRs conveyed robust and specific light-dependent inhibition of locomotion and nociception.",

Here we show that, in addition to mechanical stimuli, PIEZO channels are also powerfully modulated by voltage and can even switch to a purely voltage gated mode. Mutations that cause human diseases such as Xerocytosis profoundly shift voltage sensitivity of PIEZO1 channels towards the resting membrane potential and strongly promote pure voltage gating. Our data may be explained by the presence of an inactivation gate in the pore, the opening of which is promoted by outward permeation. Invertebrate (fly) and vertebrate (fish) PIEZO proteins are also voltage sensitive but voltage gating is a much more prominent feature of these older channels. We propose that the voltage sensitivity of PIEZO channels is a deep property co-opted to add a regulatory mechanism for PIEZO activation in widely different cellular contexts.",

It remains unclear whether the LC acts functionally as a single global effector or as discrete modules. Specifically, while spinal-projections from LC neurons can exert analgesic actions, it is not known whether they can act independently of ascending LC projections. Using viral vectors taken up at axon terminals, we expressed chemogenetic actuators selectively in LC neurons with spinal (LC:SC) or prefrontal cortex (LC:PFC) projections. Activation of the LC:SC module produced robust, lateralised analgesia while activation of LC:PFC produced aversion. In a neuropathic pain model, LC:SC activation reduced hind-limb sensitization and induced conditioned place preference. By contrast, activation of LC:PFC exacerbated spontaneous pain, produced aversion and increased anxiety-like behaviour. This independent, contrasting modulation of pain-related behaviours mediated by distinct noradrenergic modules provides evidence for a discrete functional organisation of the LC.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of functional connectivity derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are sensitive to artefacts caused by in-scanner head motion. This susceptibility has motivated the development of numerous denoising methods designed to mitigate motion-related artefacts. Here, we compare popular retrospective rs-fMRI denoising methods, such as regression of head motion parameters and mean white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (with and without expansion terms), aCompCor, volume censoring (e.g., scrubbing and spike regression), global signal regression and ICA-AROMA, combined into 19 different pipelines. These pipelines were evaluated across five different quality control benchmarks in four independent datasets associated with varying levels of motion. Pipelines were benchmarked by examining the residual relationship between in-scanner movement and functional connectivity after denoising; the effect of distance on this residual relationship; whole-brain differences in functional connectivity between high- and low-motion healthy controls (HC); the temporal degrees of freedom lost during denoising; and the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity estimates. We also compared the sensitivity of each pipeline to clinical differences in functional connectivity in independent samples of schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Our results indicate that (1) simple linear regression of regional fMRI time series against head motion parameters and WM/CSF signals (with or without expansion terms) is not sufficient to remove head motion artefacts; (2) aCompCor pipelines may only be viable in low-motion data; (3) volume censoring performs well at minimising motion-related artefact but a major benefit of this approach derives from the exclusion of high-motion individuals; (4) while not as effective as volume censoring, ICA-AROMA performed well across our benchmarks for relatively low cost in terms of data loss; and (5) group comparisons in functional connectivity between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients are highly dependent on preprocessing strategy. We offer some recommendations for best practice and outline some simple analyses to facilitate transparent reporting of the degree to which a given set of findings may be affected by motion-related artefact.",

    "abstract": "Mixed effects models provide significant advantages in sensitivity and flexibility over typical statistical approaches to neural data analysis, but mass univariate application of mixed effects models to large neural datasets is computationally intensive. Threshold free cluster enhancement also provides a significant increase in sensitivity, but requires computationally-intensive permutation-based significance testing. Not surprisingly, the combination of mixed effects models with threshold free cluster enhancement and nonparametric permutation-based significance testing is currently completely impractical. With mixed effects for large datasets (MELD) we circumvent this impasse by means of a singular value decomposition to reduce the dimensionality of neural data while maximizing signal. Singular value decompositions become unstable when there are large numbers of noise features, so we precede it with a bootstrap-based feature selection step employing threshold free cluster enhancement to identify stable features across subjects. By projecting the dependent data into the reduced space of the singular value decomposition we gain the power of a multivariate approach and we can greatly reduce the number of mixed effects models that need to be run, making it feasible to use permutation testing to determine feature level significance. Due to these innovations, MELD is much faster than an element-wise mixed effects analysis, and on simulated data MELD was more sensitive than standard techniques, such as element-wise t-tests combined with threshold-free cluster enhancement. When evaluated on an EEG dataset, MELD identified more significant features than the t-tests with threshold free cluster enhancement in a comparable amount of time.",

    "abstract": "Herbivorous insects exhibit strong feeding preferences when choosing among plant genotypes, yet experiments to map loci mediating plant susceptibility to herbivory rarely incorporate host choice. To address this gap, we applied genome-wide association (GWA) mapping to uncover genetic polymorphisms mediating damage from foraging insects (two populations of Scaptomyza flava) across a mixture of Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes in experimental enclosures. The effect of chemical defenses (glucosinolates) on herbivory depended on herbivore genotype. Unlike many studies that minimize the effects of host choice behavior, we also found a large effect of plant size on herbivory--likely through its effect on plant apparency--that was independent of herbivore genotype. These herbivory-associated loci are polymorphic at fine spatial scales, and thus have potential to shape variation in herbivory within natural populations. We also show that the polymorphism with the largest effect on herbivory underlies adaptive latitudinal variation in Arabidopsis plant size across Europe. Overall, our results provide genetic support for ecological observations that variation in both chemical defenses and non-canonical defense traits (e.g., plant size and phenology) jointly shapes plant-herbivore interactions.",

Using a complementary suite of characterization tools, we identified significant structural, chemical and mechanical variations across the different structural units of the cuttlebone: the dorsal shield consists of two stiff and hard layers with prismatic mineral organization which encapsulate a more ductile and compliant layer with a lamellar structure, enriched with organic matter. A similar organization is found in the lamellar matrix, which consists of individual chambers separated by septa, and supported by meandering plates ( pillars). Like the dorsal shield, septa contain two layers with lamellar and prismatic organization, respectively, which differ significantly in their mechanical properties: layers with prismatic organization are a factor of three stiffer, and up to a factor of ten harder than those with lamellar organization. The combination of stiff and hard, and compliant and ductile components may serve to reduce the risk of catastrophic failure, and reflect the role of organic matter for the growth process of the cuttlebone. Mechanically  weaker units may function as sacrificial structures, ensuring a step-wise failure of the individual chambers in cases of overloading, allowing the animals to retain near-neutral buoyancy even with partially damaged cuttlebones. Our findings have implications for the structure-property-function relationship of cuttlebone, and may help to identify novel bioinspired design strategies for light-weight yet high-strength foams.",

Using these strains, we disrupted numerous genes important for normal morphological development, and even generated triple mutants from a single injection. We have also managed to increase the rates of homology directed repair by more than an order of magnitude. Given the exceptional mutagenic efficiency and specificity of the Cas9 strains we built, they can be used for high-throughput reverse genetic screens to help functionally annotate the Ae. aegypti genome. Additionally, these strains represent a first step towards the development of novel population control technologies targeting Ae. aegypti that rely on Cas9-based gene drives.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAedes aegypti is the principal vector of multiple arboviruses that significantly affect human health including dengue, chikungunya, and zika. Development of tools for efficient genome engineering in this mosquito will not only lay the foundation for the application of novel genetic control strategies that do not rely on insecticides, but will also accelerate basic research on key biological processes involved in disease transmission. Here, we report the development of a transgenic CRISPR approach for rapid gene disruption in this organism. Given their high editing efficiencies, the Cas9 strains we developed can be used to quickly generate novel genome modifications allowing for high-throughput gene targeting, and can possibly facilitate the development of gene drives, thereby accelerating comprehensive functional annotation and development of innovative population control strategies for Ae. aegypti.",

Addressing these issues, we present Scikit-ribo (https://github.com/hanfang/scikit-ribo), the first open-source software for accurate genome-wide A-site prediction and translation efficiency (TE) estimation from Riboseq and RNAseq data. Scikit-ribo accurately identifies A-site locations and reproduces codon elongation rates using several digestion protocols (r = 0.99). Next we show commonly used RPKM-derived TE estimation is prone to biases, especially for low-abundance genes. Scikit-ribo introduces a codon-level generalized linear model with ridge penalty that correctly estimates TE while accommodating variable codon elongation rates and mRNA secondary structure. This corrects the TE errors for over 2000 genes in S. cerevisiae, which we validate using mass spectrometry of protein abundances (r = 0.81) and allows us to determine the Kozak-like sequence directly from Riboseq. We conclude with an analysis of coverage requirements needed for robust codon-level analysis, and quantify the artifacts that can occur from cycloheximide treatment.",

    "abstract": "Carcinogenesis is an evolutionary process driven by the accumulation of genomic aberrations. Recurrent sequences of genomic changes, both between and within patients, reflect repeated evolution that is valuable for anticipating cancer progression. Multi-region sequencing and phylogenetic analysis allow inference of the partial temporal order of genomic changes within a patients tumour. However, the inherent stochasticity of the evolutionary process makes phylogenetic trees from different patients appear very distinct, preventing the robust identification of recurrent evolutionary trajectories. Here we present a novel quantitative method based on a machine learning approach called Transfer Learning (TL) that allows overcoming the stochastic effects of cancer evolution and highlighting hidden recurrences in cancer patient cohorts. When applied to multi-region sequencing datasets from lung, breast and renal cancer (708 samples from 160 patients), our method detected repeated evolutionary trajectories that determine novel patient subgroups, which reproduce in large singlesample cohorts (n=2,641) and have prognostic value. Our method provides a novel patient classification measure that is grounded in the cancer evolution paradigm, and which reveals repeated evolution during tumorigenesis, with implications for our ability to anticipate malignant evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGene set enrichment analysis and overrepresentation analyses are commonly used methods to determine the biological processes affected by a differential expression experiment. This approach requires biologically relevant gene sets, which are currently curated manually, limiting their availability and accuracy in many organisms without extensively curated resources. New feature learning approaches can now be paired with existing data collections to directly extract functional gene sets from big data.\\n\\nResultsHere we introduce a method to identify perturbed processes. In contrast with methods that use curated gene sets, this approach uses signatures extracted from public expression data. We first extract expression signatures from public data using ADAGE, a neural network-based feature extraction approach. We next identify signatures that are differentially active under a given treatment. Our results demonstrate that these signatures represent biological processes that are perturbed by the experiment. Because these signatures are directly learned from data without supervision, they can identify uncurated or novel biological processes. We implemented ADAGE signature analysis for the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For the convenience of different user groups, we implemented both an R package (ADAGEpath) and a web server (http://adage.greenelab.com) to run these analyses. Both are open-source to allow easy expansion to other organisms or signature generation methods. We applied ADAGE signature analysis to an example dataset in which wild-type and{Delta} anr mutant cells were grown as biofilms on the Cystic Fibrosis genotype bronchial epithelial cells. We mapped active signatures in the dataset to KEGG pathways and compared with pathways identified using GSEA. The two approaches generally return consistent results; however, ADAGE signature analysis also identified a signature that revealed the molecularly supported link between the MexT regulon and Anr.\\n\\nConclusionsWe designed ADAGE signature analysis to perform gene set analysis using data-defined functional gene signatures. This approach addresses an important gap for biologists studying non-traditional model organisms and those without extensive curated resources available. We built both an R package and web server to provide ADAGE signature analysis to the community.",

    "abstract": "An important question in cell biology is whether cells are able to measure size, either whole cell size or organelle size. Perhaps cells have an internal chemical representation of size that can be used to precisely regulate growth, or perhaps size is just an accident that emerges due to constraint of nutrients. The eukaryotic flagellum is an ideal model for studying size sensing and control because its linear geometry makes it essentially one-dimensional, greatly simplifying mathematical modeling. The assembly of flagella is regulated by intraflagellar transport (IFT), in which kinesin motors carry cargo adaptors for flagellar proteins along the flagellum and then deposit them at the tip, lengthening the flagellum. The rate at which IFT motors are recruited to begin transport into the flagellum is anticorrelated with the flagellar length, implying some kind of communication between the base and the tip and possibly indicating that cells contain some mechanism for measuring flagellar length. Although it is possible to imagine many complex scenarios in which additional signaling molecules sense length and carry feedback signals to the cell body to control IFT, might the already-known components of the IFT system be sufficient to allow length dependence of IFT? Here, we investigate a model in which the anterograde kinesin motors unbind after cargo delivery, diffuse back to the base, and are subsequently reused to power entry of new IFT trains into the flagellum. By modeling such a system at three different levels of abstraction we are able to show that the diffusion time of the motors can in principle be sufficient to serve as a proxy for length measurement. In all three implementations, we found that the diffusion model can not only achieve a stable steady-state length without the addition of any other signaling molecules or pathways, but also is able to produce the anticorrelation between length and IFT recruitment rate that has been observed in quantitative imaging studies.",

Taxon age is one factor that may associate with extinction if occupancy of geographic and adaptive zones varies with time, but evidence for such an association has been equivocal. Age-dependent occupancy can also influence diversification rates and thus extinction risk where new taxa have small range and population sizes. Here we analysed 509 well-sampled genera from across the plant ToL. We found that a greater proportion of species were threatened by extinction in younger and faster-diversifying genera. Repeating our analyses in two large, well-sampled groups, we found that extinction risk increased with evolutionary age in conifer species but not palms. Potential range size decreased in older, non-threatened conifers more strongly than in threatened taxa, suggesting that range size dynamics may explain differing patterns of extinction risk across the ToL with consequences for biodiversity conservation.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing evolutionary puzzle is that all eukaryotic genomes contain large amounts of tandemly-repeated satellite DNA whose composition varies greatly among even closely related species. To elucidate the evolutionary forces governing satellite dynamics, quantification of the rates and patterns of mutations in satellite DNA copy number and tests of its selective neutrality are necessary. Here we used whole-genome sequences of 28 mutation accumulation (MA) lines of Daphnia pulex in addition to six isolates from a non-MA population originating from the same progenitor to both estimate mutation rates of abundances of satellite sequences and evaluate the selective regime acting upon them. We found that mutation rates of individual satellite sequence \\\"kmers\\\" were both high and highly variable, ranging from additions/deletions of 0.29 - 105 copies per generation (reflecting changes of 0.12 - 0.80 percent per generation). Our results also provide evidence that new kmer sequences are often formed from existing ones. The non-MA population isolates showed a signal of either purifying or stabilizing selection, with 33 % lower variation in kmer abundance on average than the MA lines, although the level of selective constraint was not evenly distributed across all kmers. The changes between many pairs of kmers were correlated, and the pattern of correlations was significantly different between the MA lines and the non-MA population. Our study demonstrates that kmer sequences can experience extremely rapid evolution in abundance, which can lead to high levels of divergence in genome-wide satellite DNA composition between closely related species.",

    "abstract": "Species identification using DNA sequences, known as DNA barcoding has been widely used in many applied fields. Current barcoding methods are usually based on a single mitochondrial locus, such as cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). This type of barcoding is not always effective when applied to species separated by short divergence times or that contain introgressed genes from closely related species. Herein we introduce a more effective multi-locus barcoding framework that is based on gene capture and \\\"next-generation\\\" sequencing and provide both empirical and simulation tests of its efficacy. We examine genetic distinctness in two pairs of fishes that are sister-species: Siniperca chuatsi vs. S. kneri and Sicydium altum vs. S. adelum, where the COI barcoding approach failed species identification in both cases. Results revealed that distinctness between S. chuatsi and S. kneri increased as more independent loci were added. By contrast S. altum and S. adelum could not be distinguished even with all loci. Analyses of population structure and gene flow suggested that the two species of Siniperca diverged from each other a long time ago but have unidirectional gene flow, whereas the two species of Sicydium are not separated from each other and have high bidirectional gene flow. Simulations demonstrate that under limited gene flow (< 0.00001 per gene per generation) and enough separation time (> 100000 generation), we can correctly identify species using more than 90 loci. Finally, we selected 500 independent nuclear markers for ray-finned fishes and designed a three-step pipeline for multilocus DNA barcoding.",

PTNRD negatively impacts tuber quality and marketability and poses a serious threat to seed and commercial potato production worldwide. PVYNTN symptoms differ in the cultivars Waneta and Pike: Waneta expresses severe PTNRD and foliar mosaic with vein and leaf necrosis, whereas Pike does not express PTNRD and mosaic is the only foliar symptom. To map loci that influence tuber and foliar symptoms, 236 F1 progeny of a cross between Waneta and Pike were inoculated with PVYNTN isolate NY090029 and genotyped using 12,808 Potato SNPs. Foliar symptom type and severity were monitored for 10 weeks, while tubers were evaluated for PTNRD expression at harvest and again after 60 days in storage. Pairwise correlation analyses indicate a strong association between PTNRD and vein necrosis ({tau} = 0.4195). QTL analyses revealed major-effect QTLs on chromosomes 4 and 5 for mosaic, 4 for PTNRD, and 5 for foliar-necrosis symptoms. Locating QTLs associated with PVY-related symptoms provides a foundation for breeders to develop markers that can be used to screen out potato clones with undesirable phenotypes, e.g., those likely to develop PTNRD or to be symptomless carriers of PVY.",

    "abstract": "Multicellular development is largely determined by transcriptional regulatory programs that orchestrate the expression of thousands of protein-coding and noncoding genes. To decipher the genomic regulatory code that specifies these programs, and to investigate globally the developmental relevance of noncoding transcription, we profiled genome-wide promoter activity throughout embryonic development in 5 Drosophila species. We show that core promoters, generally not thought to play a significant regulatory role, in fact impart broad restrictions on the developmental timing of gene expression on a genome-wide scale. We propose a hierarchical model of transcriptional regulation during development in which core promoters define broad windows of opportunity for expression, by defining a limited range of transcription factors from which they are able to receive regulatory inputs. This two-tiered mechanism globally orchestrates developmental gene expression, including noncoding transcription on a scale that defies our current understanding of ontogenesis. Indeed, noncoding transcripts are far more prevalent than ever reported before, with [~]4,000 long noncoding RNAs expressed during embryogenesis. Over 1,500 are functionally conserved throughout the melanogaster subgroup, and hundreds are under strong purifying selection. Overall, this work introduces a hierarchical model for the developmental regulation of transcription, and reveals the central role of noncoding transcription in animal development.",

Sequence comparison of these similar proteins, in conjunction with analysis of loss-of-function missense alleles identifies several conserved 2-7 amino acid microdomains within the extracellular domain that are important for dsRNA transport. Among these missense alleles, we identify and characterize a sid-1 allele, qt95, which causes tissue-specific silencing defects most easily explained as a systemic RNAi export defect. However, we conclude from genetic and biochemical analyses that sid-1(qt95) disrupts only import and speculate that the apparent export defect is caused by the cumulative effect of sequentially impaired dsRNA import steps.Thus, consistent with previous studies, we fail to detect a requirement for sid-1 in dsRNA export, but demonstrate for the first time that SID-1 functions in the intestine to support environmental RNAi.",

Thus, it is unclear how well mice can discriminate ethologically relevant scenes. Here, we examined natural scene discrimination in mice using an automated touch-screen system. We estimated the discrimination difficulty using the computational metric structural similarity (SSIM), and constructed psychometric curves. However, the performance of each mouse was better predicted by the population mean than SSIM. This high inter-mouse agreement indicates that mice use common and robust strategies to discriminate natural scenes. We tested several other image metrics to find an alternative to SSIM for predicting discrimination performance. We found that a simple, primary visual cortex (V1)-inspired model predicted mouse performance with fidelity approaching the inter-mouse agreement. The model involved convolving the images with Gabor filters, and its performance varied with the orientation of the Gabor filter. This orientation dependence was driven by the stimuli, rather than an innate biological feature. Together, these results indicate that mice are adept at discriminating natural scenes, and their performance is well predicted by simple models of V1 processing.",

The mechanisms that ensure appropriate circuit stability in this dynamic context remain poorly understood. Since interneurons sculpt the excitatory output of mitral and tufted (MT) neurons to the olfactory cortex, we predicted that MT neurons might instruct interneuron wiring in the adult brain. By blocking synaptic transmission from MT neurons we show that MT neuronal activity is critical to maintain olfactory bulb integrity and interneuron survival. Blocking interneuron death uncovered a second activity-dependent checkpoint regulating dendrite branching. In contrast, cortical circuits and MT neurons remain stable in the face of these silent and degenerating olfactory circuits. These studies identify a circuit-specific role for non-sensory activity in regulating integration of neurons into the adult brain, as predicted by previous computational models.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsCystic fibrosis (CF) patients and CF mouse models have increased risk for gastrointestinal tumors. CF mice exhibit augmented intestinal proliferation of unknown etiology and an altered intestinal environment. We examined the role of Cftr in Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, stem cell proliferation and its functional expression in the active intestinal stem cell (ISC) population. Dysregulation of intracellular pH (pHi) in CF ISCs was investigated for facilitation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling.\\n\\nMethodsCrypt epithelia from wild-type (WT) and CF mice were compared ex vivo and in intestinal organoids (enteroids) for proliferation and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling by standard assays. Cftr in ISCs was assessed by immunoblot of sorted Sox9EGFP intestinal epithelia and pHi regulation by confocal microfluorimetry of Lgr5+-EGFP ISCs. Plasma membrane association of the Wnt transducer Disheveled 2 (Dvl2) was assessed by fluorescence imaging of live enteroids from WT and CF mice crossed with Dvl2-EGFP/RosamT/mG mice.\\n\\nResultsRelative to WT, CF intestinal crypts showed a ~30% increase in epithelial and Lgr5+ ISC proliferation and increased Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Cftr was expressed in Sox9EGFPLo ISCs and loss of Cftr induced an alkaline pHi in Lgr5+-EGFP ISCs. CF crypt-base columnar cells (CBCs) demonstrated a generalized increase in plasma membrane Dvl2-EGFP association as compared to WT. Dvl2-EGFP membrane association was charge- and pH-dependent and increased in WT CBCs by Cftr inhibition.\\n\\nConclusionsCF intestine exhibits increased ISC proliferation and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Loss of Cftr increases pHi in ISCs which stabilizes the plasma membrane association of the Wnt transducer Dvl, likely facilitating Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Absence of Cftr-dependent suppression of ISC proliferation in the CF intestine may contribute to increased risk for intestinal tumors.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/156562_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (27K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf807forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fd24baorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@176497dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d2b265_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical AbstractC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Soft-shell crab is considered a gastronomic delicacy, reaching high values in the international market. The process of hardening of the crabs exoskeleton after moulting takes approximately two days to complete; however, the duration for which the shell remains at the consistency of high commercial value is only 3 hours on average. After this period, the shell assumes a consistency classified as \\\"paper\\\", later becoming \\\"hard\\\" again. The goal of this work was to evaluate the use of the crabs themselves to alter the chemical characteristics of the water and thereby increase the amount of time during which they can be marketed as \\\"soft-shell crab\\\". In this work, 241 individuals of Callinectes ornatus were used in two experiments. In the first experiment, the animals were maintained in a collective system with filtration and partial daily water renewal. In the second experiment, the crabs were maintained in a collective system with filtration but no water renewal. In Experiment 1, the chemical characteristics of the water remained unchanged over time (p > 0.05), and the median time to hardening of the exoskeleton to the paper consistency after moulting was 3 hours. Over the course of Experiment 2, there was a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in pH and significant increases in the ammonia and nitrite concentrations. When moulting occurred in water with a pH below 7.3 and total ammonia concentrations above 6.0 mg/L, the crabs shells did not harden, and it was possible to keep them soft for up to 5 days.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary origin and ecological maintenance of biodiversity is a central problem in biology. For diversity to be stable through time, each genotype or species must have an advantage when rare. This negative frequency-dependence prevents deterministic extinction and mitigates the stochastic loss of diversity (1-4). However, models of mutualism typically generate positive frequency-dependence that reduces diversity (5-8). Here, we report empirical evidence for negative frequency-dependence in the legume-rhizobium mutualism within a single host generation, a phenomenon that we term balancing nodulation. Balancing nodulation increases rare rhizobia across all 13 legume genera investigated to date, at high and low inoculum densities, and with minimal genetic differentiation between rhizobia strains. While the mechanism generating this phenomenon is currently unknown, balancing nodulation could actively maintain variation in the rhizobia-legume symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "Genomic networks represent a complex map of molecular interactions which are descriptive of the biological processes occurring in living cells. Identifying the small over-represented circuitry patterns in these networks helps generate hypotheses about the functional basis of such complex processes. Network motif discovery is a systematic way of achieving this goal. However, a reliable network motif discovery outcome requires generating random background networks which are the result of a uniform and independent graph sampling method. To date, there has been no sound practical method to numerically evaluate whether any network motif discovery algorithm performs as intended--thus it was not possible to assess the validity of resulting network motifs. In this work, we present IndeCut, the first and only method that allows characterization of network motif finding algorithm performance on any network of interest. We demonstrate that it is critical to use IndeCut prior to running any network motif finder for two reasons. First, IndeCut estimates the minimally required number of samples that each network motif discovery tool needs in order to produce an outcome that is both reproducible and accurate. Second, IndeCut allows users to choose the most accurate network motif discovery tool for their network of interest among many available options.

    "abstract": "BackgroundHi-C is a proximity-based ligation reaction used to detect regions of the genome that are close in 3D space (or \\\"interacting\\\"). Typically, results from Hi-C experiments (whole-genome contact maps) are visualized as heatmaps or Circos plots. While informative, these visualizations do not intuitively represent the complex organization and folding of the genome in 3D space, making the interpretation of the underlying 3D genomic organization difficult. Our objective was to utilize existing tools to generate a graph-based representation of a whole-genome contact map that leads to a more intuitive visualization.\\n\\nMethodologyWhole-genome contact maps were converted into graphs where each vertex represented a genomic region and each edge represented a detected or known interaction between two vertices. Three types of interactions were represented in the graph: linear, intra-chromosomal (cis-), and inter-chromosomal (trans-) interactions. Each edge had an associated weight related to the linear distance (Hi-C experimental resolution) or the associated interaction frequency from the contact map. Graphs were generated based on this representation scheme for whole-genome contact maps from a fission yeast dataset where yeast mutants were used to identify specific principles influencing genome organization (GEO accession: GSE56849). Graphs were visualized in Cytoscape with an edge-weighted spring embedded layout where vertices and linear interaction edges were coloured according to their corresponding chromosome.\\n\\nResultsThe graph-based visualizations (compared to the equivalent heatmaps) more intuitively represented the effects of the rad21 mutant on genome organization. Specifically, the graph based visualizations clearly highlighted the loss of structural globules and a greater intermingling of chromosomes in the mutant strain when compared to the wild-type. The graph-based representation and visualization protocol developed here will aid in understanding the complex organization and folding of the genome.",

In the past years, many computational tools have been developed to search motif instances by using the existing knowledge of well-studied families. Recently, with the rapidly increasing number of resolved RNA 3D structures, there is an urgent need to discover novel motifs with the newly presented information. In this work, we classify all the loops in non-redundant RNA 3D structures to detect plausible RNA structural motif families by using a clustering pipeline. Compared with other clustering approaches, our method has two benefits: first, the underlying alignment algorithm is tolerant to the variations in 3D structures; second, sophisticated downstream analysis has been performed to ensure the clusters are valid and easily applied to further research. The final clustering results contain many interesting new variants of known motif families, such as GNAA tetraloop, kink-turn, sarcin-ricin, and T-loop. We have also discovered potential novel functional motifs conserved in ribosomal RNA, sgRNA, SRP RNA, riboswitch, and ribozyme.",

    "abstract": "Genetically encoded Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) based biosensors report on changes in biochemical states in single living cells. The performance of biosensors depends on their brightness and dynamic range, which are dependent on the characteristics of the fluorescent proteins that are employed. Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) is frequently combined with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) as FRET pair in biosensors. However, current YFPs are prone to photobleaching and pH changes. In addition, more efficient acceptors may yield biosensors that have higher contrast. In this study, we evaluated the properties of a diverse set of acceptor fluorescent proteins in combination with the optimized CFP variant mTurquoise2 as the donor. To determine the theoretical performance of acceptors, the Forster radius was determined. The practical performance was determined by measuring FRET efficiency and photostability of tandem fusion proteins in mammalian cells. Our results show that mNeonGreen is the most efficient acceptor for mTurquoise2 and that the photostability is better than SYFP2. The non-fluorescent YFP variant sREACh is an efficient acceptor, which is useful in lifetime-based FRET experiments. Among the orange and red fluorescent proteins, mChery and mScarlet-I are the best performing acceptors. Several new pairs were applied in a multimolecular FRET based sensor for detecting activation of a heterotrimeric G-protein by G-protein coupled receptors. The sensor with mScarlet-I as acceptor and mTurquoise2 as donor shows a higher dynamic range in ratiometric FRET imaging experiments and less variability than with mCherry as acceptor, due to the high quantum yield and efficient maturation of mScarlet-I. Overall, the sensor with mNeonGreen as acceptor and mTurquoise2 as donor showed the highest dynamic range in ratiometric FRET imaging experiments with the G-protein sensor.",

    "abstract": "Tensile forces regulate epithelial homeostasis, but the molecular mechanisms behind this regulation are poorly understood. Using structured illumination microscopy and proximity ligation assays we show that the tight junction protein ZO-1 undergoes actomyosin tension-dependent stretching and folding in vivo. Magnetic tweezers experiments using purified ZO-1 indicate that pN-scale tensions (~2-4 pN) are sufficient to maintain the stretched conformation of ZO-1, while keeping its structured domains intact. Actomyosin tension and substrate stiffness regulate the localization and expression of the transcription factor DbpA and the tight junction membrane protein occludin in a ZO-1/ZO-2-dependent manner, resulting in modulation of gene expression, cell proliferation, barrier function and cyst morphogenesis. Interactions between the N-terminal (ZPSG) and C-terminal domains of ZO-1 prevent binding of DbpA to the ZPSG, and folding is antagonized by heterodimerization with ZO-2. We propose that tensile forces regulate epithelial homeostasis by activating ZO proteins through stretching, to modulate their protein interactions and downstream signaling.",

Using Bombyx mori as a model, we showed that the melanism levels during larval cuticle pigmentation correlated positively with the expression of cuticular protein-encoding genes. This correlation stemmed from the simultaneous induction of these genes by the melanin precursors. More importantly, the effect of the melanism background on the cuticles induced the up-regulation of other functionally redundant cuticular protein-encoding genes to rescue the morphological and adaptive defects caused by the dysfunction of some mutated cuticular proteins, and the restorative ability increased with increasing melanism levels, which gives a novel evidence that melanism enhances insect adaptability. These findings deepen our understanding of the interactions among cuticle components, as well as their importance in the stabilizing of the normal morphology and function of the cuticle.",

TRIBE expresses an RBP of interest fused to the catalytic domain (cd) of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR and performs Adenosine-to-Inosine editing on RNA targets of the RBP. However, target identification is limited by the low editing efficiency of the ADARcd. Here we describe HyperTRIBE, which carries a previously characterized hyperactive mutation (E488Q) of the ADARcd. HyperTRIBE identifies dramatically more editing sites, many of which are also edited by TRIBE but at a much lower editing frequency. HyperTRIBE therefore more faithfully recapitulates the known binding specificity of its RBP than TRIBE. In addition, separating RNA binding from the enhanced editing activity of the HyperTRIBE ADAR catalytic domain sheds light on the mechanism of ADARcd editing as well as the enhanced activity of the HyperADARcd.",

Associations between myelin content and processing speed was assessed in 570 community-living individuals (277 middle-age, 293 older-age). Myelin content was measured using the mean T1w/T2w magnetic resonance ratio, in six white matter tracts (anterior corona radiata, superior corona radiata, pontine crossing tract, anterior limb of the internal capsule, genu of the corpus callosum, and splenium of the corpus callosum). Processing speed was estimated by extracting a principal component from 5 sep-arate tests of processing speed. It was found that myelin content of the bilateral anterior limb of the internal capsule and left splenium of the corpus callosum were significant predictors of processing speed, even after controlling for socio-demographic, health and genetic variables and correcting for multiple comparisons. A 1 SD increase in the myelin content of the anterior limb of the internal capsule was associated with 2.53% increase in processing speed and within the left splenium of the corpus callosum with a 2.20% increase in processing speed. In addition, significant differences in myelin content between middle-age and older participants were found in all six white matter tracts. The present results indicate that myelin content, estimated in vivo using a neuroimaging approach in healthy older adults is sufficiently precise to predict variability in processing speed in behavioural measures.",

    "abstract": "Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) critically affects the processing of information in neuronal circuits by reversibly changing the effective strength of connections between neurons on time scales from milliseconds to a few seconds. STP is traditionally studied using intracellular recordings of postsynaptic potentials or currents evoked by presynaptic spikes. However, STP also affects the statistics of postsynaptic spikes. Here we present two model-based approaches for estimating synaptic weights and short-term plasticity from pre- and postsynaptic spike observations alone. We extend a generalized linear model (GLM) that predicts postsynaptic spiking as a function of the observed pre- and postsynaptic spikes and allow the connection strength (coupling term in the GLM) to vary as a function of time based on the history of presynaptic spikes. Our first model assumes that STP follows a Tsodyks-Markram description of vesicle depletion and recovery. In a second model, we introduce a functional description of STP where we estimate the coupling term as a biophysically unrestrained function of the presynaptic inter-spike intervals. To validate the models, we test the accuracy of STP estimation using the spiking of pre- and postsynaptic neurons with known synaptic dynamics. We first test our models using the responses of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons to simulated presynaptic input with different types of STP, and then use simulated spike trains to examine the effects of spike-frequency adaptation, stochastic vesicle release, spike sorting errors, and common input. We find that, using only spike observations, both model-based methods can accurately reconstruct the time-varying synaptic weights of presynaptic inputs for different types of STP. Our models also capture the differences in postsynaptic spike responses to presynaptic spikes following short vs long inter-spike intervals, similar to results reported for thalamocortical connections. These models may thus be useful tools for characterizing short-term plasticity from multi-electrode spike recordings in vivo.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryInformation processing in the nervous system critically depends on dynamic changes in the strength of connections between neurons. Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP), changes that occur on timescales from milliseconds to a few seconds, is thought to play a role in tasks such as speech recognition, motion detection, and working memory. Although intracellular recordings in slices of neural tissue have identified synaptic mechanisms of STP and have demonstrated its potential role in information processing, studying STP in intact animals, especially during behavior, is experimentally difficult. Unlike intracellular recordings, extracellular spiking of hundreds of neurons simultaneously can be recorded even in behaving animals. Here we developed two models that allow estimation of STP from extracellular spike recordings. We validate these models using results from in vitro experiments which simulate a realistic synaptic input from a population of presynaptic neurons with defined STP rules. Our results show that both new models can accurately recover the synaptic dynamics underlying spiking. These new methods will allow us to study STP using extracellular recordings, and therefore on a much larger scale than previously possible in behaving animals.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the effect of repeated-ischaemic exercise on the mRNA content of PGC-1 (total, 11, and 14) and Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA; 1-3, {beta}1-3, and FXYD1) isoforms in human skeletal muscle, and studied some of the potential molecular mechanisms involved. Eight trained men (26 {+/-} 5 y and 57.4 {+/-} 6.3 mL{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}min-1) completed three interval running sessions with (ISC) or without ischaemia (CON), or in hypoxia (HYP, ~3250 m), in a randomised, crossover fashion separated by 1 week. A muscle sample was collected from the dominant leg before (Pre) and after exercise (+0h, +3h) in all sessions to measure the mRNA content of PGC-1 and NKA isoforms, oxidative stress markers (i.e. catalase and HSP70 mRNA), muscle lactate, and phosphorylation of AMPK, ACC, CaMKII, and PLB protein in type I and II fibres. Muscle hypoxia (i.e. deoxygenated haemoglobin) was matched between ISC and HYP, which was higher than in CON (~90% vs. ~70%; p< 0.05). The levels of PGC-1 total, -11, -14, and FXYD1 mRNA increased in ISC only (p< 0.05). These changes were associated with increases in oxidative stress markers and higher p-ACCSer221/ACC in type I fibres, but were unrelated to muscle hypoxia, lactate, and CaMKII and PLB phosphorylation. These findings highlight that repeated-ischaemic exercise augments the skeletal muscle gene response related to mitochondrial biogenesis and ion transport in trained men. This effect seems attributable, in part, to increased oxidative stress and AMPK activation, whereas it appears unrelated to altered CaMKII signalling, and the muscle hypoxia and lactate accumulation induced by ischaemia.\\n\\nSummary in key pointsO_LIWe investigated if ischaemia would augment the exercise-induced mRNA response of PGC-1 and Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA) isoforms (1-3, {beta}1-3, and FXYD1), and examined whether this effect could be related to oxidative stress and fibre type-dependent AMPK and CaMKII signalling in the skeletal muscle of trained men.\\nC_LIO_LIRepeated-ischaemic exercise increased the mRNA content of PGC-1 total, -11, and-14, and of the NKA regulatory subunit FXYD1, whereas exercise in systemic hypoxia or alone was without effect on these genes.\\nC_LIO_LIThese responses to ischaemia were complemented by increased oxidative stress (as assessed by catalase and HSP70 mRNA) and ACC phosphorylation (an indicator of AMPK activation) in type I fibres. However, they were unrelated to CaMKII signalling, muscle hypoxia, and lactate accumulation.\\nC_LIO_LIThus, repeated ischaemic exercise augments the muscle gene response associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and ion homeostasis in trained men. This effect seems partly attributable to promoted oxidative stress and AMPK activation.\\nC_LI\\n\\nAbbreviations",
