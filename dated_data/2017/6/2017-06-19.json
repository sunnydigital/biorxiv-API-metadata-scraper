    "abstract": "Genome-wide proximity placement analysis of diverse families of human-specific genomic regulatory loci (HSGRL) identified topologically-associating domains (TADs) that are significantly enriched for HSGRL and termed rapidly-evolving in humans TADs (revTADs; Genome Biol Evol. 2016 8; 2774-88). Here, human-specific genomic features of pluripotency regulatory networks in hESC have been analyzed. The primary focus was on identification of human-specific elements of the interphase chromatin architecture of TADs responsible for transcriptional regulatory control of the NANOG, POU5F1, and POU3F2 genes. Comparative analyses of the four adjacent TADs spanning ~3.3 Mb NANOG locus-associated genomic region were carried-out to highlight primate-specific genomic features. Lastly, the putative mechanisms of the genome-wide regulatory effects of human-specific NANOG-binding sites (HSNBS) on expression of genes implicated in the fetal and adult brain development have been examined. Acquisition of primate-specific regulatory loci appears to rewire TADs exerting transcriptional control on pluripotency regulators, revealing a genomic placement pattern consistent with the enhanced regulatory impact of NANOG in primates. Proximity placement analysis of HSNBS identified a large expression signature in the human fetal neocortex temporal lobe comprising 4,957 genes, which appear to retain acquired in the embryo expression changes for many years of human brain development and maintain highly concordant expression profiles in the neocortex and prefrontal cortex regions of adult human brain. Collectively, reported herein observations indicate that genomic elements of pluripotency regulatory circuitry associated with HSNBS, specifically proteins of the classical NurD chromatin remodeling complex, contribute to transcriptional regulation of a large set of genes implicated in development and function of human brain.\\n\\nList of abbreviations5hmC, 5-Hydromethylcytosine\\n\\nCTCF, CCCTC-binding factor\\n\\nDHS, DNase hypersensitivity sites\\n\\nFHSRR, fixed human-specific regulatory regions\\n\\nGRNs, genomic regulatory networks\\n\\nHAR, human accelerated regions\\n\\nhCONDEL, human-specific conserved deletions\\n\\nhESC, human embryonic stem cells\\n\\nHSGRL, human-specific genomic regulatory loci\\n\\nHSNBS, human-specific NANOG-binding sites\\n\\nHSTFBS, human-specific transcription factor-binding sites\\n\\nLAD, lamina-associated domain\\n\\nLINE, long interspersed nuclear element\\n\\nlncRNA, long non-coding RNA\\n\\nLTR, long terminal repeat\\n\\nMADE, methylation-associated DNA editing\\n\\nmC, methylcytosine\\n\\nmESC, mouse embryonic stem cells\\n\\nNANOG, Nanog homeobox\\n\\nnt, nucleotide\\n\\nPOU5F1, POU class 5 homeobox 1\\n\\nPSDS, partial strand displacement state\\n\\nTAD, topologically associating domains\\n\\nTE, transposable elements\\n\\nTF, transcription factor\\n\\nTSC, triple-stranded complex\\n\\nTSS, transcription start sites\\n\\nSE, super-enhancers\\n\\nSED, super-enhancer domains\\n\\nsncRNA, small non coding RNA",

    "abstract": "The lack of multivariate methods for decoding the representational content of interregional neural communication has left it difficult to know what information is represented in distributed brain circuit interactions. Here we present Multi-Connection Pattern Analysis (MCPA), which works by learning mappings between the activity patterns of the populations as a factor of the information being processed. These maps are used to predict the activity from one neural population based on the activity from the other population. Successful MCPA-based decoding indicates the involvement of distributed computational processing and provides a framework for probing the representational structure of the interaction. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of MCPA in realistic circumstances. Applying MCPA to fMRI data shows that interactions between visual cortex regions are sensitive to information that distinguishes individual natural images, suggesting that image individuation occurs through interactive computation across the visual processing network. MCPA-based representational similarity analyses (RSA) results support models of error coding in interactions among regions of the network. Further RSA analyses relate the non-linear information transformation operations between layers of a computational model (HMAX) of visual processing to the information transformation between regions of the visual processing network. Additionally, applying MCPA to human intracranial electrophysiological data demonstrates that the interaction between occipital face area and fusiform face area contains information about individual faces. Thus, MCPA can be used to assess the information represented in the coupled activity of interacting neural circuits and probe the underlying principles of information transformation between regions.",

    "abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, contain a non-photosynthetic plastid known as the apicoplast that functions to produce essential metabolic compounds. It was previously reported that several members of the Clp family of chaperones and proteases localize to the apicoplast. In bacteria and in chloroplasts these proteins form complexes that degrade proteins in a proteasome-like manner to regulate key cellular processes, but their function in the apicoplast is completely unknown. In this study, we generated a conditional mutant of the P. falciparum apicoplast-targeted pfclpc gene and found that under normal conditions it localizes to the apicoplast. Knockdown of PfClpC results in growth inhibition and morphological defects, indicating that PfClpC is essential for parasite viability. Upon inhibition, PfClpC loses its apicoplast localization and appears in vesicle-like structures. Other apicoplast-targeted proteins also localize to these structures, suggesting that organelle integrity is compromised. Addition of isopentynyl pyrophosphate completely rescued the growth inhibition, indicating that the only essential function of PfClpC is related to the apicoplast. Moreover, cellular assays suggest that PfClpC inhibition interferes with the ability of the schizont-stage parasites to properly sort functional apicoplast organelles into daughter-merozoites. These data show that PfClpC is an essential gene that functions to maintain apicoplast integrity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe deadly human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, contains a unique organelle called the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid that produces vital metabolites. Members of the prokaryotic-derived Clp family were previously reported to localize to the apicoplast. In bacteria and plant chloroplasts, Clp homologs form a proteasome-like complex that degrade proteins but their function in parasite biology is unknown. Here we took a conditional knockdown approach to study an apicoplast localized Clp proteins, PfClpC, which we found to be essential for parasite viability. Inhibition of PfClpC results in a growth arrest phenotype that correlates with a reduced replication rate. We observed that PfClpC localizes to the apicoplast, however upon inhibition it is found dispersed in vesicle-like structures suggesting a complete breakdown of organelle integrity. Our ability to rescue the phenotype by adding an essential apicoplast-derived metabolite proved that the only essential function of PfClpC is linked to apicoplast function. Furthermore, we have found evidence supporting a role for PfClpC in apicoplast sorting into daughter cells. Therefore, we propose PfClpC as a potential drug target due to its essentiality, prokaryotic origin and absence from the human host.",

    "abstract": "A number of open questions in human evolutionary genetics would become tractable if we were able to directly measure evolutionary fitness. As a step towards this goal, we developed a method to examine whether individual genetic variants, or sets of genetic variants, currently influence viability. The approach consists in testing whether the frequency of an allele varies across ages, accounting for variation in ancestry. We applied it to the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA) cohort and to the parents of participants in the UK Biobank. Across the genome, we find only a few common variants with large effects on age-specific mortality: tagging the APOE {varepsilon}4 allele and near CHRNA3. These results suggest that when large, even late onset effects are kept at low frequency by purifying selection. Testing viability effects of sets of genetic variants that jointly influence one of 42 traits, we detect a number of strong signals. In participants of the UK Biobank study of British ancestry, we find that variants that delay puberty timing are enriched in longer-lived parents (P~6x10-6 for fathers and P~2x10-3 for mothers), consistent with epidemiological studies. Similarly, in mothers, variants associated with later age at first birth are associated with a longer lifespan (P~1x10-3). Signals are also observed for variants influencing cholesterol levels, risk of coronary artery disease, body mass index, as well as risk of asthma. These signals exhibit consistent effects in the GERA cohort and among participants of the UK Biobank of non-British ancestry. Moreover, we see marked differences between males and females, most notably at the CHRNA3 locus, and variants associated with risk of coronary artery disease and cholesterol levels. Beyond our findings, the analysis serves as a proof of principle for how upcoming biomedical datasets can be used to learn about selection effects in contemporary humans.",

    "abstract": "The cancer immunoediting hypothesis postulates a dual role of the immune system: protecting the host by eliminating tumor cells, and shaping the tumor by editing the genome. However, to what extent immunoediting is shaping the cancer genome is still a matter of debate. Moreover, the impact of cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint blockers on modulating immunoediting remains largely unexplored. Here we elucidated the impact of evolutionary and immune-related forces on editing the tumor in a mouse model of colorectal cancer (CRC). We first show that MC38 cell line is a valid model for hypermutated and microsatellite-unstable (MSI) CRC. Analyses of longitudinal samples of wild type and immunodeficient RAG1 knockout mice transplanted with MC38 cells revealed that upregulation of checkpoint molecules and infiltration of Tregs are the major tumor escape mechanisms. Strikingly, the impact of neutral evolution on sculpting the tumor outweighed immunoediting. Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway potentiated immunoediting and rendered tumors more homogeneous in the MC38 model. The immunoediting effects were less pronounced in a nonhypermutated/MSI- model CT26. Our study demonstrates that neutral evolution is the major force that sculpts the tumor, and that checkpoint blockade effectively enforces T cell dependent immunoselective pressure in a hypermutated/MSI model of CRC.",

    "abstract": "The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia suppresses the capacity for arboviral transmission in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, and can spread through wild mosquito populations following local introductions. Recent introductions in Cairns, Australia have demonstrated slower than expected spread, that could be due to: i) barriers to Ae. aegypti dispersal; ii) leptokurtically distributed dispersal distances; and iii) intergenerational loss of Wolbachia. We investigated these three potential causes using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and an assay for the Wolbachia infection wMel in 161 Ae. aegypti collected from Cairns in 2015. We observed a significant barrier effect of Cairns highways on Ae. aegypti dispersal using distance-based redundancy analysis and patch-based simulation analysis. We detected putative full-siblings in ovitraps 1312m apart, suggesting long-distance female movement likely mediated by human transport. Finally, we found a pair of full-siblings of different infection status, suggesting loss of Wolbachia in the field. While the long-distance movement and Wolbachia loss currently represent single observations, these findings together with the identified dispersal barriers can contribute to the slow spread of Wolbachia through the Ae. aegypti population in Cairns. Our landscape genomics approach can be extended to other host/symbiont systems that are being considered for biocontrol.",

    "abstract": "Human evolution depends on the co-evolution between genetically determined behaviors and socially transmitted information. Although vertical transmission of cultural information from parent to off-spring is common in hominins, its effects on cumulative cultural evolution are not fully understood. Here, we investigate gene-culture co-evolution in a family-structured population by studying the invasion fitness of a mutant allele that influences a deterministic level of cultural information (e.g., amount of knowledge or skill) to which diploid carriers of the mutant are exposed in subsequent generations. We show that the selection gradient on such a mutant, and the concomitant level of cultural information it generates, can be evaluated analytically under the assumption that the cultural dynamic has a single attractor point, thereby making gene-culture co-evolution in family-structured populations with multigenerational effects mathematically tractable. We apply our result to study how genetically determined phenotypes of individual and social learning co-evolve with the level of adaptive information they generate under vertical transmission. We find that vertical transmission increases adaptive information due to kin selection effects, but when information is transmitted as efficiently between family members as between unrelated individuals, this increase is moderate in diploids. By contrast, we show that the way resource allocation into learning trades off with allocation into reproduction (the \\\"learning-reproduction trade-off\\\") significantly influences levels of adaptive information. We also show that vertical transmission prevents evolutionary branching and may therefore play a qualitative role in gene-culture co-evolutionary dynamics. More generally, our analysis of selection suggests that vertical transmission can significantly increase levels of adaptive information under the biologically plausible condition that information transmission between relatives is more efficient than between unrelated individuals.",

    "abstract": "Site-specific recombinases are potent tools to regulate gene expression. In particular, the Cre and FLP enzymes are widely used to either activate or inactivate genes in a precise spatiotemporal manner. Both recombinases work efficiently in the popular model organism Caenorhabditis elegans but their use in this nematode is still only sporadic. To increase the utility of the FLP system in C. elegans we have generated a series of single-copy transgenic strains that stably express an optimized version of FLP in specific tissues or by heat induction. We show that recombination efficiencies reach 100 percent in several cell types, such as muscles, intestine and serotonin producing neurons. Moreover, we demonstrate that most promoters drive recombination exclusively in the expected tissues. As examples of the potentials of the FLP lines we describe novel tools for induced cell ablation by expression of the PEEL-1 toxin and a versatile FLP-out cassette for generation of GFP-tagged conditional knockout alleles. Together with other recombinase-based reagents created by the C. elegans community this toolkit increases the possibilities for detailed analyses of specific biological processes at developmental stages inside intact animals.",

Our numerical simulations demonstrate that loss of contact inhibition is a sufficient mechanism, appropriate for an explanation of the increase in the proportion of tumor cells and generation of spatial patterns established in the conducted experiments.",

This definition implicitly assumes that the various niche signals are integrated towards a binary fate decision between stemness and differentiation. However, observations in multiple systems have demonstrated that stem cell properties such as proliferation and self renewal can be uncoupled at the level of niche signalling input, which is incompatible with this simplified view. We have studied the role of the transcriptional regulator Zfh1, a shared target of the Hedgehog and Jak/Stat niche signalling pathways, in the somatic stem cells of the Drosophila testis. We found that Zfh1 binds and downregulates salvador and kibra, two tumour suppressor genes of the Hippo/Wts/Yki pathway, thereby restricting Yki activation and proliferation to the Zfh1 positive stem cells. These observations provide an unbroken link from niche signal input to an individual aspect of stem cell behaviour that does not, at any step, involve a fate decision. We discuss the relevance of our observations and other reports in the literature for an overall concept of stemness and niche function.\\n\\nSummary statementWe demonstrate that the fly testis niche controls stem cell proliferation by repressing Hippo pathway genes independent of a binary cell fate decision between stemness and proliferation.",

    "abstract": "The selective impact of pathogen epidemics on host defenses can be strong but remains transient. By contrast, life-history shifts can durably and continuously modify the balance between costs and benefits of immunity, which arbitrates the evolution of host defenses. Their impact on the evolutionary dynamics of host immunity, however, has seldom been documented. Optimal investment into immunity is expected to decrease with shortening lifespan, because a shorter life decreases the probability to encounter pathogens or enemies. Here, we document that in natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana, the expression levels of immunity genes correlate positively with flowering time, which in annual species is a proxy for lifespan. Using a novel genetic strategy based on bulk-segregants, we partitioned flowering time-dependent from - independent immunity genes and could demonstrate that this positive co-variation can be genetically separated. It is therefore not explained by the pleiotropic action of some major regulatory genes controlling both immunity and lifespan. Moreover, we find that immunity genes containing variants reported to impact fitness in natural field conditions are among the genes whose expression co-varies most strongly with flowering time. Taken together, these analyses reveal that natural selection has likely assorted alleles promoting lower expression of immunity genes with alleles that decrease the duration of vegetative lifespan in A. thaliana and vice versa. This is the first study documenting a pattern of variation consistent with the impact that selection on flowering time is predicted to have on diversity in host immunity.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe Stopping Cavities Trial investigated effectiveness and safety of 38% silver diamine fluoride in arresting caries lesions.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsDouble-blind randomized placebo-controlled superiority trial with 2 parallel groups. Oregon preschools. 66 preschool children with [&ge;]1 lesion. 38% silver diamine fluoride or placebo (blue-tinted water), applied topically to the lesion. The primary endpoint was caries arrest (lesion inactivity, Nyvad criteria) 14-21 days post intervention. Dental plaque was collected from all children, and microbial composition was assessed by RNA sequencing from 2 lesions and 1 unaffected surface before treatment and at follow-up for 3 children from each group.\\n\\nResults and ConclusionMean fraction of arrested caries lesions in the silver diamine fluoride group was higher (0.72; 95% CI; 0.55, 0.84) than in the placebo group (0.05; 95% CI; 0.00, 0.16). Confirmatory analysis using generalized estimating equation log-linear regression, accounting for the number of treated surfaces and length of follow-up, indicated the fraction of arrested caries was significantly higher in the treatment group (relative risk, 17.3; 95% CI: 4.3 to 69.4). No harms were observed. RNA sequencing analysis identified no consistent changes in relative abundance of caries-associated microbes, nor emergence of antibiotic or metal resistance gene expression. Topical 38% silver diamine fluoride was effective and safe in arresting cavities in preschool children. The treatment is applicable to primary care practice and may reduce the burden of untreated tooth decay in the population.\\n\\nTrial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT02536040.\\n\\nClinical SignificanceIn this clinical trial, 72% of caries lesions were arrested by silver diamine fluoride, with no harms. Contrary to the presumed antibacterial mechanism, lesion bacterial composition changed negligibly. This simple topical treatment is applicable to primary care practice and may reduce the burden of untreated tooth decay in the population.",

    "abstract": "Nucleoplasmin 2 (npm2) is an essential maternal-effect gene that mediates early embryonic events through its function as a histone chaperone that remodels chromatin. Here we report the existence of two npm2 (npm2a and npm2b) genes in zebrafish. We examined the evolution of npm2a and npm2b in a variety of vertebrates, their potential phylogenetic relationships, and their biological functions using knockout models via the CRISPR/cas9 system. We demonstrated that the two npm2 duplicates exist in a wide range of vertebrates, including sharks, ray-finned fish, amphibians, and sauropsids, while npm2a was lost in Coelacanth and mammals, as well as some specific teleost lineages. Using phylogeny and synteny analyses, we traced their origins to the early stages of vertebrate evolution. Our findings suggested that npm2a and npm2b resulted from an ancient local gene duplication, and their functions diverged although key protein domains were conserved. We then investigated their functions by examining their tissue distribution in a wide variety of species and found that they shared ovarian-specific expression, a key feature of maternal-effect genes. We also showed that both npm2a and npm2b are maternally-inherited transcripts in vertebrates. Moreover, we used zebrafish knockouts to demonstrate that npm2a and npm2b play essential, but distinct, roles in early embryogenesis. npm2a functions very early during embryogenesis, at or immediately after fertilization, while npm2b is involved in processes leading up to or during zygotic genome activation. These novel findings will broaden our knowledge on the evolutionary diversity of maternal-effect genes and underlying mechanisms that contribute to vertebrate reproductive success.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe protein and transcript of the npm2 gene have been previously demonstrated as maternal contributions to embryos of several vertebrates. Recently, two npm2 genes, denoted here as npm2a and npm2b, were discovered in zebrafish. This study was conducted to explore the evolutionary origin and changes that occurred that culminated in their current functions. We found that an ancient local duplication of the ancestral npm2 gene created the current two forms, and while most vertebrates retained both genes, notably, mammals and certain species of fish lost npm2a and, albeit rarely, both npm2a and npm2b. Our functional analyses showed that npm2a and npm2b have diverse but essential functions during embryogenesis, as npm2a mutants failed to undergo development at the earliest stage while npm2b mutants developed, although abnormally, until the zygotic genome activation stage after which their development was arrested followed subsequently by death. Our study is the first to clearly demonstrate the evolution, diversification, and functional analyses of the npm2 genes, which are essential maternal factors that are required for proper embryonic development and survival.",

To achieve whole-brain recording with the ability to detect both small synaptic potentials and action potentials, we developed a voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging technique based on a double-sided microscope that can image two sides of a nervous system simultaneously. We applied this system to the segmental ganglia of the medicinal leech. Double-sided VSD imaging enabled simultaneous recording of membrane potential events from almost all of the identifiable neurons.

Here, we develop a quantitative imaging approach to study the protein aggregation process in living mammalian cells with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. We find that sub-diffractive precursor aggregates may form even in untreated cells, and their size distribution is exactly as predicted for a system undergoing a first order phase transition. Practically, this implies that as soon as aggregates reach a critical size (Rc = 162 {+/-} 4 nm untreated cells), they will spontaneously grow into large inclusions. Our data suggest that a previously uncharacterized, RuvBL1 dependent mechanism clears aggregates above the critical size. Our study unveils the existence of sub-diffractive aggregates in living cells; and the strong agreement between cellular data and a nucleation theory, based on first order phase transition, provides insight into regulatory steps in the early stages of aggregate formation in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) is a heterotrimeric transcription factor that consists of three subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC. Although NF-Ys play multiple roles in plant development, their functions during endosperm development are not well understood. In this study, we identified eight NF-Y encoding genes, including OsNF-YA8, OsNF-YB1,9, and OsNF-YC8,9,10,11,12, which predominantly express in the rice endosperm. Interestingly, the closest homologs of these OsNF-Ys are present only in the monocot species. All the genes are preferentially expressed in the endosperm, suggesting their roles in the regulation of endosperm development. A systemic analysis of the interactions between rice endosperm-preferential NF-Ys in yeast revealed that NF-YBs and NF-YCs could interact with each other. OsNF-YA8 is a recently evolved NF-YA in rice. Generally, NF-YA does not interact with NF-YB monomers in plants; however, in the present study, we found that OsNY-YA8 interacts with OsNF-YB9. Our results also indicated that the endosperm-preferential OsNF-YBs and OsNF-YCs could interact with some ethylene response factors (ERFs) of rice. Unlike the OsNF-YC8,9,10, the members of OsNF-YB1, 9 or OsNF-YC 11 and 12 showed lack of transcriptional activation when present alone. However, they displayed functional activity while in dimer form. In addition, OsNF-YB1 knockout lines showed significant changes in the seed morphology, further confirms its role in endosperm development. Our findings have provided strong evidences that the group of phylogenetically conserved NF-Ys are differentiated in monocots to regulate the endosperm development.",

    "abstract": "Coordinate-based meta-analysis can provide important insights into mind-brain relationships. A popular approach for curated small-scale meta-analysis is activation likelihood estimation (ALE), which identifies brain regions consistently activated across a selected set of experiments, such as within a functional domain or mental disorder. ALE can also be utilized in meta-analytic co-activation modeling (MACM) to identify brain regions consistently co-activated with a seed region. Therefore, ALE aims to find consensus across experiments, treating heterogeneity across experiments as noise. However, heterogeneity within an ALE analysis of a functional domain might indicate the presence of functional sub-domains. Similarly, heterogeneity within a MACM analysis might indicate the involvement of a seed region in multiple co-activation patterns that are dependent on task contexts. Here, we demonstrate the use of the author-topic model to automatically determine if heterogeneities within ALE-type meta-analyses can be robustly explained by a small number of latent patterns. In the first application, the author-topic modeling of experiments involving self-generated thought (N = 179) revealed cognitive components fractionating the default network. In the second application, the author-topic model revealed that the left inferior frontal junction (IFJ) participated in multiple task-dependent co-activation patterns (N = 323). Furthermore, the author-topic model estimates compared favorably with spatial independent component analysis in both simulation and real data. Overall, the results suggest that the author-topic model is a flexible tool for exploring heterogeneity in ALE-type meta-analyses that might arise from functional sub-domains, mental disorder subtypes or task-dependent co-activation patterns.

    "abstract": "With ongoing global change, life is continuously forced to move to novel areas, which leads to dynamically changing species ranges. As dispersal is central to range dynamics, factors promoting fast and distant dispersal are key to understanding and predicting species ranges. During range expansions, genetic variation is depleted at the expanding front. Such conditions should reduce evolutionary potential, while increasing kin competition. Organisms able to recognise relatives may be able to assess increased levels of relatedness at expanding range margins and to increase their dispersal in a plastic manner. Using individual-based simulations and experimental range expansions of a spider mite, we demonstrate that plastic responses to kin structure can be at least as important as evolution in driving range expansion speed. Because recognition of kin or kind is increasingly documented across the tree of life, we anticipate it to be a highly important but neglected driver of range expansions.",

Here, we genotyped a cohort of 696 healthy individuals from several distinct ancestral origins and a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that there is no statistically significant association between microbiome composition and ethnicity, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or overall genetic similarity, and that only 5 of 211 (2.4%) previously reported microbiome-SNP associations replicate in our cohort. In contrast, we find similarities in the microbiome composition of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household. We define the term biome-explainability as the variance of a host phenotype explained by the microbiome after accounting for the contribution of human genetics. Consistent with our finding that microbiome and host genetics are largely independent, we find significant biome-explainability levels of 16-33% for body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), and lactose consumption. We further show that several human phenotypes can be predicted substantially more accurately when adding microbiome data to host genetics data, and that the contribution of both data sources to prediction accuracy is largely additive.

    "abstract": "Intracellular signaling pathways not only control cell proliferation and survival, but also regulate the provision of cellular energy and building blocks through mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial metabolism. Wild-type and oncogenic RAF kinases have been shown to prevent apoptosis following the removal of interleukin 3 (IL-3) from mouse pro-myeloid 32D cells by reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. To study primary effects of RAF on mitochondrial energy metabolism, we applied high-resolution respirometry after short-term IL-3 deprivation (8 h), before 32D cells show detectable signs of cell death. Respiration in intact 32D cells was suppressed as an early event following removal of IL-3, but remained more stable in 32D cells expressing the v-RAF oncogene. In permeabilized 32D cells deprived of IL-3, respiratory capacities of the NADH-pathway, the convergent NADH&succinate-pathway, and Complex IV activity were decreased compared to cells grown in the presence of IL-3, whereas succinate-supported respiration remained unchanged, consistent with control by Complex IV. The apparent Complex IV excess capacity was zero above NADH&succinate-pathway capacity reconstituting tricarboxylic acid cycle function. In comparison, electron flow reached only 60% when supported by succinate alone through Complexes II, III and IV, and was therefore relatively insensitive to Complex IV injuries up to a threshold of 40% inhibition. A slight increase in respiration following addition of cytochrome c, a marker of mitochondrial outer membrane leakage, was present after IL-3 depletion, indicating mitochondrial fragility. Our results highlight a novel link between the key mitogenic and survival kinase CRAF and mitochondrial energy homeostasis.",

How TFs dynamically orchestrate genome architecture and transcription as a cell adopts a new identity during reprogramming is not well understood. Here we show that MYOD1-mediated reprogramming of human fibroblasts into the myogenic lineage undergoes a critical transition, which we refer to as a bifurcation point, where cell identity definitively changes. By integrating knowledge of genome-wide dynamical architecture and transcription, we found significant chromatin reorganization prior to transcriptional changes that marked activation of the myogenic program. We also found that the local architectural and transcriptional dynamics of endogenous MYOD1 and MYOG reflected the global genomic bifurcation event. These TFs additionally participate in entrainment of biological rhythms. Understanding the system-level genome dynamics underlying a cell fate decision is a step toward devising more sophisticated reprogramming strategies that could be used in cell therapies.",

We assessed spontaneous predispositions in newly-hatched, visually-naive chicks, by comparing responses to a stuffed hen vs. a scrambled version of it.

The grass subfamily Pooideae dominates the grass flora of the temperate regions, but the role of cold-response gene regulation in the transitioning from tropical to temperate climate remains unexplored.\\n\\nResultsTo establish if molecular responses to cold are conserved throughout the phylogeny, we assembled the transcriptomes of five Pooideae species spanning early to later diverging lineages, and compared short- and long-term cold responsive genes using 8633 high confidence ortholog groups with resolved gene tree topologies. We found that a majority of cold responsive genes were specific to one or two lineages, an observation that we deem incompatible with a cold adapted Pooideae ancestor. However, all five species shared short-term cold response in a small set of general stress genes as well as the ability to down-regulate the photosynthetic machinery during cold temperatures.\\n\\nConclusionsOur observations indicate that the different Pooideae lineages have assembled cold response programs in parallel by taking advantage of a common potential for cold adaptation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe spatial Principal Component Analysis (sPCA, Jombart 2008) is designed to investigate non-random spatial distributions of genetic variation. Unfortunately, the associated tests used for assessing the existence of spatial patterns (global and local test; Jombart et al. 2008) lack statistical power and may fail to reveal existing spatial patterns. Here, we present a non-parametric test for the significance of specific patterns recovered by sPCA.\\n\\nResultsWe compared the performance of this new test to the original global and local tests using datasets simulated under classical population genetic models. Results show that our test outperforms the original global and local tests, exhibiting improved statistical power while retaining similar, and reliable type I errors. Moreover, by allowing to test various sets of axes, it can be used to guide the selection of retained sPCA components.\\n\\nConclusionsAs such, our test represents a valuable complement to the original analysis, and should prove useful for the investigation of spatial genetic patterns.",

The simplicity and adaptability of t-CyCIF makes it an effective method for pre-clinical and clinical research and a natural complement to single-cell genomics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe stress activated protein kinases (SAPKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, are important players in cell fate decisions in response to environmental stress signals. Crosstalk signaling between JNK and p38 is emerging as an important regulatory mechanism in the inflammatory and stress responses. However, it is still unknown how this crosstalk affects signaling dynamics, cell-to-cell variation, and cellular responses at the single-cell level. To address these questions, we established a multiplexed live-cell imaging system based on kinase translocation reporters to simultaneously monitor JNK and p38 activities with high specificity and sensitivity at single-cell resolution. Various stresses, such as anisomycin, osmotic stress, and UV irradiation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines activated JNK and p38 with various dynamics. In all cases, however, p38 suppressed JNK activity in a cross-inhibitory manner. We demonstrate that p38 antagonizes JNK through both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. This cross-inhibition of JNK appears to generate cellular heterogeneity in JNK activity after stress exposure. Our data indicate that this heterogeneity in JNK activity plays a role in fractional killing in response to UV stress. Our highly sensitive multiplexed imaging system enables detailed investigation into the p38-JNK interplay in single cells.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryCross-inhibition by p38 generates cell-to-cell variability in JNK activity.",

    "abstract": "Steady axonal cargo flow is central to the functioning of healthy neurons. However, a substantial fraction of cargo in axons remains stationary across a broad distribution of times. We examine the transport of pre-synaptic vesicles (pre-SVs), endosomes and mitochondria in C. elegans touch receptor neurons (TRNs), showing that stalled cargo are predominantly present at actin-rich regions along the neuronal process. Cargo stalled at actin-rich regions increase the propensity of moving cargo to stall at the same location, resulting in traffic jams. Such local traffic jams at actin-rich regions are likely to be a general feature of axonal transport since they occur in Drosophila neurons as well. These traffic jams can act as both sources and sinks of vesicles. We propose that they act as functional reservoirs that contribute to maintaining robust cargo flow in the neuron.",

In total, 7 Trichoderma isolates were evaluated for their biological fitness and antagonism towards 2 different P. noxius isolates associated with Senegal mahogany and rain tree in Singapore. The competitive ability of various Trichoderma isolates was assessed by their germination rates, growth rates, and chlamydospore production; and the antagonism of P. noxius by Trichoderma was assessed by the interaction of these fungi in dual culture and on wood blocks. In this study, the Trichoderma isolates showed greater competitiveness and antagonism towards P. noxius compared to similar reports in the literature. A majority of the Trichoderma isolates germinated and grew at consistently high rates, but there was considerable variability in the production of chlamydospores among isolates. All Trichoderma isolates routinely antagonized P. noxius in the different bioassays, but there was significant variability in the antagonistic capacity of various isolates and in the susceptibility of the P. noxius isolates to confrontation with Trichoderma. Relative to the controls, P. noxius cultures grew significantly slower in the presence of volatile organic compounds emitted by most Trichoderma isolates, and a large majority of Trichoderma isolates caused a significant reduction to the dry weight loss of wood blocks inoculated with P. noxius. Although no single Trichoderma isolate consistently antagonized P. noxius better than all others in every test, T. harzianum 9132 and T. virens W23 notably did so more regularly than others.",

    "abstract": "Genes are  born, and eventually they  die. In contrast to gene birth, however, gene death has found only limited scientific interest, even though it is of considerable evolutionary importance. Here we use Bsister genes, a subfamily of MIKC-type MADS-box genes, as a model to investigate gene death in unprecedented detail. Typical MIKC-type genes encode conserved transcription factors controlling plant development. We show that ABS-like genes, a clade of Bsister genes, are indeed highly conserved in Brassicaceae maintaining the ancestral function of Bsister genes in ovule and seed development. In contrast, their closest paralogs, the GOA-like genes, have been undergoing convergent gene death in Brassicaceae. Intriguingly, erosion of GOA-like genes occurred after millions of years of co-existence with ABS-like genes. We thus describe Delayed Convergent Asymmetric Degeneration (DCAD), a so far neglected but possibly frequent pattern of duplicate gene evolution that does not fit classical scenarios. DCAD of GOA-like genes may have been initiated by a reduction in the expression of an ancestral GOA-like gene in the stem group of Brassicaceae and driven by dosage subfunctionalization. Our findings have profound implications for gene annotations in genomics, interpreting patterns of gene evolution and using genes in phylogeny reconstructions of species.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication is a major source of functional innovations and genome complexity, albeit this evolutionary process requires the preservation of duplicates in the genomes for long time. However, the population genetic mechanisms governing this preservation, especially in the critical very initial phase, have remained largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that gene duplication confers per se a weak selective advantage in scenarios of fitness trade-offs. Through a precise quantitative description of a model system, we show that a second gene copy enhances the information transfer from the environmental signal to the phenotypic response by reducing gene expression inaccuracies derived from pervasive molecular noise and suboptimal gene regulation. We then reveal that such a phenotypic accuracy yields a selective advantage in the order of 0.1% on average, which would allow the positive selection of gene duplication in populations with moderate or large sizes. This advantage is greater at higher noise levels and intermediate concentrations of the environmental molecule, when fitness trade-offs become more evident. Moreover, we show that the genome rearrangement rates greatly condition the eventual fixation of duplicated genes, either by natural selection or by random genetic drift. Overall, our theoretical results highlight an original adaptive value for cells carrying new-born duplicates, broadly analyze the selective conditions that determine their early fates in different organisms, and reconcile population genetics with evolution by gene duplication.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEGene duplication is considered a major driver for the evolution of biological complexity. However, it is still enigmatic to what extent natural selection and genetic drift have governed this evolutionary process. This work uncovers a selective advantage for genotypes carrying duplicates, called phenotypic accuracy, widely characterized thanks to a multi-scale mathematical model coupling gene regulation with population genetics. Importantly, the integrative results presented here provide a detailed mechanistic description for the fixation of duplicates, which allows making predictions about the genome architectures, and which is relevant to understand the origins of complexity.",

    "abstract": "Y chromosome function, structure and evolution is poorly understood in many species including the Anopheles genus of mosquitoes, an emerging model system for studying speciation that also represents the major vectors of malaria. While the Anopheline Y had previously been implicated in male mating behavior, recent data from the Anopheles gambiae complex suggests that, apart from the putative primary sex-determiner, no other genes are conserved on the Y. Studying the functional basis of the evolutionary divergence of the Y chromosome in the gambiae complex is complicated by complete F1 male hybrid sterility. Here we used an F1xF0 crossing scheme to overcome a severe bottleneck of male hybrid incompatibilities and enabled us to experimentally purify a genetically labelled A. gambiae Y chromosome in an A. arabiensis background. Whole genome sequencing confirmed that the A. gambiae Y retained its original sequence content in the A. arabiensis genomic background. In contrast to comparable experiments in Drosophila, we find that the presence of a heterospecific Y chromosome has no significant effect on the expression of A. arabiensis genes and transcriptional differences can be explained almost exclusively as a direct consequence of transcripts arising from sequence elements present on the A. gambiae Y chromosome itself. We find that Y hybrids show no obvious fertility defects and no substantial reduction in male competitiveness. Our results demonstrate that, despite their radically different structure, Y chromosomes of these two species of the gambiae complex that diverged an estimated 1.85Myr ago function interchangeably, thus indicating that the Y chromosome does not harbor loci contributing to hybrid incompatibility. Therefore, Y chromosome gene flow between members of the gambiae complex is possible even at their current level of divergence. Importantly, this also suggests that malaria control interventions based on sex-distorting Y drive would be transferable, whether intentionally or contingent, between the major malaria vector species.",

    "abstract": "The developmental switch to sporulation in Physarum polycephalum is a phytochrome-mediated far-red light-induced cell fate decision that synchronously encompasses the entire multinucleate plasmodial cell and is associated with extensive reprogramming of the transcriptome. By repeatedly taking samples of single cells after delivery of a light stimulus pulse, we analysed differential gene expression in two mutant strains and in a heterokaryon of the two strains all of which display a different propensity for making the cell fate decision. Multidimensional scaling of the gene expression data revealed individually different single cell trajectories eventually leading to sporulation. Characterization of the trajectories as walks through states of gene expression discretized by hierarchical clustering allowed the reconstruction of Petri nets that model and predict the observed behavior. Structural analyses of the Petri nets indicated stimulus- and genotype-dependence of both, single cell trajectories and of the quasipotential landscape through which these trajectories are taken. The Petri net-based approach to the analysis and decomposition of complex cellular responses and of complex mutant phenotypes may provide a scaffold for the data-driven reconstruction of causal molecular mechanisms that shape the topology of the quasipotential landscape.",

After much debate about this process, reliability-based integration has recently been proposed and several models of smooth pursuit now include recurrent Bayesian integration or Kalman filtering. However, there is a lack of behavioral evidence supporting these theoretical predictions.\\n\\nHere, we independently manipulated the reliability of visual and prior information in a smooth pursuit task. Our results show that both smooth pursuit eye velocity and catch-up saccade amplitude were modulated by visual and prior information reliability.\\n\\nWe interpret these findings as the continuous reliability-based integration of a short-term memory of target motion with visual information, which support modelling work. Furthermore, we suggest that saccadic and pursuit systems share this short-term memory. We propose that this short-term memory of target motion is quickly built and continuously updated, and constitutes a general building-block present in all sensorimotor systems.",

Due to the complexity of native cytoplasm, the development of artificial bioreactors and cellular mimics to compartmentalize, concentrate and control the local physicochemical properties is of great interest. Here, we employ self-assembling polypeptide coacervates to explore the partitioning of the ubiquitous cytoskeletal protein actin into liquid polymer-rich droplets. We find that actin spontaneously partitions into coacervate droplets and is enriched by up to {approx}30-fold. Actin polymerizes into micrometer-long filaments and, in contrast to the globular protein BSA, these filaments localize predominately to the droplet periphery. We observe up to a 50-fold enhancement in the actin filament assembly rate inside coacervate droplets, consistent with the enrichment of actin within the coacervate phase. Together these results suggest that coacervates can serve as a versatile platform in which to localize and enrich biomolecules to study their reactivity in physiological environments.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTLiving cells harbor many protein-rich membrane-less organelles, the biological functions of which are defined by compartment composition and properties. Significant differences between the physico-chemical properties of these crowded compartments and the dilute solutions in which biochemical reactions are traditionally studied pose a major challenge for understanding regulation of organelle composition and component activity. Here, we report the spontaneous partitioning and accelerated polymerization of the cytoskeletal protein actin inside model polypeptide coacervates as a proof-of-concept demonstration of coacervates as bioreactors for studying biomolecular reactions in cell-like environments.

    "abstract": "In fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, pheromone signalling engages a GPCR-Ras-MAPK cascade to trigger sexual differentiation leading to gamete fusion. Cell-cell fusion necessitates local cell wall digestion, the location of which relies on an initially dynamic actin fusion focus that becomes stabilized upon local enrichment of the signalling cascade. We constructed a live-reporter of active Ras1 (Ras1-GTP), also functional in S. cerevisiae, which revealed Ras activity at polarity sites peaking on the fusion structure before fusion. Remarkably, constitutive Ras1 activation promoted fusion focus stabilization and fusion attempts irrespective of cell-cell pairing, leading to cell lysis. Ras1 activity is restricted by the GTPase activating protein (GAP) Gap1, itself recruited to sites of Ras1-GTP. While the GAP domain on its own does not suffice for this localization, its recruitment to Ras1-GTP sites is essential to block untimely fusion attempts. We conclude that negative feedback control of Ras activity restrains the MAPK signal and couples fusion with cell-cell engagement.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY STATEMENTGene expression at the Drosophila midgut-hindgut boundary is a hybrid of both organs. Hybrid cells repress stem cell division, but boundary injury activates stem cell division through inter-organ JAK-STAT signaling.\\n\\nABSTRACTThe molecular identities and regulation of cells at inter-organ boundaries are often unclear, despite the increasingly appreciated role of organ boundaries in disease. Using Drosophila as a model, here we show that a specific population of adult midgut organ boundary intestinal stem cells (OB-ISCs) is regulated by the neighboring hindgut, a developmentally distinct organ. This distinct OB-ISCs control is due to proximity to a specialized transition zone between the endodermal midgut and ectodermal hindgut that shares molecular signatures of both organs, which we term the hybrid zone (HZ). During homeostasis, proximity to the HZ restrains OB-ISC proliferation. However, injury to the adult HZ/hindgut drives up-regulation of upaired-3 cytokine and OB-ISC hyperplasia. If HZ disruption is severe, hyperplastic OB-ISCs expand across the inter-organ boundary. Our data suggest that inter-organ signaling plays an important role in controlling OB-ISCs in homeostasis and injury repair, which is likely critical in prevention of disease.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplications (WGD) are important evolutionary events. Our understanding of underlying mechanisms, including the evolution of duplicated genes after WGD, however remains incomplete. Teleost fish experienced a common WGD (teleost-specific genome duplication, or TGD) followed by a dramatic adaptive radiation leading to more than half of all vertebrate species. The analysis of gene expression patterns following TGD at the genome level has been limited by the lack of suitable genomic resources. The recent concomitant release of the genome sequence of spotted gar (a representative of holosteans, the closest lineage of teleosts that lacks the TGD) and the tissue-specific gene expression repertoires of over 20 holostean and teleostean fish species, including spotted gar, zebrafish and medaka (the PhyloFish project), offered a unique opportunity to study the evolution of gene expression following TGD in teleosts. We show that most TGD duplicates gained their current status (loss of one duplicate gene or retention of both duplicates) relatively rapidly after TGD (i.e. prior to the divergence of medaka and zebrafish lineages). The loss of one duplicate is the most common fate after TGD with a probability of approximately 80%. In addition, the fate of duplicate genes after TGD, including subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, or retention of two  similar copies occurred not only before, but also after the radiation of species tested, in consistency with a role of the TGD in speciation and/or evolution of gene function. Finally, we report novel cases of TGD ohnolog subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization that further illustrate the importance of these processes.",

    "abstract": "Spike sorting is a critical first step in extracting neural signals from large-scale electrophysiological data. This manuscript describes an efficient, reliable pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), where neural signals appear across many electrodes and spike sorting currently represents a major computational bottleneck. We present several new techniques that make dense MEA spike sorting more robust and scalable. Our pipeline is based on an efficient multi-stage \\\"triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit\\\" approach that initially extracts only clean, high-quality waveforms from the electrophysiological time series by temporarily skipping noisy or \\\"collided\\\" events (representing two neurons firing synchronously). This is accomplished by developing a neural network detection method followed by efficient outlier triaging. The clean waveforms are then used to infer the set of neural spike waveform templates through nonparametric Bayesian clustering. Our clustering approach adapts a \\\"coreset\\\" approach for data reduction and uses efficient inference methods in a Dirichlet process mixture model framework to dramatically improve the scalability and reliability of the entire pipeline. The \\\"triaged\\\" waveforms are then finally recovered with matching-pursuit deconvolution techniques. The proposed methods improve on the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and stability on both real and biophysically-realistic simulated MEA data. Furthermore, the proposed pipeline is efficient, learning templates and clustering much faster than real-time for a [~=] 500-electrode dataset, using primarily a single CPU core.",

    "abstract": "Several metabolic enzymes undergo reversible polymerization into macromolecular assemblies. The function of these assemblies is often unclear but in some cases they regulate enzyme activity and metabolic homeostasis. The guanine nucleotide biosynthetic enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) forms octamers that polymerize into helical chains. In mammalian cells, IMPDH filaments can associate into micron-length assemblies. Polymerization and enzyme activity are regulated in part by binding of purine nucleotides to an allosteric regulatory domain. ATP promotes octamer polymerization, whereas GTP promotes a compact, inactive conformation whose ability to polymerize is unknown. An open question is whether polymerization directly alters IMPDH catalytic activity. To address this, we identified point mutants of human IMPDH2 that either prevent or promote polymerization. Unexpectedly, we found that polymerized and non-assembled forms of IMPDH have comparable catalytic activity, substrate affinity, and GTP sensitivity and validated this finding in cells. Electron microscopy revealed that substrates and allosteric nucleotides shift the equilibrium between active and inactive conformations in both the octamer and the filament. Unlike other metabolic filaments, which selectively stabilize active or inactive conformations, IMPDH filaments accommodate multiple states. Thus, although polymerization alone does not impact catalytic activity, substrate availability and purine balance dramatically affect IMPDH filament architecture.",

Here we determined the mechanism underlying that initial observation. We show that T6S-dependent export of multiple self-recognition proteins is abrogated in this mutant strain.

The two TNF superfamily members, APRIL and BAFF even though were primarily studied for their role in lymphocyte maturation, their presence in a number of normal and cancer solid tumors including breast cancer revealed an association with tumor growth and aggressiveness. Methods: In the present work, we have explored the role of APRIL and BAFF in breast tumor development, progression and metastasis as well as resistance to therapy. We studied their effect on the epithelial to mesenchymal transition and migration of breast cancer cells, and their action on the important sub-population of cancer stem cells identified by autofluorescence and ALDH activity. Their action on an number of pluripotency genes was examined and breast cancer stem cell ability to form mammospheres was also utilized. The receptor and the signaling pathway involved were also investigated as well as the role of steroid hormones in their action. Results: Our findings show that in breast cancer both APRIL and BAFF increase epithelial to mesenchymal transition and migratory capacity, as well as cancer stem cell numbers, by inducing pluripotency genes such as KLF4 and NANOG. These effects were mediated by their common receptor BCMA and the JNK signaling pathway. Interestingly, androgens enhance APRIL transcription and subsequently its pluripotency effect. Conclusions: All these data support the significant role of APRIL and BAFF in breast cancer disease progression and provide evidence for a new possible mechanism of therapy resistance, especially in aromatase inhibitors-treated patients, were local androgen is increased.",

    "abstract": "Regenerating tissue must initiate the signaling that drives regenerative growth, and sustain that signaling long enough for regeneration to complete. How these key signals are sustained is unclear. To gain a comprehensive view of the changes in gene expression that occur during regeneration, we performed wholegenome mRNAseq of actively regenerating tissue from damaged Drosophila wing imaginal discs. We used genetic tools to ablate the wing primordium to induce regeneration, and carried out transcriptional profiling of the regeneration blastema by fluorescent labeling and sorting the blastema cells, thus identifying differentially expressed genes. Importantly, by using genetic mutants of several of these differentially expressed genes we have confirmed that they have roles in regeneration. Using this approach, we show that high expression of the gene moladietz (mol), which encodes the Duox-maturation factor NIP, is required during regeneration to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn sustain JNK signaling during regeneration. We also show that JNK signaling upregulates mol expression, thereby activating a positive feedback signal that ensures the prolonged JNK activation required for regenerative growth. Thus, by wholegenome transcriptional profiling of regenerating tissue we have identified a positive feedback loop that regulates the extent of regenerative growth.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRegenerating tissue must initiate the signaling that drives regenerative growth, and then sustain that signaling long enough for regeneration to complete. Drosophila imaginal discs, the epithelial structures in the larva that will form the adult animal during metamorphosis, have been an important model system for tissue repair and regeneration for over 60 years. Here we show that damage-induced JNK signaling leads to the upregulation of a gene called moladietz, which encodes a co-factor for an enzyme, NADPH dual oxidase (DUOX), that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), a key tissue-damage signal. High expression of moladietz induces continuous production of ROS in the regenerating tissue. The sustained production of ROS then continues to activate JNK signaling throughout the course of regeneration, ensuring maximal tissue regrowth.",

    "abstract": "Cells of multi-cellular organisms evolve toward uni-cellularity in the form of cancer and, if humans intervene, continue to evolve in cell culture. During this process, gene dosage relationships may evolve in novel ways to cope with the new environment and may regress back to the ancestral unicellular state. In this context, the evolution of sex chromosomes vis-a-vis autosomes is of particular interest. Here, we report the chromosomal evolution in ~600 cancer cell lines. Many of them jettisoned either Y or the inactive X; thus, free-living male and female cells converge by becoming \\\"de-sexualized\\\". Surprisingly, the active X often doubled, accompanied by the addition of one haploid complement of autosomes, leading to an X:A ratio of 2:3 from the extant ratio of 1:2. Theoretical modeling of the frequency distribution of X:A karyotypes suggests that the 2:3 ratio confers a higher fitness and may reflect aspects of sex chromosome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Grid cells are a special class of spatial cells found in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) characterized by their strikingly regular hexagonal firing fields. This spatially periodic firing pattern was originally considered to be invariant to the geometric properties of the environment. However, this notion was contested by examining the grid cell periodicity in environments with different polarity (Krupic et al 2015) and in connected environments (Carpenter et al 2015). Aforementioned experimental results demonstrated the dependence of grid cell activity on environmental geometry. Analysis of grid cell periodicity on practically infinite variations of environmental geometry imposes a limitation on the experimental study. Hence we analyze the grid cell periodicity from a computational point of view using a model that was successful in generating a wide range of spatial cells, including grid cells, place cells, head direction cells and border cells. We simulated the model in four types of environmental geometries such as: 1) connected environments, 2) convex shapes, 3) concave shapes and 4) regular polygons with varying number of sides. Simulation results point to a greater function for grid cells than what was believed hitherto. Grid cells in the model code not just for local position but also for more global information like the shape of the environment. The proposed model is interesting not only because it was able to capture the aforementioned experimental results but, more importantly, it was able to make many important predictions on the effect of the environmental geometry on the grid cell periodicity.",

    "abstract": "Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a brush-on treatment for tooth decay that stops 81% of cavitated caries lesions (dental cavities). Before this innovation, caries was treatable only with operative approaches (dental fillings). SDF-treated lesions harden and become resistant to further decay. We hypothesized that the hardening is due to reaction with silver, rather than classic fluoride-mediated remineralization, because infected dentin is not amenable to remineralization. Using synchrotron microCT with 1.3 m resolution, we observe filamentous densities up to 500 m in length and 0.25-7.0 m in diameter, formed in situ by applying SDF to caries lesions. We show that these \\\"microwires\\\" fill voids in the lesion caused by disease, and permeate through surrounding dentinal tubules. Using spectroscopy, we confirm that the chemical composition of the observed microwires is predominantly silver. To our knowledge, this represents the first structural microscale observations resulting from clinical SDF treatment. These novel observations hint at mechanistic explanations for the first clinical method to harden carious dentin besides remineralization. We hypothesize that SDF may not only achieve its antimicrobial functions by biochemical interactions, but also through its inherent ability to integrate into dentin.",

    "abstract": "t-Darpp is a protein encoded by the PPP1R1B gene and is expressed in breast, colon, esophageal, gastric, and prostate cancers, as well as in normal adult brain striatal cells. Overexpression of t-Darpp in cultured cells leads to increased protein kinase A activity and increased phosphorylation of AKT (protein kinase B). In HER2+ breast cancer cells t-Darpp confers resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent trastuzumab. To shed light on t-Darpp function, we studied its secondary structure, oligomerization status, metal-binding properties, and phosphorylation by cyclin dependent kinases 1 and 5. t-Darpp exhibits 12% alpha helix, 29% beta strand, 24% beta turn and 35% random coil structures. t-Darpp binds to calcium, but not to other metals commonly found in biological systems. The T39 site, critical for t-Darpp activation of the AKT signaling pathway, is a substrate for phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). Gel filtration chromatography, sedimentation equilibrium analysis, blue native gel electrophoresis, and glutaraldehyde-mediated crosslinking experiments demonstrate that the majority of t-Darpp exists as a monomer, but forms low levels (< 3%) of hetero-oligomers with its longer isoform Darpp-32. t-Darpp has a large Stokes radius of 4.4 nm relative to its mass of 19 kDa, indicating that it has an elongated structure.",

    "abstract": "Beta-hairpins are a substructure found in proteins that can lend insight into more complex systems. Furthermore, the folding of beta-hairpins is a valuable test case for benchmarking experimental and theoretical methods. Here, we simulate the folding of CLN025, a miniprotein with a beta-hairpin structure, at its experimental melting temperature using a range of state-of-the-art protein force fields. We construct Markov state models in order to examine the thermodynamics, kinetics, mechanism, and rate-determining step of folding. Mechanistically, we find the folding process is rate-limited by the formation of the turn region hydrogen bonds, which occurs following the downhill hydrophobic collapse of the extended denatured protein. These results are presented in the context of established and contradictory theories of the beta-hairpin folding process. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the AMBER-FB15 force field, at this temperature, best describes the characteristics of the full experimental CLN025 conformational ensemble, while the AMBER ff99SB-ILDN and CHARMM22* force fields display a tendency to overstabilize the native state.",

JQ1 potently inhibits growth of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in culture at low nM concentrations. Growth of other cell lines with similar EBV type III latency transcription programs is comparably inhibited. JQ1 also slows tumor development of an LCL xenograft in immunocompromised mice, but oncogene repression is not observed in endpoint biopsies. We find reduction of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease in an animal model encouraging of further studies.",

    "abstract": "Formins are a conserved group of proteins that nucleate and processively elongate actin filaments. Among them, the formin homology domain-containing protein (FHOD) family of formins contributes to contractility of striated muscle and cell motility in several contexts. However, the mechanisms by which they carry out these functions remain poorly understood. Unlike other formins, mammalian FHOD1 and FHOD3 do not accelerate actin assembly in vitro, and have instead been suggested to act as barbed end cappers or bundlers. Here, we show that purified Drosophila Fhod, in contrast with the mammalian homologues, potently accelerates actin assembly by nucleation. We found that Fhod binds tightly to barbed ends, where it slows elongation in the absence of profilin and allows elongation in the presence of profilin. Fhod protects barbed ends from capping protein, but dissociates from barbed ends relatively quickly. Finally, we used cosedimentation assays to determine that Fhod binds the sides of actin filaments and bundles filaments. This work establishes that Fhod shares the capacity of other formins to nucleate and bundle actin filaments, but is notably less effective at processively elongating barbed ends.",
