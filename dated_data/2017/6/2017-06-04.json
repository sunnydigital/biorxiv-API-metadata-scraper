    "abstract": "How does experience inform decisions? In episodic sampling, decisions are guided by a few episodic memories of past choices. This process can yield choice patterns similar to model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL); however, samples can vary from trial to trial, causing decisions to vary. Here, we show that context retrieved during episodic sampling can cause choice behavior to deviate sharply from the predictions of RL. Specifically, we show that, when a given memory is sampled, choices (in the present) are influenced by the properties of other decisions made in the same context as the sampled event. This effect is mediated by fMRI measures of context retrieval on each trial, suggesting a mechanism whereby cues trigger retrieval of context, which then triggers retrieval of other decisions from that context. This result establishes a new avenue by which experience can guide choice, and as such has broad implications for the study of decisions.",

    "abstract": "We provide evidence that decisions are made by consulting memories for individual past experiences, and that this process can be biased in favor of past choices using incidental reminders. First, in a standard rewarded choice task, we show that a model that estimates value at decision-time using individual samples of past outcomes fits choices and decision-related neural activity better than a canonical incremental learning model. In a second experiment, we bias this sampling process by incidentally reminding participants of individual past decisions. The next decision after a reminder shows a strong influence of the action taken and value received on the reminded trial. These results provide new empirical support for a decision architecture that relies on samples of individual past choice episodes rather than incrementally averaged rewards in evaluating options, and has suggestive implications for the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The elemental content of a soybean seed is a determined by both genetic and environmental factors and is an important component of its nutritional value. The elemental content is chemically stable, making the samples stored in germplasm repositories an intriguing source of experimental material. To test the efficacy of using samples from germplasm banks for gene discovery, we analyzed the elemental profile of seeds from 1653 lines in the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection. We observed large differences in the elemental profiles based on where the lines were grown, which lead us to break up the genetic analysis into multiple small experiments. Despite these challenges, we were able to identify candidate SNPs controlling elemental accumulation as well as lines with extreme elemental accumulation phenotypes. Our results suggest that elemental analysis of germplasm samples can identify SNPs in linkage disequilibrium to genes, which can be leveraged to assist in crop improvement efforts.",

    "abstract": "Quorum sensing (QS), where bacteria secrete and respond to chemical signals to coordinate population-wide behaviors, has revealed that bacteria are highly social. Here, we investigate how diversity in QS signals and receptors can modify social interactions controlled by the QS system regulating bacteriocin secretion in Streptococcus pneumoniae, encoded by the blp operon (bacteriocin-like peptide). Analysis of 4 096 pneumococcal genomes detected nine blp QS signals (BlpC) and five QS receptor groups (BlpH). Imperfect concordance between signals and receptors suggested widespread social interactions between cells, specifically eavesdropping (where cells respond to signals that they do not produce) and crosstalk (where cells produce signals that non-clones detect). This was confirmed in vitro by measuring the response of reporter strains containing each of six different blp QS receptors to cognate and non-cognate peptides. Assays between pneumococcal colonies grown adjacent to one another provided further evidence that crosstalk and eavesdropping occur at endogenous levels of signal secretion. Finally, simulations of QS strains producing bacteriocins revealed that eavesdropping can be evolutionarily beneficial even when the affinity for non-cognate signals is very weak. Our results highlight that social interactions can mediate intraspecific competition among bacteria and reveal that competitive interactions can be modified by polymorphic QS systems.",

    "abstract": "MotivationShort-read sequencing enables assessment of genetic and biochemical traits of individual genomic regions, such as the location of genetic variation, protein binding, and chemical modifications. Every region in a genome assembly has a property called mappability which measures the extent to which it can be uniquely mapped by sequence reads. In regions of lower mappability, estimates of genomic and epigenomic characteristics from sequencing assays are less reliable. At best, sequencing assays will produce misleadingly low numbers of reads in these regions. At worst, these regions have increased susceptibility to spurious mapping from reads from other regions of the genome with sequencing errors or unexpected genetic variation. Bisulfite sequencing approaches used to identify DNA methylation exacerbate these problems by introducing large numbers of reads that map to multiple regions. While many tools consider mappability during the read mapping process, subsequent analysis often loses this information. Both to correct assumptions of uniformity in downstream analysis, and to identify regions where the analysis is less reliable, it is necessary to know the mappability of both ordinary and bisulfite-converted genomes.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce the Umap software for identifying uniquely mappable regions of any genome. Its Bismap extension identifies mappability of the bisulfite-converted genome. With a read length of 24 bp, 18.7% of the unmodified genome and 33.5% of the bisulfite-converted genome is not uniquely mappable. This complicates interpretation of functional genomics experiments using short-read sequencing, especially in regulatory regions. For example, 81% of human CpG islands overlap with regions that are not uniquely mappable. Similarly, in some ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets, up to 50% of peaks overlap with regions that are not uniquely mappable. We also explored differentially methylated regions from a case-control study and identified regions that were not uniquely mappable. In the widely used 450K methylation array, 4,230 probes are not uniquely mappable. Genome mappability is higher with longer sequencing reads, but most publicly available ChIP-seq and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing datasets have shorter reads. Therefore, uneven and low mappability remains a concern in a majority of existing data.\\n\\nAvailabilityA Umap and Bismap track hub for human genome assemblies GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38, and mouse assemblies GRCm37/mm9 and GRCm38/mm10 is available at http://bismap.hoffmanlab.org for use with the UCSC and Ensembl genome browsers.

In vitro, islets of Hv1-de[fi]cient and heterozygous mice, INS-1 (832/13) cells with siRNA-mediated knockdown of Hv1 exhibit a marked defect in glucose- and K+-induced insulin secretion. Hv1 de[fi]ciency decreases both insulin and proinsulin contents, and limits glucose-induced Ca2+ entry and membrane depolarization. Furthermore, loss of Hv1 increases insulin-containing granular pH and decreases cytosolic pH. In addition, histologic studies show a decrease in {beta} cell mass in islets of Hv1-deficient mice. Collectively, our results indicate that Hv1 supports insulin secretion in the {beta} cell by calcium entry, membrane depolarization and intracellular pH regulation.",

    "abstract": "The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and related apicomplexan pathogens contain an essential plastid organelle, the apicoplast, which is a key anti-parasitic target. Derived from secondary endosymbiosis, the apicoplast depends on novel, but largely cryptic, mechanisms for protein/lipid import and organelle inheritance during parasite replication. These critical biogenesis pathways present untapped opportunities to discover new parasite-specific drug targets. We used an innovative screen to identify actinonin as having a novel mechanism-of-action inhibiting apicoplast biogenesis. Resistant mutation, chemical-genetic interaction, and biochemical inhibition demonstrate that the unexpected target of actinonin in P. falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii is FtsH1, a homolog of a bacterial membrane AAA+ metalloprotease. Pf FtsH1 is the first novel factor required for apicoplast biogenesis identified in a phenotypic screen. Our findings demonstrate that FtsH1 is a novel and, importantly, druggable antimalarial target. Development of FtsH1 inhibitors will have significant advantages with improved drug kinetics and multistage efficacy against multiple human parasites.",

By sequencing bacterial 16S ribosomal cDNA, we characterized sequential changes in the carriage status, the nasal microbiota, and the hosts antimicrobial peptide expression up to 90 days after decolonization.\\n\\nResultsBefore mupirocin use, the nasal microbiota differed by the initial, culture-based staphylococcal carriage status, with Firmicutes (54.1%) being the most predominant in carriers and Proteobacteria (75.8%) in the only noncarrier. The nasal microbiota became less diverse (Shannon diversity: 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.54) immediately after decolonisation than that before decolonisation (1.78, 95%CI: 0.58-1.93). Based on results of differential abundance analysis, Firmicutes were significantly enriched (log2 fold changes [&ge;] 4, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P < .01) while Actinobacteria, particularly Corynbebacterium, were relatively depleted in samples from staphylococcal carriers. Results of nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and constrained correspondence analysis (CCA) also suggested that the initial staphylococcal carriage status, human neutrophil peptide 1 levels, and sampling times were major contributors to the between-community dissimilarities (P for marginal permutation test: .014) though the significance attenuated when within-group correlation was considered (P for blocked permutation test: .047).\\n\\nConclusionThese findings suggest that large-scale investigations on antibiotic effects on the human nasal microbiota are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Bistable optical emission has been observed for photosynthetic purple non-sulfur bacteria Rhodobacter capsulatus SB1003. The microbes respond to UV excitation (at 395nm) in a bifurcating way one branch corresponding to increase and the other corresponding to diminishing fluorescent emission in the range 590-685nm.The switching between such bifurcating branches can be observed when parameters like concentration, temperature are varied or static magnetic field is applied. Thus switching from amplification to reduction occurs if fluorophore concentration lowered. Again if temperature is lowered a steady quenching (instead of amplification) of fluorescence is observed. However presence of magnetic field of the order of 0.5 T reverts this and once again the systems resumes its fluoresence amplifying state. We propose that aggregation of bacterial porphyrin and regulation of such aggregation by photon excitation may explain this bistablity. Possible ecological implication of the photosynthetic bistability is suggested.",

    "abstract": "The emerging single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the investigation of transcriptomic landscapes at single-cell resolution. The analysis of scRNA-seq data is complicated by excess zero or near zero counts, the so-called dropouts due to the low amounts of mRNA sequenced within individual cells. Downstream analysis of scRNA-seq would be severely biased if the dropout events are not properly corrected. We introduce scImpute, a statistical method to accurately and robustly impute the dropout values in scRNA-seq data. ScImpute automatically identifies gene expression values affected by dropout events, and only perform imputation on these values without introducing new bias to the rest data. ScImpute also detects outlier or rare cells and excludes them from imputation. Evaluation based on both simulated and real scRNA-seq data on mouse embryos, mouse brain cells, human blood cells, and human embryonic stem cells suggests that scImpute is an effective tool to recover transcriptome dynamics masked by dropout events. scImpute is shown to correct false zero counts, enhance the clustering of cell populations and subpopulations, improve the accuracy of differential expression analysis, and aid the study of gene expression dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Working memory requires information about external stimuli to be represented in the brain even after those stimuli go away. This information is encoded in the activities of neurons, and neural activities change over timescales of tens of milliseconds. Information in working memory, however, is retained for tens of seconds, suggesting the question of how time-varying neural activities maintain stable representations. Prior work shows that, if the neural dynamics are in the  null space of the representation - so that changes to neural activity do not affect the downstream read-out of stimulus information - then information can be retained for periods much longer than the time-scale of individual-neuronal activities. The prior work, however, requires precisely constructed synaptic connectivity matrices, without explaining how this would arise in a biological neural network. To identify mechanisms through which biological networks can self-organize to learn memory function, we derived biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rules that dynamically modify the connectivity matrix to enable information storing. Networks implementing this plasticity rule can successfully learn to form memory representations even if only 10% of the synapses are plastic, they are robust to synaptic noise, and they can represent information about multiple stimuli.",

Longitudinal behavioural assessments offer an alternative. We modelled longitudinal observational data on shelter dog behaviour using the framework of behavioural reaction norms, partitioning variance into personality (i.e. inter-individual differences in behaviour), plasticity (i.e. individual differences in behavioural change) and predictability (i.e. individual differences in residual intra-individual variation). We analysed data on 3,263 dogs interactions (N = 19,281) with unfamiliar people during their first month after arrival at the shelter. Accounting for personality, plasticity (linear and quadratic trends) and predictability improved the predictive accuracy of the analyses compared to models quantifying personality and/or plasticity only. While dogs were, on average, highly sociable with unfamiliar people and sociability increased over days since arrival, group averages were unrepresentative of all dogs and predictions made at the individual level entailed considerable uncertainty. Effects of demographic variables (e.g. age) on personality, plasticity and predictability were observed. Behavioural repeatability was higher one week after arrival compared to arrival day. Our results highlight the value of longitudinal assessments on shelter dogs and identify measures that could improve the predictive validity of behavioural assessments in shelters.",

Locomotion in the circular arena could be classified into four components: counter-clockwise walking, clockwise walking, nondirectional walking and pausing. Genetic analysis revealed that while wild-type genetic background was associated with reduced directional change and reduced numbers of one-way (including counterclockwise and clockwise) and nondirectional walks, the white (w+) locus promoted persistent oneway walking by increasing the maximal duration of one-way episodes. The promoting effect of w+ was further supported by the observations that (1) w+ duplicated to the Y chromosome, (2) four genomic copies of mini-white inserted on the autosomes, and (3) pan-neuronal overexpression of the White protein increased the maximal duration of one-way episodes, and that RNAi knockdown of w+ in the neurons decreased the maximal duration of one-way episodes. These results suggested a pleiotropic function of w+ in promoting persistent one-way walking in the circular arena.",

Most methods tackle this problem in two steps by using an alignment-free approach: first the DNA sequences are represented as points of a real n-dimensional space via a mapping function then either clustering or classification algorithms are applied. Those mapping functions require to be genomic signatures: the dissimilarity between the mapped points must reflect the degree of phylogenetic similarity of the source species. Designing good signatures for metagenomics can be challenging due to the special characteristics of metagenomic sequences; most of the existing signatures were not designed accordingly and they were tested only on error-free sequences sampled from a few dozens of species.\\n\\nIn this work we analyze comparatively the goodness of existing and novel signatures based on tetranu-cleotide frequencies via statistical models and computational experiments; we also study how they are affected by the generalized Chargaffs second parity rule (GCSPR), which states that in a given sequence longer than 50kbp, inverse oligonucleotides are approximately equally frequent. We analyze 38 million sequences of 150 bp-1,000 bp with 1% base-calling error, sampled from 1,284 microbes. Our models indicate that GCSPR reduces strand-dependence of signatures, that is, their values are less affected by the source strand; GCSPR is further exploited by some signatures to reduce the intra-species dispersion. Two novel signatures stand out both in the models and in the experiments: the combination signature and the operation signature. The former achieves strand-independence without grouping oligonucleotides; this could be valuable for alignment-free sequence comparison methods when distinguishing inverse oligonucleotides matters. Operation signature sums the frequencies of reverse, complement, and inverse tetranucleotides; having 72 features it reduces the computational intensity of the analysis.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence indicates that innate immune pathway activation is critical for responses to immunotherapy and overall cancer prognosis. It has been posited that innate immunity in the tumor microenvironment can be driven by derepression of endogenous repetitive element RNA. The ability to characterize these species can potentially provide novel predictive biomarkers for tumor immune responses and a mechanistic basis for elements of innate activation by tumors. We first compared total RNA and poly(A)-capture protocols applied to tumor RNA-sequencing to detect non-RNA coding transcriptomes in the TCGA. While the poly(A) protocol efficiently detects coding, most non-coding genes, and much of the LINE/SINE/ERV repeat repertoire, we found that it fails to capture overall repeat expression and co-expression. The probing of total RNA expression reveals distinct repetitive co-expression subgroups. Secondly, we found that total repeat element expression delivers the most dynamic changes in samples, which may serve as more robust biomarkers of clinical outcomes. Finally, we show that while expression of ERVs, but not other immunostimulatory repeats such as HSATII, is associated with response to immunotherapy in a cohort of patients with urothelial cancer treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy, global repeat derepression strongly correlates with an immunosuppressive phenotype in the microenvironment of colorectal and pancreatic tumors. We validate in situ in human primary tumors, associating the immunosuppressive phenotype with HSATII expression. In conclusion, we demonstrate the importance of analyzing repetitive element RNAs as potential biomarkers of response to immunotherapy and the need to better characterize these features in next generation sequencing protocols.",

But our empirical knowledge of these networks is typically incomplete, and the space of simulation models and parameters is vast, leaving room for uncertainty in theoretical predictions. Here, we show that a large fraction of this space of possibilities exhibits generic behaviors that are robust to modelling choices. We consider a wide array of model features, including interaction types and community structures, known to generate different dynamics for a few species. We combine these features in large simulated communities, and show that equilibrium diversity, functioning and stability can be predicted analytically using a random model parameterized by a few statistical properties of the community. We give an ecological interpretation of this \\\"disordered\\\" limit where structure fails to emerge from complexity. We also demonstrate that some well-studied interaction patterns remain relevant in large ecosystems, but their impact can be encapsulated in a minimal number of additional parameters. Our approach provides a powerful framework for predicting the outcomes of ecosystem assembly and quantifying the added value of more detailed models and measurements.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid enrichment is an increasingly popular approach for obtaining hundreds of loci for phylogenetic analysis across many taxa quickly and cheaply. The genes targeted for sequencing are typically single-copy loci, which facilitate a more straightforward sequence assembly and homology assignment process. However, single copy loci are relatively uncommon elements of most genomes, and as such may provide a biased evolutionary history. Furthermore, this approach limits the inclusion of most genes of functional interest, which often belong to multi-gene families. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of including large gene families in hybrid enrichment protocols for phylogeny reconstruction and subsequent analyses of molecular evolution, using a new set of bait sequences designed for the \\\"portullugo\\\" (Caryophyllales), a moderately sized lineage of flowering plants (~2200 species) that includes the cacti and harbors many evolutionary transitions to C4 and CAM photosynthesis. Including multi-gene families allowed us to simultaneously infer a robust phylogeny and construct a dense sampling of sequences for a major enzyme of C4 and CAM photosynthesis, which revealed the accumulation of adaptive amino acid substitutions associated with C4 and CAM origins in particular paralogs. Our final set of matrices for phylogenetic analyses included 75-218 loci across 74 taxa, with ~50% matrix completeness across datasets. Phylogenetic resolution was greatly improved across the tree, at both shallow and deep levels. Concatenation and coalescent-based approaches both resolve with strong support the sister lineage of the cacti: Anacampserotaceae + Portulacaceae, two lineages of mostly diminutive succulent herbs of warm, arid regions. In spite of this congruence, BUCKy concordance analyses demonstrated strong and conflicting signals across gene trees for the resolution of the sister group of the cacti. Our results add to the growing number of examples illustrating the complexity of phylogenetic signals in genomic-scale data.",

The methods used to derive polygenic risk scores from common SNPs are not suitable for variants detected in whole exome sequencing studies. Rare variants which may have major effects are seen too infrequently to judge whether they are associated and may not be shared between training and test subjects. A method is proposed whereby variants are weighted according to their frequency, their annotations and to the genes they affect. A weighted sum across all variants provides an individual risk score. Scores constructed in this way are used in a weighted burden test and are shown to be significantly different between schizophrenia cases and controls using a five-way cross validation procedure. This approach represents a first attempt to summarise exome sequence variation into a summary risk score, which could be combined with risk scores from common variants and from environmental factors.

Genetic diversity and resistance to drought stress of this plant has made it widely scattered in different regions which contains highly genetic diversity and great potential as fodder and can grow on salty, drought affected areas. Since the soil salinity has become widely spread. environmental concern has sparked so many debates. An important limiting factor in agricultural production worldwide is the sensitivity of most of the crop to salinity caused by high concentration of salts soil. Plants use three different strategies to prevent and adapt to high Na+ concentrations. Antiporters are important category of genes that play a pivotal role in ion homeostasis in plants. Na+/H+ antiporters (NHX1 and SOS1) are located in tonoplasts and reduce cytosolic Na+ concentration by pumping in the vacuole whereas SOS1 is localized at the plasma membrane and extrudes Na+ in apoplasts. Coding sequence of plasma membrane Na +/H + antiporter (SOS1) and vacuole membrane Na /+H + antiporter (NHX) in Kochia scoparia were isolated using conserved sequences of SOS1 and NHX. Also, expression profile under salinity stress was studied in this study. The amino acid sequences (aa) of the isolated region of K.SSOS1 and K.SNHX showed the maximum identity up to 84% and 90% to its orthologue in salicornia brachiata and suadea maritima, respectively. The results of semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that salinization has affected positively on SOS1 transcription level. The expression of K.SSOS1 and K.SNHX in leaves and roots of Kochia scoparia were progressively increased under all salinity levels compared to control. The results suggest that K.SSOS1 and K.SNHX play an essential role in salt tolerance of K.scoparia and they can be useful to improve salt tolerance in other crops.",

Current techniques for diagnosing, curing or simply understanding the biology of the parasite are few and far between, relying on a combination of in-silico predictions modelled on a varied and unique group of organisms and medical reports. The development of an in-vitro culture system, using COLO-680N cells, has provided the Cryptosporidium community with the opportunity to expand its toolkit for investigating this disease. One area in particular that is sorely overlooked is the metabolic alterations upon infection. Existing research is extremely limited and has already shown that significant variation can be found between the metabolome of different infected host species. Using a 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance approach to metabolomics, we have explored the nature of the mouse gut metabolome as well as providing the first insight into the metabolome of an infected cell line. Through a combination of Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis and predictive modelling, we exhibit new and potentially game changing insights into the effects of a Cryptosporidium parvum infection, while verifying the presence of known metabolic changes. Of particular note is the potential contribution of host derived taurine to the diuretic aspects of the disease previously attributed to a solely parasite based alteration of the gut environment. This practical and informative approach can spearhead our understanding of the Cryptosporidium-host metabolic exchange and thus provide novel targets for tackling this deadly parasite.",

    "abstract": "A key limitation for achieving deep imaging in biological structures lies in photon absorption and scattering leading to attenuation of fluorescence. In particular, neurotransmitter imaging is challenging in the biologically-relevant context of the intact brain, for which photons must traverse the cranium, skin and bone. Thus, fluorescence imaging is limited to the surface cortical layers of the brain, only achievable with craniotomy. Herein, we describe optimal excitation and emission wavelengths for through-cranium imaging, and demonstrate that near-infrared emissive nanosensors can be photoexcited using a two-photon 1560 nm excitation source. Dopamine-sensitive nanosensors can undergo two-photon excitation, and provide chirality-dependent responses selective for dopamine with fluorescent turn-on responses varying between 20% and 350%. We further calculate the two-photon absorption cross-section and quantum yield of dopamine nanosensors, and confirm a two-photon power law relationship for the nanosensor excitation process. Finally, we show improved image quality of the nanosensors embedded 2 mm deep into a brain-mimetic tissue phantom, whereby one-photon excitation yields 42% scattering, in contrast to 4% scattering when the same object is imaged under two-photon excitation. Our approach overcomes traditional limitations in deep-tissue fluorescence microscopy, and can enable neurotransmitter imaging in the biologically-relevant milieu of the intact and living brain.",

    "abstract": "Fertilization triggers release from meiotic arrest and initiates events that prepare for the ensuing developmental program. Protein degradation and phosphorylation are known to regulate protein activity during this process. However, the full extent of protein loss and phospho-regulation is still unknown. We examined absolute protein and phospho-site dynamics after fertilization by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. To do this, we developed a new approach for calculating the stoichiometry of phospho-sites from multiplexed proteomics that is compatible with dynamic, stable and multi-site phosphorylation. Overall, the data suggest that degradation is limited to a few low abundance proteins. However, this degradation promotes extensive dephosphorylation that occurs over a wide range of abundances during meiotic exit. We also show that eggs release a large amount of protein into the medium just after fertilization, most likely related to the blocks to polyspermy. Concomitantly, there is a substantial increase in phosphorylation likely tied to calcium activated kinases. We identify putative degradation targets as well as new components of the block to polyspermy. The analytical approaches demonstrated here are broadly applicable to studies of dynamic biological systems.\\n\\nSignificance StatementProtein phosphorylation and degradation drive critical events in early embryogenesis and the cell cycle; however, comprehensive and accurate analysis of these changes is currently difficult. Using a mass spectrometric approach, we present a quantitative view of the protein and posttranslational economy of the fertilization response in the frog egg. Protein degradation affects a small but very important class of proteins, while regulatory phosphorylation and protein release occur on a far larger scale.

    "abstract": "Chronic bacterial infections present a serious threat to the health of humans by decreasing life expectancy and quality. Resilience of these populations is closely linked to a small fraction of persister cells that are capable of surviving a wide range of environmental stressors that include starvation, DNA damage, heat shock, and antibiotics. In contrast to inherited resistance, persistence arises from a rare and reversible phenotypic change that protects the cell for one or a few generations. The frequency and character of persistence is controlled in part by the dynamics of numerous toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules, operons with an evolutionarily conserved motif including a toxin that slows cell growth and an antitoxin that can neutralize the toxin. While many such modules have been identified and studied in a wide range of organisms, relatively little consideration of the interactions between multiple TA modules within a single host has been made. Particularly, a multitude of different protein-based antitoxin species are known to be actively degraded by a limited number of shared proteolytic pathways, strongly suggesting interaction via competition between antitoxins for degradation machinery. Here we present a theoretical understanding of the dynamics of multiple TA modules whose activity is coupled through either proteolytic activity, a toxic effect on cell growth rate, or both. We also present a generalizable theoretical mechanism by which a toxic state is tunable by regulation of proteolysis. Such regulation or indirect coordination between multiple TA modules may be at the heart of the flexibility and robustness observed for bacterial persistence.",

    "abstract": "STING, an ER resident cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) receptor, plays an important role in innate immune response signaling. Upon binding to CDNs, it activates the TBK1-IRF3 signaling axis, which stimulates gene expression including interferon beta. We hypothesized that the ER localization of STING reflects a role for calcium mobilization in its signaling. To test this hypothesis, we treated mouse cells with two STING agonists, the synthetic drug DMXAA and a natural ligand, cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), and measured intracellular calcium. Both triggered a rapid rise in intracellular calcium that was partially inhibited by STING depletion. Intracellular calcium chelation blocked DMXAA induced signaling downstream of STING activation, but had no effect on cGAMP induced signaling. We propose that intracellular calcium plays an important role in the response of the STING pathway. In response to DMXAA, calcium is mobilized form the ER and required for signaling. In the case of cGAMP calcium is mobilized but not required. This difference could be explained by alternative modes of STING activation for the two ligands, or a combination of STING-dependent and -independent actions of extracellular cGAMP.",

    "abstract": "An open question in human evolution is the importance of polygenic adaptation: adaptive changes in the mean of a multifactorial trait due to shifts in allele frequencies across many loci. In recent years, several methods have been developed to detect polygenic adaptation using loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Though powerful, these methods suffer from limited interpretability: they can detect which sets of populations have evidence for polygenic adaptation, but are unable to reveal where in the history of multiple populations these processes occurred. To address this, we created a method to detect polygenic adaptation in an admixture graph, which is a representation of the historical divergences and admixture events relating different populations through time. We developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to infer branch-specific parameters reflecting the strength of selection in each branch of a graph. Additionally, we developed a set of summary statistics that are fast to compute and can indicate which branches are most likely to have experienced polygenic adaptation. We show via simulations that this method - which we call PolyGraph - has good power to detect polygenic adaptation, and applied it to human population genomic data from around the world. We also provide evidence that variants associated with several traits, including height, educational attainment, and self-reported unibrow, have been influenced by polygenic adaptation in different populations during human evolution.",
