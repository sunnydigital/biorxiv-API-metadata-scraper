    "abstract": "Population genomic datasets collected over the past decade have spurred interest in developing methods that can utilize massive numbers of loci for inference of demographic and selective histories of populations. The allele frequency spectrum (AFS) provides a convenient statistic for such analysis and accordingly much attention has been paid to predicting theoretical expectations of the AFS under a number of different models. However, to date, exact solutions for the joint AFS of two or more populations under models of migration and divergence have not been found. Here we present a novel Markov chain representation of the coalescent on the state space of the joint AFS that allows for rapid, exact calculation of the joint AFS under isolation with migration (IM) models. In turn, we show how our Markov chain method, in the context of composite likelihood estimation, can be used for accurate inference of parameters of the IM model using SNP data. Lastly, we apply our method to recent whole genome datasets from African Drosophila melanogaster.",

    "abstract": "Focal epilepsy involves excessive cortical activity that propagates both locally and distally. Does this propagation follow the same routes as normal cortical activity? We pharmacologically induced focal seizures in primary visual cortex (V1) of awake mice, and compared their propagation to the retinotopic organization of V1 and higher visual areas. We used simultaneous local field potential recordings and widefield imaging of a genetically encoded calcium indicator to measure prolonged seizures (ictal events) and brief interictal events. Both types of event are orders of magnitude larger than normal visual responses, and both start as standing waves: synchronous elevated activity in the V1 focus and in homotopic locations in higher areas, i.e. locations with matching retinotopic preference. Following this common beginning, however, seizures persist and propagate both locally and into homotopic distal regions, and eventually invade all of visual cortex and beyond. We conclude that seizure initiation resembles the initiation of interictal events, and seizure propagation respects the connectivity underlying normal visual processing.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community in Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100025). Reproductive interference is considered a strong ecological force, potentially leading to species exclusion. This supposes that the net effect of reproductive interactions is strongly negative for one of the species involved. Testing this requires a comprehensive analysis of interspecific reproductive interactions, accounting for the order and timing of mating events, and for their effects on either fertility or fecundity. To this aim, we measured reproductive interactions between a focal species, Tetranychus urticae, and an invasive (T.evansi) and a resident (T. ludeni) species, varying the mating sequence and interval, and measuring the effect of such crosses on fecundity and offspring sex ratio (a measure of fertility, as these species are haplodiploid). We found that mating with heterospecifics affected fecundity and sex ratio negatively, but also positively, depending on the species involved, and on the order and timing of mating events. Overall, the net effect of reproductive interactions was weak despite strong effects of particular events. In natural situations, the outcome of reproductive interactions will thus hinge upon the frequency of each event.",

    "abstract": "Puttick et al. [1] performed a simulation study to compare accuracy among methods of inferring phylogeny from discrete morphological characters. They report that a Bayesian implementation of the Mk model [2] was most accurate (but with low resolution), while a maximum likelihood (ML) implementation of the same model was least accurate. They conclude by strongly advocating that Bayesian implementations of the Mk model should be the default method of analysis for such data. While we appreciate the authors attempt to investigate the accuracy of alternative methods of analysis, their conclusion is based on an inappropriate comparison of the ML point estimate, which does not consider confidence, with the Bayesian consensus, which incorporates estimation credibility into the summary tree. Using simulation, we demonstrate that ML and Bayesian estimates are concordant when confidence and credibility are comparably reflected in summary trees, a result expected from statistical theory. We therefore disagree with the conclusions of PEA and consider their prescription of any default method to be poorly founded. Instead, we recommend caution and thoughtful consideration of the model or method being applied to a morphological dataset.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated many low-penetrance loci in schizophrenia. However, its pathological mechanisms are poorly understood, which in turn hampers the development of novel pharmacological treatments. Pathway and gene set analyses carry the potential to generate hypotheses about disease mechanisms and have provided biological context to genome-wide data of schizophrenia. We aimed to examine which biological processes are likely candidates to underlie schizophrenia by integrating novel and powerful pathway analysis tools using data from the largest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia GWAS (N = 79 845) and the most recent 2018 schizophrenia GWAS (N = 105 318). By applying a primary unbiased analysis (Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation; MAGMA) to weigh the role of biological processes from the MSigDB database, we identified enrichment of common variants in synaptic plasticity and neuron differentiation gene sets. We supported these findings using MAGMA, Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of variaNT Associations (MAGENTA) and Interval Enrichment Analysis (INRICH) on detailed synaptic signaling pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and found enrichment in mainly the dopaminergic and cholinergic synapses. Moreover, shared genes involved in these neurotransmitter systems had a large contribution to the observed enrichment, protein products of top genes in these pathways showed more direct and indirect interactions than expected by chance, and expression profiles of these genes were largely similar among brain tissues. In conclusion, we provide strong and consistent genetics and protein-interaction informed evidence for the role of postsynaptic signaling processes in schizophrenia, opening avenues for future translational and psychopharmacological studies.",

    "abstract": "Tendon injuries heal via scar tissue rather than regeneration. This healing response forms adhesions between the flexor tendons in the hand and surrounding tissues, resulting in impaired range of motion and hand function. Mechanistically, inflammation has been strongly linked to adhesion formation, and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is associated with both adhesion formation and tendinopathy. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that deletion of the PGE2 receptor EP4 in S100a4-lineage cells would decrease adhesion formation. S100a4-Cre; EP4flox/flox (EP4cKOS100a4) repairs healed with improved gliding function at day 14, followed by impaired gliding at day 28, relative to wild type. Interestingly, EP4cKOS100a4 resulted in only transient deletion of EP4, suggesting up-regulation of EP4 in an alternative cell population in these mice. Loss of EP4 in Scleraxis-lineage cells did not alter gliding function, suggesting that Scx-lineage cells are not the predominant EP4 expressing population. In contrast, a dramatic increase in -SMA+, EP4+ double-positive cells were observed in EP4cKOS100a4 suggesting that EP4cKOS100a4 repairs heal with increased infiltration of EP4 expressing -SMA myofibroblasts, identifying a potential mechanism of late up-regulation of EP4 and impaired gliding function in EP4cKOS100a4 tendon repairs.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic control of cell polarity is of critical importance for many aspects of cellular development and motility. In Myxococcus xanthus, a G-protein and its cognate GTPase-activating protein establish a polarity axis that defines the direction of movement of the cell and which can be rapidly inverted by the Frz chemosensory system. Although vital for collective cell behaviours, how Frz triggers this switch has remained unknown. Here, we use genetics, imaging and mathematical modelling to show that Frz controls polarity reversals via a gated relaxation oscillator. FrzX, which we newly identify as the primary Frz output, provides the gating and thus acts as the trigger for reversals. Slow relocalisation of the polarity protein RomR then creates a refractory period during which another switch cannot be triggered. A secondary Frz output, FrzZ, decreases this delay allowing rapid reversals when required. This architecture thus results in a highly tunable switch that allows a wide range of motility responses.",

    "abstract": "The metazoan genome is compartmentalized in megabase-scale areas of highly interacting chromatin known as topologically associating domains (TADs), typically identified by computational analyses of Hi-C sequencing data. TADs are demarcated by boundaries that are largely conserved across cell types and even across species, although, increasing evidence suggests that the seemingly invariant TAD boundaries may exhibit plasticity and their insulating strength can vary. However, a genome-wide characterization of TAD boundary strength in mammals is still lacking. A systematic classification and characterization of TAD boundaries may generate new insights into their function. In this study, we first use fused two-dimensional lasso as a machine learning method to improve Hi-C contact matrix reproducibility, and, subsequently, we categorize TAD boundaries based on their insulation score. We demonstrate that higher TAD boundary insulation scores are associated with elevated CTCF levels and that they may differ across cell types. Intriguingly, we observe that super-enhancer elements are preferentially insulated by strong boundaries, i.e. boundaries of higher insulation score. Furthermore, we perform a pan-cancer analysis to demonstrate that strong TAD boundaries and super-enhancer elements are frequently co-duplicated in cancer patients. Taken together, our findings suggest that super-enhancers insulated by strong TAD boundaries may be exploited, as a functional unit, by cancer cells to promote oncogenesis.",

We found that the number of clusters on the maternalallele was positively correlated with maternal age and that these consist of more individual mutations with larger intra-mutational distances compared to paternal clusters. More than 50% of maternal clusters were located on chromosomes 8, 9 and 16, in regions with an overall increased maternal mutation rate. Maternal clusters in these regions showed a distinct mutation signature characterized by C>G mutations. Finally, we found that maternal clusters associate with processes involving double-stranded-breaks (DSBs) such as meiotic gene conversions and de novo deletions events. These findings suggest accumulation of DSB-induced mutations throughout oocyte aging as an underlying mechanism leading to maternal mutation clusters.",

    "abstract": "E. Coli AlkB catalyzes the direct dealkylation of various alkylated bases in damaged DNA. The diffusion of molecular Oxygen to the active site in AlkB is an essential step for the oxidative dealkylation activity. Despite detailed studies on the stepwise oxidation mechanism of AlkB, there is no conclusive picture of how O2 molecules reach the active site of the protein. Yu et al. (Nature, 439, 879) proposed the existence of an intra-molecular tunnel based on their initial crystal structures of AlkB. We have employed computational simulations to investigate possible migration pathways inside AlkB for O2 molecules. Extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, including explicit ligand sampling and potential of mean force (PMF) calculations, have been performed to provide a microscopic description of the O2 delivery pathway in AlkB. Analysis of intra-molecular tunnels using the CAVER software indicates two possible pathways for O2 to diffuse into the AlkB active site. Explicit ligand sampling simulations suggests that only one of these tunnels provides a viable route. The free energy path for an oxygen molecule to travel along each of these tunnels has been determined with AMBER and AMOEBA. Both PMFs indicate passive transport of O2 from the surface of the protein. However, the inclusion of explicit polarization shows a very large barrier for diffusion of the co-substrate out of the active site, compared with the non-polarizable potential. In addition, our results suggest that the mutation of a conserved residue along the tunnel, Y178, has dramatic effects on the dynamics of AlkB and on the transport of O2 along the tunnel.",

TRIBE expresses an RBP of interest fused to the catalytic domain (cd) of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR and performs Adenosine-to-Inosine editing on RNA targets of the RBP. However, target identification is limited by the low editing efficiency of the ADARcd. Here we describe HyperTRIBE, which carries a previously characterized hyperactive mutation (E488Q) of the ADARcd. HyperTRIBE identifies dramatically more editing sites, many of which are also edited by TRIBE but at a much lower editing frequency. HyperTRIBE therefore more faithfully recapitulates the known binding specificity of its RBP than TRIBE. In addition, separating RNA binding from the enhanced editing activity of the HyperTRIBE ADAR catalytic domain sheds light on the mechanism of ADARcd editing as well as the enhanced activity of the HyperADARcd.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that neurons in sensorimotor circuits involved in perceptual decision-making also play a role in decision confidence. In these studies, confidence is often considered to be an optimal readout of the probability that a decision is correct. However, the information leading to decision accuracy and the report of confidence often co-varied, leaving open the possibility that there are actually two dissociable signal types in the brain: signals that correlate with decision accuracy (optimal confidence) and signals that correlate with subjects behavioral reports of confidence (subjective confidence). We recorded neuronal activity from a sensorimotor decision area, the superior colliculus (SC) of monkeys, while they performed two different tasks. In our first task, decision accuracy and confidence co-varied, as in previous studies. In our second task, we implemented a novel motion discrimination task with stimuli that were matched for decision accuracy but produced different levels of confidence as reflected by behavioral reports. We used a multivariate decoder to predict monkeys choices from neuronal population activity. As in previous studies on perceptual decision-making mechanisms, we found that neuronal decoding performance increased as decision accuracy increased. However, when decision accuracy was matched, performance of the decoder was similar between high and low subjective confidence conditions. These results show that the SC likely signals optimal decision confidence similar to previously reported cortical mechanisms, but is unlikely to play a critical role in subjective confidence. The results also motivate future investigations to determine where in the brain signals related to subjective confidence reside.\\n\\nSignificance StatementConfidence is thought to reflect the rational or optimal belief concerning ones choice accuracy. Here, we introduce a novel version of the dot-motion discrimination task with stimulus conditions that produce similar accuracy but different subjective behavioral reports of confidence. We decoded decision performance of this task from neuronal signals in the superior colliculus (SC), a subcortical region involved in decision-making. We found that SC activity signaled a perceptual decision for visual stimuli, with the strength of this activity reflecting decision accuracy, but not the subjective level of confidence as reflected by behavioral reports. These results demonstrate an important role for the SC in perceptual decision-making and challenge current ideas about how to measure subjective confidence in monkeys and humans.",

Pseudotemporal ordering of 1023 cellular responses to manipulation of sensory input demonstrates that changes in expression of activity-induced genes both reinforced cell-type identity and contributed to increased transcriptional heterogeneity within each cell type. This is due to cell-type specific biases in the choice of transcriptional states following manipulation of neuronal activity. These results reveal that axonal projection pattern, laminar position, and activity state define significant axes of variation that contribute both to the transcriptional identity of individual neurons and to the transcriptional heterogeneity within each neuronal subtype.",

Despite considerable genomic resources, mechanistic understanding of biological processes in Anopheles has been hampered by a lack of tools for reverse genetics. Here, we report successful application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for highly efficient, site-specific mutagenesis in the diverse malaria vectors Anopheles albimanus, Anopheles coluzzii, and Anopheles funestus. When guide RNAs and Cas9 are injected at high concentration, germline mutations are common and usually bi-allelic allowing for the rapid creation of stable, mutant lines for reverse genetic analysis. Our protocol should enable researchers to dissect the molecular and cellular basis of anopheline traits critical to successful disease transmission, potentially exposing new targets for malaria control.",

    "abstract": "Much of the functional diversity observed in modern enzyme superfamilies originates from molecular tinkering with existing enzymes1. New enzymes frequently evolve from enzymes with latent, promiscuous activities2, and often inherit key features of the ancestral enzyme, retaining conserved catalytic groups and stabilizing analogous intermediates or transition states3. While experimental evolutionary biochemistry has yielded considerable insight into the evolution of new enzymes from existing enzymes4, the emergence of catalytic activity de novo remains poorly understood. Although certain enzymes are thought to have evolved from non-catalytic proteins5-7, the mechanisms underlying these complete evolutionary transitions have not been described. Here we show how the enzyme cyclohexadienyl dehydratase (CDT) evolved from a cationic amino acid-binding protein belonging to the solute-binding protein (SBP) superfamily. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory between reconstructed ancestors and extant proteins showed that the emergence and optimization of catalytic activity involved several distinct processes. The emergence of CDT activity was potentiated by the incorporation of a desolvated general acid into the ancestral binding site, which provided an intrinsically reactive catalytic motif, and reshaping of the ancestral binding site, which facilitated enzyme-substrate complementarity. Catalytic activity was subsequently gained via the introduction of hydrogen-bonding networks that positioned the catalytic residue precisely and contributed to transition state stabilization. Finally, catalytic activity was enhanced by remote substitutions that refined the active site structure and reduced sampling of non-catalytic states. Our work shows that the evolutionary processes that underlie the emergence of enzymes by natural selection in the wild are mirrored by recent examples of computational design and directed evolution of enzymes in the laboratory.",

Drug prescription is one major component of health care--reflecting the accuracy of diagnosis, the adherence to evidence-based guidelines, susceptibility to drug marketing, and regulatory factors. Using medical claims data covering nearly half of the USA population, we have developed a framework to compare prescription rates of 600 popular drugs in 2,334 counties. Our approach uncovers geographically separated sub-Americas, where patients receive treatment for different diseases, and where physicians choose different drugs for the same disease. The geographical variation suggests influences of racial composition, state-level health care laws, and wealth. Some regions consistently prefer more expensive drugs, even when they have not been proven more efficacious than cheaper alternatives. Our study underlines the benefit of aggregating massive information on medical practice into a summarized and actionable form.

    "abstract": "Specialized neurons called cnidocytes define the phylum Cnidaria. They possess an  explosive organelle called cnidocyst that is important for prey capture and antipredator defense. An extraordinary morphological and functional complexity of the cnidocysts has inspired numerous studies to investigate their structure and development. However, the transcriptomes of the cells bearing these unique organelles are yet to be characterized, impeding our understanding of the genetic basis of their biogenesis. By generating transgenic lines of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we have characterized cell-type specific transcriptomic profiles of various stages of cnidocyte maturation and show that nematogenesis (the formation of functional cnidocysts) is underpinned by dramatic shifts in the spatiotemporal gene expression. We also highlight the stark fall in transcriptional-levels of toxin and structural protein coding genes within cnidocytes with the maturation of capsule. We further reveal that the majority of upregulated genes and enriched biochemical pathways specific to cnidocytes are yet to be characterized. Finally, we unravel the recruitment of a metazoan stress-related transcription factor complex into nematogenesis and highlight its role in the formation of a structural protein of the cnidocyst wall. Thus, we provide novel insights into the biology, development, and evolution of cnidocytes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundConverging evidence suggests that immune-mediated dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Although genetic studies have shown that immune-associated loci are associated with increased FTD risk, a systematic investigation of genetic overlap between immune-mediated diseases and the spectrum of FTD-related disorders has not been performed.\\n\\nMethods and findingsUsing large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (total n = 192,886 cases and controls) and recently developed tools to quantify genetic overlap/pleiotropy, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with  FTD-related disorders namely FTD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - and one or more immune-mediated diseases including Crohns disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), celiac disease (CeD), and psoriasis (PSOR). We found up to 270-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and RA and comparable enrichment between FTD and UC, T1D, and CeD. In contrast, we found only modest genetic enrichment between any of the immune-mediated diseases and CBD, PSP or ALS. At a conjunction false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, we identified numerous FTD-immune pleiotropic SNPs within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6. By leveraging the immune diseases, we also found novel FTD susceptibility loci within LRRK2 (Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2), TBKBP1 (TANK-binding kinase 1 Binding Protein 1), and PGBD5 (PiggyBac Transposable Element Derived 5). Functionally, we found that expression of FTD-immune pleiotropic genes (particularly within the HLA region) is altered in postmortem brain tissue from patients with frontotemporal dementia and is enriched in microglia compared to other central nervous system (CNS) cell types.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show considerable immune-mediated genetic enrichment specifically in FTD, particularly within the HLA region. Our genetic results suggest that for a subset of patients, immune dysfunction may contribute to risk for FTD. These findings have potential implications for clinical trials targeting immune dysfunction in patients with FTD.",

    "abstract": "Plant species have repeatedly evolved recognition systems between pollen and pistils that identify and reject inappropriate matings. Two of the most important systems recognize self-pollen and interspecific pollen. Outstanding questions are whether and how these two recognition systems are linked and if this association could constrain the evolution of mate choice. Our study characterizes variation in self and interspecific incompatibility in the native range of the Texas wildflower Phlox drummondii. We found quantitative variation in self-incompatibility and demonstrate that this variation is significantly correlated with variation in incompatibility with its close congener P. cuspidata. Furthermore, we find strong evidence that self and interspecific incompatibility involve common mechanisms of pollen adhesion or early pollen-tube germination. Finally, we show that P. drummondii populations that co-occur and hybridize with P. cuspidata have significantly higher interspecific incompatibility and self-incompatibility than isolated P. drummondii populations. This geographic variation suggests that the evolution of self-compatibility is constrained by selection favoring interspecific incompatibility to reduce maladaptive hybridization. To our knowledge this is the strongest evidence that a correlation between variation in self and interspecific incompatibilities could influence the evolution of pollen recognition across the range of a species.",

In this study, EEG equipment was adapted for use and transportation in a backpack while cycling. Participants performed an auditory oddball task while cycling outside and sitting in an isolated chamber inside the lab. Cycling increased EEG noise and marginally diminished alpha amplitude. However, this increased noise did not influence the ability to measure reliable event related potentials (ERP). The P3 was similar in topography, and morphology when outside on the bike, with a lower amplitude in the outside cycling condition. There was only a minor decrease in the statistical power to measure reliable ERP effects. Unexpectedly, when biking outside significantly decreased P2 and increased N1 amplitude were observed when evoked by both standards and targets compared with sitting in the lab. This may be due to attentional processes filtering the overlapping sounds between the tones used and similar environmental frequencies. This study established methods for mobile recording of ERP signals.

Previous research has disagreed about whether these features emerge from internally or externally driven properties (i.e. words already in the lexicon vs. regularities in the external world), mapping onto preferential attachment and preferential acquisition accounts, respectively (Steyvers & Tenenbaum, 2005; Hills, Maouene, Maouene, Sheya, & Smith, 2009). Such accounts suggest that inherent semantic structure shapes new lexical growth. Here we extend previous work by creating semantic networks using the SEEDLingS corpus, a newly collected corpus of linguistic input to infants. Using a recently developed LSA-like approach (GLoVe vectors), we confirm the presence of previously reported structural characteristics, but only in certain ranges of semantic similarity space. Our results confirm the robustness of certain aspects of network organization, and provide novel evidence in support of preferential acquisition accounts.",

Harmful mechanical stretch of the alveolar epithelium is a recognized mechanism of VILI, yet little is known about how mechanical stretch affects aged epithelial cells. An activated response known as Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress occurs at the cellular level, which is increased with aging. The disrupted ER function results in disruption in cellular homeostasis, apoptosis, and inflammation. We hypothesized that age and mechanical stretch increase proinflammatory gene expression that is mediated by ER stress. Type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATII) were harvested from C57Bl6/J mice 8 weeks (young) and 20 months (old) of age. The cells were cyclically mechanically stretched at 15% change in surface area for up to 24 hours. Prior to stretch, groups were administered 4-PBA or vehicle as a control. Mechanical stretch upregulated both ER stress and proinflammatory gene expression in ATIIs. Age-matched and mis-matched monocyte recruitment by ATII conditioned media was quantified. Administration of 4-PBA attenuated both the ER stress and proinflammatory increases from stretch and/or age and significantly reduced monocyte migration to ATII conditioned media. Age increases susceptibility to stretch-induced ER stress and downstream inflammation in a primary ATII epithelial cell model.",

    "abstract": "Over the last few years, RNA-seq has been used to study alterations in alternative splicing related to several diseases. Bioinformatics workflows used to perform these studies can be divided into two groups, those finding changes in the absolute isoform expression and those studying differential splicing. Many computational methods for transcriptomics analysis have been developed, evaluated and compared; however, there are not enough reports of systematic and objective assessment of processing pipelines as a whole. Moreover, comparative studies have been performed considering separately the changes in absolute or relative isoform expression levels. Consequently, no consensus exists about the best practices and appropriate workflows to analyse alternative and differential splicing. To assist the adequate pipeline choice, we present here a benchmarking of nine commonly used workflows to detect differential isoform expression and splicing. We evaluated the workflows performance over three different experimental scenarios where changes in absolute and relative isoform expression occurred simultaneously. In addition, the effect of the number of isoforms per gene, and the magnitude of the expression change over pipeline performances were also evaluated. Our results suggest that workflow performance is influenced by the number of replicates per condition and the conditions heterogeneity. In general, workflows based on DESeq, DEXSeq, Limma and NOISeq performed well over a wide range of transcriptomics experiments. In particular, we suggest the use of workflows based on Limma when high precision is required, and DESeq2 and DEXseq pipelines to prioritize sensitivity. When several replicates per condition are available, NOISeq and Limma pipelines are indicated.",

    "abstract": "BCR-ABL1-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) hematologic neoplasms. Nevertheless, acquired TKI resistance remains a major problem in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and TKIs are less effective against Ph+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). GAB2, a scaffolding adaptor that binds and activates SHP2, is essential for leukemogenesis by BCR-ABL1, and a GAB2 mutant lacking SHP2 binding cannot mediate leukemogenesis. Using a genetic loss-of-function approach and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models for CML and BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL, we show that SHP2 is required for BCR-ABL1-evoked myeloid and lymphoid neoplasia. Ptpn11 deletion impairs initiation and maintenance of CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasm, and compromises induction of BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL. SHP2, and specifically, its SH2 domains, PTP activity and C-terminal tyrosines, is essential for BCR-ABL1+, but not WT, pre-B cell proliferation. The MEK/ERK pathway is regulated by SHP2 in WT and BCR-ABL1+ pre-B cells, but is only required for the proliferation of BCR-ABL1+ cells. SHP2 is required for SRC family kinase (SFK) activation only in BCR-ABL1+ pre-B cells. RNAseq reveals distinct SHP2-dependent transcriptional programs in BCR-ABL1+ and WT pre-B cells. Our results suggest that SHP2, via SFKs and ERK, represses MXD3/4 to facilitate a MYC-dependent proliferation program in BCR-ABL1-transformed pre-B cells.",

    "abstract": "LINE-1/L1 retrotransposon sequences comprise 17% of the human genome. Among the many classes of mobile genetic elements, L1 is the only autonomous retrotransposon that still drives human genomic plasticity today. Through its co-evolution with the human genome, L1 has intertwined itself with host cell biology to aid its proliferation. However, a clear understanding of L1s lifecycle and the processes involved in restricting its insertion and its intragenomic spreading remains elusive. Here we identify modes of L1 proteins entrance into the nucleus, a necessary step for L1 proliferation. Using functional, biochemical, and imaging approaches, we also show a clear cell cycle bias for L1 retrotransposition that peaks during the S phase. Our observations provide a basis for novel interpretations about the nature of nuclear and cytoplasmic L1 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and the potential role of DNA replication in L1 retrotransposition.",

    "abstract": "The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor has dual functions in Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling and accurate chromosome segregation, and is frequently mutated in colorectal cancers. Although APC contributes to proper cell division, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that C. elegans APR-1/APC is an attenuator of the pulling forces acting on the mitotic spindle. During asymmetric cell division of the C. elegans zygote, a LIN-5/NuMA protein complex localizes dynein to the cell cortex to generate pulling forces on astral microtubules that position the mitotic spindle. We found that APR-1 localizes to the anterior cell cortex in a Par-aPKC polarity-dependent manner and suppresses anterior centrosome movements. Our combined cell biological and mathematical analyses support the conclusion that cortical APR-1 reduces force generation by stabilizing microtubule plus ends at the cell cortex. Furthermore, APR-1 functions in coordination with LIN-5 phosphorylation to attenuate spindle pulling forces. Our results document a physical basis for spindle-pulling force attenuation, which may be generally used in asymmetric cell division, and when disrupted potentially contributes to division defects in cancer.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAPC (adenomatous polyposis coli) is a Wnt signaling component as well as a microtubule-associated protein, and its mutations are frequently associated with colorectal cancers in humans. Although APC stabilizes microtubules (MTs), its mechanical role during cell division is largely unknown. Here we show that APC is an attenuator of forces acting on the mitotic spindle during asymmetric cell division of the C. elegans zygote. We performed live-imaging, laser-microsurgery, and numerical simulation to show how APC suppresses spindle pulling force generation by stabilizing microtubule plus-ends and reducing microtubule catastrophe frequency at the cell cortex. Our study is the first to document a mechanical role for the APC protein, and provides a physical basis for spindle-pulling force attenuation.",

Current methods, however, require extensive human intervention, are highly sensitive to parameter choice, or produce metrics that are difficult to interpret biologically. We therefore developed a novel method, Lobe Contribution Elliptical Fourier Analysis (LOCO-EFA), which generates from digitalised cell outlines meaningful descriptors that can be directly matched to morphological features. We show that LOCO-EFA provides a tool to phenotype efficiently and objectively populations of cells by applying it to the complex shaped pavement cells of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type and speechless leaves. To further validate our method, we analysed computer-generated tissues, where cell shape can be specified in a controlled manner. LOCO-EFA quantifies deviations between the specified shape that an individual in silico cell takes up when in isolation and the resultant shape when they are allowed to interact within a confluent tissue, thereby assessing the role of cell-cell interactions on population cell shape distributions.\\n\\nSummary statement\\n\\nNovel method (LOCO-EFA) quantifies complex cell shapes, extracting meaningful biological features such as protrusion number and amplitude; here shown for plant pavement cells and validated on in silico tissues.",

One of the current challenges is to develop systematic approaches for fusing heterogeneous datasets into an integrated view of multivariable dynamics. We demonstrate that heterogeneous data fusion can be successfully implemented within a semi-supervised learning framework that exploits the intrinsic geometry of high-dimensional datasets. We illustrate our approach using a dataset from studies of pattern formation in Drosophila. The result is a continuous trajectory that reveals the joint dynamics of gene expression, subcellular protein localization, protein phosphorylation, and tissue morphogenesis.

    "abstract": "Self-pollinating plants (\\\"selfers\\\") have larger geographic ranges and inhabit higher latitudes than their outcrossing relatives. This finding has led to the hypothesis that selfers also have broader climatic niches. It is possible that the increased likelihood of successful colonization into new areas and the initial purging of deleterious mutations may offset selfers inability to adapt to new environments due to low heterozygosity. Here, for the first time, we examine the climatic niches and mutation accumulation rates of hundreds of closely related selfing and outcrossing species. Contrary to expectations, selfers do not have wider climatic niche breadths than their outcrossing sister taxa despite selfers greatly expanded geographic ranges. Selfing sister pairs also exhibit greater niche overlap than outcrossing sisters, implying that climatic niche expansion becomes limited following the transition to selfing. Further, the niche breadth of selfers is predicted to decrease significantly faster than that of closely-related outcrossers. In support of these findings, selfers also display significantly higher mutation accumulation rates than their outcrossing sisters, implying decreased heterozygosity, effective population size, and adaptive potential. These results collectively suggest that while the release from mate limitation among selfing species may result in initial range expansion, range size and niche breadth are decoupled, and the limitations of an increasingly homogeneous genome will constrict selfers climatic niches and over time reduce their geographic ranges.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation age is an accurate biomarker of chronological age and predicts lifespan, but its underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. In this genome-wide association study of 9,907 individuals, we found gene variants mapping to five loci associated with intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA) and gene variants in 3 loci associated extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA). Mendelian randomization analysis suggested causal influences of menarche and menopause on IEAA and lipid levels on IEAA and EEAA. Variants associated with longer leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT) locus at 5p15.33 confer higher IEAA (P<2.7x10-11). Causal modelling indicates TERT-specific and independent effects on LTL and IEAA. Experimental hTERT expression in primary human fibroblasts engenders a linear increase in DNA methylation age with cell population doubling number. Together, these findings indicate a critical role for hTERT in regulating the DNA methylation clock, in addition to its established role of compensating for cell replication-dependent telomere shortening.",

    "abstract": "The increased usage of whole-genome selection (WGS) and other molecular evaluation methods in plant breeding relies on the ability to genotype a very large number of untested individuals in each breeding cycle. Many plant breeding programs evaluate large biparental populations of homozygous individuals derived from homozygous parent inbred lines. This structure lends itself to parent-progeny imputation, which transfers the genotype scores of the parents to progeny individuals that are genotyped for a much smaller number of loci. Here we introduce a parent-progeny imputation method that infers individual genotypes from index-free pooled samples of DNA of multiple individuals using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We demonstrated the method for pools of simulated maize double haploids (DH) from biparental populations, genotyped using a genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approach for 3,000 loci at 0.125x to 4x coverage. We observed high concordance between true and imputed marker scores and the HMM produced well-calibrated genotype probabilities that correctly reflected the uncertainty of the imputed scores. Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) calculated from the imputed scores closely matched GEBV calculated from the true marker scores. The within-population correlation between these sets of GEBV approached 0.95 at 1x and 4x coverage when pooling two or four individuals, respectively. Our approach can reduce the genotyping cost per individual by a factor up to the number of pooled individuals in GBS applications without the need for extra sequencing coverage, thereby enabling cost-effective large scale genotyping for applications such as WGS in plant breeding.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental assumption in inferring causality of an exposure on complex disease using Mendelian randomization (MR) is that the genetic variant used as the instrumental variable cannot have pleiotropic effects. Violation of this  no pleiotropy assumption can cause severe bias. Emerging evidence have supported a role for pleiotropy amongst disease-associated loci identified from GWA studies. However, the impact and extent of pleiotropy on MR is poorly understood. Here, we introduce a method called the Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) test to detect and correct for pleiotropy in multi-instrument summary-level MR testing. We show using simulations that existing approaches are less sensitive to the detection of pleiotropy when it occurs in a subset of instrumental variables, as compared to MR-PRESSO. Next, we show that pleiotropy is widespread in MR, occurring in 41% amongst significant causal relationships (out of 4,250 MR tests total) from pairwise comparisons of 82 complex traits and diseases from summary level genome-wide association data. We demonstrate that pleiotropy causes distortion between-168% and 189% of the causal estimate in MR. Furthermore, pleiotropy induces false positive causal relationships-defined as those causal estimates that were no longer statistically significant in the pleiotropy corrected MR test but were previously significant in the naive MR test-in up to 10% of the MR tests using a P < 0.05 cutoff that is commonly used in MR studies. Finally, we show that MR-PRESSO can correct for distortion in the causal estimate in most cases. Our results demonstrate that pleiotropy is widespread and pervasive, and must be properly corrected for in order to maintain the validity of MR.",

One quarter of all tumor samples contained somatic integrations of telomeric sequences into non-telomeric DNA. With 80% prevalence, ATRX/DAXXtrunc tumors display a 3-fold enrichment of telomere insertions. A systematic analysis of telomere composition identified aberrant telomere variant repeat (TVR) distribution as a genomic marker of ATRX/DAXXtrunc tumors. In this clinically relevant subgroup, singleton TTCGGG and TTTGGG TVRs (previously undescribed) were significantly enriched or depleted, respectively. Overall, our findings provide new insight into the recurrent genomic alterations that are associated with the establishment of different telomere maintenance mechanisms in cancer.",

The cell line is derived from an unknown number of larvae from an unspecified strain of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Toward improved utility of the cell line for research in virus transmission, we present an annotated assembly of the C6/36 genome.\\n\\nResultsThe C6/36 genome assembly has the largest contig N50 (3.3 Mbp) of any mosquito assembly, presents the sequences of both haplotypes for most of the diploid genome, reveals independent null mutations in both alleles of the Dicer locus, and indicates a male-specific genome. Gene annotation was computed with publicly available mosquito transcript sequences. Gene expression data from cell line RNA sequence identified enrichment of growth-related pathways and conspicuous deficiency in aquaporins and inward rectifier K+ channels. As a test of utility, RNA sequence data from Zika-infected cells was mapped to the C6/36 genome and transcriptome assemblies. Host subtraction reduced the data set by 89%, enabling faster characterization of non-host reads.\\n\\nConclusionsThe C6/36 genome sequence and annotation should enable additional uses of the cell line to study arbovirus vector interactions and interventions aimed at restricting the spread of human disease.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the healthy brain aging process is key to uncovering the mechanisms leading to pathological age-related neurodegeneration, including progression to Alzheimers disease (AD). Here, we report the first deep whole genome sequencing study aiming to identify variants that are associated specifically to healthy brain aging defined on both clinical and neuropathological level, thus tacking the issue of pathological heterogeneity that often underlies a clinical AD diagnosis. We studied samples from the VITA brain bank and followed an extreme phenotypic ends study design comparing neuropathologically \\\"healthy\\\" aging individuals above 80 years of age with pure AD patients of the same age. Focusing on the extreme ends of the phenotypic distribution, and potentially functional variants, we discover a single variant (rs10149146) carried by 53.6% of the \\\"healthy\\\" brain elderly individuals in our study (15/28 individuals) and none of the 12 AD cases. This variant lies on the autophagy and cell cycle associated TECPR2 gene. Autophagy dysfunction has been previously implicated in multiple progressive neurodegenerative diseases. An additional non-synonymous variant on the CINP gene (encoding a cell-cycle checkpoint protein) is also found in 46% of healthy controls and absent from all the AD cases. TECPR2 and CINP appear to be \\\"partner\\\" genes in terms of regulation and their associated transcription factors have been previously implicated in AD and neurodegeneration. Our study is the first to support the hypothesis that a TECPR2 non-synonymous variant carries a significant neuroprotective effect pointing to key molecules for the involvement of autophagy and cell cycle control in protection from neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Parafusin is a phosphoglucomutase (PGM) paralog that acts as a signaling scaffold protein in calcium mediated exocytosis across many eukaryotes. In Toxoplasma gondii the parafusin related protein 1 (PRP1) has been associated in indirect and heterologous studies with the regulated exocytosis of the micronemes, which are required for successful host cell invasion and egress. Here we directly assessed the role of PRP1 by deleting the gene from the parasite. We observed a specific defect in microneme secretion in response to high Ca2+ fluxes, but not to phosphatidic acid fluxes controlling microneme release. We observed no defect in constitutive microneme secretion which was sufficient to support completion of the lytic cycle. Furthermore, deletion of the other PGM in Toxoplasma, PGM2, as well as the double PRP1/PGM2 deletion resulted in a similar phenotype. This suggests a functional interaction between these two genes. Strikingly, tachyzoites without both paralogs are completely viable in vitro and during acute mice infections. This indicates that PGM activity is neither required for glycolysis. In conclusion, the PRP1-PGM2 pair is required for a burst in microneme secretion upon high Ca2+ fluxes, but this burst is not essential to complete the lytic cycle of the parasite.\\n\\nPlain Language SummaryCalcium mediated control of microneme secretion is essential for host cell invasion and egress of Toxoplasma gondii. Here it is shown that the two phosphoglucomutases in Toxoplasma both function in the translation of a spike in calcium into a burst in microneme secretion.",

    "abstract": "Surface association provides numerous fitness advantages to bacteria. Thus, it is critical for bacteria to recognize surface contact and to consequently initiate physiological changes required for a surface-associated lifestyle (1). Ubiquitous microbial appendages called pili are involved in sensing surfaces and mediating downstream surface-associated behaviors (2-6). The mechanism by which pili mediate surface sensing remains unknown, largely due to the difficulty to visualize their dynamic nature and to directly modulate their activity without genetic modification. Here, we show that Caulobacter crescentus pili undergo dynamic cycles of extension and retraction that cease within seconds of surface contact, and this arrest of pilus activity coincides with surface-stimulated holdfast synthesis. By physically blocking pili, we show that imposing resistance to pilus retraction is sufficient to stimulate holdfast synthesis in the absence of surface contact. Thus, resistance to type IV pilus retraction upon surface attachment is used for surface sensing.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryBacteria use the tension imparted on retracting pilus fibers upon their binding to a surface for surface sensing.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThere is increasing evidence for the role of impaired intestinal permeability in obesity and associated metabolic diseases. Zonulin is an established serum marker for intestinal permeability and identical to pre-haptoglobin2. Here, we aimed to investigate the relationship between circulating zonulin and metabolic traits related to obesity.\\n\\nMETHODSSerum zonulin was measured by using a widely used commercial ELISA kit in 376 subjects from the metabolically well-characterized cohort of Sorbs from Germany. In addition, haptoglobin genotype was determined in DNA samples from all study subjects.\\n\\nRESULTSAs zonulin concentrations did not correlate to the haptoglobin genotypes, we investigated the specificity of the zonulin ELISA assay using antibody capture experiments, mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis. Using serum samples that gave the highest or lowest ELISA signals, we detected several proteins that are likely to be captured by the antibody in the present kit. However, none of these proteins corresponds to pre-haptoglobin2. We used increasing concentrations of recombinant pre-haptoglobin 2 and complement C3 as one of the representative captured proteins and the ELISA kit did not detect either. Western blot analysis using both the polyclonal antibodies used in this kit and monoclonal antibodies rose against zonulin showed a similar protein recognition pattern but with different intensity of detection. The protein(s) measured using the ELISA kit was (were) significantly increased in patients with diabetes and obesity and correlated strongly with markers of the lipid and glucose metabolism. Combining mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis using the polyclonal antibodies used in the ELISA kit, we identified properdin as another member of the zonulin family.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSOur study suggests that the zonulin ELISA does not recognize pre-haptoglobin 2, rather structural (and possibly functional) analogue proteins belonging to the mannose-associated serine protease family, with properdin being the most likely possible candidate.",

Here we present a new method of analysis for the AAPA test that focuses on the movement paths of the animals and utilizes a clustering algorithm to automatically extract the stereotypical types of behaviour as reflected in the recorded paths. We apply the method to experiments that study the effect of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the reference memory and identify six major classes of movement motifs not previously described in AAPA tests.

    "abstract": "Neural plasticity--the ability of a neuron to change its cellular properties in response to past experiences--underpins the nervous systems capacity to form memories and actuate behaviors. How different plasticity mechanisms act together in vivo and at a cellular level to transform sensory information into behavior is not well understood. Here we show that in the nematode C. elegans two plasticity mechanisms--sensory adaptation and presynaptic plasticity--act within a single cell to encode thermosensory information and actuate a temperature-preference memory. Sensory adaptation enables the primary thermosensory neuron, AFD, to adjust the temperature range of its sensitivity to the local environment, thereby optimizing its ability to detect temperature fluctuations associated with migration. Presynaptic plasticity transforms this thermosensory information into a behavioral preference by gating synaptic communication between sensory neuron AFD and its postsynaptic partner, AIY. The gating of synaptic communication is regulated at AFD presynaptic sites by the conserved kinase nPKC{varepsilon}. Bypassing or altering AFD presynaptic plasticity predictably changes the learned behavioral preferences without affecting sensory responses. Our findings indicate that two distinct and modular neuroplasticity mechanisms function together within a single sensory neuron to encode multiple components of information required to enact thermotactic behavior. The integration of these plasticity mechanisms result in a single-cell logic system that can both represent sensory stimuli and guide memory-based behavioral preference.",

    "abstract": "Many cortical neurons combine the information ascending and descending the cortical hierarchy. In the classical view, this information is combined nonlinearly to give rise to a single firing rate output, which collapses all input streams into one. We propose that neurons can simultaneously represent multiple input streams by using a novel code that distinguishes single spikes and bursts at the level of a neural ensemble. Using computational simulations constrained by experimental data, we show that cortical neurons are well suited to generate such multiplexing. Interestingly, this neural code maximizes information for short and sparse bursts, a regime consistent with in vivo recordings. It also suggests specific connectivity patterns that allows to demultiplex this information. These connectivity patterns can be used by the nervous system to maintain optimal multiplexing. Contrary to firing rate coding, our findings indicate that a single neural ensemble can communicate multiple independent signals to different targets.",

This complexity arises from the rate at which new studies are published and from the terminology that varies widely from study-to-study and even more so from discipline-to-discipline. One way to investigate and manage this problem is to build a \\\"semantic space\\\" that maps the different vocabulary used in functional neuroimaging literature. Such a semantic space will also help identify the primary research domains of neuroimaging and their most commonly reported brain regions. In this work, we analyzed the multivariate semantic structure of abstracts in Neurosynth and found that there are six primary domains of the functional neuroimaging literature each with their own preferred reported brain regions. Our analyses also highlight possible semantic sources of reported brain regions within and across domains because some research topics (e.g., memory disorders, substance use disorder) use heterogeneous terminology. Furthermore, we highlight the growth and decline of the primary domains over time. Finally, we note that our techniques and results form the basis of a \\\"recommendation engine\\\" that could help readers better navigate the neuroimaging literature.",

    "abstract": "Combining sensory inputs over space and time is fundamental to vision. Population receptive field models have been successful in characterizing spatial encoding throughout the human visual pathways. A parallel question--how visual areas in the human brain process information distributed over time--has received less attention. One challenge is that the most widely used neuroimaging method--fMRI--has coarse temporal resolution compared to the time-scale of neural dynamics. Here, via carefully controlled temporally modulated stimuli, we show that information about temporal processing can be readily derived from fMRI signal amplitudes in male and female subjects. We find that all visual areas exhibit sub-additive summation, whereby responses to longer stimuli are less than the linear prediction from briefer stimuli. We also find fMRI evidence that the neural response to two stimuli is reduced for brief interstimulus intervals (indicating adaptation). These effects are more pronounced in visual areas anterior to V1-V3. Finally, we develop a general model that shows how these effects can be captured with two simple operations: temporal summation followed by a compressive nonlinearity. This model operates for arbitrary temporal stimulation patterns and provides a simple and interpretable set of computations that can be used to characterize neural response properties across the visual hierarchy. Importantly, compressive temporal summation directly parallels earlier findings of compressive spatial summation in visual cortex describing responses to stimuli distributed across space. This indicates that for space and time, cortex uses a similar processing strategy to achieve higher-level and increasingly invariant representations of the visual world.\\n\\nSignificance statementCombining sensory inputs over time is fundamental to seeing. Two important temporal phenomena are summation, the accumulation of sensory inputs over time, and adaptation, a response reduction for repeated or sustained stimuli. We investigated these phenomena in the human visual system using fMRI. We built predictive models that operate on arbitrary temporal patterns of stimulation using two simple computations: temporal summation followed by a compressive nonlinearity. Our new temporal compressive summation model captures (1) subadditive temporal summation, and (2) adaptation. We show that the model accounts for systematic differences in these phenomena across visual areas. Finally, we show that for space and time, the visual system uses a similar strategy to achieve increasingly invariant representations of the visual world.",

Although reproductive deficits are associated with lifestyle induced sleep deficiencies, how sleep loss affects reproductive physiology is poorly understood, even in model organisms. We aimed to bridge this mechanistic gap by impairing sleep in female fruit flies and testing its effect on egg output. We find that sleep deprivation by feeding caffeine or by mechanical perturbation results in decreased egg output. Transient activation of wake-promoting dopaminergic neurons decreases egg output in addition to sleep levels, thus demonstrating a direct negative impact of sleep deficit on reproductive output. Similarly, loss-of-function mutation in dopamine transporter fumin (fmn)leads to both significant sleep loss and lowered fecundity. This demonstration of a direct relationship between sleep and reproductive fitness indicates a strong driving force for the evolution of sleep.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionIntermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique capable of increasing cortical excitability beyond the stimulation period. Due to the rapid induction of modulatory effects compared to conventional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) paradigms, prefrontal application of iTBS is gaining popularity as a therapeutic tool for psychiatric disorders such as depression. In an attempt to increase efficacy, higher than conventional intensities are currently being applied. The assumption that this increases neuromodulatory effect is well established for the standard rTMS paradigms but may be mechanistically false for iTBS. This study examined the influence of intensity on the neurophysiological and behavioural effects of iTBS in the prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nMethods16 healthy participants received iTBS over prefrontal cortex (F1 electrode) at either 50, 75 or 100% resting motor threshold (rMT) in separate sessions. Single-pulse TMS and concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) was used to assess changes in cortical reactivity measured as TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and TMS-evoked oscillations. The n-back task (2-back and 3-back) were used to assess changes in working memory (accuracy and reaction time).\\n\\nResultsThe data can be summarised as an inverse U-shape relationship between intensity and iTBS plastic effects, where 75% iTBS resulted in the largest neurophysiological changes both in TMS-EEG and working memory. Even though 75% iTBS showed significantly decreased reaction time in the 3-back task, between condition comparisons revealed no significant differences.\\n\\nConclusionsThe assumption that higher intensity results in greater neuromodulatory effects is false, at least in healthy individuals, and should be carefully considered for clinical populations.

    "abstract": "There is a strong need for procedures that enable context and application dependent validation of antibodies. Here we describe the foundation for a resource aiding more detailed assessment antibody selectivity for capturing endogenous proteins from human plasma. In 414 immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments with EDTA plasma, data was generated by mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with 157 antibodies (targeting 120 unique proteins). Out of a total of 1,313 unique proteins, 426 proteins (33%) were detected in > 20% of the assays and indicate a background comprised of mainly proteins from the complement system. For all proteins identified either in heat-treated or untreated EDTA plasma, frequencies of occurrence were derived. We determined z-scores for each IP as a measure of enrichment to annotate the antibodies into four categories (ON-target, CO-target, OFF-target and NO-target). For 45% (70/157) of the tested antibodies, the expected target proteins were enriched (z-score [&ge;]3) above background. There were 84% (59/70) of binders that co-enriched other proteins beside the intended target, either due to OFF-target binding or predicted interactions. Comparing several antibodies raised against IGFBP2, the established library allowed us to describe protein complexes in plasma, and we employed multiplexed sandwich immunoassays to confirm these. In summary, the generated resource of plasma enrichment profiles and background proteins adds a very useful and yet lacking starting point for the assessment of antibody selectivity in this clinically important body fluid. The provided insights will contribute to a more informed use of validated affinity reagents and may lead to further advancements of plasma proteomics assays.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn light of the biodiversity crisis and our limited ability to explain variation in biodiversity, tools to quantify spatial and temporal variation in biodiversity and its underlying drivers are critically needed. Inspired by the recently published ecospace framework, we developed and tested a sampling design for environmental and biotic mapping. We selected 130 study sites (40 x 40 m) across Denmark using stratified random sampling along the major environmental gradients underlying biotic variation. Using standardized methods, we collected site species data on vascular plants, bryophytes, macrofungi, lichens, gastropods and arthropods. To evaluate sampling efficiency, we calculated regional coverage (relative to the known species number per taxonomic group), and site scale coverage (i.e., sample completeness per taxonomic group at each site). To extend taxonomic coverage to organisms that are difficult to sample by classical inventories (e.g., nematodes and non-fruiting fungi), we collected soil for metabarcoding. Finally, to assess site conditions, we mapped abiotic conditions, biotic resources and habitat continuity.\\n\\nResultsDespite the 130 study sites only covering a minute fraction (0.0005 %) of the total Danish terrestrial area, we found 1774 species of macrofungi (54 % of the Danish fungal species pool), 663 vascular plant species (42 %), 254 bryophyte species (41 %) and 200 lichen species (19 %). For arthropods, we observed 330 spider species (58 %), 123 carabid beetle species (37 %) and 99 hoverfly species (33 %). Correlations among species richness for taxonomic groups were predominantly positive. Overall, sample coverage was remarkably high across taxonomic groups and sufficient to capture substantial spatial variation in biodiversity across Denmark. This inventory is nationally unprecedented in detail and resulted in the discovery of 143 species with no previous record for Denmark. Comparison between plant OTUs detected in soil DNA and observed plant species confirmed the usefulness of carefully curated environmental DNA-data. Species richness did not correlate well among taxa suggesting differential and complex biotic responses to environmental variation.\\n\\nConclusionsWe successfully and adequately sampled a wide range of diverse taxa along key environmental gradients across Denmark using an approach that includes multi-taxon biodiversity assessment and ecospace mapping. Our approach is applicable to assessments of biodiversity in other regions and biomes where species are structured along environmental gradient.",

    "abstract": "Functional testing protocols are thought to be the gold standard for the exploration of the immune system. However, in terms of routine analysis, they present numerous drawbacks and consequently their use is mainly limited to research applications. In the clinical context of septic shock, characterized by marked lymphocyte alterations, a new approach for lymphocyte intracellular cytokine measurement in whole blood upon was evaluated in a proof-of-concept study. Following lymphocyte activation, simultaneous intracellular labeling of Interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}), Tumor Necrosis Factor- (TNF-), and Interleukin-2 (IL-2) was performed in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (identified by surface marking). The analysis was carried out by flow cytometry (6 colors). Results obtained in septic patients (n = 22) were compared to those of healthy volunteers (n = 8). Independently of lymphopenia, there were significant differences between groups. In particular there was significant decrease in the production of IL-2 and TNF- in septic patients, while the production of IFN-{gamma} was not significantly altered. Polyfunctional results showed that patients presented with increased percentages of triple negative lymphocytes. In contrast, volunteers had higher proportions of triple positive cells. The approach could be performed in a robust and consistent way, taking 4.5 hours to complete. Moreover, clear differences could be observed between clinical groups with this modified method. These characteristics illustrate the potential of this novel whole blood protocol for clinical applications. However, further research is required to determine the applicability compared to alternative test and to evaluate clinical performances in larger cohorts of patients.",

    "abstract": "Eschericia coli remains the workhorse producing recombinant proteins given its ease of handling, access and genetic manipulation using standard laboratory techniques. However, disulfide-rich proteins can be difficult to produce in E. coli, in large part due to the reducing environment of the bacterial cytoplasm. Refolding from insoluble inclusion bodies can be a viable strategy for generating substantial quantities of disulfide-rich protein. For the best chance of successfully refolding a protein, it is vital to carry out a variety of small-scale test refolds under a swathe of conditions including altering the concentration of urea, salts, reduced and oxidized glutathione, temperature, length of refold time and protein dilution factor. Once a protein has undergone refolding it is vital to determine that the final product is natively folded given the chance of soluble misfolded protein. For determination of correct folding, a variety of techniques can be employed, and ideally, numerous should be used together. For proteins that possess enzymatic function the gold standard to assess correct folding is an activity assay. Non-enzymatic proteins can be assessed using a combination of circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These techniques should be utilized alongside mass spectrometry, Western blotting and SDS-PAGE.",

Hence, the critical need for novel approaches to handle multiple correlated exposures.\\n\\nMethodsWe propose a novel approach using the G-formula, a maximum likelihood-based substitution estimator, combined with an ensemble learning technique (i.e. SuperLearner) to infer causal effect estimates for a multi-pollutant mixture. We simulated four continuous outcomes from real data on 5 correlated exposures under four exposure-response relationships with increasing complexity and 500 replications. The first simulated exposure-response was generated as a linear function depending on two exposures; the second was based on a univariate nonlinear exposure-response relationship; the third was generated as a linear exposure-response relationship depending on two exposures and their interaction; the fourth simulation was based on a non-linear exposure-response relationship with an effect modification by sex and a linear relationship with a second exposure. We assessed the method based on its predictive performance (Minimum Square error [MSE]), its ability to detect the true predictors and interactions (i.e. false discovery proportion, sensitivity), and its bias. We compared the method with generalized linear and additive models, elastic net, random forests, and Extreme gradient boosting. Finally, we reconstructed the exposure-response relationships and developed a toolbox for interactions visualization using individual conditional expectations.\\n\\nResultsThe proposed method yielded the best average MSE across all the scenarios, and was therefore able to adapt to the true underlying structure of the data. The method succeeded to detect the true predictors and interactions, and was less biased in all the scenarios. Finally, we could correctly reconstruct the exposure-response relationships in all the simulations.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first approach combining ensemble learning techniques and causal inference to unravel the effects of chemical mixtures and their interactions in epidemiological studies. Additional developments including high dimensional exposure data, and testing for detection of low to moderate associations will be carried out in future developments.",

For SNPs on 18q21 (rs12953717 and rs4464148) and 20q13 (rs4925386), alleles that correlate with higher risk for the development of colorectal cancer are associated with shorter disease free survival. However, for rs6983267 on 8q24, the low risk allele is associated with a higher risk for recurrence and metastasis after surgery, and importantly, is strongly correlated with the resistance of colorectal cancer cell lines to chemoradiotherapy. We also found that although MYC expression is dramatically increased in cancer, patients with higher levels of MYC have a better prognosis. The expression of SMAD7 is weakly correlated with disease free time. Notably, the presence of the 8q24 and 18q21 SNP alleles is not correlated with a change of expression of MYC and SMAD7. rs4464148, and probably rs6983267 and rs4925386, are linked with overall survival time of patients.\\n\\nConclusionsSNPs at three colorectal cancer risk loci detect subpopulations of rectal cancer patients with poor prognosis. rs6983267 probably affects prognosis through interfering with the resistance of cancer cells to chemoradiotherapy.",

We hypothesized that dynamic changes in signaling, including adaptation and feedback, limit drug efficacy. Using a quantitative chemoproteomics approach we mapped dynamic changes in the kinome in response to various agents and identified signaling changes that correlate with drug sensitivity. Measurement of dynamics across a panel of breast cancer cell lines identified that maintenance of CDK4 and AURKA activity was associated with drug resistance. We tested whether incomplete inhibition of CDK4 or AURKA was a source of therapy failure and found that inhibition of either was sufficient to sensitize most breast cancer cells to PI3K, AKT, and mTOR inhibitors. In particular, drug combinations including the AURKA inhibitor MLN8237 were highly synergistic and induced apoptosis through enhanced suppression of mTOR signaling to S6 and 4E-BP1 leading to tumor regression in vivo. This signaling map identifies survival factors whose presence limits the efficacy of target therapy and indicates that Aurora kinase co-inhibition could unlock the full potential of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitors in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase is the ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase that catalyzes the synthesis of telomeres at the ends of linear human chromosomes and contributes to proper telomere-loop (T-loop) formation. Formation of the T-loop, an obligate step before cell division can proceed, requires the generation of a 3-overhang on the G-rich strand of telomeric DNA via telomerase or C-strand specific nucleases. Here, we discover telomerase activity is critical for efficient cell cycle progression using transient chemical inhibition by the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat. Telomerase inhibition caused changes in cell cycle kinetics and increased the proportion of cells in G2 phase, suggesting delayed clearance through this checkpoint. Investigating the possible contribution of unstructured telomere ends to these cell cycle distribution changes, we observed that imetelstat treatment induced {gamma}H2AX DNA damage foci in a subset of telomerase-positive cells but not telomerase-negative primary human fibroblasts. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation with {gamma}H2AX antibodies demonstrated imetelstat treatment-dependent enrichment of this DNA damage marker at telomeres. Notably, the effects of telomerase inhibition on cell cycle profile alterations were abrogated by pharmacological inhibition of the DNA-damage-repair transducer ATM.\\n\\nAdditionally, imetelstat potentiation of etoposide, a DNA-damaging drug that acts preferentially during S/G2 phases of the cell cycle, also depended on functional ATM signaling. Our results suggest that telomerase inhibition delays the removal of ATM-dependent DNA damage signals from telomeres in telomerase-positive cancer cells. This demonstrates for the first time that telomerase activity directly facilitates the progression of the cell cycle through modulation of transient telomere dysfunction signals.",

    "abstract": "Alcoholism is the third leading cause of preventable mortality in the world. In the last decades a large body of experimental data has paved the way to a clearer knowledge of the specific molecular targets through which ethanol (EtOH) acts on brain circuits. Yet how these multiple mechanisms play together to result in a dysregulated dopamine (DA) release under alcohol influence remains unclear. In this manuscript, we delineate potential circuit-level mechanisms responsible for EtOH-dependent increase and dysregulation of DA release from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) into nucleus accumbens (Nac). For this purpose, we build a circuit model of the VTA composed of DA and GABAergic neurons, that integrate external Glutamatergic (Glu) inputs to result in DA release. In particular, we reproduced a non-monotonic dose dependence of DA neurons firing activity on EtOH: an increase in firing at small to intermediate doses and a drop below baseline (alcohol-free) levels at high EtOH concentrations. Our simulations predict that a certain level of synchrony is necessary for the firing rate increase produced by EtOH. Moreover, EtOHs effect on the DA neurons firing rate and, consequently, DA release can reverse depending on the average activity level of the Glu afferents to VTA. Further, we propose a mechanism for emergence of transient (phasic) DA peaks and the increase in their frequency in EtOH. Phasic DA transients result from DA neuron population bursts, and these bursts are enhanced in EtOH. These results suggest the role of synchrony and average activity level of Glu afferents to VTA in shaping the phasic and tonic DA release under the acute influence of EtOH and in normal conditions.",

    "abstract": "Synuclein is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease as well as in other neurodegenerative diseases. However, its normal function in cells is not understood. The N-termini of -, {beta}-, and {gamma}-synuclein are comprised of seven 11-amino acid repeats that are predicted to form amphipathic helices. -Synuclein binds to negatively charged lipids, especially small vesicles and tubulates and vesiculates lipids. The membrane-binding and membrane-curving abilities raise the possibility that synuclein could alter cellular processes that involve highly curved structures. In the present study we examined the localization of endogenous synuclein in bovine chromaffin cells by immunocytochemistry and its possible function to control protein discharge upon fusion of the granule with the plasma membrane by regulating the fusion pore. We found with quantitative immunocytochemistry that endogenous {beta}-synuclein associates with secretory granules. Endogenous -synuclein only rarely is found on secretory granules. Overexpression of -synuclein but not {beta}-synuclein quickened the median duration of the post-fusion discharge of BDNF-pHluorin by 30%, consistent with -synuclein speeding fusion pore expansion.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new hypothesis test for the differential abundance of proteins in mass-spectrometry based relative quantification. An important feature of this type of high-throughput analyses is that it involves an enzymatic digestion of the sample proteins into peptides prior to identification and quantification. Due to numerous homology sequences, different proteins can lead to peptides with identical amino acid chains, so that their parent protein is ambiguous. These so-called shared peptides make the protein-level statistical analysis a challenge, so that they are often not accounted for. In this article, we use a linear model describing peptide-protein relationships to build a likelihood ratio test of differential abundance for proteins. We show that the likelihood ratio statistic can be computed in linear time with the number of peptides. We also provide the asymptotic null distribution of a regularized version of our statistic. Experiments on both real and simulated datasets show that our procedures outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Repeat expansions cause over 30, predominantly neurogenetic, inherited disorders. These can present with overlapping clinical phenotypes, making molecular diagnosis challenging. Single gene or small panel PCR-based methods are employed to identify the precise genetic cause, but can be slow and costly, and often yield no result. Genomic analysis via whole exome and whole genome sequencing (WES and WGS) is being increasingly performed to diagnose genetic disorders. However, until recently analysis protocols could not identify repeat expansions in these datasets.\\n\\nA new method, called exSTRa (expanded Short Tandem Repeat algorithm) for the identification of repeat expansions using either WES or WGS was developed and performance of exSTRa was assessed in a simulation study. In addition, four retrospective cohorts of individuals with eleven different known repeat expansion disorders were analysed with the new method. Results were assessed by comparing to known disease status. Performance was also compared to three other analysis methods (ExpansionHunter, STRetch and TREDPARSE), which were developed specifically for WGS data. Expansions in the STR loci assessed were successfully identified in WES and WGS datasets by all four methods, with high specificity and sensitivity, excepting the FRAXA STR where expansions were unlikely to be detected. Overall exSTRa demonstrated more robust/superior performance for WES data in comparison to the other three methods. exSTRa can be applied to existing WES or WGS data to identify likely repeat expansions and can be used to investigate any STR of interest, by specifying location and repeat motif. We demonstrate that methods such as exSTRa can be effectively utilized as a screening tool to interrogate WES data generated with PCR-based library preparations and WGS data generated using either PCR-based or PCR-free library protocols, for repeat expansions which can then be followed up with specific diagnostic tests. exSTRa is available via GitHub (https://github.com/bahlolab/exSTRa).",

Nbs1 has a conserved C-terminal motif that binds ATM, but the full extent of ATM interactions with MRN are unknown. Here, we show that Tel1 overexpression in Schizosaccharomyces pombe restores Tel1 activity at DSBs and telomeres in the absence of Nbs1. This activity requires Mre11, indicating that Tel1 overexpression drives low affinity binding to the Mre11-Rad50 subcomplex. Mre11-Rad50 binds DSBs in nbs1{Delta} cells, and fusing the Tel1-binding motif of Nbs1 to Mre11 fully restores Tel1 signaling in these cells. Tel1 overexpression does not restore Tel1 signaling in cells carrying the rad50-I1192W mutation, which impairs the ability of Mre11-Rad50 to form the ATP-bound closed conformation. From these findings, we propose that Tel1 activation at DNA ends proceeds by a sequential mechanism initiated by high affinity binding to Nbs1 which recruits Tel1, followed by a low affinity interaction with Mre11-Rad50 in the closed conformation to activate Tel1.",

Here, we explore how changing patterns of drug delivery modulates the spread of resistance in a population. Resistance evolves readily under both temporal and spatial variation in drug delivery and fixes rapidly under temporal, but not spatial, variation. Resistant and sensitive genotypes coexist in spatially varying conditions due to a resistance-growth rate trade-off which, when coupled to dispersal, generates negative frequency-dependent selection and a quasi-protected polymorphism. Coexistence is ultimately lost, however, because resistant types with improved growth rates in the absence of drug spread through the population. These results suggest that spatially variable drug prescriptions can delay but not prevent the spread of resistance and provide a striking example of how the emergence and eventual demise of biodiversity is underpinned by evolving fitness trade-offs.",

Although replication origins are selected stochastically, such that each cell is using a different cohort of origins to replicate their genomes7-12, replication-timing is regulated independently and upstream of origin selection13 and evidence suggests that replication timing is conserved in consecutive cell cycles14. Hence, quantifying the extent of cell-to-cell variation in replication timing is central to studies of chromosome structure and function. Here we devise a strategy to measure variation in single-cell replication timing using DNA copy number. We find that borders between replicated and un-replicated DNA are highly conserved between cells, demarcating active and inactive compartments of the nucleus. Nonetheless, measurable variation was evident. Surprisingly, we detected a similar degree of variation in replication timing from cell-to-cell, between homologues within cells, and between all domains genome-wide regardless of their replication timing. These results demonstrate that stochastic variation in replication timing is independent of elements that dictate timing or extrinsic environmental variation.",

Neither standard model accounts for performance of the other task. Sequential sampling models incorporate response initiation as an uninterrupted non-decision time parameter independent of task-related variables. The countermanding race model does not account for the choice process. Here we show with new behavioral, neural and computational results that perceptual decision making of varying difficulty can be countermanded with invariant efficiency, that single prefrontal neurons instantiate both evidence accumulation and response inhibition, and that an interactive race between two GO and one STOP stochastic accumulator fits countermanding choice behavior. Thus, perceptual decision-making and response control, previously regarded as distinct mechanisms, are actually aspects of more flexible behavior supported by a common neural and computational mechanism. The identification of this aspect of decision-making with response production clarifies the component processes of decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Presynaptic efficacy can be modulated by retrograde control mechanisms, but the nature of these complex signaling systems remain obscure. We have developed and optimized a tissue specific ribosome profiling approach in Drosophila. We first demonstrate the ability of this technology to define genome-wide translational regulations. We then leverage this technology to test the relative contributions of transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms in the postsynaptic muscle that orchestrate the retrograde control of presynaptic function. Surprisingly, we find no changes in transcription or translation are necessary to enable retrograde homeostatic signaling. Rather, post-translational mechanisms appear to ultimately gate instructive retrograde communication. Finally, we find that a global increase in translation induces adaptive responses in both transcription and translation of protein chaperones and degradation factors to promote cellular proteostasis. Together, this demonstrates the power of ribosome profiling to define transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms driving retrograde signaling during adaptive plasticity.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYRecent advances in next-generation sequencing approaches have revolutionized our understanding of transcriptional expression in diverse systems. However, transcriptional expression alone does not necessarily report gene translation, the process of ultimate importance in understanding cellular function. To circumvent this limitation, biochemical tagging of ribosomes and isolation of ribosomally-associated mRNA has been developed. However, this approach, called TRAP, has been shown to lack quantitative resolution compared to a superior technology, ribosome profiling, which quantifies the number of ribosomes associated with each mRNA. Ribosome profiling typically requires large quantities of starting material, limiting progress in developing tissue-specific approaches. Here, we have developed the first tissue specific ribosome profiling system in Drosophila to reveal genome-wide changes in translation. We first demonstrate successful ribosome profiling from a specific tissue, muscle, with superior resolution compared to TRAP. We then use transcriptional and ribosome profiling to define transcriptional and translational adaptions necessary for synaptic signaling at the neuromuscular junction. Finally, we utilize ribosome profiling to demonstrate adaptive changes in cellular translation following cellular stress to muscle tissue. Together, this now enables the power of Drosophila genetics to be leveraged with translational profiling in specific tissues.",
