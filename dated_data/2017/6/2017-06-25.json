    "abstract": "Gut innate immune defenses contain bacterial populations and protect the host interior from invasive microbes. Although excess intestinal immune activity frequently promotes inflammatory illnesses, we know little about the consequences of chronic innate immune activity exclusively in endodermal gut cells of an otherwise normal animal. To address this question, we generated a transgenic line that allows us to activate inflammatory signals in adult fly intestinal progenitor cells. We found that constitutive immune activity in intestinal progenitors disrupts expression of homeostatic regulators such as Notch signal transduction pathway components and induces hyperplasia throughout the gut. Consistent with these observations, we found that persistent immune signaling interferes with progenitor cell differentiation and exacerbates the formation of Notch-dependent intestinal tumors. These findings uncover a novel link between constitutive immune activity and tumorigenesis in intestinal stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Network ecology provides a systems basis for approaching ecological questions, such as factors that influence biological diversity, the role of particular species or particular traits in structuring ecosystems, and long-term ecological dynamics (e.g. stability). Whereas the introduction of network theory has enabled ecologists to quantify not only the degree, but also the architecture of ecological complexity, these advances have come at the cost of introducing new challenges, including new theoretical concepts and metrics, and increased data complexity and computational intensity. Synthesizing recent developments in the network ecology literature, we point to several potential solutions to these issues: integrating network metrics and their terminology across sub-disciplines; benchmarking new network algorithms and models to increase mechanistic understanding; and improving tools for sharing ecological network research, in particular \\\"model\\\" data provenance, to increase the reproducibility of network models and analyses. We propose that applying these solutions will aid in synthesizing ecological subdisciplines and allied fields by improving the accessibility of network methods and models.",

Furthermore, the environmental factors that trigger sexual reproduction in diatoms are not understood. Although genome sequences of a few diatoms are available, little is known about the molecular basis for sexual reproduction. Here we show that ammonium reliably induces the key sexual morphologies, including oogonia, auxospores, and spermatogonia, in two strains of T. pseudonana, T. weissflogii, and Cyclotella cryptica. RNA sequencing revealed 1,274 genes whose expression patterns changed when T. pseudonana was induced into sexual reproduction by ammonium. Some of the induced genes are linked to meiosis or encode flagellar structures of heterokont and cryptophyte algae. The identification of ammonium as an environmental trigger suggests an unexpected link between diatom bloom dynamics and strategies for enhancing population genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "As they contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids proteins will readily adsorb onto interfaces between water and hydrophobic fluids such as oil. This adsorption normally causes changes in protein structure, which can result in a loss of protein function and irreversible adsorption, leading to the formation of protein interfacial films. While this can be advantageous in some applications (e.g. food technology) in most cases it limits our ability to exploit protein functionality at interfaces. To understand and control protein interfacial adsorption and function it is necessary to understand the microscopic conformation of proteins at liquid interfaces. In this paper molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the adsorption and conformation of two similar proteins, lysozyme and -lactalbumin, at a water-octane interface. While they both adsorb onto the interface -lactalbumin does so in a specific orientation, mediated by two amphipathic helices, while lysozyme adsorbs in a non-specific manner. Using replica exchange simulations both proteins are found to possess a number of distinct interfacial conformations, with compact states similar to the solution conformation being most common for both proteins. Decomposing the different contributions to the protein energy at oil-water interfaces, suggests that conformational change for -lactalbumin, unlike lysozyme, is driven by favourable protein-oil interactions. Revealing these differences between the factors that govern conformational change at interfaces in otherwise similar proteins can give insight into the control of protein interfacial adsorption, aggregation, and function.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the fine balance between changes of entropy and enthalpy and the competition between a guest and water molecules in molecular binding is crucial in fundamental studies and practical applications. Experiments provide measurements. However, illustrating the binding/unbinding processes gives a complete picture of molecular recognition not directly available from experiments, and computational methods bridge the gaps. Here, we investigated guest association/dissociation with {beta}-cyclodextrin ({beta}-CD) by using microsecond-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, post-analysis and numerical calculations. We computed association and dissociation rate constants, enthalpy, and solvent and solute entropy of binding. All the computed values of kon, koff, {Delta}H, {Delta}S, and {Delta}G using GAFF-CD and q4MD-CD force fields for {beta}-CD could be compared with experimental data directly and agreed reasonably with experiment findings. Both force fields resulted in similar computed {Delta}G from independently computed kinetics rates, {Delta}G=-RTln(kon {middle dot} C{degrees} / k off), and thermodynamics properties, {Delta}G={Delta}H - T{Delta}S. The water entropy calculations show that entropy gain of desolvating water molecules are a major driving force, and both force fields have the same strength of non-polar attractions between solutes and {beta}-CD as well. Water molecules play a crucial role in guest binding to {beta}-CD. However, collective water/{beta}-CD motions could contribute to different computed kon and {Delta}H values by different force fields, mainly because the parameters of {beta}-CD provide different motions of {beta}-CD, hydrogen-bond networks of water molecules in the cavity of free {beta}-CD and the strength of desolvation penalty. As a result, q4MD-CD suggests that guest binding is mostly driven by enthalpy, while GAFF-CD shows that gaining entropy is the major driven force of binding. The study further interprets experiments, deepens our understanding of ligand binding, and suggests strategies for force field parameterization.",

    "abstract": "Recent genome analyses have identified recurrent mutations in the cohesin complex in a wide range of human cancers. Here we demonstrate that the most frequently mutated subunit of the cohesin complex, STAG2, displays a strong synthetic lethal interaction with its paralog STAG1. Mechanistically, STAG1 loss abrogates sister chromatid cohesion in STAG2 mutated but not in wild-type cells leading to mitotic catastrophe, defective cell division and apoptosis. STAG1 inactivation inhibits the proliferation of STAG2 mutated but not wild-type bladder cancer and Ewing sarcoma cell lines. Restoration of STAG2 expression in a mutated bladder cancer model alleviates the dependency on STAG1. Thus, STAG1 and STAG2 support sister chromatid cohesion to redundantly ensure cell survival. STAG1 represents a vulnerability of cancer cells carrying mutations in the major emerging tumor suppressor STAG2 across different cancer contexts. Exploiting synthetic lethal interactions to target recurrent cohesin mutations in cancer, e.g. by inhibiting STAG1, holds the promise for the development of selective therapeutics.",

We thus hypothesized that population-wide epitope immunogenicity could be probabilistically defined by exploiting public TCR features. To gain a proof-of-concept, here we describe a machine learning framework yielding probabilistic estimates of immunogenicity, termed \\\"immunogenicity scores\\\", by utilizing features designed to mimic thermodynamic interactions between peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and TCR repertoire. Immunogenicity score dynamics among observed and computationally simulated single amino acid mutants delineated the landscape of position- and residue-specific mutational impacts, and even quantitatively estimated escaping potentials of known epitopes with remarkable positional specificity. This study illustrates that the population-wide aspect of adaptive immunity is predictable via non-individualized approach, possibly indicating antigen-guided convergence of human T cell reactivity.",

    "abstract": "Homeostasis is a vital mode of biological self-regulation. The hallmarks of homeostasis for any biological system are a baseline set point of physiological activity, detection of unacceptable deviations from the set point, and effective corrective measures to counteract deviations. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) is a form of neuroplasticity in which neurons and circuits resist environmental perturbations in order to maintain appropriate levels of activity. One assumption is that if an environmental perturbation triggers homeostatic corrective changes in neuronal properties, those corrective measures should be reversed upon removal of the perturbation. We test the reversibility and limits of HSP at a well-studied model synapse, the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ). At the Drosophila NMJ, impairment of glutamate receptors causes a decrease in quantal size, which is offset by a corrective, homeostatic increase in the number of vesicles released per evoked presynaptic stimulus, or quantal content. This process has been termed presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). Taking advantage of a GAL4/GAL80TS/UAS expression system, we triggered PHP by expressing a dominant-negative glutamate receptor subunit at the NMJ. We then reversed PHP by halting expression of the dominant-negative receptor. Our data show that PHP is fully reversible over a time course of 48-72 hours after the dominant-negative glutamate receptor stops being genetically expressed. Additionally, we found that the PHP response triggered by the dominant-negative subunit was ablated at high temperatures. Our data show that the long-term maintenance of PHP at the Drosophila NMJ is a reversible regulatory process that is sensitive to temperature.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBiological homeostatic systems must upregulate or downregulate cellular parameters in order to maintain appropriate set points of physiological activity. Homeostasis is a well-documented mode of regulation in metazoan nervous systems. True homeostatic control should be a reversible process - but due to technical difficulties of presenting and removing functional challenges to living synapses, the reversibility of homeostatic forms of synapse regulation has not been rigorously examined in vivo over extended periods of developmental time. Here we formally demonstrate that homeostatic regulation of Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular synapse function is reversible and temperature-labile. This is significant because developing methods to study how homeostatic regulatory systems are turned on and off could lead to fundamental new insights about control of synaptic output.",

    "abstract": "Music is a highly dynamic stimulus, and consists of distinct acoustic features, such as pitch, rhythm and timbre. Neuroimaging studies highlight a hierarchy of brain networks involved in music perception. Psychedelic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) temporary disintegrate the normal hierarchy of brain functioning, and produce profound subjective effects, including enhanced music-evoked emotion. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the acute effects of LSD on music-evoked brain-activity under naturalistic music listening conditions. 16 healthy participants were enrolled in magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while listening to a 7-minute music piece under eyes-closed conditions on two separate visits (LSD (75 mcg) and placebo). Dynamic time courses for acoustic features were extracted from the music excerpts, and were entered into subject-level fMRI analyses as regressors of interest. Differences between conditions were assessed at group level subsequently, and were related to changes in music-evoked emotions via correlation analyses. Psycho-physiological interactions (PPIs) were carried out to further interrogate underlying music-specific changes in functional connectivity under LSD. Results showed pronounced cortical and subcortical changes in music-evoked brain activity under LSD. Most notable changes in brain activity and connectivity were associated with the component timbral complexity, representing the complexity of the musics spectral distribution, and these occurred in brain networks previously identified for music-perception and music-evoked emotion, and showed an association with enhanced music-evoked feelings of wonder under LSD. The findings shed light on how the brain processes music under LSD, and provide a neurobiological basis for the usefulness of music in psychedelic therapy.",

Here, we examined how varying the rate of stress application alters budding yeast cell viability and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling at the single-cell level. We show that cell survival and signaling depend on a rate threshold that operates in conjunction with a concentration threshold to determine the timing of MAPK signaling during rate-varying stimulus treatments. We also discovered that the stimulation rate threshold is sensitive to changes in the expression levels of the Ptp2 phosphatase, but not of another phosphatase that similarly regulates osmostress signaling during switch-like treatments. Our results demonstrate that stimulation rate is a regulated determinant of signaling output and provide a paradigm to guide the dissection of major stimulation rate-dependent mechanisms in other systems.",

Therefore, we tested whether a buffering agent increases the output of glucose in the liver and influences of lactose synthesis. In this study, sixteen lactating goats were randomly assigned to two groups: one group received a HC diets (Concentrate: Forage = 6:4, HG), and the other group received the same diet with a buffering agent added (0.2% NaHCO3, 0.1% MgO, BG) as a treatment for 19-weeks experimental period. The results showed that the total volatile fatty acids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) declined in the rumen leading to the rumen pH was stabilized in the BG group. Milk yield and lactose content increased. The alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, pro-inflammatory cytokines, LPS and lactate content in the plasma was significantly decreased, whereas prolactin and growth hormone levels were increased. The hepatic vein content of glucose was increased. In addition, the expression of pyruvate carboxylase (PC), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) in the liver was significantly up-regulated. In mammary gland, the glucose transporter type-1, 8, 12 and sodium-glucose cotransporter-1 levels were increased. Cumulatively, the buffering agent treatment increased blood concentrations of glucose via the gluconeogenes and promoting their synthesis in the liver. It may contribute to the increase in milk yield and lactose synthesis of lactating goats.",

Incredible progress has been achieved in computational modeling, simulation and optimization, across domains as diverse as astrophysics, climate studies, biomedicine, architecture, and chess. However, the use of computers to pose new questions, or prioritize existing ones, has thus far been quite limited.\\n\\nPicassos comment highlights the point that good questions can sometimes be more elusive than good answers. The history of science offers numerous examples of the impact of good questions. Paul Erd[o]s, the wandering monk of mathematical graph theory, offered small prizes for anyone who could prove conjectures he identified as important (1). The prizes varied in cash amounts based on the perceived complexity of the problem posed by Erd[o]s.\\n\\nPosing technical questions and allocating resources to answer them has taken on a new guise in the Internet age. The X-Prize foundation (http://www.xprize.org/) offers multi-million dollar bounties for grand technological goals, including goals for sequencing genomes or space exploration. Several companies provide portals where customers can place cash bounties on educational, scientific or technological challenges, while potential problem solvers can compete to produce the best solutions for these problems. Amazons Turk site (https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) links people requesting performance of intellectual tasks to people willing to work on them for a fee. Such crowd-sourcing systems create markets of questions and answers, and can help allocate resources and capabilities efficiently.\\n\\nThis paradigm suggests a number of interesting questions for scientific research. In a resource limited environment, can funds and research capacity be allocated more efficiently? Can knowledge demand provide an alternative or complementary mechanism to traditional investigator-initiated research grants?\\n\\nThe fathers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Herbert Simon in particular envisioned the application of AI to Scientific Discovery in different forms and styles (focusing on physics). We follow on these early dreams and describe a novel approach aimed at remodeling of the biomedical research infrastructure and catalyze gene function determination. We aim to start a bold discussion of new ideas aimed towards increasing the efficiency of the allocation of research capacities, reproducibility, provenance tracking, removing redundancy and catalyzing knowledge gain with each experiment. In particular, we describe a tractable computational framework and infrastructure that can help researchers assess the potential information gain of millions of experiments before conducting them. The utility of experiments in this case is modeled as the predictive knowledge (formalized as information) to be gained as a result of performing the experiment. The experimentalist would then be empowered to select experiments that maximized information gain if they wished, recognizing that there are frequently other considerations, such as a specific technological or medical utility, that might over-ride the priority of maximizing information gain. The conceptual approach we develop is general, and here we apply it to the study of gene function.",

    "abstract": "Many adult tissues are dynamically sustained by the rapid turnover of stem cells. Yet, how cell fates such as self-renewal and differentiation are orchestrated to achieve long-term homeostasis remains elusive. Studies utilizing clonal tracing experiments in multiple tissues have argued that while stem cell fate is balanced at the population level, individual cell fate - to divide or differentiate - is determined intrinsically by each cell seemingly at random ( 1 2 3 4 5). These studies leave open the question of how cell fates are regulated to achieve fate balance across the tissue. Stem cell fate choices could be made autonomously by each cell throughout the tissue or be the result of cell coordination ( 6 7). Here we developed a novel live tracking strategy that allowed recording of every division and differentiation event within a region of epidermis for a week. These measurements reveal that stem cell fates are not autonomous. Rather, direct neighbors undergo coupled opposite fate decisions. We further found a clear ordering of events, with self-renewal triggered by neighbor differentiation, but not vice-versa. Typically, around 1-2 days after cell delamination, a neighboring cell entered S/G2 phase and divided. Functional blocking of this local feedback showed that differentiation continues to occur in the absence of cell division, resulting in a rapid depletion of the epidermal stem cell pool. We thus demonstrate that the epidermis is maintained by nearest neighbor coordination of cell fates, rather than by asymmetric divisions or fine-tuned cell-autonomous stochastic fate choices. These findings establish differentiation-dependent division as a core feature of homeostatic control, and define the relevant time and length scales over which homeostasis is enforced in epithelial tissues.",

    "abstract": "Differences among hosts, resulting from genetic variation in the immune system or heterogeneity in drug treatment, can impact within-host pathogen evolution. Identifying such interactions can potentially be achieved through genetic association studies. However, extensive and correlated genetic population structure in hosts and pathogens presents a substantial risk of confounding analyses. Moreover, the multiple testing burden of interaction scanning can potentially limit power. To address these problems, we have developed a Bayesian approach for detecting host influences on pathogen evolution that makes use of vast existing data sets of pathogen diversity to improve power and control for stratification. The approach models key processes, including recombination and selection, and identifies regions of the pathogen genome affected by host factors. Using simulations and empirical analysis of drug-induced selection on the HIV-1 genome we demonstrate the power of the method to recover known associations and show greatly improved precision-recall characteristics compared to other approaches. We build a high-resolution map of HLA-induced selection in the HIV-1 genome, identifying novel epitope-allele combinations.",

Here, we investigate the contribution of enhancer elements to the metastatic phenotype of osteosarcoma. Through epigenomic profiling, we identify substantial differences in enhancer activity between primary and metastatic tumors in human patients as well as nearisogenic pairs of high and low lung-metastatic osteosarcoma cells. We term these regions Metastatic Variant Enhancer Loci (Met-VELs). We demonstrate that these Met-VELs drive coordinated waves of gene expression during metastatic colonization of the lung. Met-VELs cluster non-randomly, indicating that activity of these enhancers and their associated gene targets are positively selected. As evidence of this causal association, osteosarcoma lung metastasis is inhibited by global interruptions of Met-VEL-associated gene expression via pharmacologic BET inhibition, by knockdown of AP-1 transcription factors that occupy Met-VELs, and by knockdown or functional inhibition of individual genes activated by Met-VELs, such as F3. We further show that genetic deletion of a single Met-VEL at the F3 locus blocks metastatic cell outgrowth in the lung. These findings indicate that Met-VELs and the genes they regulate play a functional role in metastasis and may be suitable targets for anti-metastatic therapies.",

These forces include those both decreasing (e.g., selective sweeps (Begun et al. 2007; Cruickshank & Hahn 2014) or background selection (Phung et al. 2016)) and increasing variation (e.g., balancing selection (Charlesworth 2006)).

Here, we investigate the evolution and adaptation of H7N9 by combining publicly available data with newly generated virus sequences isolated in Guangdong between 2015-2017. Phylogenetic analyses show that currently-circulating H7N9 viruses belong to distinct lineages with differing spatial distributions. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction and structural modelling we have identified parallel amino-acid changes on multiple separate lineages. Furthermore, we infer mutations in HA primarily occur at sites involved in receptor-recognition and/or antigenicity. We also identify seven new HP strains, which likely emerged from viruses circulating in eastern Guangdong around March 2016 and is further associated with a high rate of adaptive molecular evolution.",

    "abstract": "Recent genomic analyses have provided substantial evidence for past periods of gene flow from polar bears (Ursus maritimus) into Alaskan brown bears (Ursus arctos), with some analyses suggesting a link between climate change and genomic introgression. However, because it has only been possible to sample bears from the present day, the timing, frequency, and evolutionary significance of this admixture remains unknown. Here, we analyze genomic DNA from three additional and geographically distinct brown bear populations, including two that lived temporally close to the peak of the last ice age. We find evidence of admixture in all three populations, suggesting that admixture between these species has been common in their recent evolutionary history. In addition, analyses of ten fossil bears from the now-extinct Irish population indicate that admixture peaked during the last ice age, when brown bear and polar bear ranges overlapped. Following this peak, the proportion of polar bear ancestry in Irish brown bears declined rapidly until their extinction. Our results support a model in which ice age climate change created geographically widespread conditions conducive to admixture between polar bears and brown bears, as is again occurring today. We postulate that this model will be informative for many admixing species pairs impacted by climate change. Our results highlight the power of paleogenomes to reveal patterns of evolutionary change that are otherwise masked with only contemporary data.",

It is widely assumed that mechanisms of enhancer action involve reorganization of three-dimensional chromatin architecture, but this is poorly understood. Here we identify a novel mechanism of long-range enhancer associated chromatin reorganization. At the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) locus we observe large-scale decompaction of chromatin between Shh and its brain enhancers in neural progenitor cells. We show that the chromatin unfolding is dependent on activation of the enhancers, not the promoter, is impeded by chromatin-bound proteins located between the enhancer and promoter, and is mediated by the recruitment of Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1. We suggest that large-scale chromatin decompaction, analogous to the inducible puffs in Drosophila polytene chromosomes, represents a new mechanism of chromatin reorganization coupled to long-range gene activation from mammalian enhancers and that seems incompatible with a chromatin-looping model of enhancer-promoter communication",

Additionally, an in vivo promoter reporter assay and motility analysis revealed a key role for IHF as a repressor of cell motility through the control of FliA sigma factor expression. This investigation of first stage and mature biofilm formation indicates that biofilm structure is strongly affected by IHF and Fis, while CRP seems to provide a fine-tuning mechanism.

    "abstract": "Healthy ageing is accompanied by a constellation of changes in cognitive processes and alterations in functional brain networks. The relationships between brain networks and cognition during ageing in later life are moderated by demographic and environmental factors, such as prior education, in a poorly understood manner. Using multivariate analyses, we identify three latent patterns (or modes) linking resting-state functional connectivity to demographic and cognitive measures in 101 cognitively-normal elders. The first mode (p=0.00043) captures an opposing association between age and core cognitive processes such as attention and processing speed on functional connectivity patterns. The functional subnetwork expressed by this mode links bilateral sensorimotor and visual regions through key areas such as the parietal operculum. A strong, independent association between years of education and functional connectivity loads onto a second mode (p=0.012), characterised by the involvement of key hub-regions. A third mode (p=0.041) captures weak, residual brain-behaviour relations. Our findings suggest that circuits supporting lower-level cognitive processes are most sensitive to the influence of age in healthy older adults. Education, and to a lesser extent, executive functions, load independently onto functional networks - suggesting that the moderating effect of education acts upon networks distinct from those vulnerable with ageing. This has important implications in understanding the contribution of education to cognitive reserve during healthy ageing.",

    "abstract": "Musicians can perform at different tempos, speakers can control the cadence of their speech, and children can flexibly vary their temporal expectations of events. To understand the neural basis of such flexible timing, we recorded from the medial frontal cortex of primates trained to produce different time intervals with different effectors. The activity of neurons was heterogeneous, nonlinear and complex. However, responses were unified under a remarkable form of invariance: firing rate profiles were temporally stretched for longer intervals and compressed for short ones. At the network level, this phenomenon was evident by flexible changes in the speed with which the population activity traced an invariant trajectory. To identify the origin of speed control, we recorded from both downstream caudate neurons and thalamic neurons projecting to the medial frontal cortex. Speed adjustments were a prominent feature in the caudate but not in the thalamus suggesting that this phenomenon originates within cortical networks. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we created recurrent neural network models at different levels of complexity that could explain flexible timing with speed control. Analysis of the models revealed that the key to flexible speed control was the action of an external input upon the nonlinearities of individual neurons whose recurrent interactions set the networks relaxation dynamics. These findings demonstrate a simple and general mechanism for conferring temporal flexibility upon sensorimotor and cognitive functions.",

Comparison of both structures for the same protein allows precise determination of structural changes after photo-activation. The chromophore photoisomerization causes an outward movement and partial helix formation of a formerly unstructured loop. A tryptophan residue located in this loop, in {pi}-{pi} stacking distance to PCB in the dark state, moves away by 14 [A] opening the binding cleft for the entry of water molecules. Also the in vitro assembled protein (chromophore addition to apo-protein) has been crystallized (1.6 [A] resolution). Most importantly, an intermediate structure was solved (2.1 [A]) with the protein in photoproduct conformation and the chromophore already isomerized into the parental 15-Z configuration, thereby giving insight into chromophore-initiated conformational protein changes.\\n\\nImpact StatementThis manuscript presents crystal structures of a photochromic protein in both states, before (1.6 [A]) and after (1.9 [A]) the light induced photochemical event with sufficient resolution to allow detailed description of conformational changes of chromophore and protein. The light driven reaction, double bond photoisomerization of a covalently bound bilin chromophore is presented here for the first time. Our results allow determining the impact of the chromophore photochemistry on the protein conformation. In addition, we succeeded in trapping an intermediate carrying the chromophore already in isomerized state with the protein still in unchanged conformation. Absorption spectra of this intermediate clearly demonstrate a color change, thus allowing conclusion that the absorption of phytochromes is predominantly determined by the chromophore conformation alone with only moderate effect of the surrounding protein.\\n\\nAuthors ContributionsXX, KHZ, and WG designed the experiment.
