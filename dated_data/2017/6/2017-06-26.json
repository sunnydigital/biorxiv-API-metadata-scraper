    "abstract": "Cell size is specific to each species and impacts their ability to function. While various phenomenological models for cell size regulation have been proposed, recent work in bacteria have demonstrated an adder model, in which a cell increments its size by a constant amount between each division. However, the coupling between cell size, shape and constriction, remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate size control and the cell cycle dependence of bacterial growth, using multigenerational cell growth and shape data for single Caulobacter crescentus cells. Our analysis reveals a biphasic mode of growth: a relative timer phase before constriction where cell growth is correlated to its initial size, followed by a pure adder phase during constriction. Cell wall labeling measurements reinforce this biphasic model: a crossover from uniform lateral growth to localized septal growth is observed. We present a mathematical model that quantitatively explains this biphasic mixer model for cell size control.",

    "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that some genes have originated de novo from previously non-coding genomic sequences. However, the processes underlying de novo gene birth are still enigmatic. In particular, the appearance of a new functional protein seems highly improbable unless there is already a pool of neutrally evolving peptides that can at some point acquire new functions. Here we show for the first time that such peptides do not only exist but that they are prevalent among the translation products of mouse genes that lack homologues in rat and human. The data suggests that the translation of these peptides is due to the chance occurrence of open reading frames with a favorable codon composition. Our approach combines ribosome profiling experiments, proteomics data and non-synonymous and synonymous nucleotide polymorphism analysis. We propose that effectively neutral processes involving the expression of thousands of transcripts all the way down to proteins provide a basis for de novo gene evolution.",

    "abstract": "Recent history has provided us with one pandemic (Influenza A/H1N1) and two severe viral outbreaks (Ebola and Zika). In all three cases, post-hoc analyses have given us deep insights into what triggered these outbreaks, their timing, evolutionary dynamics, and phylogeography, but the genomic characteristics of outbreak viruses are still unclear. To address this outstanding question, we searched for a common denominator between these recent outbreaks, positing that the genome of outbreak viruses is in an unstable evolutionary state, while that of non-outbreak viruses is stabilized by a network of correlated substitutions. Here, we show that during regular epidemics, viral genomes are indeed stabilized by a dense network of weakly correlated sites, and that these networks disappear during pandemics and outbreaks when rates of evolution increase transiently. Post-pandemic, these evolutionary networks are progressively re-established. We finally show that destabilization is not caused by substitutions targeting epitopes, but more likely by changes in the environment sensu lato. Our results prompt for a new interpretation of pandemics as being associated with evolutionary destabilized viruses.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity generates ionic flows and thereby both magnetic fields and electric potential differences, i.e. voltages. Voltage measurements are widely used, but suffer from isolating and smearing properties of tissue between source and sensor, are blind to ionic flow direction, and reflect the difference between two electrodes, complicating interpretation. Magnetic field measurements could overcome these limitations, but have been essentially limited to magnetoencephalography (MEG), using centimeter-sized, helium-cooled extracranial sensors. Here, we report on in vivo magnetic recordings of neuronal activity from visual cortex of cats with magnetrodes, specially developed needle-shaped probes carrying micron-sized, non-cooled magnetic sensors based on spin electronics. Event-related magnetic fields inside the neuropil were on the order of several nanoteslas, informing MEG source models and efforts for magnetic field measurements through MRI. Though the signal-to-noise ratio is still inferior to electrophysiology, this proof of concept demonstrates the potential to exploit the fundamental advantages of magnetophysiology.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LISpin-electronics based probes achieve local magnetic recordings inside the neuropil\\nC_LIO_LIMagnetic field recordings were performed in vivo, in anesthetized cat visual cortex\\nC_LIO_LIEvent-related fields (ERFs) to visual stimuli were up to several nanoteslas in size\\nC_LIO_LIERFs could be detected after averaging less than 20 trials\\nC_LI\\n\\nIN BRIEFCaruso et al. report in vivo, intra-cortical recordings of magnetic fields that reflect neuronal activity, using magnetrodes, i.e. micron size magnetic sensors based on spin electronics.",

    "abstract": "Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are iconic Australian marsupials currently threatened by several processes. Infectious reproductive tract disease, caused by Chlamydia pecorum, and koala retrovirus infection are considered key drivers of population decline. The clinical sign of  wet bottom, a staining of the rump associated with urinary incontinence, is often caused by chlamydial urogenital tract infections. However, wet bottom has been recorded in koalas free of C. pecorum, suggesting other causative agents in those individuals. Current understanding of the bacterial community of the koala urogenital tract is limited. We used 16S rRNA diversity profiling to investigate the microbiome of the urogenital tract of ten female koalas. This was to produce baseline data on the female koala urogenital tract microbiome, and to undertake preliminary investigations of potential causative agents of wet bottom, other than C. pecorum. Five urogenital samples were processed from koalas presenting with wet bottom and five were clinically normal. We detected thirteen phyla across the ten samples, with Firmicutes occurring at the highest relative abundance (77.6%). The order Lactobacillales, within the Firmicutes, comprised 70.3% of the reads from all samples. After normalising reads using DESeq2 and testing for significant differences (P < 0.05), there were 25 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) more commonly found in one group over the other. The families Aerococcaceae and Tissierellaceae both had four significantly differentially abundant OTUs. These four Tissierellaceae OTUs were all significantly more abundant in koalas with wet bottom.\\n\\nImportanceThis study provides an essential foundation for future investigations of both the normal microflora of the koala urogenital tract, and better understanding of the causes of koala urogenital tract disease. Koalas in the states of Queensland and New South Wales are currently undergoing decline, and have been classified as vulnerable populations. Urogenital tract disease is a leading cause of hospital admissions in these states, yet previously little was known of the normal flora of this site. Wet bottom is a clinical sign of urogenital tract disease, which is often assumed to be caused by C. pecorum and treated accordingly. Our research highlights that other organisms may be causing wet bottom, and these potential aetiological agents need to be further investigated to fully address the problems this species faces.",

    "abstract": "Directed connectivity inference has become a cornerstone in neuroscience following the recent progress in neuroimaging and elctrophysiological techniques to characterize anatomical and functional networks. This paper focuses on the detection of existing connections from the observed activity in networks of 50 to 150 nodes with linear feedback in discrete time. Through the variation of multiple network parameters, our numerical results indicate that directed connections - in the time domain - are more accurately estimated based on the coefficients obtained from multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) than Granger causality analysis, which is based on the error residuals of the same MVAR linear regression. Based on these findings, we propose a non-parametric significance test for connectivity detection, which achieves a good control of false positives (type 1 error) and is robust to various network topologies. When generating surrogate distributions, we compare the effects of circular shifts, random permutations and phase randomization of the observed time series, each breaking down covariances in a specific manner: the MVAR estimates from those shuffled covariances build a null-hypothesis distribution for each connection, from which the original connectivity estimate can be compared. We apply our method to multiunit activity data recorded from Utah electrode arrays in monkey and examine the detected interactions between 25 channels for a proof of concept. The results unravel a non-trivial underlying connectivity structure, which differentiates the effect of incoming and outgoing connections.",

    "abstract": "Allosteric regulation is found across all domains of life, yet we still lack simple, predictive theories that directly link the experimentally tunable parameters of a system to its input-output response. To that end, we present a general theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model. We rigorously test this model using the ubiquitous simple repression motif in bacteria by first predicting the behavior of strains that span a large range of repressor copy numbers and DNA binding strengths and then constructing and measuring their response. Our model not only accurately captures the induction profiles of these strains but also enables us to derive analytic expressions for key properties such as the dynamic range and [EC50]. Finally, we derive an expression for the free energy of allosteric repressors which enables us to collapse our experimental data onto a single master curve that captures the diverse phenomenology of the induction profiles.",

    "abstract": "One of the major challenges in visual neuroscience is represented by foreground-background segmentation. Data from nonhuman primates show that segmentation leads to two distinct, but associated processes: the enhancement of neural activity during figure processing (i.e., foreground enhancement) and the suppression of background-related activity (i.e., background suppression). To study foreground-background segmentation in ecological conditions, we introduce a novel method based on parametric modulation of low-level image properties followed by application of simple computational image-processing models. By correlating the outcome of this procedure with human fMRI activity measured during passive viewing of 334 natural images, we reconstruct easily interpretable \\\"neural images\\\" from seven visual areas: V1, V2, V3, V3A, V3B, V4 and LOC. Results show evidence of foreground enhancement for all tested regions, while background suppression specifically occurs in V4 and LOC. \\\"Neural images\\\" reconstructed from V4 and LOC revealed a preserved spatial resolution of foreground textures, indicating a richer representation of the salient part of natural images, rather than a simplistic model of object shape. Our results indicate that scene segmentation is an automatic process that occurs during natural viewing, even when individuals are not required to perform any particular task.",

    "abstract": "Plant cells are surrounded by walls, which must often meet opposing functional requirements during plant growth and defense. The cells meet them by modifying wall structure and composition in a tightly controlled and adaptive manner. The modifications seem to be mediated by a dedicated cell wall integrity (CWI) maintenance mechanism. Currently the mode of action of the mechanism is not understood and it is unclear how its activity is coordinated with established plant defense signaling. We investigated responses to induced cell wall damage (CWD) impairing CWI and the underlying mechanism in Arabidopsis thaliana. Interestingly inhibitor- and enzyme-derived CWD induced similar, turgor-sensitive stress responses. Genetic analysis showed that the receptor-like kinase (RLK) FEI2 and the mechano-sensitive, plasma membrane-localized Ca2+- channel MCA1 function downstream of the THE1 RLK in CWD perception. Phenotypic clustering with 27 genotypes identified a core group of RLKs and ion channels, required for activation of CWD responses. By contrast, the responses were repressed by pattern-triggered immune (PTI) signaling components including PEPR1 and 2, the receptors for the immune signaling peptide AtPep1. Interestingly AtPep1 application repressed CWD-induced phytohormone accumulation in a PEPR1/2-dependent manner. These results suggest that PTI suppresses CWD-induced defense responses through elicitor peptide-mediated signaling during defense response activation. If PTI is impaired, the suppression of CWD-induced responses is alleviated, thus compensating for defective PTI.\\n\\nSignificance statementStress resistance and plant growth determine food crop yield and efficiency of bioenergy production from ligno-cellulosic biomass. Plant cell walls are essential elements of the biological processes, therefore functional integrity of the cell walls must be maintained throughout. Here we investigate the plant cell wall integrity maintenance mechanism. We characterize its mode of action, identify essential signaling components and show that the AtPep1 signaling peptide apparently coordinates pattern triggered immunity (PTI) and cell wall integrity maintenance in plants. These results suggest how PTI and cell wall modification coordinately regulate biotic stress responses with plants possibly compensating for PTI impairment through enhanced activation of stress responses regulated by the CWI maintenance mechanism.",

KMAC also identifies correct motifs in more experiments than four state-of-the-art motif discovery methods. In addition, KSM derived features outperform both PWM and deep learning model derived sequence features in predicting differential regulatory activities of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) alleles. Finally, we have applied KMAC to 1488 ENCODE TF ChIP-seq datasets and created a public resource of KSM and PWM motifs. We expect that the KSM representation and KMAC method will be valuable in characterizing TF binding specificities and in interpreting the effects of non-coding genetic variations.",

    "abstract": "Measures of general deleteriousness, like CADD or PolyPhen, have become indispensable tools in the interpretation of genetic variants. However, these measures say little about where in the organism these deleterious effects will be most apparent. An additional, complementary measure is needed to link deleterious variants (as determined by e.g., CADD) to tissues in which their effect will be most meaningful. Here, we introduce TiSAn (Tissue Specific Annotation), a tool that predicts how related a genomic position is to a given tissue (http://github.com/kevinVervier/TiSAn). TiSAn uses machine learning on genome-scale, tissue-specific data to discriminate variants relevant to a tissue from those having no bearing on the development or function of that tissue. Predictions are then made genome-wide, and these scores can then be used to contextualize and filter variants of interest in whole genome sequencing or genome wide association studies (GWAS). We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of TiSAn by introducing predictive models for human heart and human brain, and detecting tissue-relevant variations in large cohorts for autism spectrum disorder (TiSAn-brain) and coronary artery disease (TiSAn-heart). We find that TiSAn is better able to prioritize genetic variants according to their tissue-specific action than the current state of the art method, GenoSkyLine.",

Here, we used a multielectrode array, wide field calcium imaging, and two-photon calcium imaging to study focal seizure propagation pathways in an acute rodent neocortical 4-aminopyridine model. Although ictal neuronal bursts did not propagate beyond a 2-3 mm region, they were associated with hemisphere-wide field potential fluctuations and parvalbumin-positive interneuron activity outside the seizure focus. While bicuculline surface application enhanced contiguous seizure propagation, focal bicuculline microinjection at sites distant to the 4-aminopyridine focus resulted in epileptic network formation with maximal activity at the two foci. Our study suggests that both classical and epileptic network propagation can arise from localized inhibition defects, and that the network appearance can arise in the context of normal brain structure without requirement for pathological connectivity changes between sites.",

    "abstract": "Cell fate generation can rely on the unequal distribution of molecules during progenitor cell division in the nervous system of vertebrates and invertebrates. Here we address asymmetric fate determinant localization in the developing Drosophila nervous system, focussing on the control of asymmetric Miranda distribution in larval neuroblasts. We used live imaging of neuroblast polarity reporters at endogenous levels of expression to address Miranda localization during the cell cycle. We reveal that the regulation and dynamics of cortical association of Miranda in interphase and mitosis are different. In interphase Miranda binds directly to the plasma membrane. At the onset of mitosis, Miranda is phosphorylated by aPKC and displaced from the PM. After nuclear envelope breakdown asymmetric localization of Miranda requires actomyosin activity. Therefore, Miranda phosphorylation by aPKC and differential binding to the actomyosin network are required at distinct phases of the cell cycle to polarize fate determinant localization.",

    "abstract": "Human gut microbiome composition is shaped by multiple host intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but the relative contribution of host genetic compared to environmental factors remains elusive. Here, we genotyped a cohort of 696 healthy individuals from several distinct ancestral origins and a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that there is no statistically significant association between microbiome composition and ethnicity, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or overall genetic similarity, and that only 5 of 211 (2.4%) previously reported microbiome-SNP associations replicate in our cohort. In contrast, we find similarities in the microbiome composition of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household. We define the term biome-explainability as the variance of a host phenotype explained by the microbiome after accounting for the contribution of human genetics. Consistent with our finding that microbiome and host genetics are largely independent, we find significant biome-explainability levels of 16-33% for body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), and lactose consumption. We further show that several human phenotypes can be predicted substantially more accurately when adding microbiome data to host genetics data, and that the contribution of both data sources to prediction accuracy is largely additive. Overall, our results suggest that human microbiome composition is dominated by environmental factors rather than by host genetics.",

    "abstract": "Whilst next generation sequencing is frequently used to whole genome sequence bacteria from cultures, its rarely applied directly to clinical samples. Therefore, this study addresses the issue of applying NGS microbial diagnostics directly to blood samples. To demonstrate the potential of direct from blood sequencing a bacteria spiked blood model was developed. Horse blood was spiked with clinical samples of E. coli and S. aureus, and a process developed to isolate bacterial cells whilst removing the majority of host DNA. One sample of each isolate was then amplified using {phi}29 multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and sequenced. The total processing time, from sample to amplified DNA ready for sequencing was 3.5 hours, significantly faster than the 18-hour overnight culture step which is typically required. Both bacteria showed 100% survival through the processing. The direct from sample sequencing resulted in greater than 92% genome coverage of the pathogens whilst limiting the sequencing of host genome (less than 7% of all reads). Analysis of de novo assembled reads allowed accurate genotypic antibiotic resistance prediction. The sample processing is easily applicable to multiple sequencing platforms. Overall this model demonstrates potential to rapidly generate whole genome bacterial data directly from blood.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAntibiotic resistance poses a threat to public health and a burden to healthcare systems. Escherichia coli causes more bacteraemia cases in England than any other bacterial species, these infections, in part due to their high incidence, also pose a significant antibiotic resistance burden. The main aim of this study was to estimate the impact of E. coli bacteraemia on patient in-hospital mortality and length of stay. Secondarily, this study also aimed to estimate the effect of antibiotic resistance on these outcomes.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsCase patients were adult E. coli bacteraemia patients infected between July 2011 and June 2012, as reported in an English national mandatory surveillance database, with susceptibility data taken from a national laboratory surveillance database. Control patients were all non-case, adult patients with an English hospital admission record. Case and control patient characteristics and admission information were taken from NHS Digital Datasets.  Resistance was defined as non-susceptible and intermediate isolates, whilst  susceptible was defined as susceptible and non-tested isolates. Time to in-hospital mortality and discharge was investigated through Cox proportional hazards models. To acquire estimates of excess length of stay, multistate models were constructed, with a unit bed day cost applied to estimate cost burden. The total number of case and control hospital spells was 14,051 and 8,919,275 respectively. Acquisition of E. coli bacteraemia was associated with a statistically significant increased daily risk of in-hospital mortality, especially for the first eight days of someones hospital admission [Hazard Ratio = 2.77 (95% confidence interval; 2.61-2.94)]. Antibiotic resistance did not seem to significantly increase this risk further, though did significantly reduce risk of experiencing a discharge event (dead or alive). E.coli bacteraemia was estimated to cost {pound}14,340,900 over the study period (rounded to the nearest {pound}100), with resistance associated with excess costs per infection of {pound}220 - {pound}420 dependent on resistance type, for those where a significant impact was found (rounded to the nearest {pound}10).\\n\\nConclusionsE. coli bacteraemia places a significant burden on patient health and on the hospital sector in England. Resistance is an important factor on length of stay with regards to such infections.",

    "abstract": "Homeostasis is a vital mode of biological self-regulation. The hallmarks of homeostasis for any biological system are a baseline set point of physiological activity, detection of unacceptable deviations from the set point, and effective corrective measures to counteract deviations. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) is a form of neuroplasticity in which neurons and circuits resist environmental perturbations in order to maintain appropriate levels of activity. One assumption is that if an environmental perturbation triggers homeostatic corrective changes in neuronal properties, those corrective measures should be reversed upon removal of the perturbation. We test the reversibility and limits of HSP at a well-studied model synapse, the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ). At the Drosophila NMJ, impairment of glutamate receptors causes a decrease in quantal size, which is offset by a corrective, homeostatic increase in the number of vesicles released per evoked presynaptic stimulus, or quantal content. This process has been termed presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). Taking advantage of a GAL4/GAL80TS/UAS expression system, we triggered PHP by expressing a dominant-negative glutamate receptor subunit at the NMJ. We then reversed PHP by halting expression of the dominant-negative receptor. Our data show that PHP is fully reversible over a time course of 48-72 hours after the dominant-negative glutamate receptor stops being genetically expressed. Additionally, we found that the PHP response triggered by the dominant-negative subunit was ablated at high temperatures. Our data show that the long-term maintenance of PHP at the Drosophila NMJ is a reversible regulatory process that is sensitive to temperature.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBiological homeostatic systems must upregulate or downregulate cellular parameters in order to maintain appropriate set points of physiological activity. Homeostasis is a well-documented mode of regulation in metazoan nervous systems. True homeostatic control should be a reversible process - but due to technical difficulties of presenting and removing functional challenges to living synapses, the reversibility of homeostatic forms of synapse regulation has not been rigorously examined in vivo over extended periods of developmental time. Here we formally demonstrate that homeostatic regulation of Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular synapse function is reversible and temperature-labile. This is significant because developing methods to study how homeostatic regulatory systems are turned on and off could lead to fundamental new insights about control of synaptic output.",

We were able to map critical nodes that govern planktonic to biofilm transition and identify 8 new regulatory interactions for CRP, IHF or Fis responsible for the control of the promoters of rpoS, rpoE, flhD, fliA, csgD and yeaJ. Additionally, an in vivo promoter reporter assay and motility analysis revealed a key role for IHF as a repressor of cell motility through the control of FliA sigma factor expression. This investigation of first stage and mature biofilm formation indicates that biofilm structure is strongly affected by IHF and Fis, while CRP seems to provide a fine-tuning mechanism. Taken together, the analysis presented here shows the utility of combining computational and experimental approaches to generate a deeper understanding of the biofilm formation process in bacteria.",

We used this set to identify complexes that are reproducibly under- or over-expressed in specific breast cancer subtypes. We found that mutation or deletion of one subunit of a complex was often associated with a collateral reduction in protein expression of additional complex members. This collateral loss phenomenon was evident from proteomic, but not transcriptomic, profiles suggesting post-transcriptional control. Mutation of the tumor suppressor E-cadherin (CDH1) was associated with a collateral loss of members of the adherens junction complex, an effect we validated using an engineered model of E-cadherin loss.",

In contrast, here we used patch-clamp electrophysiology in brain slices to show that RQ mice entirely lack tonic inhibition in principal cells of layer II/III somatosensory cortex and ventrobasal thalamus. Additionally, protein quantification and multielectrode electrophysiology show that the mutation interferes with trafficking of GABAA receptor subunits involved in generating tonic currents, leading to increased cortical firing and decreased thalamic bursting rates. Together with previous work, our results suggest that an optimum level of tonic inhibition is required for normal thalamocortical function, such that deviations in either direction away from this optimum enhance susceptibility to absence seizures.",

GDF8 is held in a latent state through interactions with its N-terminal prodomain, much like TGF-{beta} Using a combination of small angle X-ray scattering and mutagenesis, we characterized the interactions of GDF8 with its prodomain.

However, these states are not reversible, indicating the latent GDF8 is  spring-loaded. Structural analysis shows that the prodomain:GDF8 complex adopts an  open configuration, distinct from the latency state of TGF- and more similar to the  open state of Activin A and BMP9 (non-latent complexes). We determined that GDF{beta}8 maintains similar features for latency, including the alpha-1 helix and fastener elements, and identified a series of mutations in the prodomain of GDF8 that alleviate latency, including I56E, which does not require activation by the protease Tolloid. In vivo, active GDF8 variants were potent negative regulators of muscle mass, compared to wild-type GDF8.

    "abstract": "The immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) and T cell beta variable (TRBV) loci are among the most complex and variable regions in the human genome. Generated through a process of gene duplication/deletion and diversification, these loci can vary extensively between individuals in copy number and contain genes that are highly similar, making their analysis technically challenging. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the functional gene segments in the IGHV and TRBV loci, quantifying their copy number and single nucleotide variation in a globally diverse sample of 109 (IGHV) and 286 (TRBV) humans from over a hundred populations. We find that the IGHV and TRBV gene families exhibit starkly different patterns of variation. In particular, with hundreds of copy number haplotypes (instances that have differences in the number of functional gene segments), the IGHV locus has undergone more frequent gene duplication/deletion compared to the TRBV locus, which has only a few copy number haplotypes. In contrast, the TRBV locus has a greater or at least equal propensity to mutate, as evidenced by greater single nucleotide variation, compared to the IGHV locus. Thus, despite common molecular and functional characteristics, the genes that comprise the IGHV and TRBV loci have evolved in strikingly different ways. As well as providing insight into the different evolutionary paths the IGHV and TRBV loci have taken, our results are also important to the adaptive immune repertoire sequencing community, where the lack of frequencies of common alleles and copy number variants is hampering existing analytical pipelines.",

    "abstract": "During lytic Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection, the viral endonu-clease SOX promotes widespread degradation of cytoplasmic messenger RNA (mRNA). However, select mRNAs, including the transcript encoding interleukin-6 (IL-6), escape SOX-induced cleavage. IL-6 escape is mediated through a 3 UTR RNA regulatory element that overrides the SOX targeting mechanism. Here, we reveal that this protective RNA element functions to broadly restrict cleavage by a range of homologous and non-homologous viral endonucleases. However, it does not impede cleavage by cellular endonucleases. The IL-6 protective sequence may be representative of a larger class of nuclease escape elements, as we identified a similar protective element in the GADD45B mRNA. The IL-6 and GADD45B-derived elements display similarities in their sequence, putative structure, and several associated RNA binding proteins. However, the overall composition of their ribonucleoprotein complexes appears distinct, leading to differences in the breadth of nucleases restricted. These findings highlight how RNA elements can selectively control transcript abundance in the background of widespread virus-induced mRNA degradation.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe ability of viruses to control the host gene expression environment is crucial to promote viral infection. Many viruses express factors that reduce host gene expression through widespread mRNA decay. However, some mRNAs escape this fate, like the transcript encoding the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-6 during KSHV infection. IL-6 escape relies on an RNA regulatory element located in its 3UTR and involves the recruitment of a protective protein complex. Here, we show that this escape extends beyond KSHV to a variety of related and unrelated viral endonucleases. However, the IL-6 element does not protect against cellular endonucleases, revealing for the first time a virus-specific nuclease escape element. We identified a related escape element in the GADD45B mRNA, which displays several similarities with the IL-6 element. However, these elements assemble a largely distinct complex of proteins, leading to differences in the breadth of their protective capacity. Collectively, these findings reveal how a putative new class of RNA elements function to control RNA fate in the background of widespread mRNA degradation by viral endonucleases.",

    "abstract": "Mapping the reports of awareness and its neural underpinnings is instrumental to understand the limits of human perception. The capacity to become aware of objects in the world may be studied by suppressing faint target stimuli with strong masking stimuli, or - alternatively - by manipulating the level of wakefulness from full alertness to mild drowsiness. By combining these two approaches, we studied how perceptual awareness is modulated by decreasing wakefulness. We found dynamic changes in behavioural and neural signatures of conscious access in humans between awake and drowsy states. Behaviourally, we show a decrease in the steepness of the psychophysical function for conscious access in drowsy trials. Neural mapping showed delayed processing of target-mask interaction as the consciousness transition progressed, suggesting that the brain resolution of conscious access shifts from early sensory/perceptual to decision-making stages of processing. Once the goal to report the awareness of a target is set, the system behaviourally adapts to rapid changes in wakefulness, revealing the flexibility of the neural signatures of conscious access, and its suppression, to maintain performance.\n\nSignificance statementMaintaining full alertness for long periods of time in attentionally demanding situations is challenging and may lead to a decrease in performance. We show the effect of wakefulness fluctuations on behaviour and brain dynamics that humans use to maintain performance. We reveal the neural strategies we have to cope with drowsiness by shifting the weights to more flexible brain processes and relaxing the precision of the decisions we take.",

This requires urgent intervention.\\n\\nObjectiveTo investigate associations of physical activity with cardiovascular fitness in a cross-sectional retrospective observational study. Data were collected for 21 years from 2530 healthy volunteers and athletes representing the entire spectrum of physical activity from the totally inactive sedentary persons to the highly trained national athletes.\\n\\nMethodsSimple echocardiographic parameters of cardiovascular fitness were analyzed. Cardiac fitness was characterized by reduced resting heart rate, increased relative left ventricular muscular mass, improved left ventricular diastolic function and peak exercise oxygen consumption.\\n\\nResultsWe found that even moderate exercise is associated with improved cardiac fitness.

    "abstract": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), a malformation of the acetabulum, is a frequent cause of early onset osteoarthritis. The disease encompasses a spectrum of severities, some of which are more amenable to treatment. Embryonic immobilisation significantly impairs the development of joint shape however the impact of this malformation to the function and growth of the joint in the short to medium term is unclear. We developed a novel model of developmental joint dysplasia using the zebrafish jaw joint to identify the mechanisms regulating cellular plasticity and ability to recover joint shape and function. Larval zebrafish were immobilised either pharmacologically or using targeted ablation of jaw muscles to induce an altered joint shape. Following restoration of muscle activity we dynamically monitored the joint shape and function in individuals at cellular resolution impossible in other vertebrate species. Reflecting the variability of the human condition we found a proportion of joints will recover both their shape and function, while others will not; despite coming from a genetically homogenous population. This allowed us to study what controls likelihood of recovery; we identified a number of cellular changes that predict likelihood of functional recovery, including position of precursor cells, and specific patterns of proliferation, migration and differentiation in joints and associated connective tissues. These factors together predict recovery better than severity of malformation alone. Using Finite Element Analysis we studied the mechanics of joints representative of ones that recover and those that fail to identify differences in patterns of strain that could explain the cellular behaviours that underpin likelihood of recovery. Thus, this model would enable the study of the short to long term impact of altered joint shape on function and could help to identify the changes that render an individual more receptive to treatment and therefore may potentially be indicative of long term joint health.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy (intra-individual variation) varies among different human tissues and increases with age, suggesting that the majority of mtDNA heteroplasmies are acquired, rather than inherited. However, the extent to which heteroplasmic sites are shared across a tissue remains an open question. We therefore investigated heteroplasmy in two liver samples (one from each primary lobe) from 83 Europeans, sampled at autopsy. Minor allele frequencies (MAF) at heteroplasmic sites were significantly correlated between the two liver samples from an individual, with significantly more sharing of heteroplasmic sites in the control region than in the coding region. We show that this increased sharing for the control region cannot be explained by recent mutations at just a few specific heteroplasmic sites or by the possible presence of 7S DNA. Moreover, we carried out simulations to show that there is significantly more sharing than would be predicted from random genetic drift from a common progenitor cell. We also observe a significant excess of non-synonymous vs. synonymous heteroplasmies in the coding region, but significantly more sharing of synonymous heteroplasmies. These contrasting patterns for the control vs. the coding region, and for non-synonymous vs. synonymous heteroplasmies, suggest that selection plays a role in heteroplasmy sharing.",

Integrating external information such as quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of molecular traits (e.g., expression, methylation) is a powerful approach to identify the subset of GWAS signals explained by regulatory effects. In particular, expression QTLs (eQTLs) help pinpoint the responsible gene among the GWAS regions that harbor many genes, while methylation QTLs (mQTLs) help identify the epigenetic mechanisms that impact gene expression which in turn affect disease risk. In this work we propose multiple-trait-coloc (moloc), a Bayesian statistical framework that integrates GWAS summary data with multiple molecular QTL data to identify regulatory effects at GWAS risk loci.\\n\\nResultsWe applied moloc to schizophrenia (SCZ) and eQTL/mQTL data derived from human brain tissue and identified 52 candidate genes that influence SCZ through methylation. Our method can be applied to any GWAS and relevant functional data to help prioritize disease associated genes.\\n\\nAvailabilitymoloc is available for download as an R package (https://github.com/clagiamba/moloc).

In this study of the upper photosynthetic zone of hypersaline microbial mats of Elkhorn Slough, California (USA), we show how reference-based and reference-free methods can be used to meaningfully assess microbial ecology and genetic partitioning in these complex microbial systems. Mapping of metagenome reads to the dominant Cyanobacteria observed in the system, Coleofasciculus (Microcoleus) chthonoplastes, was used to examine strain variants within these metagenomes. Highly conserved gene subsystems indicate a core genome for the species, and a number of variant genes and subsystems suggest strain level differentiation, especially for carbohydrate utilization. Metagenome sequence coverage binning was used to assess ecosystem partitioning of remaining microbes. Functional gene annotation of these bins (primarily of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria) recapitulated the known biogeochemical functions in microbial mats using a genetic basis, and also revealed evidence of novel functional diversity within the Gemmatimonadetes and Gammaproteobacteria. Combined, these two approaches show how genetic partitioning can inform biogeochemical partitioning of the metabolic diversity within microbial ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Fertility problems affect many couples. Research into male fertility commonly uses mouse models due to their availability and similar spermatogenesis to humans. A common target is the seminiferous tubules, the site of spermatozoa production, typically studied using biopsies and histological analysis. High-field Magnetic Resonance (MR) may offer a non-invasive alternative to investigate testicular function in infertility models. Here, we assess seminiferous tubules structure in sacrificed mice to determine the usefulness of MR compared to histology. Twelve mice (11 aged 35-57 days, one >9 months) were sacrificed and MR imaged at 9.4T with a Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement sequence. Testes were scanned in situ for all mice, and excised in a subset of mice (n=4). A second subset of mice (n=4) had their testes selected for histological analysis. Seminiferous tubule diameter was measured manually from MRI and histology images. Custom image analysis scripts were created for the automated segmentation of seminiferous tubules and calculation of tissue volumes. All ex vivo and in situ images of testes exhibited clear outlines of seminiferous tubules. Ratio of total testis volume to volume of seminiferous tubules did not differ significantly between ex vivo and in situ measurements, and were similar in mature and younger mice. Both total testis volume and seminiferous tubule volume were larger in the mature animal. While histological slices trended towards larger average seminiferous tubules diameter than MRI images, we found no significant differences between MRI and histological measurements. High-field MRI can be used in a mouse model to assess testicular structure in situ. All volumetric measurements compared favourably with histological data. In situ scans also clearly showed identifiable extra-testicular tissues, such as epididymis and prostate tissues. The potential to image tissues associated with sperm maturation as well as spermatogenesis emphasises how MR could be a useful technique in mouse models of fertility, however further work is required to optimize tissue segmentation and validate this method for use in longitudinal studies. This type of measurement could be extended to human fertility studies in the future.",

However, a comprehensive view of the signals and cell types contributing to mDA neurogenesis is not yet available. By analyzing the transcriptome of the mouse ventral midbrain at a tissue and single-cell level during mDA neurogenesis we found that three recently identified radial glia types 1-3 (Rgl1-3) contribute to different key aspects of mDA neurogenesis. While Rgl3 expressed most extracellular matrix components and multiple ligands for various pathways controlling mDA neuron development, such as Wnt and Shh, Rgl1-2 expressed most receptors. Moreover, we found that specific transcription factor networks explain the transcriptome and suggest a function for each individual radial glia. A network controlling neurogenesis was found in Rgl1, progenitor maintenance in Rgl2 and the secretion of factors forming the mDA niche by Rgl3. Our results thus uncover a broad repertoire of developmental signals expressed by each midbrain cell type during mDA neurogenesis. Cells identified for their emerging importance are Rgl3, a niche cell type, and Rgl1, a neurogenic progenitor that expresses ARNTL, a transcription factor that we find is required for mDA neurogenesis.",

    "abstract": "We analyse two comprehensive transcriptome datasets from human tissues and human-derived cell lines in terms of the expression profiles of the SLC and ABC families of membrane transporters. The Gini index (coefficient) characterises inequalities of distributions, and is used in a novel way to describe the distribution of the expression of each transporter among the different tissues and cell lines. In many cases, transporters exhibit extremely high Gini coefficients, even when their supposed substrates might be expected to be available to all tissues, indicating a much higher degree of specialisation than is usually assumed. This is consistent with divergent evolution from a more restricted set of ancestors. Similar trends hold true for the expression profiles of transporters in different cell lines, suggesting that cell lines exhibit largely similar transport behaviour to that of tissues. By contrast, the Gini coefficients for ABC transporters tend to be larger in cell lines than in tissues, implying that some kind of a selection process has taken place. In particular, with some exceptions such as olfactory receptors and genes involved in keratin production, transporter genes are significantly more heterogeneously expressed than are most non-transporter genes. The Gini index also allows us to determine those transcripts with the most stable expression; these often differ significantly from the  housekeeping genes commonly used for normalisation in transcriptomics and qPCR studies. The lowest four in tissues are FAM32A, ABCB7, MRPL21 and PCBP1, while the lowest three in cell lines are SF3B2, NXF1 and RBM45. PCBP1 is both reasonably highly expressed and has a low Gini coefficient in both tissues and cell lines, and is an excellent novel housekeeping gene. Overall, our analyses provide novel opportunities for the normalisation of genome-wide expression profiling data.",

Gene-specific methods can be used to screen the presence of GMOs.

The specificity, the limit of detection, the efficiency, and the ability to quantify the GMO content were tested in GM cotton, soybean, and canola events. The results demonstrated that the primers can specifically detect cp4-epsps GM crops. The limit of detection was found to be 0.4 ng /l DNA per PCR reaction with the ability to detect 1-16 copies of the haploid genome of each GM event. The efficiency of this screening method (which was 94-110 % with an R2 higher than 0.96) indicated that these new primers can be applied to the screening of GM samples that contain the cp4-epsps gene. Also, the gene-specific real-time PCR screening method could be successfully developed for qualification of different types of GM cotton, soybean and canola events with the construction of a serial dilution ranging from 10 % to 1 %.",

However, it is widely acknowledged that the effects of focal cortical stimulation on behaviour can vary substantially between participants and even from trial to trial within individuals. Here we asked whether spontaneous fluctuations in alertness can account for the variability in behavioural and neurophysiological responses to TMS. We combined single-pulse TMS with neural recording via electroencephalography (EEG) to quantify changes in motor and cortical reactivity with fluctuating levels of alertness defined objectively on the basis of ongoing brain activity. We observed rapid, non-linear changes in TMS-evoked neural responses - specifically, motor evoked potentials and TMS-evoked cortical potentials - as EEG activity indicated decreasing levels of alertness, even while participants remained awake and responsive in the behavioural task.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTA substantial proportion of inter-trial variability in neurophysiological responses to TMS is due to spontaneous fluctuations in alertness, which should be controlled for during experimental and clinical applications of TMS.",

    "abstract": "Timing is critical for myriad behaviors in dynamic environments. For example, to intercept an object, the brain must compute a reliable estimate of time-to-contact (TTC). Prior work suggests that humans compute TTC using kinematic information such as distance and speed without explicitly relying on temporal cues, just as one would do in a physics classroom using kinematic equations. Considering the inherent uncertainty associated with estimates of speed and distance and the ability of human brain to combine different sources of information, we asked whether humans additionally rely on temporal cues. We found that humans actively integrate speed information with both explicit and implicit timing cues. Analysis of behavior in relation to a Bayesian model revealed that the additional temporal information helps subjects optimize their performance in the presence of measurement uncertainty. These findings suggest that brains timing mechanisms are actively engaged while interacting with dynamic stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Several recent longitudinal studies have investigated the hormonal correlates of both young adult womens general sexual desire and, more specifically, their desire for uncommitted sexual relationships. Findings across these studies have been mixed, potentially because each study tested only small samples of women (Ns = 43, 33, and 14). Here we report results from a much larger (N = 375) longitudinal study of hormonal correlates of young adult womens general sexual desire and their desire for uncommitted sexual relationships. Our analyses suggest that within-woman changes in general sexual desire are negatively related to progesterone, but are not related to testosterone or cortisol. We observed some positive relationships for estradiol, but these were generally only significant for solitary sexual desire. By contrast with our results for general sexual desire, analyses showed no evidence that changes in womens desire for uncommitted sexual relationships are related to their hormonal status. Together, these results suggest that changes in hormonal status contribute to changes in womens general sexual desire, but do not influence womens desire for uncommitted sexual relationships.",

How ZA assembly is regulated during epithelial cell morphogenesis is not fully understood. We show that during ZA morphogenesis, the function of the small GTPase Rap1 and the F-actin binding protein AF6/Cno are both linked to that of the P21-activated kinase Pak4/Mbt. We find that Rap1 and Mbt regulate each others localization at the ZA and cooperate in promoting ECadherin stabilization. During this process Cno regulates the recruitment of Baz at the ZA, a process that is also regulated by Arm phosphorylation by Mbt. Altogether, we propose that Rap1, Cno and Mbt regulate ZA morphogenesis by coordinating ECadherin stabilization and Baz recruitment and retention. In addition, our work uncovers a new link between two main oncogenes, Rap1 and Pak4/Mbt, in a model developing epithelial cell.",

    "abstract": "Differentiation induces reorganization of microtubules (MTs) into non-centrosomal arrays in a variety of tissues. The physiological functions of these microtubule arrays are just beginning to be understood as few tools currently exist to genetically perturb microtubule organization in vivo, particularly in mammals. We developed a genetic toolkit that can be broadly applied to the study of microtubule dynamics and function in many cell types. Using a TRE-EB1-GFP mouse we demonstrate that distinct differentiation transitions in the epidermis cause a decrease in microtubule growth rates and microtubule growth lifetimes, resulting in strong suppression of dynamics. To understand the physiological functions of these stable, non-centrosomal microtubules, we generated a TRE-spastin mouse, which can be used to perturb microtubule organization in a wide-variety of tissues in vivo. Unexpectedly, microtubule perturbation exclusively in post-mitotic keratinocytes had profound consequences on epidermal morphogenesis. We uncoupled novel cell-autonomous roles for MTs in differentiation-driven cell flattening from non-cell autonomous functions in regulating proliferation, differentiation, and tissue architecture. Taken together, we have created tools that will be broadly useful for the study of microtubule dynamics and function in mammalian tissue physiology and have used them to uncover previously unknown functions for non-centrosomal microtubules during mammalian epidermal development.",

    "abstract": "Assessing diet variability is of main importance to better understand the biology of bats and design conservation strategies. Although the advent of metabarcoding has facilitated such analyses, this approach does not come without challenges. Biases may occur throughout the whole experiment, from fieldwork to biostatistics, resulting in the detection of false negatives, false positives or low taxonomic resolution. We detail a rigorous metabarcoding approach based on a short COI minibarcode and two-step PCR protocol enabling the  all at once taxonomic identification of bats and their arthropod preys for several hundreds of samples. Our study includes faecal pellets collected in France from 357 bats representing 16 species, as well as insect mock communities that mimic bat meals of known composition, negative and positive controls. All samples were analysed using three replicates. We compare the efficiency of DNA extraction methods and we evaluate the effectiveness of our protocol using identification success, taxonomic resolution, sensitivity, and amplification biases. Our parallel identification strategy of predators and preys reduces the risk of mis-assigning preys to wrong predators and decreases the number of molecular steps. Controls and replicates enable to filter the data and limit the risk of false positives, hence guaranteeing high confidence results for both prey occurrence and bat species identification. We validate 551 COI variants from arthropod including 18 orders, 117 family, 282 genus and 290 species. Our method therefore provides a rapid, resolutive and cost-effective screening tool for addressing evolutionary ecological issues or developing  chirosurveillance and conservation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Food availability and quality are both critical for growing young animals. In nature, swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and other aerial insectivores feed on both aquatic insects, which are rich in omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) and terrestrial insects, which contain considerably less LCPUFA. Carnivorous mammals and fishes must obtain LCPUFA from diet, as they have lost the capacity to convert the precursor omega-3 ALA into LCPUFA. Thus, the relative value of aquatic versus terrestrial insects depends not only on the fatty acid composition of the prey, but also upon the capacity of consumers to convert ALA into LCPUFA. We used a combination of stable-isotope-labeled fatty acid tracers to ask if, and how efficiently, Tree Swallows can deposit newly synthesized LCPUFA into tissue. Our data show for the first time that Tree Swallows can convert ALA into LCPUFA deposited in liver and skeletal muscle. However, high Tree Swallow demand for LCPUFA combined with low ALA availability in natural terrestrial foods may strain their modest conversion ability. This suggests that while Tree Swallows can synthesize LCPUFA de novo, LCPUFA are ecologically essential nutrients in natural systems. Our findings thus provide mechanistic support for our previous findings and the importance of LCPUFA-rich aquatic insects for Tree Swallows and most likely other aerial insectivores with similar niches.\\n\\nSummary StatementA stable-isotope-labeled tracer reveals the mechanism for omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) limitation in a wild avian insectivore, showing that LCPUFA are an ecologically essential nutrient.",

    "abstract": "The freshwater cnidarian polyp named Hydra, which can be mass-cultured in the laboratory, is characterized by a highly dynamic homeostasis with a continuous self-renewal of its three adult stem cell populations, the epithelial stem cells from the epidermis, the epithelial stem cells from the gastrodermis, and the multipotent interstitial stem cells, which provide cells of the nervous system, gland cells and germ cells. Two unusual features characterize these stem cells that cannot replace each other, they all avoid G1 to pause in G2, and the two epithelial populations are concomitantly multifunctional and stem cells. H. vulgaris that does not show any signs of aging over the years, resists to weeks of starvation and adapts to the loss of neurogenesis, providing a unique model system to study the resistance to aging. By contrast some strains of a distinct species named H. oligactis undergo a rapid aging process when undergoing gametogenesis or when placed in stress conditions. The aging phenotype is characterized by the rapid loss of somatic interstitial stem cells, the progressive reduction in epithelial stem cell self-renewal, the loss of regeneration, the disorganization of the neuro-muscular system, the loss of the feeding behavior, and the death of all animals within about three months. We review here the possible mechanisms that help H. vulgaris to sustain stem cell self-renewal and thus bypass aging processes. For this, FoxO seems to act as a pleiotropic actor, regulating stem cell proliferation, stress response and apoptosis. In H. oligactis, the regulation of the autophagy flux differs between aging-sensitive and aging-resistant animals, pointing to a key role for proteostasis in the maintenance of a large pool of active and plastic epithelial stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Legionellaceae are intracellular bacteria known as important pathogens of man. In the environment, they are mainly found in biofilms associated with amoebas. In contrast to another gammaproteobacterial family Enterobacteriaceae which established a broad spectrum of symbioses with many insect taxa, the only instance of legionella-like symbiont has been reported from lice of the genus Polyplax. Here, we sequenced the complete genome of this symbiont and compared its main characteristics to other Legionella species and insect symbionts. Based on rigorous multigene phylogenetic analyses, we confirm this bacterium as a member of the genus Legionella and propose the name Candidatus Legionella polyplacis, sp.n. We show that the genome of Ca. Legionella polyplacis underwent massive degeneration, including considerable size reduction (529.746 bp, 484 protein coding genes) and a severe decrease in GC content (23%). We identify several possible constraints underlying the evolution of this bacterium. On one hand, Ca. Legionella polyplacis and the louse symbionts Riesia and Puchtella experienced convergent evolution, perhaps due to adaptation to similar hosts. On the other hand, some metabolic differences are likely to reflect different phylogenetic positions of the symbionts and hence availability of particular metabolic function in the ancestor. This is exemplified by different arrangements of thiamine metabolism in Ca. Legionella polyplacis and Riesia. Finally, horizontal gene transfer is shown to play a significant role in the adaptive and diversification process. Particularly, we show that Ca. L. polyplacis horizontally acquired a complete biotin operon (bioADCHFB) that likely assisted this bacterium when becoming an obligate mutualist.",

    "abstract": "Crescent-shaped red blood cells, the hallmark of sickle cell disease, present a striking departure from the biconcave disc shape normally found in mammals. Characterized by increased mechanical fragility, sickled cells promote haemolytic anaemia and vaso-occlusions and contribute directly to disease in humans. Remarkably, a similar sickle-shaped morphology has been observed in erythrocytes from several deer species, without pathological consequences. The genetic basis of erythrocyte sickling in deer, however, remains unknown, limiting the utility of deer as comparative models for sickling. Here, we determine the sequences of human {beta}-globin orthologs in 15 deer species and identify a set of co-evolving, structurally related residues that distinguish sickling from non-sickling deer. Protein structural modelling indicates a sickling mechanism distinct from human sickle cell disease, coordinated by a derived valine (E22V) in the second alpha helix of the {beta}-globin protein. The evolutionary history of deer {beta}-globins is characterized by incomplete lineage sorting, episodes of gene conversion between adult and foetal {beta}-globin paralogs, and the presence of a trans-species polymorphism that is best explained by long-term balancing selection, suggesting that sickling in deer is adaptive. Our results reveal structural and evolutionary parallels and differences in erythrocyte sickling between human and deer, with implications for understanding the ecological regimes and molecular architectures that favour the evolution of this dramatic change in erythrocyte shape.",

    "abstract": "In natural populations, individuals of a given genotype may belong to different classes. Such classes can for instance represent different age groups, developmental stages, or habitats. Class structure has important evolutionary consequences because the fitness of individuals with the same genetic background may vary depending on their class. As a result, demographic transitions between classes can cause fluctuations that need to be removed when estimating selection on a trait. Intrinsic differences between classes are classically taken into account by weighting individuals by class-specific reproductive values, defined as the relative contribution of individuals in a given class to the future of the population. These reproductive values are generally constant weights calculated from a constant projection matrix. Here, I show, for large populations and clonal reproduction, that reproductive values can be defined as time-dependent weights satisfying dynamical demographic equations that only depend on the average between-class transition rates over all genotypes. Using these time-dependent demographic reproductive values yields a simple Price equation where the non-selective effects of between-class transitions are removed from the dynamics of the trait. This generalises previous theory to a large class of ecological scenarios, taking into account densitydependence, ecological feedbacks and arbitrary distributions of the trait. I discuss the role of reproductive values for prospective and retrospective analyses of the dynamics of phenotypic traits.\\n\\nNote on this versionCompared to the previous version of the manuscript, some changes have been made to improve the readability and structure of the text, and to clarify the connections with the existing literature. One reviewer pointed out inconsistencies in some of the numerical simulations, and in the mutation term in appendix A2, which have now been fixed. When checking the calculations, I have also identified a missing term in the equation for the dynamics of individual reproductive values. The new equation makes much more sense. Additional results are also presented, in particular for discrete-time models and populations with a continuous age structure, for which Fishers original definition of reproductive value can be recovered.",

    "abstract": "In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, synthesis of isoprenoids from glycolytic intermediates is essential for survival. The antimalarial fosmidomycin (FSM) inhibits isoprenoid synthesis. In P. falciparum, we identify a loss-of-function mutation in HAD2 (PF3D7_1226300) as necessary for FSM resistance. Enzymatic characterization reveals that HAD2, a member of the haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase (HAD) superfamily, is a phosphatase. Harnessing a growth defect in resistant parasites, we select for suppression of HAD2-mediated FSM resistance and uncover hypomorphic suppressor mutations in the locus encoding the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK9). Metabolic profiling demonstrates that FSM resistance is achieved via increased steady-state levels of MEP pathway and glycolytic intermediates and confirms reduced PFK9 function in the suppressed strains. We identify HAD2 as a novel regulator of malaria parasite metabolism and drug sensitivity and uncover PFK9 as a novel site of genetic metabolic plasticity in the parasite. Our study informs the biological functions of an evolutionarily conserved family of metabolic regulators and reveals a previously undescribed strategy by which malaria parasites adapt to cellular metabolic dysregulation.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEUnique and essential aspects of parasite metabolism are excellent targets for development of new antimalarials. An improved understanding of parasite metabolism and drug resistance mechanisms are urgently needed. The antibiotic fosmidomycin targets the synthesis of essential isoprenoid compounds from glucose and is a candidate for antimalarial development. Our study identifies a novel mechanism of drug resistance and further describes a family of metabolic regulators in the parasite. Using a novel forward genetic approach, we also uncover mutations that suppress drug resistance in the glycolytic enzyme PFK9. Thus, we identify an unexpected genetic mechanism of adaptation to metabolic insult that influences parasite fitness and tolerance to antimalarials.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are a widely distributed, diverse group of photosynthetic bacteria that exhibit phototaxis, or motion in response to light. Cyanobacteria such as Synechocystis sp. secrete a mixture of complex polysaccharides that facilitate cell motion, while their type 4 pili allow them to physically attach to each other. Even though cells can respond individually to light, colonies of such bacteria are observed to move collectively towards the light source in dense finger-like projections. Agent-based models are especially useful in connecting individual cell behaviour with the emergent collective phenomena that arise out of their interactions. We present an agent-based model for cyanobacterial phototaxis that accounts for slime deposition as well as for direct physical links between bacteria, mediated through their type 4 pili. We reproduce the experimentally observed aggregation of cells at the colony boundary as a precursor to finger formation. Our model also describes the changes in colony morphology that occur when the location of the light source is abruptly changed. We find that the overall motion of cells toward light remains relatively unimpaired even if a fraction of them do not sense light, allowing heterogeneous populations to continue to mount a robust collective response to stimuli. Our work suggests that in addition to bio-chemical signalling via diffusible molecules in the context of bacterial quorum-sensing, short-ranged physical interactions may also contribute to collective effects in bacterial motility.",

    "abstract": "Social interactions are crucial to the survival and well-being of all mammals, including humans. Although the prelimbic cortex (PL, part of medial prefrontal cortex) has been implicated in social behavior, it is not clear which neurons are relevant, nor how they contribute. We found that the PL contains anatomically and molecularly distinct subpopulations of neurons that target 3 downstream regions that have been implicated in social behavior: the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the amygdala, and the ventral tegmental area. Activation of NAc-projecting PL neurons (PL-NAc), but not the other subpopulations, decreased preference for a social target, suggesting an unique contribution of this population to social behavior. To determine what information PL-NAc neurons convey, we recorded selectively from them, and found that individual neurons were active during social investigation, but only in specific spatial locations. Spatially-specific inhibition of these neurons prevented the formation of a social-spatial association at the inhibited location. In contrast, spatially nonspecific inhibition did not affect social behavior. Thus, the unexpected combination of social and spatial information within the PL-NAc population appears to support socially motivated behavior by enabling the formation of social-spatial associations.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a debilitating chronic condition, which requires complex and expensive disease management. Exercise has now been recognised as a critical factor in improving health and quality of life in patients with CF. Hence, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is used to determine aerobic fitness of young patients as part of the clinical management of CF. However, at present there is a lack of conclusive evidence for one limiting system of aerobic fitness for CF patients at an individual patient level.\\n\\nHere, we perform detailed data analysis that allows us to identify important systems-level factors that affect aerobic fitness. We use patients data and principal component analysis to confirm the dependence of CPET performance on variables associated with ventilation and metabolic rates of oxygen consumption. We find that the time at which participants cross the anaerobic threshold (AT) is well correlated with their overall performance. Furthermore, we propose a predictive modelling framework that captures the relationship between ventilatory dynamics, lung capacity and function and performance in CPET within a group of children and adolescents with CF. Specifically, we show that using Gaussian processes (GP) we can predict AT at the individual patient level with reasonable accuracy given the small sample size of the available group of patients. We conclude by presenting future perspectives for improving and extending the proposed framework.\\n\\nOur modelling and analysis have the potential to pave the way to designing personalised exercise programmes that are tailored to specific individual needs relative to patients treatment therapies.",

    "abstract": "Organisms are expected to invest less in reproduction in response to a stressor, but theory predicts that this effect should depend on the frequency of stressors in the environment. Here we investigated how an acute stressor affected gonadal function in a songbird, and how long-term differences in the stress environment influenced these acute stress responses. We exposed male Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis) either to chronic or minimal (control) disturbance during gonadal recrudescence, after which we measured baseline testosterone, testosterone after an acute handling stressor, and the ability to elevate testosterone in response to hormonal stimulation. In a 2x2 design, we then euthanized males from the two chronic treatment groups either immediately or after an acute stressor to investigate the effect of these treatments on the gonadal transcriptome. We found that chronically disturbed birds had marginally lower testosterone. The acute stressor suppressed testosterone in control birds, but not in the chronic disturbance group. The ability to elevate testosterone did not differ between the chronic treatments. Surprisingly, chronic disturbance had a weak effect on the testicular transcriptome, and did not affect transcriptomic response to the acute stressor. The acute stressor, on the other hand, upregulated cellular stress response, and affected expression of genes associated with hormonal stress-response. Overall, we show that both chronic and acute stressors affect reproductive function, and that chronic stress changes how acute stressors affect testosterone physiology. Our findings also suggest that acute and chronic stressors affect testes differently, and that gonadal function is relatively robust to long-term stressors.\\n\\nSummary statementAn acute stressor downregulated testosterone production, but this effect was absent in chronically disturbed birds. The acute stressor had a strong effect on the gonadal transcriptome, whereas chronic disturbance had a negligible effect.",

Unfortunately, few existing methods are able to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within metagenomic data, and to the best of our knowledge, no methods exist to detect SNPs within AMR genes within the resistome. The ability to identify SNPs in AMR genes across the resistome would represent a significant advance in understanding the dissemination and evolution of AMR, as SNP identification would enable \\\"fingerprinting\\\" of the resistome, which could then be used to track AMR dynamics across various settings and/or time periods.\\n\\nResultsWe present LueVari, a reference-free SNP caller based on the read colored de Bruijn graph, an extension of the traditional de Bruijn graph that allows repeated regions longer than the k-mer length and shorter than the read length to be identified unambiguously.

Furthermore, we show LueVari constructs sequences containing the variation which span 93% of the gene in datasets with lower coverage (15X), and 100% of the gene in datasets with higher coverage (30X).\\n\\nAvailabilityCode and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/baharpan/cosmo/tree/LueVari.",

The ability to precisely localize a messenger RNA can reveal key information about its regulation. Although smFISH is well established in cell culture or thin sections, methods for its accurate application to tissues are lacking. The utility of smFISH in thick tissue sections must overcome several challenges, including probe penetration of fixed tissue, accessibility of target mRNAs for probe hybridization, high fluorescent background, spherical aberration along the optical axis, and image segmentation of organelles. Here we describe how we overcame these obstacles to study mRNA localization in Drosophila larval muscle samples that approach 50 m thickness. We use sample-specific optimization of smFISH, particle identification based on maximum likelihood testing, and 3-dimensional multiple-organelle segmentation. The latter allows using independent thresholds for different regions of interest within an image stack. Our approach therefore facilitates accurate measurement of mRNA location in thick tissues.",

Males often contain substantially more heterochromatic DNA than females, due to the presence of a large, repeat-rich Y chromosome, and male flies generally have shorter average life spans than females. Here we show that repetitive DNA becomes de-repressed more rapidly in old male flies relative to females, and repeats on the Y chromosome are disproportionally mis-expressed during aging. This is associated with a loss of heterochromatin at repetitive elements during aging in male flies, and a general loss of repressive chromatin in aged males away from pericentromeric regions and the Y. By generating flies with different sex chromosome karyotypes (XXY females; X0 and XYY males), we show that repeat de-repression and average lifespan is directly correlated with the number of Y chromosomes. Thus, sex-specific chromatin differences contribute to sex-specific aging in flies.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila Y-chromosome is gene poor and mainly consists of silenced, repetitive DNA. Nonetheless, the Y influences expression of hundreds of genes genome-wide, possibly by sequestering key components of the heterochromatin machinery away from other positions in the genome. To test the influence of the Y chromosome on the genome-wide chromatin landscape, we assayed the genomic distribution of histone modifications associated with gene activation (H3K4me3), or heterochromatin (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) in fruit flies with varying sex chromosome complements (X0, XY and XYY males; XX and XXY females). Consistent with the general deficiency of active chromatin modifications on the Y, we find that Y gene dose has little influence on the genomic distribution of H3K4me3. In contrast, both the presence and the number of Y-chromosomes strongly influence genome-wide enrichment patterns of repressive chromatin modifications. Highly repetitive regions such as the pericentromeres, the dot, and the Y chromosome (if present) are enriched for heterochromatic modifications in wildtype males and females, and even more strongly in X0 flies. In contrast, the additional Y chromosome in XYY males and XXY females diminishes the heterochromatic signal in these normally silenced, repeat-rich regions, which is accompanied by an increase in expression of Y-linked repeats. We find hundreds of genes that are expressed differentially between individuals with aberrant sex chromosome karyotypes, many of which also show sex-biased expression in wildtype Drosophila. Thus, Y-chromosomes influence heterochromatin integrity genome-wide, and differences in the chromatin landscape of males and females may also contribute to sex-biased gene expression and sexual dimorphisms.",

We demonstrate that these functional boundaries serve as a functional fingerprint of the individual animals, and can be achieved under anesthesia or awake conditions (rest, naturalistic viewing), though differences between awake and anesthetized states precluded the detection of individual differences across states. Comparison of awake and anesthetized states suggested a more nuanced picture of changes in connectivity for higher order association areas, as well as visual and motor cortex. These results establish feasibility and data requirements for the generation of reproducible individual-specific parcellations in NHP, as well as provide insights into the impact of scan state and motivate efforts toward harmonizing protocols.",

Surprisingly, this analysis revealed thousands of previously unreported degeneracies that reduced the number of unique analytes to ~2,961.

    "abstract": "The shape of most animal cells is controlled by the actin cortex, a thin, isotropic network of dynamic actin filaments (F-actin) situated just beneath the plasma membrane. The cortex is held far from equilibrium by both active stresses and turnover: Myosin-II molecular motors drive deformations required for cell division, migration, and tissue morphogenesis, while turnover of the molecular components of the actin cortex relax stress and facilitate network reorganization. While many aspects of F-actin network viscoelasticity are well-characterized in the presence and absence of motor activity, a mechanistic understanding of how non-equilibrium actin turnover contributes to stress relaxation is still lacking. To address this, we developed a reconstituted in vitro system wherein the steady-state length and turnover rate of F-actin in entangled solutions are controlled by the actin regulatory proteins cofilin, profilin, and formin, which sever, recycle, and nucleate filaments, respectively. Cofilin-mediated severing accelerates the turnover and spatial reorganization of F-actin, without significant changes to filament length. Microrheology measurements demonstrate that cofilin-mediated severing is a single-timescale mode of stress relaxation that tunes the low-frequency viscosity over two orders of magnitude. These findings serve as the foundation for understanding the mechanics of more physiological F-actin networks with turnover, and inform an updated microscopic model of single-filament turnover. They also demonstrate that polymer activity, in the form of ATP hydrolysis on F-actin coupled to nucleotide-dependent cofilin binding, is sufficient to generate a form of active matter wherein asymmetric filament disassembly preserves filament number in spite of sustained severing.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWhen an animal cell moves or divides, a disordered network of actin filaments (F-actin) plays a central role in controlling the resulting changes in cell shape. While it is known that continual turnover of F-actin by cofilin-mediated severing aids in reorganization of the cellular cytoskeleton, it is unclear how the turnover of structural elements alters the mechanical properties of the network. Here we show that severing of F-actin by cofilin results in a stress relaxation mechanism in entangled solutions characterized by a single-timescale set by the severing rate. Additionally, we identify ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide-dependent cofilin binding as sufficient ingredients to generate a non-equilibrium steady-state in which asymmetric F-actin disassembly preserves filament number in spite of sustained severing.",

These complexes can be sterically stabilized via PEGylation [PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)] into nanoparticles (NPs) and targeted to specific tissues and cell types via the conjugation of an affinity ligand. However, there are currently no guidelines on how to effectively navigate the large space of compositional parameters that modulate the specific and nonspecific binding interactions of peptide-targeted NPs with cells. Such guidelines are desirable to accelerate the optimization of formulations with novel peptides. Using PEG-lipids functionalized with a library of prototypical tumor-homing peptides, we varied the peptide density and other parameters (binding motif, peptide charge, CL/DNA charge ratio) to study their effect on the binding and uptake of the corresponding NPs. We used flow cytometry to quantitatively assess binding as well as internalization of NPs by cultured cancer cells. Surprisingly, full peptide coverage resulted in less binding and internalization than intermediate coverage, with the optimum coverage varying between cell lines. In, addition, our data revealed that great care must be taken to prevent nonspecific electrostatic interactions from interfering with the desired specific binding and internalization. Importantly, such considerations must take into account the charge of the peptide ligand as well as the membrane charge density and the CL/DNA charge ratio. To test our guidelines, we evaluated the in vivo tumor selectivity of selected NP formulations in a mouse model of peritoneally disseminated human gastric cancer. Intraperitoneally administered peptide-tagged CL-DNA NPs showed tumor binding, minimal accumulation in healthy control tissues, and preferential penetration of smaller tumor nodules, a highly clinically relevant target known to drive recurrence of the peritoneal cancer.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

The transcription machinery has the potential to aggravate such conflicts by generating co-transcriptional R-loops as an additional barrier to replication fork progression. Here, we investigate the influence of conflict orientation and R-loop formation on genome stability in human cells using a defined episomal system. This approach reveals that head-on (HO) and co-directional (CD) conflicts induce distinct DNA damage responses. Unexpectedly, the replisome acts as an orientation-dependent regulator of R-loop levels, reducing R-loops in the CD orientation but promoting their formation in the HO orientation. Replication stress and deregulated origin firing increase the number of HO collisions leading to genome-destabilizing R-loops. Our findings not only uncover an intrinsic function of the replisome in R-loop homeostasis, but also suggest a mechanistic basis for genome instability associated with deregulated DNA replication, which is observed in many disease states, including cancer.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological process involved in normal tissue morphogenesis and also in disease pathology. It causes dramatic alterations in cell morphology, migration, proliferation, and phenotype. We captured the global transcriptional and epigenetic programs elicited when polarized, cobblestone human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were stimulated to undergo EMT, a process associated with several retinal pathologies. The reorganization of chromatin landscapes occurred preferentially at distal enhancers, rather than promoter regions, accompanied by 3136 significantly changing genes. Of the 95 significantly changing transcription factors, FOXS1 was most upregulated. Loss and gain of function experiments demonstrated that FOXS1 is upstream of canonical EMT regulators, and can stimulate EMT in RPE and other epithelia. Inhibition of p38, stimulated by combined action of the EMT-inducing factors, TGF{beta}1 and TNF, dampened FOXS1 expression. An increase of FOXS1 in several cancers indicates it has a role in several EMT-involved pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Thermal breadth, the range of body temperatures over which organisms perform well, and thermal acclimation, the ability to alter optimal performance temperature and critical thermal maximum or minimum with changing temperatures, reflect the capacity of organisms to respond to temperature variability and are thus crucial traits for coping with climate change. Although there are theoretical frameworks for predicting thermal breadths and acclimation, the predictions of these models have not been tested across taxa, latitudes, body sizes, traits, habitats, and methodological factors. Here, we address this knowledge gap using simulation modeling and empirical analyses of >2,000 acclimation strengths from >500 species using four datasets of ectotherms. After accounting for important statistical interactions, covariates, and experimental artifacts, we reveal that i) acclimation rate scales positively with body size contributing to a negative association between body size and thermal breadth across species and ii) acclimation capacity increases with body size, seasonality, and latitude (to mid-latitudinal regions) and is regularly underestimated for most organisms. Contrary to suggestions that plasticity theory and empirical work on thermal acclimation are incongruent, these findings are consistent with theory on phenotypic plasticity. We further validated our framework by demonstrating that it could predict global extinction risk to amphibian biodiversity from climate change.",

    "abstract": "There are many examples where the use of chemicals have had profound unintended consequences, such as fertilizers reducing crop yields (paradox of enrichment) and insecticides increasing insect pests (by reducing natural biocontrol). Recently, the application of agrochemicals, such as agricultural disinfectants and fungicides, has been explored as an approach to curb the pathogenic fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which is associated with worldwide amphibian declines. However, the long-term, net effects of early-life exposure to these chemicals on amphibian disease risk have not been thoroughly investigated. Using a combination of laboratory experiments and analysis of data from the literature, we explored the effects of fungicide exposure on Bd infections in two frog species. Extremely low concentrations of the fungicides azoxystrobin, chlorothalonil, and mancozeb were directly toxic to Bd in culture. However, estimated environmental concentrations of the fungicides did not reduce Bd on Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) tadpoles exposed simultaneously to any of these fungicides and Bd, and fungicide exposure actually increased Bd-induced mortality. Additionally, exposure to any of these fungicides as tadpoles resulted in higher Bd abundance and greater Bd-induced mortality when challenged with Bd post-metamorphosis, an average of 71 days after their last fungicide exposure. Analysis of data from the literature revealed that previous exposure to the fungicide itraconazole, which is commonly used to clear Bd infections, made the critically endangered booroolong frog (Litoria booroolongensis) more susceptible to Bd. Finally, a field survey revealed that Bd prevalence was positively associated with concentrations of fungicides in ponds. Although fungicides show promise for controlling Bd, these results suggest that, if fungicides do not completely eliminate Bd or if Bd re-colonizes, exposure to fungicides has the potential to do more harm than good. To ensure that fungicide applications have the intended consequence of curbing amphibian declines, researchers must identify which fungicides do not compromise the pathogen resistance mechanisms of amphibians.",

If this assertion was correct, one could expect individuals of the same species living under distinct environmental conditions to be genetically similar, but having different GDM levels and being phenotypically divergent. We tested this presumption by studying the relationship between variability of functional morphological traits and GDM levels in American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus), in green houses located in two geographical sites. Our analyses revealed that body linear morphometry, skull geometry, scaled mass index, packed cell volume and neutrophil counts differed significantly among males and females within and between localities. GDM, nonetheless, was rather similar among sex and locality groups. These results show that levels of GDM, at least under our experimental contexts, does not correlate with functional morphological trait variability.",

    "abstract": "Systemic RNA interference (RNAi) in C. elegans is dependent on sid-1 (WO_SCPLOWINSTONC_SCPLOW et al. 2002), sid-3 (JO_SCPLOWOSEC_SCPLOW et al. 2012) and sid-5 (HO_SCPLOWINASC_SCPLOW et al. 2012). After injection, expression, or ingestion, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is transported between cells throughout the animal to enable RNAi in most tissues, including the germline and progeny. Here, we characterize the role of the Sid genes in transport of dsRNA to progeny. We previously reported that dsRNA injected directly in the germline unexpectedly requires sid-1 activity in the progeny to initiate RNAi (WO_SCPLOWINSTONC_SCPLOW et al. 2002). We now show that germline injected dsRNA can travel by three independent pathways to silence gene expression in embryos. First, germline injected dsRNA is delivered, presumably by bulk flow, into oocytes and embryos. This means of delivery, which does not require sid-1, is limited by the amount and location of injected dsRNA. Second, maternal sid-1 transports extracellular dsRNA into the germline where it can silence maternal deposited mRNAs and segregate to embryos to silence embryonically expressed mRNAs. Third, extracellular dsRNA is also endocytosed into oocytes by the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor superfamily homolog RME-2. The endocytosed dsRNA then requires sid-1 and sid-5 in embryos to silence embryonically expressed genes. Extracellular fluorescent dsRNA, once endocytosed into oocytes, does not co-localize with VIT2::GFP and it does not require sid-1 activity to segregate from the late endocytosis marker GFP::RAB-7 in early embryos. In conclusion, we identify genes and pathways that function redundantly for intergenerational RNA transfer that may represent mechanisms for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.",

We show that temperature modulates Cpf1 activity by controlling its ability to access genomic DNA. This effect is stronger on AsCpf1, explaining its lower efficiency in ectothermic organisms. We capitalize on this property to show that temporal control of the temperature allows post-translational modulation of Cpf1-mediated genome editing.

    "abstract": "While cholinergic receptor activation has long been known to dramatically enhance the excitability of cortical neurons, the cellular mechanisms responsible for this effect are not well understood. We used intracellular recordings in rat neocortical brain slices to assess the ionic mechanisms supporting persistent firing modes triggered by depolarizing stimuli following cholinergic receptor activation. We found multiple lines of evidence suggesting that a component of the underlying hyperexcitability associated with persistent firing reflects a reduction in the standing (leak) K+ current mediated by Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene (ERG) channels. Three chemically diverse ERG channel blockers (terfenadine, ErgToxin-1, and E-4031) abolished persistent firing and the underlying increase in input resistance in deep pyramidal cells in temporal and prefrontal association neocortex. Calcium accumulation during triggering stimuli appear to attenuate ERG currents, leading to membrane potential depolarization and increased input resistance, two critical elements generating persistent firing. Our results also suggest that ERG current normally governs cortical neuron responses to depolarizing stimuli by opposing prolonged discharges and by enhancing the post-stimulus repolarization. The broad expression of ERG channels and the ability of ERG blocks to abolish persistent firing evoked by both synaptic and intracellular step stimuli suggests modulation of ERG channels may underlie many forms of persistent activity observed in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The limitation of plasticity in the adult brain impedes functional recovery later in life from brain injury or disease. This pressing clinical issue may be resolved by enhancing plasticity in the adult brain. One strategy for triggering robust plasticity in adulthood is to reproduce one of the hallmark physiological events of experience-dependent plasticity observed during the juvenile critical period - rapidly reduce the activity of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons and disinhibit local excitatory neurons. This may be achieved through enhancement of local inhibitory inputs, particularly those of somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons. However, to date the means for manipulating SST interneurons for enhancing cortical plasticity in the adult brain are not known. We show that SST interneuron-selective overexpression of Lypd6, an endogenous nicotinic signaling modulator, enhances ocular dominance plasticity in the adult primary visual cortex (V1). Lypd6 overexpression mediates a rapid experience-dependent increase in the visually evoked activity of SST interneurons as well as a simultaneous reduction in PV interneuron activity and disinhibition of excitatory neurons. Recapitulating this transient activation of SST interneurons using chemogenetics similarly enhanced V1 plasticity. Notably, we show that SST-selective Lypd6 overexpression restores visual acuity in amblyopic mice that underwent early long-term monocular deprivation. Our data in both male and female mice reveal selective modulation of SST interneurons and a putative downstream circuit mechanism as an effective method for enhancing experience-dependent cortical plasticity as well as functional recovery in adulthood.\n\nSignificance StatementThe decline of cortical plasticity after closure of juvenile critical period consolidates neural circuits and behavior, but this limits functional recovery from brain diseases and dysfunctions in later life. Here we show that activation of cortical SST interneurons by Lypd6, an endogenous modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), enhances experience-dependent plasticity and recovery from amblyopia in adulthood. This manipulation triggers rapid reduction of PV interneuron activity and disinhibition of excitatory neurons, which are known hallmarks of cortical plasticity during juvenile critical periods. Our study demonstrates modulation of SST interneurons by Lypd6 to achieve robust levels of cortical plasticity in the adult brain and may provide promising targets for restoring brain function in the event of brain trauma or disease.",

Here we show that specially designed microfluidic devices can apply a tension force to ultra-flexible electrodes that prevents buckling without increasing the thickness or stiffness of the electrode during implantation. Additionally, these \\\"fluidic microdrives\\\" allow us to precisely actuate the electrode position with micron-scale accuracy. To demonstrate the efficacy of our fluidic microdrives, we used them to actuate highly flexible carbon nanotube fiber (CNTf) microelectrodes11,14 for electrophysiology. We used this approach in three proof-of-concept experiments. First, we recorded compound action potentials in a soft model organism, the small cnidarian Hydra. Second, we targeted electrodes precisely to the thalamic reticular nucleus in brain slices and recorded spontaneous and optogenetically-evoked extracellular action potentials. Finally, we inserted electrodes more than 4 mm deep into the brain of rats and detected spontaneous individual unit activity in both cortical and subcortical regions. Compared to syringe injection, fluidic microdrives do not penetrate the brain and prevent changes in intracranial pressure by diverting fluid away from the injection site during insertion and actuation. Overall, the fluidic microdrive technology provides a robust new method to implant and actuate ultra-flexible neural electrodes.",

    "abstract": "Animals integrate changes in external and internal environments to generate behavior. While neural circuits detecting external cues have been mapped, less is known about how internal states like hunger are integrated into behavioral outputs. We use the nematode C. elegans to decode how changes in internal nutritional status affects chemosensory behaviors. We show that acute food deprivation leads to a reversible decline in repellent, but not attractant, sensitivity. This behavioral change requires two conserved transcription factors MML-1 (Mondo A) and HLH-30 (TFEB), both of which translocate from the intestinal nuclei to the cytoplasm upon food deprivation. Next, we identify insulin-like peptides INS-23 and INS-31 as candidate ligands relaying food-status signals from the intestine to other tissues. Furthermore, we show that ASI chemosensory neurons use the DAF-2 insulin receptor, PI-3 Kinase, and the mTOR complex to integrate these intestine-released peptides. Together, our study shows how internal food status signals are integrated by transcription factors and intestine-neuron signaling to generate flexible behaviors.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe have all experienced behavioral changes when we are hungry - the pang in our stomach can cause us to behave erratically. In particular, hungry animals, including humans, are known to pursue behaviors that involve higher risk compared to when they are well-fed. Here we explore the molecular details of this behavior in the invertebrate animal model C. elegans. This behavior, termed sensory integration, shows that C. elegans display reduced copper sensitivity when hungry. Copper is toxic and repellant to C. elegans; reduced avoidance indicates that these animals use riskier food search behaviors when they are hungry. Luckily, like us, this behavioral change is reversible upon re-feeding. This hunger-induced behavioral change is not due to increased attraction to food or depletion of fat stores, but rather insulin signaling between the intestine and specific neurons. We use genetic tools, microscopy, and behavioral tests to determine that this risky behavior involves sensation of \"lack of food\" in the intestine, release of signaling molecules, and engagement with sensory neurons. Our work highlights new and potentially evolutionarily conserved ways in which intestinal cells and neurons communicate leading to largescale behavioral change, providing further support for the importance of the gut-brain-axis.",

    "abstract": "Predicting which substances are suitable for consumption during foraging is critical for animals to survive. While food-seeking behavior is extensively studied, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying avoidance of potentially poisonous substances remain poorly understood. Here we examined the role of the insular cortex (IC) to central amygdala (CeA) circuit in the establishment of such avoidance behavior. Using anatomic tracing approaches combined with optogenetics-assisted circuit mapping, we found that the gustatory region of the IC sends direct excitatory projections to the lateral division of the CeA (CeL), making monosynaptic excitatory connections with distinct populations of CeL neurons. Specific inhibition of neurotransmitter release from the CeL-projecting IC neurons prevented mice from acquiring the \\\"no-go\\\" response, while leaving the \\\"go\\\" response largely unaffected in a tastant (sucrose/quinine)-reinforced \\\"go/no-go\\\" task. Furthermore, selective activation of the IC-CeL pathway with optogenetics drove unconditioned lick suppression in thirsty animals, induced aversive responses, and was sufficient to instruct conditioned action suppression in response to a cue predicting the optogenetic activation. These results indicate that activity in the IC-CeL circuit is necessary for establishing anticipatory avoidance responses to an aversive tastant, and is also sufficient to drive learning of such anticipatory avoidance. This function of the IC-CeL circuit is likely important for guiding avoidance of substances with unpleasant tastes during foraging in order to minimize the chance of being poisoned.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe ability to predict which substances are suitable for consumption is critical for survival.

    "abstract": "Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS) is an X-linked syndromic form of mental retardation characterized by various skeletal dysmorphisms, moderate to severe mental retardation, and in some cases, psychosis. CLS is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RPS6KA3) gene encoding a growth factor-regulated serine/threonine kinase, ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2). We previously identified RSK2 as a novel interacting protein that tonically inhibits 5-HT2A receptor signaling by phosphorylating Ser-314 within the third intracellular loop. To determine if RSK2 inhibits 5-HT2A receptor signaling in vivo and whether disruption of RSK2 could lead to schizophrenia-like behaviors - as is seen in some CLS patients - we genetically disrupted the function of RSK2 either globally or selectively in forebrain pyramidal neurons in mice. Both global and forebrain-selective RSK2 deletion augmented the locomotor responses to the psychotomimetic drugs phencyclidine (PCP) and amphetamine (AMPH). Significantly, forebrain-selective deletion of RSK2 augmented 5-HT2A receptor signaling as exemplified by enhanced 5-HT2A-mediated c-fos activation and head-twitch response without altering the levels or distribution of 5-HT2A receptor protein. Thus, RSK2 modulates 5HT2A receptor function in vivo, and disruption of RSK2 leads to augmented psychostimulant-induced responses reminiscent of those seen in many animal models of schizophrenia. These findings strengthen the association between 5-HT2A receptor dysfunction and psychosis, and provide a potential mechanism underlying the schizophrenia-like symptoms present in some CLS patients.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIGlobal and cell-type-specific RSK2 knock-out mice were assessed behaviorally and pharmacologically\\nC_LIO_LIAugmentation of amphetamine and PCP locomotor responses were seen in both global and forebrain-specific RSK2 KO mice\\nC_LIO_LIAugmentation of 5-HT2A serotonin receptor function but not number was also observed\\nC_LIO_LIThese alterations reveal insights into mechanisms potentially responsible for behavioral sequlae of Coffin-Lowry Syndrome\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "O_LIPremise of the study: Invasive plants may leave enemies behind when they colonize a new habitat, allowing selection to favor increased investment in growth and/or reproduction over defensive traits. Previous studies have identified reduced diversity of potential bacterial pathogens and evolutionary increases in growth and reproduction in invading populations of yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis). This study leverages a recently developed high-throughput assay of immune function to test for evidence of a trade-off between increased growth and defense against bacterial pathogens in yellow starthistles invasion of California (USA).\\nC_LIO_LIMethods: Seven bacterial strains were cultured from infected leaf tissue in the native range. Healthy leaf tissue from five native European collections and six invading collections were exposed to these native bacterial strains. A standardized assay of peroxidase activity was used measure the oxidative burst immune response to pathogen recognition by the leaf. Immune responses were compared to plant growth within and between ranges to assess evidence for a trade-off.\\nC_LIO_LIKey Results: Plant genotypes from the native range demonstrated a higher immune response to bacterial strains than did invading genotypes, consistent with a trade-off with plant growth across regions. The same trade-off was also apparent across genotypes from the native range, but not across genotypes from the invaded range.\\nC_LIO_LIConclusions: Our results provide evidence that increased growth in a highly invasive plant species may come at a cost to immune function, consistent with the hypothesis that escape from enemies can provide opportunities for shifts in resource allocation that favor the proliferation of non-native species.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "DNA replication involves the inherent risk of genome instability, as replisomes invariably encounter DNA lesions or other structures that stall or collapse replication forks during S-phase. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the multi-BRCT domain protein Brc1, which is related to budding yeast Rtt107 and mammalian PTIP, plays an important role in maintaining genome integrity and cell viability when cells experience replication stress. The C-terminal pair of BRCT domains in Brc1 were previously shown to bind phospho-histone H2A ({gamma}H2A) formed by Rad3/ATR checkpoint kinase at DNA lesions; however, the putative scaffold interactions involving the N-terminal BRCT domains 1-4 of Brc1 have remained obscure. Here we show that these domains bind Rhp18/Rad18, which is an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase that has crucial functions in postreplication repair. A missense allele in BRCT domain 4 of Brc1 disrupts binding to Rhp18 and causes sensitivity to replication stress. Brc1 binding to Rhp18 and {gamma}H2A are required for the Brc1-overexpression suppression of smc6-74, which impairs the Smc5/6 structural maintenance of chromosomes complex required for chromosome integrity and repair of collapsed replication forks. From these findings we propose that Brc1 provides scaffolding functions linking {gamma}H2A, Rhp18, and Smc5/6 complex at damaged replication forks.",

    "abstract": "Faithful cellular differentiation requires precise coordination of changes in gene expression. However, the relative contributions of transcriptional and translational regulation during human cellular differentiation are unclear. Here, we induced forebrain neuronal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and characterized genomewide RNA and translation levels during neurogenesis. We find that thousands of genes change at the translation level across differentiation without a corresponding change in RNA level. Specifically, we identify mTOR complex 1 signaling as a key driver for elevated translation of translation-related genes in hESCs. In contrast, translational repression in active neurons is mediated by transcript 3' UTRs, through regulatory sequences. Together, our findings identify a functional role for the dramatic 3' UTR extensions that occur during brain development, and provide insights to interpret genetic variants in post-transcriptional control factors that influence neurodevelopmental disorders and diseases.",
