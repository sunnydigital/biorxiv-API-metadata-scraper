    "abstract": "We introduce the contextual multi-armed bandit task as a framework to investigate learning and decision making in uncertain environments. In this novel paradigm, participants repeatedly choose between multiple options in order to maximise their rewards. The options are described by a number of contextual features which are predictive of the rewards through initially unknown functions. From their experience with choosing options and observing the consequences of their decisions, participants can learn about the functional relation between contexts and rewards and improve their decision strategy over time. In three experiments, we explore participants behaviour in such learning environments. We predict participants behaviour by context-blind (mean-tracking, Kalman filter) and contextual (Gaussian process and linear regression) learning approaches combined with different choice strategies. Participants are mostly able to learn about the context-reward functions and their behaviour is best described by a Gaussian process learning strategy which generalizes previous experience to similar instances. In a relatively simple task with binary features, they seem to combine this learning with a \\\"probability of improvement\\\" decision strategy which focuses on alternatives that are expected to lead to an improvement upon a current favourite option. In a task with continuous features that are linearly related to the rewards, participants seem to more explicitly balance exploration and exploitation. Finally, in a difficult learning environment where the relation between features and rewards is non-linear, some participants are again well-described by a Gaussian process learning strategy, whereas others revert to context-blind strategies.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous electrical stimulation and recording using multi-electrode arrays can provide a valuable technique for studying circuit connectivity and engineering neural interfaces. However, interpreting these measurements is challenging because the spike sorting process (identifying and segregating action potentials arising from different neurons) is greatly complicated by electrical stimulation artifacts across the array, which can exhibit complex and nonlinear waveforms, and overlap temporarily with evoked spikes. Here we develop a scalable algorithm based on a structured Gaussian Process model to estimate the artifact and identify evoked spikes. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated in both real and simulated 512-electrode recordings in the peripheral primate retina with single-electrode and several types of multi-electrode stimulation. We establish small error rates in the identification of evoked spikes, with a computational complexity that is compatible with real-time data analysis. This technology may be helpful in the design of future high-resolution sensory prostheses based on tailored stimulation (e.g., retinal prostheses), and for closed-loop neural stimulation at a much larger scale than currently possible.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySimultaneous electrical stimulation and recording using multi-electrode arrays can provide a valuable technique for studying circuit connectivity and engineering neural interfaces. However, interpreting these recordings is challenging because the spike sorting process (identifying and segregating action potentials arising from different neurons) is largely stymied by electrical stimulation artifacts across the array, which are typically larger than the signals of interest. We develop a novel computational framework to estimate and subtract away this contaminating artifact, enabling the large-scale analysis of responses of possibly hundreds of cells to tailored stimulation. Importantly, we suggest that this technology may also be helpful for the development of future high-resolution neural prosthetic devices (e.g., retinal prostheses).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTamoxifen (TAM) has recently been shown to cause acute gastric atrophy and metaplasia in mice. We have previously demonstrated that the outcome of Helicobacter felis infection, which induces similar gastric lesions in mice, is altered by deletion of specific NF-{kappa}B subunits. Nfkb1-/- mice developed more severe gastric atrophy than wild-type (WT) mice 6 weeks after H. felis infection. In contrast, Nfkb2-/- mice were protected from this pathology. We therefore hypothesized that gastric lesions induced by TAM may be similarly regulated by signaling via NF-{kappa}B subunits.\\n\\nMethodsGroups of 5 female C57BL/6 (WT), Nfkb1-/-, Nfkb2-/- and c-Rel-/- mice were administered 150mg/kg TAM by IP injection. 72 hours later, gastric corpus tissues were taken for quantitative histological assessment. In addition, groups of 6 female WT and Nfkb1-/- mice were exposed to 12Gy {gamma}-irradiation. Gastric epithelial apoptosis was quantified 6 and 48 hours after irradiation.\\n\\nResultsTAM induced gastric epithelial lesions in all strains of mice, but this was more severe in Nfkb1-/- mice than WT mice. Nfkb1-/- mice exhibited more severe parietal cell loss than WT mice, had increased gastric epithelial expression of Ki67 and had an exaggerated gastric epithelial DNA damage response as quantified by {gamma}H2AX. To determine investigate whether the difference in gastric epithelial DNA damage response of Nfkb1-/- mice was unique to TAM induced DNA damage, or a generic consequence of DNA damage, we also assessed gastric epithelial apoptosis following {gamma}-irradiation. 6 hours after {gamma}-irradiation, gastric epithelial apoptosis was increased in the gastric corpus and antrum of Nfkb1-/- mice.\\n\\nConclusionsNF-{kappa}B1 mediated signaling regulates the development of gastric mucosal pathology following TAM administration. This is associated with an exaggerated gastric epithelial DNA damage response. This aberrant response appears to reflect a more generic sensitization of the gastric mucosa of Nfkb1-/- mice to DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "Mood instability is a core clinical feature of affective and psychotic disorders. In keeping with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach, it may be a useful construct for identifying biology that cuts across psychiatric categories. We aimed to investigate the biological validity of a simple measure of mood instability and evaluate its genetic relationship with several psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of mood instability in 53,525 cases and 60,443 controls from UK Biobank, identifying four independently-associated loci (on chromosomes eight, nine, 14 and 18), and a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability estimate of approximately 8%. We found a strong genetic correlation between mood instability and MDD (rg=0.60, SE=0.07, p=8.95 x 10-17) and a small but significant genetic correlation with both schizophrenia (rg=0.11, SE=0.04, p=0.01) and anxiety disorders (rg=0.28, SE=0.14, p=0.04), although no genetic correlation with BD, ADHD or PTSD. Several genes at the associated loci may have a role in mood instability, including the DCC netrin 1 receptor (DCC) gene, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit beta (eIF2B2), placental growth factor (PGF), and protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type D (PTPRD). Strengths of this study include the very large sample size, but our measure of mood instability may be limited by the use of a single question. Overall, this work suggests a polygenic basis for mood instability. This simple measure can be obtained in very large samples; our findings suggest that doing so may offer the opportunity to illuminate the fundamental biology of mood regulation.",

This work reports a combination of X-ray diffraction, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, for the characterisation of binders to different isoforms of the cyclophilin (Cyp) protein family. Although several Cyp inhibitors have been reported in the literature, it has proven challenging to achieve high binding selectivity for different isoforms of this protein family. The present studies have led to the identification of several structurally novel fragments that bind to diverse Cyp isoforms in distinct pockets with low millimolar dissociation constants.

To address the unresolved question of how the shift in diet between fresh and saltwater affects the regulation of metabolic function, we fed salmon contrasting diets in each of the two life stages. Combining transcriptomics with comparative genomics, we found that lipid metabolism undergoes a concerted shift between fresh- and saltwater stages. Lipogenesis and lipid transport become less active in liver after transition to saltwater, while genes for lipid uptake in gut are more expressed in lipid-rich seawater environments. We assess how the whole-genome duplication that gave rise to the salmonids has impacted the evolution of lipid metabolism, and find signatures of pathway-specific selection pressure on gene duplicates, as well as a limited number of cases of increased gene dosage.",

    "abstract": "Measures of general deleteriousness, like CADD or PolyPhen, have become indispensable tools in the interpretation of genetic variants. However, these measures say little about where in the organism these deleterious effects will be most apparent. An additional, complementary measure is needed to link deleterious variants (as determined by e.g., CADD) to tissues in which their effect will be most meaningful. Here, we introduce TiSAn (Tissue Specific Annotation), a tool that predicts how related a genomic position is to a given tissue (http://github.com/kevinVervier/TiSAn). TiSAn uses machine learning on genome-scale, tissue-specific data to discriminate variants relevant to a tissue from those having no bearing on the development or function of that tissue. Predictions are then made genome-wide, and these scores can then be used to contextualize and filter variants of interest in whole genome sequencing or genome wide association studies (GWAS). We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of TiSAn by introducing predictive models for human heart and human brain, and detecting tissue-relevant variations in large cohorts for autism spectrum disorder (TiSAn-brain) and coronary artery disease (TiSAn-heart). We find that TiSAn is better able to prioritize genetic variants according to their tissue-specific action than the current state of the art method, GenoSkyLine.",

Here, we describe the use of a reagentless mRNA fluorescent biosensor based upon the single stranded binding (SSB) protein. In this study, SSB showed similar binding properties to mRNA, to that of its native substrate, ssDNA. Furthermore, fluorescently labelled MDCC-SSB gave the same fluorescence response with both ssDNA and ssRNA, in a concentration dependent manner. When directly compared to RT-qPCR, we found the biosensor to be more reproducible with no product lost through purification. Therefore, the MDCC-SSB is a novel tool for comparative measurement of mRNA yield following in vitro transcription.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage lambda makes a decision between lysis and lysogeny based on the number of coinfecting phages, namely the multiplicity of infection (MoI): lysis at low MoIs; lysogeny at high MoIs. Here, by evaluating various rationally designed models on their ability a) to make the lytic decision at MoI of 1 and the lysogeny decision at MoI of 2, b) to exhibit bistability at both MoIs, and c) to perform accurately in the presence of noise, it is demonstrated that lambdas lysis/lysogeny decision is based on three features, namely a) mutual repression, b) cooperative positive autoregulation of CI, and c) cooperative binding of the activator protein, not basal expression, triggering positive autoregulatory loop of CI. Cro and CI are sufficient to acquire the first two features. CII is required to acquire the third feature. The quasi-minimal two-protein model for the switch is justified by showing its qualitative equivalence, except for Cro repression of pRM, to the lambdas gene regulatory network responsible for the decision. A three-protein simplified version of the lambdas switch is shown to possess all the three design features. Bistability at MoI of 1 is responsible for lysogen stability, whereas bistability at MoI of 2 imparts stability to lytic development post-infection and especially during prophage induction.",

    "abstract": "The coordinated activity of muscles is produced in part by spinal rhythmogenic neural circuits, termed central pattern generators (CPGs). A classical CPG model, proposed conceptually by T.G. Brown in 1911, is a system of coupled oscillators that transform locomotor drive into coordinated and gait-specific patterns of muscle recruitment. A system of ordinary differential equations with a physiologically-inspired coupling locus of interactions captures the timing relationship for bilateral coordination of limbs in locomotion and is typically solved numerically. Consequently, it is intriguing to have a full analytical description of this plausible CPG architecture to illuminate the functionality within this structure. Here, we provided a closed-form analytical solution contrasted against the previous numerical method. The computational load of the analytical solution was decreased by an order of magnitude when compared to the numerical approach (relative errors, <0.01%). The analytical solution tested and supported the previous finding that the input to the model can be expressed in units of the desired limb locomotor speed. Furthermore, we performed parametric sensitivity analysis in the context of controlling asymmetric locomotion and documented two possible mechanisms associated with either an external drive or intrinsic CPG parameters. The results support the idea that many different combinations of network states, even within the same anatomical CPG structure, may generate the same behavioral outcomes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUsing a simple process of leaky integration, we developed an analytical solution to a robust model of spinal pattern generation. We analyzed the ability of this neural element to exert locomotor control of the signal associated with limb speeds, which represent high-level modality within the motor system. Furthermore, we tested the ability of this simple structure to embed steering control using the velocity signal in the models inputs or within the internal connectivity of its elements. Both mechanisms can produce the same behavioral outcome, pointing to the methodological challenges of modeling central pattern generators and demonstrating the possibility of spinal circuit adaptations to asymmetric short- or long-term conditions in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative genetics experiments aim at understanding and predicting the evolution of phenotypic traits. Running such experiments often bring the same questions: Should I bother with maternal effects? Could I estimate those effects? What is the best crossing scheme to obtain reliable estimates? Can I use molecular markers to spare time in the complex task of keeping track of the experimental pedigree?\\n\\nWe explored those practical issues in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria using morphologic and coloration traits, known to be influenced by maternal effects. We ran quantitative genetic analyses with an experimental dataset and used simulations to explore i) the efficiency of animal models to accurately estimate both heritability and maternal effects, ii) the influence of crossing schemes on the precision of estimates and iii) the performance of a marker-based method compared to the pedigree-based method.\\n\\nThe simulations indicated that maternal effects deeply affect heritability estimates and very large datasets are required to properly distinguish and estimate maternal effects and heritabilities. In particular, ignoring maternal effects in the animal model resulted in overestimation of heritabilities and a high rate of false positives whereas models specifying maternal variance suffer from lack of power. Maternal effects can be estimated more precisely than heritabilities but with low power. To obtain better estimates, bigger datasets are required and, in the presence of maternal effects, increasing the number of families over the number of offspring per families is recommended. Our simulations also showed that, in the desert locust, using relatedness based on available microsatellite markers may allow reasonably reliable estimates while rearing locusts in group.\\n\\nIn the light of the simulation results, our experimental dataset suggested that maternal effects affected various phase traits. However the statistical limitations, revealed by the simulation approach, didnt allow precise variance estimates. We stressed out that doing simulations is a useful step to design an experiment in quantitative genetics and interpret the outputs of the statistical models.",

We implement the clustering step using the MapReduce approach for parallelising the analysis of large datasets, which enables the use of compute clusters. The computational task is distributed across the compute system, and no specialised hardware is required. Using this approach, we have re-implemented the Inchworm module from the widely used Trinity pipeline, and tested the method in the context of the full Trinity pipeline. Validation tests on a range of real datasets show large reductions in the runtime and per-node memory requirements, when making use of a compute cluster.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study shows that MapReduce-based clustering has great potential for distributing challenging sequencing problems, without loss of accuracy.

    "abstract": "Oxidation of DNA increases its mutation rate, causing otherwise rare G [-&gt;] T transversions during DNA replication. Here we use a comparative genomic approach to assess the importance of DNA oxidation for the evolution of genomic sequences. To do so, we study the mutational spectrum of Gn-tracks on various timescales, ranging from one human generation to the divergence between primates, and compare it to the properties of guanines oxidation known from experimental and computational studies. Our results suggest that, in short Gn tracks (n [&le;] 3), oxidation does not dominate the mutagenesis of guanines, except in cancerous tumors, especially in lungs. However, we consistently find that the G [-&gt;] T transversion rate is elevated by an order of magnitude in long Gn tracks (n {gtrsim} 6). In such long Gn-tracks, G [-&gt;] T substitutions in fact dominate the mutational spectrum, suggesting that long Gn tracks are oxidized more frequently and/or repaired less efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Force sensing and generation at the tissular and cellular scale is central to many biological events. There is a growing interest in modern cell biology for methods enabling force measurements in vivo. Optical trapping allows non-invasive probing of pico-Newton forces and thus emerged as a promising mean for assessing biomechanics in vivo. Nevertheless, the main obstacles rely in the accurate determination of the trap stiffness in heterogeneous living organisms, at any position where the trap is used. A proper calibration of the trap stiffness is thus required for performing accurate and reliable force measurements in vivo. Here, we introduce a method that overcomes these difficulties by accurately measuring hemodynamic profiles in order to calibrate the trap stiffness. Doing so, and using numerical methods to assess the accuracy of the experimental data, we measured flow profiles and drag forces imposed to trapped red blood cells of living zebrafish embryos. Using treatments enabling blood flow tuning, we demonstrated that such method is powerful in measuring hemodynamic forces in vivo with high accuracy and confidence. Altogether, this study demonstrates the power of optical tweezing in measuring low range hemodynamic forces in vivo and offers an unprecedented tool in both cell and developmental biology.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial surface structures such as type IV pili are common receptors for phage. Strains of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa express one of five different major type IV pilin alleles, two of which are glycosylated with either lipopolysaccharide O-antigen units or polymers of D-arabinofuranose. Here we show that both these post-translational modifications protect P. aeruginosa from a variety of pilus-specific phages. We identified a phage capable of infecting strains expressing both non-glycosylated and glycosylated pilins, and through construction of a chimeric phage, traced this ability to its unique tail proteins. Alteration of pilin sequence, or masking of binding sites by glycosylation, both block phage infection. The energy invested by prokaryotes in glycosylating thousands of pilin subunits is thus explained by the protection against phage predation provided by these common decorations.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEPost-translational modification of bacterial and archaeal surface structures such as pili and flagella is widespread, but the function of these decorations is not clear. We propose that predation by bacteriophages that use these structures as receptors selects for strains that mask potential phage binding sites using glycosylation. Phages are of significant interest as alternative treatments for antibiotic-resistant pathogens, but the ways in which phage interact with host receptors are not well understood. We show that specific phage tail proteins allow for infection of strains with glycosylated pili, providing a foundation for the creation of designer phages that can circumvent first-line bacterial defenses.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity underlies many of the ecosystem services demanded by humans. For cities, the design of  green infrastructures or  nature-based solutions has been proposed to maintain the provisioning of these services and the preservation of biodiversity. It is unclear, however, how such green infrastructure can be implemented, given existing planning practices that generally ignore biodiversity. Urban open spaces are normally designed by landscape architects with a primary focus on plants, aesthetic design and functionality for human users. As a consequence, conservation of species only plays a minor role, in fact, protected animals are often considered detrimental to the design, e.g. when the need to conserve a protected species demands modifications of a building project. Conversely, conservationists are often in favor of protected areas, also in cities, with little access for humans and no human design.\\n\\nWe propose  Animal-Aided Design (AAD) as a methodology for the design of urban open spaces, to integrate conservation into open space planning. The basic idea of AAD is to include the presence of animals in the planning process, such that they are an integral part of the design. For AAD, the desired species are chosen at the beginning of a project. The requirements of the target species then not only set boundary conditions for the design, but also serve as an inspiration for the design itself. The aim of AAD is to establish a stable population at the project site, or contribute to population growth of species with larger habitats. AAD thus allows a combination of good urban design with species conservation. We illustrate our approach with designs for urban spaces in Munich.",

    "abstract": "Rabies viruses have the highest case fatality rate of any known virus and are responsible for an estimated 60,000 deaths each year. This is despite the fact that there are highly efficacious vaccines and postexposure prophylaxis available. However, while it is assumed these biologics provide protection against all rabies virus isolates, there are certain subdivisions of RABV lineages, such as within the Arctic-like RABV (AL rabies virus lineage, where data is limited and thus the potency of existing biologics has not been thoroughly assessed. By fusing the Arctic-like rabies virus envelope glycoprotein ecto- and transmembrane domains with the vesicular stomatitis virus cytoplasmic domain, a high titre (7.7 x 105 - 6.1 x 106 RLU/ml) pseudotyped virus was generated that was subsequently used in a pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay. These results showed that Arctic-like rabies viruses are neutralised to human, canine and feline vaccines and human post-exposure prophylaxis and this was not influenced by the swapping of the cytoplasmic domains (CVS-11 vs CVS-11etmVSVc; r = 0.99, p < 0.0001). This study supports the concept that rabies virus vaccines and newly identified mAbs are able to neutralise rabies virus variants that cluster in a monophyletic clade, referred to as phylogroup I lyssaviruses.",

We show that FGF-MAPK signaling maintains multipotency and promotes the pharyngeal muscle fate, whereas signal termination permits the deployment of a pan-cardiac program, shared by the first and second lineages, to define heart identity. In the second heart lineage, a Tbx1/10-Dach pathway actively suppresses the first heart lineage program, conditioning later cell diversity in the beating heart.

A weighted burden test using 372 variants was significant at p=0.024. The sample size is too small to implicate individual variants or genes but overall this finding provides further support for the hypothesis that disruption of miR-137 binding sites can increase the risk of schizophrenia, perhaps by leading to over-expression of the target gene.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe natural environment serves as a potential reservoir for Campylobacter, the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans. However, little is understood about the mechanisms underlying variations in survival characteristics between different strains of C. jejuni in natural environments, including water.\\n\\nResultsWe identified three Campylobacter jejuni strains that exhibited variability in their ability to retain culturability after suspension in water at two different temperatures (4{degrees}C and 25{degrees}C). Of the three, strains C. jejuni M1 exhibited the most rapid loss of culturability whilst retaining viability. Using RNAseq transcriptomics, we characterised C. jejuni M1 gene expression in response to suspension in water by analyzing bacterial suspensions recovered immediately after introduction into water (Time 0), and from two sampling time/temperature combinations where considerable loss of culturability was evident, namely (i) after 24 h at 25{degrees}C, and (ii) after 72 h at 4{degrees}C. Transcript data were compared with a culture-grown control. Some gene expression characteristics were shared amongst the three populations recovered from water, with more genes being up-regulated than down. Many of the up-regulated genes were identified in the Time 0 sample, whereas the majority of down-regulated genes occurred in the 25{degrees}C (24 h) sample.\\n\\nConclusionsVariations in expression were found amongst genes associated with oxygen tolerance, starvation and osmotic stress. However, we also found upregulation of flagellar assembly genes, accompanied by down-regulation of genes involved in chemotaxis. Our data also suggested a switch from secretion via the sec system to via the tat system, and that the quorum sensing gene luxS may be implicated in the survival of strain M1 in water. Variations in gene expression also occurred in accessory genome regions. Our data suggest that despite the loss of culturability, C. jejuni M1 remains viable and adapts via specific changes in gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for in vivo detection and characterization of white matter lesions (WML) in multiple sclerosis. While these lesions have been studied for over two decades using MRI technology, automated segmentation remains challenging. Although the majority of statistical techniques for the automated segmentation of WML are based on a single imaging modality, recent advances have used multimodal techniques for identifying WML. Complementary imaging modalities emphasize different tissue properties, which can help identify and characterize interrelated features of lesions. However, prior work has ignored relationships between imaging modalities, which may be informative in this clinical context. To harness the coherent changes in these measurements, we utilized inter-modal coupling regression (IMCo) to estimate the covariance structure across modalities. We then used a local logistic regression, MIMoSA, which leverages new covariance features from IMCo regression as well as the mean structure of each imaging modality in order to model the probability that any voxel is part of a lesion. Finally, we introduced a novel thresholding algorithm to fully automate the estimation of the probability maps to generate fully automated segmentations masks for 94 subjects. To evaluate the performance of the automated segmentations generated using MIMoSA we compared results with gold standard manual segmentations. We demonstrate the superiority of MIMoSA to other automated segmentation techniques by comparing it to the OASIS algorithm as well as LesionTOADS. MIMoSA resulted in statistically significant improvement in lesion segmentation.",

One possibility is that this system supports cognition that is independent of the immediate environment; alternatively or additionally, it might support higher-order conceptual representations that draw together multiple features. We tested these accounts using a novel paradigm that separately manipulated the availability of perceptual information to guide decision-making and the representational complexity of this information. Using task based imaging we established regions that respond when cognition combines both stimulus independence with multi-modal information. These included left and right angular gyri and the left middle temporal gyrus. Although these sites were within the default mode network, they showed a stronger response to demanding memory judgements than to an easier perceptual task, contrary to the view that they support automatic aspects of cognition. In a subsequent analysis, we showed that these regions were located at the extreme end of a macroscale gradient, which describes gradual transitions from sensorimotor to transmodal cortex. This shift in the focus of neural activity towards transmodal, default mode, regions might reflect a process of isolation from specific sensory inputs that enables conceptually rich cognitive states to be generated in the absence of input.\\n\\nHighlights O_LIBrain regions supporting meaning overlap with stimulus independence.\\nC_LIO_LIBilateral angular gyri and left MTG respond strongly to both features of cognition.\\nC_LIO_LIThese patterns reflect a shift in activity towards regions of transmodal cortex.\\nC_LIO_LIComplex memory representations may emerge in cortical areas distant from input.\\nC_LI",

Despite its key role, its molecular mechanism has remained largely unknown. Here, we employ single-molecule magnetic tweezers to measure, in real-time, the compaction of individual DNA molecules by the budding yeast condensin complex. We show that compaction proceeds in large (~200nm) steps, driving DNA molecules into a fully condensed state against forces of up to 2pN. Compaction can be reversed by applying high forces or adding buffer of high ionic strength. While condensin can stably bind DNA in the absence of ATP, ATP hydrolysis by the SMC subunits is required for rendering the association salt-insensitive and for subsequent compaction. Our results indicate that the condensin reaction cycle involves two distinct steps, where condensin first binds DNA through electrostatic interactions before using ATP hydrolysis to encircle the DNA topologically within its ring structure, which initiates DNA compaction. The finding that both binding modes are essential for its DNA compaction activity has important implications for understanding the mechanism of chromosome compaction.",

    "abstract": "Microbes form complex and dynamic ecosystems that play key roles in the health of the animals and plants with which they are associated. Such ecosystems are often represented by a directed, signed and weighted ecological network, where nodes represent microbial taxa and edges represent ecological interactions. Inferring the underlying ecological networks of microbial communities is a necessary step towards understanding their assembly rules and predicting their dynamical response to external stimuli. However, current methods for inferring such networks require assuming a particular population dynamics model, which is typically not known a priori. Moreover, those methods require fitting longitudinal abundance data, which is not readily available, and often does not contain the variation that is necessary for reliable inference. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a new method to map the ecological networks of microbial communities using steady-state data. Our method can qualitatively infer the inter-taxa interaction types or signs (positive, negative or neutral) without assuming any particular population dynamics model. Additionally, when the population dynamics is assumed to follow the classic Generalized Lotka-Volterra model, our method can quantitatively infer the inter-taxa interaction strengths and intrinsic growth rates. We systematically validate our method using simulated data, and then apply it to four experimental datasets of microbial communities. Our method offers a novel framework to infer microbial interactions and reconstruct ecological networks, and represents a key step towards reliable modeling of complex, real-world microbial communities, such as the human gut microbiota.",

Available biological datasets allow the identification of non-coding regulatory elements with high confidence; furthermore, chromatin conformation data can be used to confirm enhancer-promoter interactions in specific tissue types and developmental stages. We have devised an analysis pipeline that integrates datasets about gene expression, enhancer activity, chromatin accessibility, epigenetic marks, and Hi-C contact frequencies in various brain tissues and developmental stages, leading to the identification of eight non-coding elements that might regulate the expression of three genes with important roles in brain development in vertebrates. We have then performed comparative sequence and microsynteny analyses in order to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the regulatory landscape around these genes; we observe a general pattern of ancient regulatory elements conserved across most vertebrate lineages, together with younger elements that appear to be mammal and primate innovations.

    "abstract": "The increased recognition of frequent divergence with gene flow has renewed interest in chromosomal inversions as a source for promoting adaptive divergence. Inversions can suppress recombination between heterokaryotypes so that local adapted inversions will be protected from introgression with the migrants. However, we do not have a clear understanding of the conditions for which adaptive divergence is more or less likely to be promoted by inversions when the availability of inversion variation is considered. Standing genetic variation, as opposed to new mutations, could offer a quick way to respond to sudden environmental changes, making it a likely avenue for rapid adaptation. For a scenario of secondary contact between locally-adapted populations, we might intuit that standing inversion variation would predominate over new inversion mutations in maintaining local divergence. Our results show that this is not always the case. Maladaptive gene flow, as both a demographic parameter and the cause for selection that favors locally-adapted inversions, differentiates the dynamics of standing inversion variation from that of segregating point mutations. Counterintuitively, in general, standing inversion variation will be less important to the adaptation than new inversions under the demographic and genetic conditions that are more conducive to adaptive divergence via inversions.",

    "abstract": "Do local conditions influence evolutions ability to produce new traits? Biological data demonstrate that evolutionary processes can be profoundly influenced by local conditions. However, the evolution of novel traits has not been addressed in this context, owing in part to the challenges of performing the necessary experiments with natural organisms. We conduct in silico experiments with the Avida Digital Evolution Platform to address this question. We created eight different spatially heterogeneous environments and ran 100 replicates in each. Within each environment, we examined the distribution of locations where nine different focal traits first evolved. Using spatial statistics methods, we identified regions within each environment that had significantly elevated probabilities of containing the first organism with a given trait (i.e. hotspots of evolutionary potential). Having demonstrated the presence of many such hotspots, we explored three potential mechanisms that could drive the formation of these patterns: proximity of specific resources, variation in local diversity, and variation in the sequence of locations the members of an evolutionary lineage occupy. Resource proximity and local diversity appear to have minimal explanatory power. Lineage paths through space, however, show some promising preliminary trends. If we can understand the processes that create evolutionary hotspots, we will be able to craft environments that are more effective at evolving targeted traits. This capability would be useful both to evolutionary computation, and to efforts to guide biological evolution.",

    "abstract": "Genetic factors contribute to the risk for developing alcohol use disorder (AUD). In collaboration with the genetics company 23andMe, Inc., we performed a genome-wide association (GWAS) study of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), an instrument designed to screen for alcohol misuse over the past year. Our final sample consisted of 20,328 research participants of European ancestry (55.3% females; mean age = 53.8, SD = 16.1) who reported ever using alcohol. Our results showed that the  chip-heritability of AUDIT score, when treated as a continuous phenotype, was 12%. No loci reached genome-wide significance. The gene ADH1C, which has been previously implicated in AUD, was among our most significant associations (4.4 x 10-7; rs141973904). We also detected a suggestive association on chromosome 1 (2.1 x 10-7; rs182344113) near the gene KCNJ9, which has been implicated in mouse models of high ethanol drinking. Using LD score regression, we identified positive genetic correlations between AUDIT score and AUD, high alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking. We also observed an unexpected positive genetic correlation between AUDIT and educational attainment, and additional unexpected negative correlations with BMI/obesity and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We conclude that conducting a genetic study using data from a population unselected for AUD and responding to an online questionnaire may represent a cost-effective strategy for elucidating the etiology of AUD.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the role of genes in directing behavior is one of the primary goals of neuroscience. Mating behavior in Drosophila is controlled by male-specific splicing of the master regulatory gene fruitless (fru), and the male-specific splice form, fruM, is both necessary and sufficient for all aspects of the courtship ritual. We have previously described the role of Trapped in endoderm 1 (Tre1) in courtship behavior. Tre1 encodes an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor that is essential for normal courtship behavior in male flies. We previously found that feminizing Tre1-expressing cells in males via expression of the female-specific splicing factor Transformer (TraF) resulted in rapid courtship initiation. Here we confirm that Tre1 is required in neurons for normal courtship behavior, and present genetic evidence that Tre1 acts through the downregulation of the E-cadherin Shotgun, and that the neurotransmitter histamine is the likely Tre1 ligand. Our findings are the first evidence for metabotropic histamine receptors in Drosophila, and the first to demonstrate a role for histamine in courtship.",

Although previous efforts were successful for individual disease conditions (single disease), limited information exists on shared genetic risk between these disorders. This article presents a detailed review and analysis of cardio-metabolic diseases risk (CMD-R) genes that are also associated with mood disorders. Firstly, we reviewed meta-GWA studies published until January 2016, for the diseases \\\"type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension\\\" and/or for the risk factors \\\"blood pressure, obesity, plasma lipid levels, insulin and glucose related traits\\\". We then searched the literature for published associations of these CMD-R genes with mood disorders. We considered studies that reported a significant association of at least one of the CMD-R genes and \\\"depressive disorder\\\" OR \\\"depressive symptoms\\\" OR \\\"bipolar disorder\\\" OR \\\"lithium treatment\\\", OR \\\"serotonin reuptake inhibitors treatment\\\". Our review revealed 24 potential pleiotropic genes that are likely to be shared between mood disorders and CMD-Rs. These genes include MTHFR, CACNA1D, CACNB2, GNAS, ADRB1, NCAN, REST, FTO, POMC, BDNF, CREB, ITIH4, LEP, GSK3B, SLC18A1, TLR4, PPP1R1B, APOE, CRY2, HTR1A, ADRA2A, TCF7L2, MTNR1B, and IGF1. A pathway analysis of these genes revealed significant pathways: corticotrophin-releasing hormone signaling, AMPK signaling, cAMP-mediated or G-protein coupled receptor signaling, axonal guidance signaling, serotonin and dopamine receptors signaling, dopamine-DARPP32 feedback in cAMP signaling, circadian rhythm signaling and leptin signaling. Our findings provide insights in to the shared biological mechanisms of mood disorders and cardio-metabolic diseases.",

The identification of microbial hybrids is made even more complicated, as most environmental microbes are resistant to culturing and must be studied in their native mixed communities. We have previously adapted the chromosome conformation capture method Hi-C to the assembly of genomes from mixed populations. Here, we show the methods application in assembling genomes directly from an uncultured, mixed population from a spontaneously inoculated beer sample. Our assembly method has enabled us to de-convolute 4 bacterial and 4 yeast genomes from this sample, including a putative yeast hybrid. Downstream isolation and analysis of this hybrid confirmed its genome to consist of Pichia membranifaciens and that of another related, but undescribed yeast. Our work shows that Hi-C-based metagenomic methods can overcome the limitation of traditional sequencing methods in studying complex mixtures of genomes.",

    "abstract": "Many bacterial adaptive responses to changes in growth conditions due to biotic and abiotic factors involve reprogramming of gene expression at the transcription level. The bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP), which catalyzes transcription, can thus be considered as the major mediator of cellular adaptive strategies. But how do bacteria respond if a stress factor directly compromises the activity of the RNAP? We used a phage-derived small protein to specifically perturb bacterial RNAP activity in exponentially growing Escherichia coli. Using cytological profiling, tracking RNAP behavior at single-molecule level and transcriptome analysis, we reveal that adaptation to conditions that directly perturb bacterial RNAP performance can result in a biphasic growth behavior and thereby confer the  adapted bacterial cells an enhanced ability to tolerate diverse antibacterial stresses. The results imply that while synthetic transcriptional rewiring may confer bacteria with the intended desirable properties, such approaches may also collaterally allow them to acquire undesirable traits.",

Pathway enrichment identified numerous pathways consistent with the current AD knowledge base, including dysregulation of Glutamate Receptor Signaling, Synaptic Long Term Potentiation and Depression, Rho and Rac Signaling, Calcium Signaling, and Oxidative Phosphorylation and Mitochondrial Dysfunction. Additionally, the data demonstrate that a large number of changes occur in the proteome very early relative to the onset of both traditional disease markers such as amyloid accumulation, tau phosphorylation and cognitive dysfunction. These early changes include a number of dysregulated proteins that have novel associations with AD progression.

However, since the spatial scale of extracellular oscillations typically exceeds that of firing rates, it is unclear whether coherence complements or compromises the rate code. We examined responses in the macaque primary visual cortex and found that fluctuations in gamma-band (~40Hz) neuronal coherence correlated more with firing rate than oscillations in the local-field-potential (LFP). Although the spatial extent of LFP rhythms was broader, that of neuronal coherence was indistinguishable from firing rates. To identify the mechanism, we developed a statistical technique to isolate the rhythmic component of the spiking process and found that above results are explained by an activation-dependent increase in neuronal sensitivity to gamma-rhythmic input. Such adaptive changes in sensitivity to rhythmic inputs might constitute a fundamental homeostatic mechanism that prevents globally coherent inputs from undermining spatial resolution of the neural code.",

Studies have suggested that alpha-beta power decreases may index word-retrieval processes. In context-driven word retrieval, participants hear lead-in sentences that either constrain the final word (\\\"He locked the door with the\\\") or not (\\\"She walked in here with the\\\"). The last word is shown as a picture to be named. Previous studies have consistently found alpha-beta power decreases prior to picture onset for constrained relative to unconstrained sentences, localised to the left lateral-temporal and lateral-frontal lobes. However, the relative contribution of temporal versus frontal areas to alpha-beta power decreases is unknown. We recorded the electroencephalogram from patients with stroke lesions encompassing the left-lateral temporal and inferior parietal regions or left-lateral frontal lobe and from matched controls. Individual-participant analyses revealed a behavioural sentence context facilitation effect in all participants, except for in the two patients with extensive lesions to temporal and inferior-parietal lobes. We replicated the alpha-beta power decreases prior to picture onset in all participants, except for in the two same patients with extensive posterior lesions. Thus, whereas posterior lesions eliminated the behavioural and oscillatory context effect, frontal lesions did not. Hierarchical clustering analyses of the patients lesion profiles, and behavioural and electrophysiological effects identified P7 and P9 as having a unique combination of lesion distribution and context effects. These results indicate a critical role for the left lateral-temporal and inferior parietal lobes, but not frontal cortex, in generating the alpha-beta power decreases underlying context-driven word production.",

To provide an effective substrate for cognitive function, we reasoned that ongoing functional brain networks should also be able to reorganise and coordinate in a similar manner. To test this hypothesis, we use a novel method for identifying repeating patterns of network dynamics, and show that resting networks in magnetoencephalography are well characterised by visits to short-lived transient brain states, with spatially distinct power and phase-coupling in specific frequency bands. Brain states were identified for sensory, motor networks and higher-order cognitive networks; the latter include a posterior higher-order cognitive network in the alpha range (8-12Hz) and an anterior cognitive network in the delta/theta range (1-7Hz). Both higher-order cognitive networks exhibit especially high power and coherence, and contain brain areas corresponding to posterior and anterior subdivisions of the default mode network. Our results show that large-scale cortical phase-coupling networks operate in very specific frequency bands, possibly reflecting functional specialisation at different intrinsic timescales.",

    "abstract": "The Cucurbita genus contains several economically important species in the Cucurbitaceae family. Interspecific hybrids between C. maxima and C. moschata are widely used as rootstocks for other cucurbit crops. We report high-quality genome sequences of C. maxima and C. moschata and provide evidence supporting an allotetraploidization event in Cucurbita. We are able to partition the genome into two homoeologous subgenomes based on different genetic distances to melon, cucumber and watermelon in the Benincaseae tribe. We estimate that the two diploid progenitors successively diverged from Benincaseae around 31 and 26 million years ago (Mya), and the allotetraploidization happened earlier than 3 Mya, when C. maxima and C. moschata diverged. The subgenomes have largely maintained the chromosome structures of their diploid progenitors. Such long-term karyotype stability after polyploidization is uncommon in plant polyploids. The two subgenomes have retained similar numbers of genes, and neither subgenome is globally dominant in gene expression. Allele-specific expression analysis in the C. maxima x C. moschata interspecific F1 hybrid and the two parents indicates the predominance of trans-regulatory effects underlying expression divergence of the parents, and detects transgressive gene expression changes in the hybrid correlated with heterosis in important agronomic traits. Our study provides insights into plant genome evolution and valuable resources for genetic improvement of cucurbit crops.",

    "abstract": "To optimize fitness a plant should monitor its metabolism to appropriately control growth and defense. Primary metabolism can be measured by the universally conserved TOR (Target of Rapamycin) pathway to balance growth and development with the available energy and nutrients. Recent work suggests that plants may measure defense metabolites to potentially provide a strategy ensuring fast reallocation of resources to coordinate plant growth and defense. There is little understanding of mechanisms enabling defense metabolite signaling. To identify mechanisms of defense metabolite signaling, we used glucosinolates, an important class of plant defense metabolites. We report novel signaling properties specific to one distinct glucosinolate, 3- hydroxypropyl glucosinolate across plants and fungi. This defense metabolite, or derived compounds, reversibly inhibits root growth and development. 3-hydroxypropyl glucosinolate signaling functions via genes in the ancient TOR pathway. Thus, plants might link evolutionarily new defense metabolites to ancient signaling pathways to optimize energy allocation.",
