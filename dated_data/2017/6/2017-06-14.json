    "abstract": "Adult Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies were placed into one end of a tube near to repellents (benzaldehyde and heat) and away from the other end containing attractants (light and a favored temperature). They escaped from the repellents and went to the attractants. Five motile mutants that failed to do that were isolated. They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal sensory stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. The mutants, although motile, failed to respond to stimuli at both 34{degrees}C and at room temperature. Some of the mutants have been mapped. It is proposed that the information from the different sensory receptors comes together at an intermediate, called \\\"inbetween\\\" (Inbet), that brings about a behavioral response. The Boss is defined here.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrevious reports of altered grey and white matter structure in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) have been inconsistent. Recent meta-analyses have, however, reported reduced hippocampal grey matter volume in MDD and reduced white matter integrity in several brain regions. The use of different diagnostic criteria, different scanners and imaging sequences may, however, obscure further anatomical differences.\\n\\nMethodsIn this study, we tested for differences in subcortical grey matter volume and white matter integrity between depressed individuals and controls in a large sample of subjects from the first data release of the UK Biobank imaging study of 4446 individuals, which used consistent diagnostic criteria at a single assessment centre, with a single MRI scanner and protocol.\\n\\nResultsWhilst we found no significant differences in subcortical volumes, we report significant reductions in depressed individuals versus controls in global white matter integrity, as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) ({beta} = -0.187, p = 0.017). We also report reductions in FA in association/commissural fibres ({beta} = -0.184, p = 0.019) and thalamic radiations ({beta} = -0.175, p = 0.027). Examining tracts individually, we report tract-specific FA reductions in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus ({beta} = -0.218, pcorrected = 0.012) and superior thalamic radiation ({beta} = -0.258, pcorrected = 0.010) in subjects with depression.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings highlight the need for further large adequately-powered studies of depression and provide further evidence for disrupted white matter integrity in the disorder. Future studies would focus on exploring the typical neuro-phenotype in homogenous subgroups of depression.",

    "abstract": "Polyacrylamide gels functionalized with extracellular matrix proteins are commonly used as cell culture platforms to evaluate the combined effects of extracellular matrix composition, cell geometry and substrate rigidity on cell physiology. For this purpose, protein transfer onto the surface of polyacrylamide hydrogels must result in geometrically well-resolved micropatterns with homogeneous protein distribution. Yet the outcomes of micropatterning methods have not been pairwise evaluated against these criteria. We report a high-fidelity photoresist lift-off patterning method to pattern ECM proteins on polyacrylamide hydrogels ranging from 5 to 25 kPa. We directly compare the protein transfer efficiency and pattern geometrical accuracy of this protocol to the widely used microcontact printing method. Lift-off patterning achieves higher protein transfer efficiency, increases pattern accuracy, increases pattern yield, and reduces variability of these factors within arrays of patterns as it bypasses the drying and transfer steps of microcontact printing. We demonstrate that lift-off patterned hydrogels successfully control cell size and shape and enable long-term imaging of actin intracellular structure and lamellipodia dynamics when we culture epithelial cells on these substrates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSimple mechanistic epidemic models are widely used for forecasting and parameter estimation of infectious diseases based on noisy case reporting data. Despite the widespread application of models to emerging infectious diseases, we know little about the comparative performance of standard computational-statistical frameworks in these contexts. Here we build a simple stochastic, discrete-time, discrete-state epidemic model with both process and observation error and use it to characterize the effectiveness of different flavours of Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We use fits to simulated data, where parameters (and future behaviour) are known to explore the limitations of different platforms and quantify parameter estimation accuracy, forecasting accuracy, and computational efficiency across combinations of modeling decisions (e.g. discrete vs. continuous latent states, levels of stochasticity) and computational platforms (JAGS, NIMBLE, Stan).\\n\\nResultsModels incorporating at least one source of population-level variation (i.e., dispersion in either the transmission process or the observation process) provide reasonably good forecasts and parameter estimates, while models that incorporate only individual-level variation can lead to inaccurate (or overconfident) results. Models using continuous approximations to the transmission process showed improved computational efficiency without loss of accuracy.\\n\\nConclusionSimple models of disease transmission and observation can be fitted reliably to simple simulations, as long as population-level variation is taken into account. Continuous approximations can improve computational efficiency using more advanced MCMC techniques.",

We argue that it can further be shown that core features of language processing emerge from particular phasal and cross-frequency coupling properties of neural oscillations; what has been referred to as the language  oscillome. It is expected that basic aspects of the language oscillome result from genetic guidance, what we will here call the language  oscillogenome, for which we will put forward a list of candidate genes. We have considered genes for altered brain rhythmicity in conditions involving language deficits (autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, specific language impairment and dyslexia) for which we have confident genome-oscillome-phenome connections. These selected genes map on to aspects of brain function, particularly on to neurotransmitter function. Our aim is to propose a set of biologically robust genome-to-language linking hypotheses that, given testing, would grant causal and explanatory power to brain rhythms with respect to language processing.",

    "abstract": "We address the evolution of effective number of individuals under androdioecy and gynodioecy. We analyze dynamic models of autosomal modifiers of weak effect on sex expression. In our zygote control models, the sex expressed by a zygote depends on its own genotype, while in our maternal control models, it depends on the genotype of its maternal parent. Our analysis unifies full multi-dimensional local stability analysis with the Li-Price equation, which for all its heuristic appeal, describes evolutionary change over a single generation. We define a point in the neighborhood of a fixation state from which a single-generation step indicates the asymptotic behavior of the frequency of a modifier allele initiated at an arbitrary point near the fixation state. A concept of heritability appropriate for the evolutionary modification of sex emerges from the Li-Price framework. We incorporate our theoretical analysis into our previously-developed Bayesian inference framework to develop a new method for inferring the viability of gonochores (males or females) relative to hermaphrodites. Applying this approach to microsatellite data derived from natural populations of the gynodioecious plant Schiedea salicaria and the androdioecious killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus, we find that while female and hermaphrodite S. salicaria appear to have similar viabilities, male K. marmoratus appear to survive to reproductive age at less than half the rate of hermaphrodites.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria secrete a variety of compounds important for nutrient scavenging, competition mediation and infection establishment. While there is a general consensus that secreted compounds can be shared and therefore have social consequences for the bacterial collective, we know little about the physical limits of such bacterial social interactions. Here, we address this issue by studying the sharing of iron-scavenging siderophores between surface-attached microcolonies of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using single-cell fluorescent microscopy, we show that siderophores, secreted by producers, quickly reach non-producers within a range of 100 m, and significantly boost their fitness. Producers in turn respond to variation in sharing efficiency by adjusting their pyoverdine investment levels. These social effects wane with larger cell-to-cell distances and on hard surfaces. Thus, our findings reveal the boundaries of compound sharing, and show that sharing is particularly relevant between nearby yet physically separated bacteria on soft surfaces, matching realistic natural conditions such as those encountered in soft tissue infections.",

The tunicate Ciona emerged as an attractive model to study early cardiopharyngeal development at high resolution: through two asymmetric and oriented divisions, defined cardiopharyngeal progenitors produce distinct first and second heart precursors, and pharyngeal muscle (aka atrial siphon muscle, ASM) precursors. Here, we demonstrate that differential FGF-MAPK signaling distinguishes between heart and ASM precursors. We characterize a feed-forward circuit that promotes the successive activations of essential ASM determinants, Hand-related, Tbx1/10 and Ebf. Finally, we show that coupling FGF-MAPK restriction and cardiopharyngeal network deployment with cell divisions defines the timing of gene expression and permits the emergence of diverse cell types from multipotent progenitors.",

    "abstract": "Many mutualistic microbial relationships are based on nutrient cross-feeding. Traditionally, cross-feeding is viewed as being unidirectional from the producer to the recipient. This is likely true when a producers metabolic waste, such as fermentation products, provides carbon for a recipient. However, in some cases the cross-fed nutrient holds value for both the producer and the recipient. In such cases, there is potential for nutrient reacquisition by producer cells in a population, leading to competition against recipients. Here we investigate the consequences of inter-partner competition for cross-fed nutrients on mutualism dynamics using an anaerobic coculture pairing fermentative Escherichia coli and phototrophic Rhodopseudomonas palustris. In this coculture, E. coli excretes waste organic acids that provide carbon for R. palustris. In return, R. palustris cross-feeds E. coli ammonium (NH4+), a valuable nitrogen compound that both species prefer. To explore the potential for inter-partner competition, we first used a kinetic model to simulate cocultures with varied affinities for NH4+ in each species. The model predicted that inter-partner competition for cross-fed NH4+ could profoundly impact population dynamics. We then experimentally tested the predictions by culturing mutants lacking NH4+ transporters in both NH4+ competition assays and cooperative cocultures. Both theoretical and experimental results indicated that the recipient must have a competitive advantage in acquiring valuable cross-fed NH4+ to avoid collapse of the mutualism. Thus, the very metabolites that form the basis for cooperative cross-feeding can also be subject to competition between mutualistic partners.\\n\\nSignificanceMutualistic relationships, particularly those based on nutrient cross-feeding, promote stability of diverse ecosystems and drive global biogeochemical cycles. Cross-fed nutrients within these systems can be either waste products valued only by one partner or nutrients that both partners value. Here, we explore how inter-partner competition for a communally-valuable cross-fed nutrient impacts mutualism dynamics. We discovered that mutualism stability necessitates that the recipient have a competitive advantage against the producer in obtaining the cross-fed nutrient. We propose that the requirement for recipient-biased competition is a general rule for mutualistic coexistence based on the transfer of communally valuable resources, microbial or otherwise.",

    "abstract": "The wiring diagram of the neocortex determines how information is processed across dozens of cortical areas. Each area communicates with multiple others via extensive long-range axonal projections 1-6, but the logic of inter-area information transfer is unresolved. Specifically, the extent to which individual neurons send dedicated projections to single cortical targets or distribute their signals across multiple areas remains unclear5,7-20. Distinguishing between these possibilities has been challenging because axonal projections of only a few individual neurons have been reconstructed. Here we map the projection patterns of axonal arbors from 591 individual neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) using two complementary methods: whole-brain fluorescence-based axonal tracing21,22 and high-throughput DNA sequencing of genetically barcoded neurons (MAPseq)23. Although our results confirm the existence of dedicated projections to certain cortical areas, we find these are the exception, and that the majority of V1 neurons broadcast information to multiple cortical targets. Furthermore, broadcasting cells do not project to all targets randomly, but rather comprise subpopulations that either avoid or preferentially innervate specific subsets of cortical areas. Our data argue against a model of dedicated lines of intracortical information transfer via \\\"one neuron - one target area\\\" mapping. Instead, long-range communication between a sensory cortical area and its targets may be based on a principle whereby individual neurons copy information to, and potentially coordinate activity across, specific subsets of cortical areas.",

These advances are invariably collaborative, involving the contributions of many scientists to a discovery network in which theory and experiment are built upon. To understand such scientific advances, data mining of public and commercial data sources coupled with network analysis can be used as a digital methodology to assemble and analyze component events in the history of a therapeutic. This methodology is extensible beyond the history of therapeutics and its use more generally supports (i) efficiency in exploring the scientific history of a research advance (ii) documenting and understanding collaboration (iii) portfolio analysis, planning and optimization (iv) communication of the societal value of research. As a proof of principle, we have conducted a case study of five anti-cancer therapeutics. We have linked the work of roughly 237,000 authors in 106,000 scientific publications that capture the research crucial for the development of these five therapeutics. We have enriched the content of networks of these therapeutics by annotating them with information on research awards as well as peer review that preceded these awards. Applying retrospective citation discovery, we have identified a core set of publications cited in the networks of all five therapeutics and additional intersections in combinations of networks as well as awards from the National Institutes of Health that supported this research. Lastly, we have mapped these awards to their cognate peer review panels, identifying another layer of collaborative scientific activity that influenced the research represented in these networks.",

    "abstract": "Microbes comprise nearly half of all biomass on Earth. Almost every habitat on Earth is teeming with microbes, from hydrothermal vents to the human gastrointestinal tract. Those microbes form complex communities and play critical roles in maintaining the integrity of their environment or the well-being of their hosts. Controlling microbial communities can help us restore natural ecosystems and maintain healthy human microbiota. Yet, our ability to precisely manipulate microbial communities has been fundamentally impeded by the lack of a systematic framework to control them. Here we fill this gap by developing a control framework based on the new notion of structural accessibility. This framework allows identifying minimal sets of \\\"driver species\\\" through which we can achieve feasible control of the entire microbial community. We numerically validate our control framework on large microbial communities, and then we demonstrate its application for controlling the gut microbiota of gnotobiotic mice infected with Clostridium difficile and the core microbiota of the sea sponge Ircinia oros.",

    "abstract": "Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) are critical public health concerns because they are among the leading causes of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections. Chlorhexidine (CHX) is a bisbiguanide cationic antiseptic that is routinely used for patient bathing and other infection control practices. VREfm are likely frequently exposed to CHX; however, the long-term effects of CHX exposure have not been studied in enterococci. In this study, we serially exposed VREfm to increasing concentrations of CHX for a period of 21 days in two independent experimental evolution trials. Reduced CHX susceptibility emerged (4-fold shift in CHX MIC). Sub-populations with reduced daptomycin (DAP) susceptibility were detected, which were further analyzed by genome sequencing and lipidomic analysis. Across the trials, we identified adaptive changes in genes with predicted or experimentally confirmed roles in chlorhexidine susceptibility (efrE), global nutritional stress response (relA), nucleotide metabolism (cmk), phosphate acquisition (phoU), and glycolipid biosynthesis (bgsB), among others. Moreover, significant alterations in membrane phospholipids were identified. Our results are clinically significant because they identify a link between serial sub-inhibitory CHX exposure and reduced DAP susceptibility. In addition, the CHX-induced genetic and lipidomic changes described in this study offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying the emergence of antibiotic resistance in VREfm.",

    "abstract": "All ales are fermented by various strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, recent whole-genome sequencing has revealed that most commercially available ale yeasts are highly related and represent a small fraction of the genetic diversity found among S. cerevisiae isolates as a whole. This lack of diversity limits the phenotypic variations between these strains, which translates into a limited number of sensory compounds created during fermentation. Here, we characterized a collection of wild S. cerevisiae, S. kudriavzevii, and S. paradoxus strains for their ability to ferment wort into beer. Although many isolates performed well, S. cerevisiae strain YH166 was the most promising, displaying excellent fermentation kinetics and attenuation, as well as a tropical fruit sensory profile. Use of this strain in multiple styles of beer suggested that it is broadly applicable in the brewing industry. Thus, YH166 is a novel ale strain that can be used to lend fruity esters to beer and should pair well with citrusy hops in hop-forward ales.",

Its highest energy consumption compared to other brain networks and its intimate coupling with conscious awareness are both pointing to an overarching function. Many research streams speak in favor of an evolutionarily adaptive role in envisioning experience to anticipate the future. In the present work, we propose a process model that tries to explain how the DMN may implement continuous evaluation and prediction of the environment to guide behavior. Specifically, we answer the question whether the neurobiological properties of the DMN collectively provide the computational building blocks necessary for a Markov Decision Process. We argue that our formal account of DMN function naturally accommodates as special cases previous interpretations based on (1) predictive coding, (2) semantic associations, and (3) a sentinel role. Moreover, this process model for the neural optimization of complex behavior in the DMN offers parsimonious explanations for recent experimental findings in animals and humans.",

    "abstract": "Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive bacteria. We have shown previously that Staphylococcus aureus can survive daptomycin exposure by releasing membrane phospholipids that inactivate the antibiotic. To determine whether other pathogens possess this defence mechanism, phospholipid release and daptomycin activity were measured after incubation of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Group A or B streptococci, Streptococcus gordonii or Enterococcus faecalis with the antibiotic. All bacteria released phospholipid in response to daptomycin, which resulted in at least partial inactivation of the antibiotic. However, E. faecalis showed the highest levels of lipid release and daptomycin inactivation. As shown previously for S. aureus, phospholipid release by E. faecalis was inhibited by the lipid biosynthesis inhibitor platensimycin. In conclusion, several pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, including E. faecalis, inactivate daptomycin by releasing phospholipids, which may contribute to the failure of daptomycin to resolve infections caused by these pathogens.",

However, dopamine neurons exhibit several notable deviations from this hypothesis. A coherent explanation for these deviations can be obtained by analyzing the dopamine response in terms of Bayesian reinforcement learning. The key idea is that prediction errors are modulated by probabilistic beliefs about the relationship between cues and outcomes, updated through Bayesian inference. This account can explain dopamine responses to inferred value in sensory preconditioning, the effects of cue pre-exposure (latent inhibition) and adaptive coding of prediction errors when rewards vary across orders of magnitude. We further postulate that orbitofrontal cortex transforms the stimulus representation through recurrent dynamics, such that a simple error-driven learning rule operating on the transformed representation can implement the Bayesian reinforcement learning update.",

Many de novo assemblers using the de Bruijn graph of a set of the RNA sequences rely on in-memory representation of this graph. However, current methods analyse the complete set of read-derived k-mer sequence at once, resulting in the need for computer hardware with large shared memory.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a novel approach that clusters k-mers as the first step. The clusters correspond to small sets of gene products, which can be processed quickly to give candidate transcripts. We implement the clustering step using the MapReduce approach for parallelising the analysis of large datasets, which enables the use of compute clusters. The computational task is distributed across the compute system, and no specialised hardware is required. Using this approach, we have re-implemented the Inchworm module from the widely used Trinity pipeline, and tested the method in the context of the full Trinity pipeline. Validation tests on a range of real datasets show large reductions in the runtime and per-node memory requirements, when making use of a compute cluster.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study shows that MapReduce-based clustering has great potential for distributing challenging sequencing problems, without loss of accuracy.

    "abstract": "Identification of synteny between genomes of closely related species is an important aspect of comparative genomics. However, it is unknown to what extent draft assemblies lead to errors in such analysis. To investigate this, we fragmented genome assemblies of model nematodes to various extents and conducted synteny identification and downstream analysis. We first show that synteny between species can be underestimated up to 40% and find disagreements between popular tools that infer synteny blocks. This inconsistency and further demonstration of erroneous gene ontology enrichment tests throws into question the robustness of previous synteny analysis when gold standard genome sequences remain limited. In addition, determining the true evolutionary relationship is compromised by assembly improvement using a reference guided approach with a closely related species. Annotation quality, however, has minimal effect on synteny if the assembled genome is highly contiguous. Our results highlight the need for gold standard genome assemblies for synteny identification and accurate downstream analysis.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGenome assemblies across all domains of life are currently produced routinely. Initial analysis of any new genome usually includes annotation and comparative genomics. Synteny provides a framework in which conservation of homologous genes and gene order is identified between genomes of different species. The availability of human and mouse genomes paved the way for algorithm development in large-scale synteny mapping, which eventually became an integral part of comparative genomics. Synteny analysis is regularly performed on assembled sequences that are fragmented, neglecting the fact that most methods were developed using complete genomes. Here, we systematically evaluate this interplay by inferring synteny in genome assemblies with different degrees of contiguation. As expected, our investigation reveals that assembly quality can drastically affect synteny analysis, from the initial synteny identification to downstream analysis. Importantly, we found that improving a fragmented assembly using synteny with the genome of a related species can be dangerous, as this a priori assumes a potentially false evolutionary relationship between the species. The results presented here re-emphasize the importance of gold standard genomes to the science community, and should be achieved given the current progress in sequencing technology.",

Here we show that neuromasts of the posterior lateral line in medaka are composed of two independent life-long lineages with different embryonic origins. Clonal analysis and 4D imaging revealed a hierarchical organisation with instructing and responding roles: an inner, neural lineage induces the formation of an outer, border cell lineage (nBC) from the skin epithelium. Our results demonstrate that the neural lineage is necessary and sufficient to generate nBCs highlighting self-organisation principles at the level of the entire embryo.

    "abstract": "Beige adipocyte differentiation within white adipose tissue, referred to as browning, is seen as a possible mechanism for increasing energy expenditure. The molecular regulation underlying the thermogenic browning process has not been entirely elucidated. Here, we identify the zinc finger transcription factor EGR1 as a negative regulator of the beige fat program. Loss of Egr1 in mice promotes browning in the absence of external stimulation and activates Ucp1 that encodes the key thermogenic mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1. Moreover, EGR1 is recruited to the proximal region of the Ucp1 promoter in subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue. Transcriptomic analysis of subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue in the absence of Egr1 identifies the molecular signature of white adipocyte browning downstream of Egr1 deletion and highlights a concomitant increase of beige differentiation marker and decrease in extracellular matrix gene expression. Conversely, Egr1 overexpression in mesenchymal stem cells decreases beige adipocyte differentiation, while increasing extracellular matrix production. These results uncover the role of Egr1 in blocking energy expenditure via direct Ucp1 transcription regulation and highlight Egr1 as a therapeutic target for counteracting obesity.",

As dispersal is central to range dynamics, factors promoting fast and distant dispersal are key to understanding and predicting species ranges. During range expansions, genetic variation is depleted at the expanding front. Such conditions should reduce evolutionary potential, while increasing kin competition. Organisms able to recognise relatives may be able to assess increased levels of relatedness at expanding range margins and to increase their dispersal in a plastic manner. Using individual-based simulations and experimental range expansions of a spider mite, we demonstrate that plastic responses to kin structure can be at least as important as evolution in driving range expansion speed.

However, it was considered a dubious taxon by some researchers until a molecular study with strong species-level taxon sampling revealed its phylogenetic affinities and validated its status as a distinct species. We reanalysed existing mitochondrial DNA data together with a new data set sampling multiple populations of the Long-tailed Sylph (Aglaiocercus kingii), a species broadly distributed in the Andes of South America. In contrast to previous work, we found that H. zusii shares a haplotype with specimens of A. kingii from the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia, which is phylogenetically nested within a clade formed by populations of A. kingii from the Colombian Andes. These results suggest that H. zusii is not a distinct species, but is most likely the result of hybridization between a female A. kingii and a male of another hummingbird species. These findings highlight the importance of thorough taxonomic and geographic sampling when assessing the likelihood of hybrid origin of an organism, particularly in cases potentially involving wide-ranging species in areas where deep phylogeographic structure is likely.",

To enable the rigorous analysis of such variants, multiple high quality and contiguous genome assemblies are essential. Similarly, while genome assemblies based on short reads have made genomics accessible for non-reference species, these assemblies have limitations due to low contiguity. Long-read sequencers and long-read technologies have ushered in a new era of genome sequencing where the lengths of reads exceed those of most repeats. However, because these technologies are not only costly, but also time and compute intensive, it has been unclear how scalable they are. Here we demonstrate a fast and cost effective reference assembly for an Arabidopsis thaliana accession using the USB-sized Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer and typical consumer computing hardware (4 Cores, 16Gb RAM). We assemble the accession KBS-Mac-74 into 62 contigs with an N50 length of 12.3 Mb covering 100% (119 Mb) of the non-repetitive genome. We demonstrate that the polished KBS-Mac-74 assembly is highly contiguous with BioNano optical genome maps, and of high per-base quality against a likewise polished Pacific Biosciences long-read assembly.

    "abstract": "The rice XA21-mediated immune response is activated upon recognition of the RaxX peptide produced by the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The 60 residue RaxX precursor is posttranslationally modified to form a sulfated tyrosine peptide that shares sequence and functional similarity with the plant sulfated tyrosine (PSY) peptide hormones. The five kb raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster of Xoo encodes RaxX, the RaxST tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase, and the RaxA and RaxB components of a predicted type one secretion system. The identified the complete raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster is present only in Xanthomonas spp., in five distinct lineages in addition to X. oryzae. The phylogenetic distribution of the raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster is consistent with the occurrence of multiple lateral transfer events during Xanthomonas speciation. RaxX variants representing each of the five lineages, and three Xoo RaxX variants, fail to activate the XA21-mediated immune response yet retain peptide hormone activity. These RaxX variants contain a restricted set of missense mutations, consistent with the hypothesis that selection acts to maintain peptide hormone-like function. These observations are also consistent with the hypothesis that the XA21 receptor evolved specifically to recognize Xoo RaxX.",

    "abstract": "While weight-bearing and resistive exercise modestly increases aBMD, the precise relationship between physical activity and bone microstructure, and strain in humans is not known. Previously, we established a voluntary upper-extremity loading model that assigns a persons target force based on their subject-specific, continuum FE-estimated radius bone strain. Here, our purpose was to quantify the inter-individual variability in radius microstructure and FE-estimated strain explained by site-specific mechanical loading history, and to determine whether variability in strain is captured by aBMD, a clinically relevant measure of bone density and fracture risk. Seventy-two women aged 21-40 were included in this cross-sectional analysis. High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) was used to measure macro- and micro-structure in the distal radius. Mean energy equivalent strain in the distal radius was calculated from continuum finite element models generated from clinical resolution CT images of the forearm. Areal BMD was used in a nonlinear regression model to predict FE strain. Hierarchical linear regression models were used to assess the predictive capability of intrinsic (age, height) and modifiable (body mass, grip strength, physical activity) predictors. Fifty-one percent of the variability in FE bone strain was explained by its relationship with aBMD, with higher density predicting lower strains. Age and height explained up to 31.6% of the variance in microstructural parameters. Body mass explained 9.1% and 10.0% of the variance in aBMD and bone strain, respectively, with higher body mass indicative of greater density. Overall, results suggest that meaningful differences in bone structure and strain can be predicted by subject characteristics.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAreal bone mineral density (aBMD) explains 51% of the variability in bone strain.\\nC_LIO_LIAdult bone loading predicts greater cortical porosity and trabecular density.\\nC_LIO_LIGreater body mass predicts greater aBMD and lower bone strain.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDecitabine is a deoxycytidine nucleoside derivative inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases, which has been studied extensively and is approved for myelodysplastic syndrome in adults but with less focus in children. Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints.\\n\\nResultsTwenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A, 14 in Arm B). All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia. Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data. Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms. MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients. DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21. Unlike end-point marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, one week prior to the patients marrow aspirate confirming non-response. Decitabine-induced effects of end-induction marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation and gene expression comparison with matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates.\\n\\nConclusionsThis first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML. Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations. The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission. Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01177540.",

    "abstract": "We project the long term incidence of Zika virus disease (ZVD) under varying hazards of infection and consider how the age-distribution of disease burden varies between these scenarios. Pathogens with age-structured disease outcomes, such as rubella and Zika virus, require that management decisions consider their impact not only on total disease incidence but also on distribution of disease burden within a population. In some cases, reductions of overall transmission can have the paradoxical effect of increasing the incidence of severe disease despite decreasing the total incidence. This happens because of corresponding increases in the average age of infection. Beginning with the current population structure and demographic rates of Brazil, we project forward total ZVD burden as measured by cases occurring in pregnant women and document the scenarios under which a paradox of control for Zika management emerges. We conclude that while a paradox of control can occur for ZVD, the higher total costs from increasing the average age of infection will only be realized after several decades and vanish under conservative discounting of future costs. This indicates that managers faced with an emerging pathogen should prioritize current disease incidence over potential increases in severe disease outcomes in the endemic state.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe intuitive response to an emerging outbreak is to halt, or at least reduce, transmission. However, in some circumstances, reducing overall transmission and incidence may be counterproductive from a public health perspective as public health interventions affect both the total level and the distribution of disease burden. We consider the scenarios under which reducing transmission of an emerging pathogen such as Zika virus may increase the costs associated with disease in the most vulnerable segments of the population - in this case, reproductive-age women. We conclude that after applying standard discounting rates to future cases, the \\\"paradox of control\\\" vanishes and reducing hazard of infection uniformly reduces the total costs associated with severe disease.",

    "abstract": "The latent period is a crucial life history trait, particularly for polycyclic plant diseases, because it determines how many complete monocycles could theoretically occur during an epidemic. Many empirical studies have focused on the variation of the latent period with pathogen or host genotype, or changes in response to environmental factors. The focus on these aspects is unsurprising, as these factors classically form the three parts of the epidemiological triangle. Experiments in controlled conditions are generally used to assess pathogenicity and host susceptibility, and also provide the opportunity to measure the distribution of latent periods in epidemiological systems. Once estimated for one or several pairs of host-pathogen genotypes, the mean value of this important trait is usually considered to be fixed and is often used \\\"as is\\\" in epidemiological models. We show here that the latent period can display non-negligible variability over the course of a disease epidemic, and that this variability has multiple sources, some of which have complex, antagonistic impacts. We develop arguments for four sources of variation that challenge the implicit assumption that the latent period remains constant: daily fluctuations in leaf temperature, nature of inoculum, host stage or age of host tissues, intra-population competition and selection for aggressiveness traits. We focus on the wheat fungal disease Septoria tritici blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici), making use of empirical datasets collected during the first authors own research projects and a targeted literature review. Such empirical epidemiological knowledge is new and potentially important for modelers. While some studies have demonstrated that the distribution of latent periods around the mean value has consequences for epidemiological dynamics, we show that it might also be important for epidemiological modelers to account for changes in this mean value during an annual epidemic. These results may be of critical importance for improving outbreak forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Recently Wieners causality theorem, which states that one variable could be regarded as the cause of another if the ability to predict the future of the second variable is enhanced by implementing information about the preceding values of the first variable, was linked to information theory through the development of a novel metric called  transfer entropy. Intuitively, transfer entropy can be conceptualized as a model-free measure of directed information flow from one variable to another. In contrast, directionality of information flow is not reflected in traditional measures of association which are completely symmetric by design. Although information theoretic approaches have been applied before in epidemiology, their value for inferring causality from observational studies is still unknown. Therefore, in the present study we use a set of simulation experiments, reflecting the most classical and widely used epidemiological observational study design, to validate the application of transfer entropy in epidemiological research. Moreover, we illustrate the practical applicability of this information theoretic approach to  real-world epidemiological data by demonstrating that transfer entropy is able to extract the correct direction of information flow from longitudinal data concerning two well-known associations, i.e. that between smoking and lung cancer and that between obesity and diabetes risk. In conclusion, our results provide proof-of-concept that the recently developed transfer entropy method could be a welcome addition to the epidemiological armamentarium, especially to dissect those situations in which there is a well-described association between two variables but no clear-cut inclination as to the directionality of the association.",

In 2014, a population-based cross-sectional study was performed in two previously trachoma-endemic areas of The Gambia. Participants of all ages from Lower River Region (LRR) (N = 1028) and Upper River Region (URR) (N = 840) underwent examination for trachoma and had blood collected for detection of antibodies against the Ct antigen Pgp3, by ELISA. Overall, 30 (1.6%) individuals had active trachoma; the prevalence in children aged 1-9 years was 3.4% (25/742) with no statistically significant difference in prevalence between the regions. There was a significant difference in overall seroprevalence by region: 26.2% in LRR and 17.1% in URR (p<0.0001). In children 1-9 years old, seroprevalence was 4.4% in LRR and 3.9% in URR. Reversible catalytic models using information on age-specific seroprevalence demonstrated a decrease in the transmission of Ct infection in both regions, possibly reflecting the impact of improved access to water, health and sanitation as well as mass drug administration campaigns. Serological testing for antibodies to Ct antigens is potentially useful for trachoma programmes, but consideration should be given to the coendemicity of sexually transmitted Ct infections.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is limited information about the role of different age groups, particularly subgroups of school-age children and younger adults in propagating influenza epidemics.\\n\\nMethodsFor a communicable disease outbreak, some subpopulations may play a disproportionate role during the ascent of the outbreak due to increased susceptibility and/or contact rates. Such subpopulations can be identified by considering the proportion that cases in a subpopulation represent among all cases in the population occurring before the epidemic peak (Bp), the corresponding proportion after the epidemic peak (Ap), to calculate the relative risk for a subpopulation, RR=Bp/Ap. We estimated RR for several age groups using data on reported influenza A cases in Germany between 2002-2017.\\n\\nResultsChildren aged 14-17y had the highest RR estimates for 7 out of 15 influenza A epidemics in the data, including the 2009 pandemic, and the large 2016/17, 2008/09, and 2006/07 seasons. Children aged 10-13y had the highest RR estimates during 3 epidemics, including the large 2014/15 and 2004/05 seasons. Children aged 6-9y had the highest RR estimates during two epidemics, including the large 2012/13 season. Children aged 2-5y had the highest RR estimate during the moderate 2015/16 season; adults aged 18-24y had the highest RR estimate during the small 2005/06 season; adults aged 25-34y had the highest RR estimate during the large, 2002/03 season.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results support the prominent role of all school-age children, particularly the oldest ones, in propagating influenza epidemics in the community.

    "abstract": "It is not clear why central nervous system (CNS) axons lose their intrinsic ability to regenerate with maturity, whilst peripheral (PNS) axons do not. A key difference between these neuronal types is their ability to transport integrins into axons. Integrins can mediate PNS regeneration, but are excluded from adult CNS axons along with their rab11 positive carriers. We reasoned that this exclusion might contribute to the intrinsic inability of CNS neurons to regenerate, and investigated this hypothesis using laser axotomy. We identify a novel regulator of selective axon transport and regeneration, the ARF6 GEF EFA6. EFA6 exerts its effects from a previously unreported location within the axon initial segment (AIS). EFA6 does not localise here in DRG axons, and in these neurons, ARF activation is counteracted by an ARF-GAP which is absent from the CNS, ACAP1. Depleting EFA6 from cortical neurons permits endosomal integrin transport and enhances regeneration, whilst overexpressing EFA6 prevents DRG regeneration. Our results demonstrate that ARF6 is an intrinsic regulator of regenerative capacity, implicating EFA6 as a focal molecule linking the axon initial segment, signalling and transport.\\n\\nSummary StatementWe identify a novel resident of the axon initial segment, EFA6. This functions to prevent growth-promoting molecules from entering mature CNS axons. Removing EFA6 elevates the axons regenerative potential.",

    "abstract": "Life is perpetuated through a single-cell bottleneck between generations in many organisms. Here, I highlight that this cell holds information in two distinct forms: in the linear DNA sequence that is replicated during cell divisions, and in the three-dimensional arrangement of molecules that can change during development but that is recreated at the start of each generation. These two interdependent stores of information - one replicating with each cell division and the other cycling with a period of one generation - coevolve while perpetuating an organism. Unlike the genome, the cycling arrangement of molecules, which could include RNAs, proteins, sugars, lipids, etc., is not well understood. Because this arrangement and the genome are together transmitted from one generation to the next, analysis of both is necessary to understand evolution, origins of inherited diseases, and consequences of genome engineering. Recent developments suggest that tools are in place to examine how all the information to build an organism is encoded within a single cell, and how this cell code is reproduced in every generation.",

    "abstract": "The goal of lineage tracing is to understand body formation over time by discovering which cells are the progeny of a specific, identified, ancestral progenitor. Subsidiary questions include unequivocal identification of what they have become, how many descendants develop, whether they live or die, and where they are located in the tissue or body at the end of the window examined. A classical approach in experimental embryology, lineage tracing continues to be used in developmental biology, stem cell and cancer research, wherever cellular potential and behavior need to be studied in multiple dimensions, of which one is time. Each technical approach has its advantages and drawbacks. This chapter, with some previously unpublished data, will concentrate non-exclusively on the use of interspecies chimeras to explore the origins of perivascular (or mural) cells, of which those adjacent to the vascular endothelium are termed pericytes for this purpose. These studies laid the groundwork for our understanding that pericytes derive from progenitor mesenchymal pools of multiple origins in the vertebrate embryo, some of which persist into adulthood. The results obtained through xenografting, like in the methodology described here, complement those obtained through genetic lineage tracing techniques within a given species.",

Yet sequence variants could affect traits differently depending on whether they are inherited from the mother or the father. To explore this possibility, we studied 21 quantitative phenotypes in a large Hutterite pedigree. We first identified variants with significant single parent (maternal-only or paternal-only) effects, and then used a novel statistical model to identify variants with opposite parental effects. Overall, we identified parent of origin effects (POEs) on 11 phenotypes, most of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Many of the loci with POEs have features of imprinted regions and many of the variants with POE are associated with the expression of nearby genes. Overall, our results indicate that POEs, which are often opposite in direction, are relatively common in humans, have potentially important clinical effects, and will be missed in traditional GWAS.",

    "abstract": "Pathway transplantation from one organism to another represents a means to a more complete understanding of a biochemical or regulatory process. The purine biosynthesis pathway, a core metabolic function, was transplanted from human to yeast. We replaced the entire Saccharomyces cerevisiae adenine de novo pathway with the cognate human pathway components. A yeast strain was \\\"humanized\\\" for the full pathway by deleting all relevant yeast genes completely and then providing the human pathway in trans using a neochromosome expressing the human protein coding regions under the transcriptional control of their cognate yeast promoters and terminators. The \\\"humanized\\\" yeast strain grows in the absence of adenine, indicating complementation of the yeast pathway by the full set of human proteins. While the strain with the neochromosome is indeed prototrophic, it grows slowly in the absence of adenine. Dissection of the phenotype revealed that the human ortholog of ADE4, PPAT, shows only partial complementation. We have used several strategies to understand this phenotype, that point to PPAT/ADE4 as the central regulatory node. Pathway metabolites are responsible for regulating PPATs protein abundance through transcription and proteolysis as well as its enzymatic activity by allosteric regulation in these yeast cells. Extensive phylogenetic analysis of PPATs from diverse organisms hints at adaptations of the enzyme-level regulation to the metabolite levels in the organism. Finally, we isolated specific mutations in PPAT as well as in other genes involved in the purine metabolic network that alleviate incomplete complementation by PPAT and provide further insight into the complex regulation of this critical metabolic pathway.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection is considered to be the main process that drives biological evolution. It requires selected entities to originate dependent upon one another by the means of reproduction or copying, and for the progeny to inherit the qualities of their ancestors. However, natural selection is a manifestation of a more general persistence principle, whose temporal consequences we propose to name \\\"stability-based sorting\\\" (SBS). Sorting based on static stability, i.e., SBS in its strict sense and usual conception, favours characters that increase the persistence of their holders and act on all material and immaterial entities. Sorted entities could originate independently from each other, are not required to propagate and need not exhibit heredity. Natural selection is a specific form of SBS--sorting based on dynamic stability. It requires some form of heredity and is based on competition for the largest difference between the speed of generating its own copies and their expiration. SBS in its strict sense and selection thus have markedly different evolutionary consequences that are stressed in this paper. In contrast to selection, which is opportunistic, SBS is able to accumulate even momentarily detrimental characters that are advantageous for the long-term persistence of sorted entities. However, it lacks the amplification effect based on the preferential propagation of holders of advantageous characters. Thus, it works slower than selection and normally is unable to create complex adaptations. From a long-term perspective, SBS is a decisive force in evolution--especially macroevolution. SBS offers a new explanation for numerous evolutionary phenomena, including broad distribution and persistence of sexuality, altruistic behaviour, horizontal gene transfer, patterns of evolutionary stasis, planetary homeostasis, increasing ecosystem resistance to disturbances, and the universal decline of disparity in the evolution of metazoan lineages. SBS acts on all levels in all biotic and abiotic systems. It could be the only truly universal evolutionary process, and an explanatory framework based on SBS could provide new insight into the evolution of complex abiotic and biotic systems.",

In order to fluently derive meaning, a listener must integrate contextual information to guide interpretations of the sensory input. While many studies have demonstrated the influence of prior context, the neural mechanisms supporting the integration of subsequent information remain unknown. Using magnetoencephalography, we analysed responses to spoken words with a varyingly ambiguous onset phoneme, the identity of which is later disambiguated at the lexical uniqueness point1. Our results uncover a three-level processing network. Subphonemic detail is preserved in primary auditory cortex over long timescales, and re-evoked at subsequent phoneme positions. Commitments to phonological categories occur in parallel, resolving on the shorter time-scale of ~450 ms. Finally, predictions are formed over likely lexical items. These findings provide evidence that future input determines the perception of earlier speech sounds by maintaining sensory features until they can be optimally integrated with top-down information.",

    "abstract": "The precision of multisensory heading perception improves when visual and vestibular cues arising from the same cause, namely motion of the observer through a stationary environment, are integrated. Thus, in order to determine how the cues should be processed, the brain must infer the causal relationship underlying the multisensory cues. In heading perception, however, it is unclear whether observers follow the Bayesian strategy, a simpler non-Bayesian heuristic, or even perform causal inference at all. We developed an efficient and robust computational framework to perform Bayesian model comparison of causal inference strategies, which incorporates a number of alternative assumptions about the observers. With this framework, we investigated whether human observers performance in an explicit cause attribution and an implicit heading discrimination task can be modeled as a causal inference process. In the explicit inference task, all subjects accounted for cue disparity when reporting judgments of common cause, although not necessarily all in a Bayesian fashion. By contrast, but in agreement with previous findings, data from the heading discrimination task only could not rule out that several of the same observers were adopting a forced-fusion strategy, whereby cues are integrated regardless of disparity. Only when we combined evidence from both tasks we were able to rule out forced-fusion in the heading discrimination task. Crucially, findings were robust across a number of variants of models and analyses. Our results demonstrate that our proposed computational framework allows researchers to ask complex questions within a rigorous Bayesian framework that accounts for parameter and model uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "The sounds of all languages are described by a finite set of symbols, which are extracted from the continuum of sounds produced by the vocal organ. How the discrete phonemic identity is encoded in the continuous movements producing speech remains an open question for the experimental phonology. In this work, this question is assessed by using Hall-effect transducers and magnets -mounted on the tongue, lips and jaw- to track the kinematics of the oral tract during the vocalization of vowel-consonant-vowel structures. Using a threshold strategy, the time traces of the transducers were converted into discrete motor coordinates unambiguously associated with the vocalized phonemes. Furthermore, the signals of the transducers combined with the discretization strategy were used to drive a low-dimensional vocal model capable of synthesizing intelligible speech. The current work not only addressed a relevant inquiry of the biology of language, but also shows the performance of the experimental technique to monitor the displacement of the main articulators of the vocal tract while speaking. This novel electronic device represents an economic and portable option to the standard system used to study the vocal tract movements.",

    "abstract": "Above-ground biomass production is a key target for studies of crop abiotic stress tolerance, disease resistance and yield improvement. However, biomass is slow and laborious to evaluate in the field using traditional destructive methods. High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) is widely promoted as a potential solution that can rapidly and non-destructively assess plant traits by exploiting advances in sensor and computing technology. A key potential application of HTP is for quantitative genetics studies that identify loci where allelic variation is associated with variation in crop production. And, the value of performing such studies in the field, where environmental conditions match that of production farming, is recognized. To date, HTP of biomass productivity in field trials has largely focused on expensive and complex methods, which - even if successful - will limit their use to a subset of wealthy research institutions and companies with extensive research infrastructure and highly-trained personnel. Even with investment in ground vehicles, aerial vehicles and gantry systems ranging from thousands to millions of dollars, there are very few examples where Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) detected by HTP of biomass production in a field-grown crop are shown to match QTLs detected by direct measures of biomass traits by destructive harvest techniques. Until such proof of concept for HTP proxies is generated it is unlikely to replace existing technology and be widely adopted. Therefore, there is a need for methods that can be used to assess crop performance by small teams with limited training and at field sites that are remote or have limited infrastructure. Here we use an inexpensive and simple, miniaturized system of hemispherical imaging and light attenuation modeling to identify the same set of key QTLs for biomass production as traditional destructive harvest methods applied to a field-grown Setaria mapping population. This provides a case study of a HTP technology that can deliver results for QTL mapping without high costs or complexity.",

    "abstract": "A central challenge in biology is to understand how innate behaviors evolve between closely related species. One way to elucidate how differences arise is to compare the development of behavior in species with distinct adult traits. Here, we report that Peromyscus polionotus is strikingly precocious with regard to burrowing behavior, but not other behaviors, compared to its sister species P. maniculatus. In P. polionotus, burrows were excavated as early as 17 days of age, while P. maniculatus did not build burrows until 10 days later. Moreover, the well-known differences in burrow architecture between adults of these species--P. polionotus adults excavate long burrows with an escape tunnel, while P. maniculatus dig short, single-tunnel burrows--were intact in juvenile burrowers. To test whether this juvenile behavior is influenced by early-life environment, pups of both species were reciprocally cross-fostered. Fostering did not alter the characteristic burrowing behavior of either species, suggesting these differences are genetic. In backcross F2 hybrids, we show that precocious burrowing and adult tunnel length are genetically correlated, and that a single P. polionotus allele in a genomic region linked to adult tunnel length is predictive of precocious burrow construction. The co-inheritance of developmental and adult traits indicates the same genetic region--either a single gene with pleiotropic effects, or closely linked genes-- acts on distinct aspects of the same behavior across life stages. Such genetic variants likely affect behavioral drive (i.e. motivation) to burrow, and thereby affect both the development and adult expression of burrowing behavior.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIJuvenile P. polionotus construct burrows precociously compared to its sister species P. maniculatus\\nC_LIO_LICross-fostering does not alter species-specific burrowing behavior\\nC_LIO_LIA QTL linked to adult tunnel length predicts developmental onset of burrow construction in hybrids\\nC_LIO_LIPleiotropic genetic variant(s) may affect behavioral drive across life stages\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe haploid mammalian Y chromosome is usually under-represented in genome assemblies due to high repeat content and low depth due to its haploid nature. One strategy to ameliorate the low coverage of Y sequences is to experimentally enrich Y-specific material before assembly. Since the enrichment process is imperfect, algorithms are needed to identify putative Y-specific reads prior to downstream assembly. A strategy that uses k-mer abundances to identify such reads was used to assemble the gorilla Y (Tomaszkiewicz et al 2016). However, the strategy required the manual setting of key parameters, a time-consuming process leading to sub-optimal assemblies.\\n\\nResultsWe develop a method, RecoverY, that selects Y-specific reads by automatically choosing the abundance level at which a k-mer is deemed to originate from the Y. This algorithm uses prior knowledge about the Y chromosome of a related species or known Y transcript sequences. We evaluate RecoverY on both simulated and real data, for human and gorilla, and investigate its robustness to important parameters. We show that RecoverY leads to a vastly superior assembly compared to alternate strategies of filtering the reads or contigs. Compared to the preliminary strategy used in Tomaszkiewicz et al (2016), we achieve a 33% improvement in assembly size and a 20% improvement in the NG50, demonstrating the power of automatic parameter selection.\\n\\nAvailabilityOur tool RecoverY is freely available at https://github.com/makovalab-psu/RecoverY\\n\\nContactkmakova@bx.psu.edu, pashadag@cse.psu.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationAttached as an additional file.",

    "abstract": "Maternal investment is likely to have direct effects on offspring survival. In oviparous animals whose embryos are exposed to the external environment, maternal provisioning of molecular factors like mRNAs and proteins may help embryos cope with sudden changes in the environment. Here we sought to modify the maternal mRNA contribution to offspring embryos and test for maternal effects on acute thermal tolerance in early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. We drove in vivo overexpression of a small heat shock protein gene (Hsp23) in female ovaries and measured the effects of acute thermal stress on offspring embryonic survival and larval development. We report that overexpression of the Hsp23 gene in female ovaries produced offspring embryos with increased thermal tolerance. We also found that brief heat stress in the early embryonic stage (0 to 1 hour-old) caused decreased larval performance later in life (5 to 10 days-old), as indexed by pupation height, as well as increased development time to pupation.

    "abstract": "Recent efforts in systems immunology lead researchers to build quantitative models of cell activation and differentiation. One goal is to account for the distributions of proteins from single-cell measurements by flow cytometry or mass cytometry as a readout of biological regulation. In that context, large cell-to-cell variability is often observed in biological quantities. We show here that these readouts, viewed in logarithmic scale may result in two easily-distinguishable modes, while the underlying distribution (in linear scale) is unimodal. We introduce a simple mathematical test to highlight this mismatch. We then dissect the flow of influence of cell-to-cell variability proposing a graphical model which motivates higher-dimensional analysis of the data. Finally we show how acquiring additional biological information can be used to reduce uncertainty introduced by cell-to-cell variability, helping to clarify whether the data is uni- or bimodal. This communication has cautionary implications for manual and automatic gating strategies, as well as clustering and modeling of single-cell measurements.",

    "abstract": "Microbes are critical in carbon and nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems. Members of the Verrucomicrobia are ubiquitous in such systems, yet their roles and ecophysiology are not well understood. In this study, we recovered 19 Verrucomicrobia draft genomes by sequencing 184 time-series metagenomes from a eutrophic lake and a humic bog that differ in carbon source and nutrient availabilities. These genomes span four of the seven previously defined Verrucomicrobia subdivisions, and greatly expand the known genomic diversity of freshwater Verrucomicrobia. Genome analysis revealed their potential role as (poly)saccharide-degraders in freshwater, uncovered interesting genomic features for this life style, and suggested their adaptation to nutrient availabilities in their environments. Between the two lakes, Verrucomicrobia populations differ significantly in glycoside hydrolase gene abundance and functional profiles, reflecting the autochthonous and terrestrially-derived allochthonous carbon sources of the two ecosystems respectively. Interestingly, a number of genomes recovered from the bog contained gene clusters that potentially encode a novel porin-multiheme cytochrome c complex and might be involved in extracellular electron transfer in the anoxic humic-rich environment. Notably, most epilimnion genomes have large numbers of so-called \\\"Planctomycete-specific\\\" cytochrome c-containing genes, which exhibited nearly opposite distribution patterns with glycoside hydrolase genes, probably associated with the different environmental oxygen availability and carbohydrate complexity between lakes/layers. Overall, the recovered genomes are a major step towards understanding the role, ecophysiology and distribution of Verrucomicrobia in freshwater.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEFreshwater Verrucomicrobia are cosmopolitan in lakes and rivers, yet their roles and ecophysiology are not well understood, as cultured freshwater Verrucomicrobia are restricted to one subdivision of this phylum. Here, we greatly expand the known genomic diversity of this freshwater lineage by recovering 19 Verrucomicrobia draft genomes from 184 metagenomes collected from a eutrophic lake and a humic bog across multiple years. Most of these genomes represent first freshwater representatives of several Verrucomicrobia subdivisions. Genomic analysis revealed Verrucomicrobia as potential (poly)saccharide-degraders, and suggested their adaptation to carbon source of different origins in the two contrasting ecosystems. We identified putative extracellular electron transfer genes and so-called \\\"Planctomycete-specific\\\" cytochrome c-containing genes, and found their distinct distribution patterns between the lakes/layers. Overall, our analysis greatly advances the understanding of the function, ecophysiology and distribution of freshwater Verrucomicrobia, while highlighting their potential role in freshwater carbon cycling.",

Here, we consider key conceptual issues that have impeded progress in our understanding of hippocampal function, and we review findings that establish the scope and limits of hippocampal involvement in navigation and memory. We argue that space and time serve as a primary scaffold to break up experiences into specific contexts, and to organize multimodal input that is to be associated within a context. However, the hippocampus is clearly capable of incorporating additional dimensions into the scaffold if they are determined to be relevant in the event-defined context. Conceiving of the hippocampal representation as constrained by immediate task demands--yet preferring axes that involve space and time--helps to reconcile an otherwise disparate set of findings on the core function of the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "The left and right rodent hippocampi exhibit striking lateralization in some of the very neural substrates considered to be critical for hippocampal cognitive function. Despite this, there is an overwhelming lack of consideration for hemispheric differences in studies of the rodent hippocampus. Asymmetries identified so far suggest that a bilateral model of the hippocampus will be essential for an understanding of this brain region, and perhaps of the brain more widely. Although hypotheses have been proposed to explain how the left and right hippocampi contribute to behavior and cognition, these hypotheses have either been refuted by more recent studies or have been limited in the scope of data they explain. Here, I will first review data on human and rodent hippocampal lateralization. The implications of these data suggest that considering the hippocampus as a bilateral structure with functional lateralization will be critical moving forward in understanding the function and mechanisms of this brain region. In exploring these implications, I will then propose a hypothesis of the hippocampus as a bilateral structure. This discrete-continuous (DC) hypothesis proposes that the left and right hippocampi contribute to spatial memory and navigation in a complementary manner. Specifically, the left hemisphere stores spatial information as discrete, salient locations and that the right hemisphere represents space continuously, contributing to route computation and flexible spatial navigation. Consideration of hippocampal lateralization in designing future studies may provide insight into the function of the hippocampus and resolve debates concerning its function.",

    "abstract": "Intracranial recordings from patients implanted with depth electrodes are a valuable source of information in cognitive neuroscience. They allow for the unique opportunity to record brain activity with a high spatial and temporal resolution. To extract the local signal of interest in stereotactic EEG (S-EEG) data, a common pre-processing choice is to re-reference the data with a bipolar montage.\\n\\nWith bipolar reference, each channel is subtracted from its neighbour in order to reduce commonalities between channels and isolate activity that is spatially confined. We here challenge the assumption that bipolar reference can effectively perform this task. We argue that in order to extract local activity, the distribution of the signal source of interest, as well as the distribution of interfering distant signals and noise sources need to be considered. Those can have a variable spatial extent and are modulated by electrode spacing, location and anatomical characteristics. Those factors are not accounted for by a fixed referencing scheme and bipolar reference can therefore not only decrease the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the data, but also lead to mislocalization of activity and consequently to misinterpretation of results.\\n\\nWe promote the perspective of regarding referencing as a spatial filtering operation with fixed coefficients. As an alternative, we propose to use Independent Component Analysis (ICA), to derive filter coefficients that reflect the statistical dependencies of the data at hand. We argue that ICA performs the same task that bipolar referencing pursues, namely undoing the linear superposition of activity and can therefore be used to identify activity that is local. We first describe and demonstrate this procedure on human S-EEG recordings. In a simulation with real data, we then quantitatively show that ICA outperforms the bipolar referencing operation in sensitivity and importantly in specificity when it comes to revealing local time series from the superposition of neighbouring channels.",

    "abstract": "The ability to adapt behavior to environmental fluctuations is critical for survival of organisms ranging from invertebrates to mammals. Caenorhabditis elegans can learn to avoid sodium chloride when it is paired with starvation. This behavior is likely advantageous to avoid areas without food. While some genes have been implicated in this salt aversive learning behavior, critical genetic components, and the neural circuit in which they act, remain elusive. Here, we show that the sole worm ortholog of mammalian CaMKI/IV, CMK-1, is essential for salt aversive learning behavior in C. elegans. We find that CMK-1 acts in the primary salt-sensing ASE neurons to regulate this behavior. By characterizing the intracellular calcium dynamics in ASE neurons using microfluidics, we find that loss of cmk-1 leads to an altered pattern of sensory-evoked calcium responses that may underlie salt aversive learning. Our study implicates the conserved CaMKI/CMK-1 as an essential cell-autonomous regulator for behavioral plasticity to environmental salt in C. elegans.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLike other animals, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans depends on salt for survival and navigates toward high concentrations of this essential mineral. Because salt generates osmotic stress at high concentrations, it also threatens the survival of small terrestrial animals like C. elegans. A growing body of evidence indicates that C. elegans balances these factors through a process called salt aversive learning. We show that this behavior depends on expression of a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase, CMK-1, in the ASE salt sensing neurons and that salt-induced calcium signals in the ASE neurons are less sensitive to salt conditioning in animals lacking CMK-1 function. Our study identifies CMK-1 and sensory neurons as key factors in this form of behavioral plasticity.",

This mechanism could be used, for example, to rapidly disseminate a genetic payload through a population, promising novel strategies for the control of vector-borne diseases. However, all CRISPR gene drives tested have produced significant quantities of resistance alleles that cannot be converted to drive alleles and would likely prevent these drives from spreading in a natural population. In this study, we assessed three strategies for reducing resistance allele formation. First, we directly compared drives with the nanos and vasa promoters, which showed that the vasa drive produced high levels of resistance alleles in somatic cells. This was not observed in the nanos drive. Another strategy was the addition of a second gRNA to the drive, which both significantly increased the drive conversion efficiency and reduced the formation rate of resistance alleles. Finally, to minimize maternal carryover of Cas9, we assessed the performance of an autosomal drive acting in the male germline, and found no subsequent formation of resistance alleles in embryos. Our results mark a step toward developing effective gene drives capable of functioning in natural populations and provide several possible avenues for further reduction of resistance rates.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can evoke illusory flash-like visual percepts known as phosphenes. The perception of phosphenes represents a major experimental challenge when studying tACS-induced effects on cognitive performance. Besides growing concerns that retinal phosphenes themselves could potentially have neuromodulatory effects, the perception of phosphenes may also modify the alertness of participants. Past research has shown that stimulation intensity, frequency and electrode montage affect phosphene perception. However, to date, the effect of an additional tACS parameter on phosphene perception has been completely overlooked: the relative phase difference between stimulation electrodes. This is a crucial and timely topic given the confounding nature of phosphene perception and the increasing number of studies reporting changes in cognitive function following tACS phase manipulations. However, studying phosphene perception for different frequencies and phases simultaneously is not tractable using standard approaches, as the physiologically plausible range of parameters results in a combinatorial explosion of experimental conditions, yielding impracticable experiment durations. To overcome this limitation, here we applied a Bayesian optimization approach to efficiently sample an exhaustive tACS parameter space. Moreover, unlike conventional methodology, which involves subjects judging the perceived phosphene intensity on a rating scale, our study leveraged the strength of human perception by having the optimization driven based on a subjects relative judgement. Applying Bayesian optimization for two different montages, we found that phosphene perception was affected by differences in the relative phase between cortical electrodes. The results were replicated in a second study involving new participants and validated using computational modelling. In summary, our results have important implications for the experimental design and conclusions drawn from future tACS studies investigating the effects of phase on cognition.",

Although most astrocytes appeared dormant during time-lapse calcium imaging, a subgroup displayed persistent, rhythmic oscillating calcium activity. These active astrocytes formed a subnetwork within the respiratory network distinct from the neuronal network. Activation of exogenous MrgA1 receptors expressed in astrocytes tripled their calcium oscillation frequency activity in both the preBotzinger complex and pFRG/RTN. However, neurons in the preBotC were unaffected, whereas neuronal calcium oscillatory frequency in pFRG/RTN doubled. Notably, astrocyte activation in pFRG/RTN triggered local PGE2 release and blunted the hypercapnic response.
