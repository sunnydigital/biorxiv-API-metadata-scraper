    "abstract": "Adult Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies were placed into one end of a tube near to repellents (benzaldehyde and heat) and away from the other end containing attractants (light and a favored temperature). They escaped from the repellents and went to the attractants. Five motile mutants that failed to do that were isolated. They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal sensory stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. The mutants, although motile, failed to respond to stimuli at both 34{degrees}C and at room temperature. Some of the mutants have been mapped. It is proposed that the information from the different sensory receptors comes together at an intermediate, called \\\"inbetween\\\" (Inbet), that brings about a behavioral response. The Boss is defined here.",

    "abstract": "We use an oligonucleotide library of over 10000 variants together with a synthetic biology approach to identify an insulation mechanism encoded within a subset of {sigma}54 promoters. Insulation manifests itself as dramatically reduced protein expression for a downstream gene that may be expressed by transcriptional read-through. The insulation we observe is strongly associated with the presence of short CT-rich motifs (3-5 bp), positioned within 25 bp upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motif of the silenced gene. We hypothesize that insulation is effected by binding of the RBS to the upstream CT-rich motif. We provide evidence to support this hypothesis using mutations to the CT-rich motif and gene expression measurements on multiple sequence variants. Modelling is also consistent with this hypothesis. We show that the strength of the silencing, effected by insulation, depends on the location and number of CT-rich motifs encoded within the promoters. Finally, we show that in E.coli these insulator sequences are preferentially encoded within {sigma}54 promoters as compared to other promoter types, suggesting a regulatory role for these sequences in natural contexts. Our findings suggest that context-related regulatory effects may often be due to sequence-specific interactions encoded sparsely by short motifs that are not easily detected by lower throughput studies. Such short sequence-specific phenomena can be uncovered with a focused OL design that filters out the sequence noise, as exemplified herein.",

    "abstract": "A number of image recognition systems have been specifically formulated for the individual recognition of large animals. These programs are versatile and can easily be adapted for the identification of smaller individuals such as insects. The Interactive Individual Identification System, I3S Classic, initially produced for the identification of individual whale sharks was employed to distinguish between different species of mosquitoes and bees, utilising the distinctive vein pattern present on insect wings. I3S Classic proved to be highly effective and accurate in identifying different species and sexes of mosquitoes and bees, with 80% to100% accuracy for the majority of the species tested. The sibling species Apis mellifera and Apis mellifera carnica were both identified with100% accuracy. Bombus terrestris terrestris and Bombus terrestris audax; were also identified and separated with high degrees of accuracy (90% to 100% respectively for the fore wings and 100% for the hind wings). When both Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto and Anopheles arabiensis were present in the database, they were identified with 94% and 100% accuracy respectively, allowing for a morphological and non-molecular method of sorting between these members of the sibling complex. Flat, not folded and entire, rather than broken, wing specimens were required for accurate identification. Only one wing image of each sex was required in the database to retrieve high levels of accurate results in the majority of species tested. The study describes how I3S was used to identify different insect species and draws comparisons with the use of the CO1 algorithm. As with CO1, I3S Classic proved to be suitable software which could reliably be used to aid the accurate identification of insect species. It is emphasised that image recognition for insect species should always be used in conjunction with other identifying characters in addition to the wings, as is the norm when identifying species using traditional taxonomic keys.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial and archaeal viruses (\\\"phages\\\") play an enormous role in global life cycles and have recently regained importance as therapeutic agents to fight serious infections by multi-resistant bacterial strains. Nevertheless, taxonomic classification of phages is up to now only insufficiently informed by genome sequencing. Despite thousands of publicly available phage genomes, it still needs to be investigated how this wealth of information can be used for the fast, universal and accurate classification of phages. The Genome BLAST Distance Phylogeny (GBDP) approach is a truly whole-genome method currently used for in silico DNA: DNA hybridization and phylogenetic inference from prokaryotic genomes. Based on the principles of phylogenetic systematics, we here established GBDP for phage phylogeny and classification, using the common subset of genome-sequenced and officially classified phages. Trees inferred with the best GBDP variants showed only few deviations from the official phage classification, which were uniformly due to incorrectly annotated GenBank entries. Except for low resolution at the family level, the majority of taxa was well supported as monophyletic. Clustering genome sequences with distance thresholds optimized for the agreement with the classification turned out to be phylogenetically reasonable. Accordingly modifying genera and species is taxonomically optional but would yield more uniform sequence divergence as well as stronger branch support. Analysing an expanded data set containing > 4000 phage genomes from public databases allowed for extrapolating regarding the number, composition and host specificity of future phage taxa. The selected methods are implemented in an easy-to-use web service \\\"VICTOR\\\" freely available at http://ggdc.dsmz.de/victor.php.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary biologists commonly assess the evolutionary advantage of an allele based on its effects on the lifetime survival and reproduction of individuals. However, alleles affecting traits like sex, evolvability, and cooperation can cause fitness effects that depend heavily on differences in the environmental, genetic, and social context of individuals carrying the allele. This variability makes it difficult to summarize the evolutionary fate of an allele based solely on its effects on any one individual. In this review we show how attempts to average over variability in the fitness effects of an allele can sometimes cause misleading results. We then describe a number of intriguing new evolutionary phenomena that have emerged in studies that explicitly model the fate of alleles that influence long-term lineage dynamics. We conclude with prospects for generalizations of population genetics theory and discuss how this theory might be applied to the evolution of infectious diseases.",

Here we present HTSvis, an R/Shiny open-source web application for interactive visualization and exploratory analysis of arrayed high-throughput data. Using a light-weight infrastructure suitable for desktop computers, HTSvis can be used to visualize raw data, perform quality control and interactively visualize screening results from single- to multi-channel measurements, such as image-based, screens. Input data can either be a result file obtained upon analysis with cellHTS or a generic table with raw or analyzed data from, e.g. a high-content microscopy screen.

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress induced by fluoride (F) is associated with fluorosis formation, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, Melatonin pretreatment suppressed F-induced hepatocyte injury in HepG2 cells. Melatonin increases the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD2) by enhancing sirtuin 3 (SIRT3)-mediated deacetylation and promotes SOD2 gene expression via SIRT3-regulated DNA-binding activity of forkhead box O3 (FoxO3a), indicating that melatonin markedly enhanced mROS scavenging in F-exposed HepG2 cells. Notably, melatonin activated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1). PGC-1 interacted with the estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERR) bound to the SIRT3 promoter, where it functions as a transcription factor to regulate SIRT3 expression. Furthermore, daily injection of melatonin for 30 days inhibited F-induced oxidative stress in mice liver, leading to improvement of liver function. Mechanistic study revealed that the protective effects of melatonin were associated with down-regulation of JNK1/2 phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our data suggest a novel role of melatonin in preventing F-induced oxidative stress through activation of the SIRT3 pathway.",

Current methods for discriminating lymphocyte cell types primarily relies on labelling techniques with magnetic beads or fluorescence agents, which take time and have costs for sample preparation and may also have a potential risk of altering cellular functions. Here, we present label-free identification of non-activated lymphocyte subtypes using refractive index tomography. From the measurements of three-dimensional refractive index maps of individual lymphocytes, the morphological and biochemical properties of the lymphocytes are quantitatively retrieved. Machine learning methods establish an optimized classification model using the retrieved quantitative characteristics of the lymphocytes to identify lymphocyte subtypes at the individual cell level. We show that our approach enables label-free identification of three lymphocyte cell types (B, CD4+ T, and CD8+ T lymphocytes) with high specificity and sensitivity. The present method will be a versatile tool for investigating the pathophysiological roles of lymphocytes in various diseases including cancers, autoimmune diseases, and virus infections.",

Furthermore, the performance of existing algorithms varies between samples and biotopes. Here, we present a dereplication, aggregation and scoring strategy, DAS Tool, that combines the strengths of a flexible set of established binning algorithms. DAS Tool applied to a constructed community generated more accurate bins than any automated method. Further, when applied to environmental and host-associated samples of different complexity, DAS Tool recovered substantially more near-complete genomes, including novel lineages, than any single binning method alone. The ability to reconstruct many near-complete genomes from metagenomics data will greatly advance genome-centric analyses of ecosystems.",

There are many practical difficulties associated with subjects smoking in the modern neuroscientific laboratory environment, however electronic cigarettes obviate many of these issues, and provide a close simulation of smoking tobacco cigarettes. We have examined the neural effects of  smoking electronic cigarettes with concurrent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The results demonstrate the feasibility of using these devices in the MRI environment, and show brain activation in a network of cortical (motor cortex, insula, cingulate, amygdala) and sub-cortical (putamen, thalamus, globus pallidus, cerebellum) regions. Concomitant relative deactivations were seen in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex. These results reveal the brain processes involved in (simulated) smoking for the first time, and validate a novel approach to the study of smoking, and addiction more generally.",

    "abstract": "Historically, evolutionary changes have been thought to act on much longer time scales than ecological dynamics. However, a recent body of research has demonstrated that evolution that is rapid enough to dramatically affect ecological dynamics can lead to feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes. Thus, to understand the stability of ecological communities, we must also consider evolutionary change in the component species. Here, we use individual-based simulations of a quantitative genetic eco-evolutionary model to describe how trait evolution influences the stability of ecological communities. On short time scales, faster evolutionary rates decreased the probability of species extinctions as populations at low densities were rescued via trait evolution. However, on longer time scales, evolutionary had little effect on the number of extinctions. The extent of short-term evolutionary rescue depended on the source of trait variation; populations with variation generated through mutation experienced more rescue events and were less prone to extinction, relative to populations with only standing trait variation. Trait evolution leading to more rescued populations increased the stability of the community on timescales relevant to conservation. Our work highlights the importance of intraspecific trait variation and the evolutionary mechanisms maintaining this variation for community ecology, as well as management of declining populations in a community context.",

    "abstract": "Pattern separation is a process that minimizes overlap between patterns of neuronal activity representing similar experiences. Theoretical work suggests that the dentate gyrus (DG) performs this role for memory processing but a direct demonstration is lacking. One limitation is the difficulty to measure DG inputs and outputs simultaneously. To rigorously assess pattern separation by DG circuitry, we used mouse brain slices to stimulate DG afferents and simultaneously record DG granule cells (GCs) and interneurons. Output spiketrains of GCs are more dissimilar than their input spiketrains, demonstrating for the first time temporal pattern separation at the level of single neurons in the DG. Pattern separation is larger in GCs than in fast-spiking interneurons and hilar mossy cells, and is amplified in CA3 pyramidal cells. Analysis of the neural noise and computational modelling suggest that this form of pattern separation is not explained by simple randomness and arises from specific presynaptic dynamics. Overall, by reframing the concept of pattern separation in dynamic terms and by connecting it to the physiology of different types of neurons, our study offers a new window of understanding in how hippocampal networks might support episodic memory.",

    "abstract": "Model-free learning creates stimulus-response associations. But what constitutes a stimulus? Are there limits to types of stimuli a model-free or habitual system can operate over? Most experiments on reward learning in humans and animals have used discrete sensory stimuli, but there is no algorithmic reason that model-free learning should be restricted to external stimuli, and recent theories have suggested that model-free processes may operate over highly abstract concepts and goals. Our study aimed to determine whether model-free learning processes can operate over environmental states defined by information held in working memory. Specifically, we tested whether or not humans can learn explicit temporal patterns of individually uninformative cues in a model-free manner. We compared the data from human participants in a reward learning paradigm using (1) a simultaneous symbol presentation condition or (2) a sequential symbol presentation condition, wherein the same visual stimuli were presented simultaneously or as a temporal sequence that required working memory. We found a significant effect of reward on human behavior in the sequential presentation condition, indicating that model-free learning can operate on information stored in working memory. Further analyses, however, revealed that the behavior of the participants contradicts the basic assumptions of our hypotheses, and it is possible that the observed effect of reward was generated by model-based rather than model-free learning. Thus it is not possible to draw any conclusions from out study regarding model-free learning of temporal sequences held in working memory. We conclude instead that careful thought should be given about how to best explain two-stage tasks to participants.",

To model fetal outcomes in nonhuman primates, we administered Asian-lineage ZIKV subcutaneously to four pregnant rhesus macaques. While non-pregnant animals clear viremia within 10-12 days, maternal viremia was prolonged in 3 of 4 pregnancies. Fetal head growth velocity in the last month of gestation determined by ultrasound assessment of head circumference was decreased in comparison with biparietal diameter and femur length within each fetus, both within normal range. ZIKV RNA was detected in tissues from all four fetuses at term cesarean section. In all pregnancies, neutrophilic infiltration was present at the maternal-fetal interface (decidua, placenta, fetal membranes), in various fetal tissues, and in fetal retina, choroid, and optic nerve (first trimester infection only). Consistent vertical transmission in this primate model may provide a platform to assess risk factors and test therapeutic interventions for interruption of fetal infection.",
