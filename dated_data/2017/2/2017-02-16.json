    "abstract": "Current evolutionary biology models usually assume that a phenotype undergoes gradual change. This is in stark contrast to biological intuition, which indicates that change can also be punctuated-the phenotype can jump. Such a jump can especially occur at speciation, i.e. dramatic change occurs that drives the species apart. Here we derive a Central Limit Theorem for punctuated equilibrium. We show that, if adaptation is fast, for weak convergence to hold, dramatic change has to be a rare event.\\n\\nAMS subject classification: 60F05, 60J70, 60J85, 62P10, 92B99",

    "abstract": "MotivationChromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is a widely used approach to study protein-DNA interactions. Often, the quantities of interest are the differential occupancies relative to controls, between genetic backgrounds, treatments, or combinations thereof. Current methods for differential occupancy of ChIP-seq data rely however on binning or sliding window techniques, for which the choice of the window and bin sizes are subjective.\\n\\nResultsHere, we present GenoGAM (Genome-wide Generalized Additive Model), which brings the well-established and flexible generalized additive models framework to genomic applications using a data parallelism strategy. We model ChIP-Seq read count frequencies as products of smooth functions along chromosomes. Smoothing parameters are objectively estimated from the data by cross-validation, eliminating ad-hoc binning and windowing needed by current approaches. GenoGAM provides base-level and region-level significance testing for full factorial designs. Application to a ChIP-Seq dataset in yeast showed increased sensitivity over existing differential occupancy methods while controlling for type I error rate. By analyzing a set of DNA methylation data and illustrating an extension to a peak caller, we further demonstrate the potential of GenoGAM as a generic statistical modeling tool for genome-wide assays.\\n\\nAvailabilitySoftware is available from Bioconductor: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenoGAM.html\\n\\nContactgagneur@in.tum.de\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary information is available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "ESCRT-III proteins have been implicated in sealing the nuclear envelope in mammals, spindle pole body dynamics in fission yeast, and surveillance of defective nuclear pore complexes in budding yeast. Here, we report that Lem2p (LEM2), a member of the LEM (Lap2-Emerin-Man1) family of inner nuclear membrane proteins, and the ESCRT-II/ESCRT-III hybrid protein Cmp7p (CHMP7), work together to recruit additional ESCRT-III proteins to holes in the nuclear membrane. In S. pombe, deletion of the ATPase vps4 leads to severe defects in nuclear morphology and integrity. These phenotypes are suppressed by loss-of-function mutations that arise spontaneously in lem2 or cmp7, implying that these proteins may function upstream in the same pathway. Building on these genetic interactions, we explored the role of LEM2 during nuclear envelope reformation in human cells. We found that CHMP7 and LEM2 enrich at the same region of the chromatin disc periphery during this window of cell division, and that CHMP7 can bind directly to the C-terminal domain of LEM2 in vitro. We further found that, during nuclear envelope formation, recruitment of the ESCRT factors CHMP7, CHMP2A and IST1/CHMP8 all depend on LEM2 in human cells. We conclude that Lem2p/LEM2 is a conserved nuclear site-specific adaptor that recruits Cmp7p/CHMP7 and downstream ESCRT factors to the nuclear envelope.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions can be stabilized against invasion by non-cooperative individuals by putting such \\\"cheaters\\\" at a selective disadvantage. Selection against cheaters should eliminate genetic variation in partner quality -- yet such variation is often found in natural populations. One explanation for this paradox is that mutualism outcomes are determined not only by responses to partner performance, but also by partner signals. Here, we build a model of coevolution in a symbiotic mutualism, in which hosts ability to sanction non-cooperative symbionts and recognition of symbiont signals are determined by separate loci, as are symbionts cooperation and expression of signals. In the model, variation persists without destabilizing the interaction, in part because coevolution of symbiont signals and host recognition is altered by the coevolution of sanctions and cooperation, and vice-versa. Individual-based simulations incorporating population structure strongly corroborate these results. The dual systems of sanctions and partner recognition converge toward conditions similar to some economic models of mutualistic symbiosis in which hosts offering the right incentives to potential symbionts can initiate symbiosis without screening for partner quality. These results predict that mutualists can maintain variation in recognition of partner signals or in the ability to sanction non-cooperators without destabilizing mutualism, and reinforce the notion that studies of mutualism should consider communication between partners as well as the exchange of benefits.",

However, the inference of the maternal allele inheritance in monogenic autosomal recessive disease is still challenging.

    "abstract": "To get a faculty job, graduating doctoral students have to substantially outperform their peers, given the competitive nature of the academic job market. In an ideal, meritocratic world, factors such as prestige of degree-granting university ought not to play a substantial role. However, it has recently been reported that top-ranked universities produced about 2-6 times more faculty than did universities that were ranked lower (Clauset, Arbesman, and Larremore 2015), necessitating un-meritocratic factors: how could students from top-ranked universities be six times more productive than their peers from lower-ranked universities? Here we present a signal detection model to demonstrate that substantially higher rates of faculty production need not require substantially (and unrealistically) higher levels of student productivity. Instead, it is a high hiring threshold due to keen competition that causes small difference in average student productivity between universities to result in manifold differences in placement rates. Under this framework, the previously reported results are compatible with a purely meritocratic system. As a simple proof of concept, we examined the association between university ranking and the impact factors of students publications from a small selected sample of psychology departments in the U.S. The results are in agreement with our theoretical model. Whereas these results do not necessarily mean that the actual faculty hiring market is purely meritocratic, they highlight the difficulty in empirically demonstrating that it is not so.",

    "abstract": "Using MRI to diagnose mental disorders has been a long-term goal. Despite this, the vast majority of prior neuroimaging work has been descriptive rather than predictive. The current study applies support vector machine (SVM) learning to MRI measures of brain white matter to classify adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and healthy controls. In a precisely matched group of individuals with MDD (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25), SVM learning accurately (70%) classified patients and controls across a brain map of white matter fractional anisotropy values (FA). The study revealed three main findings: 1) SVM applied to DTI derived FA maps can accurately classify MDD vs. healthy controls; 2) prediction is strongest when only right hemisphere white matter is examined; and 3) removing FA values from a region identified by univariate contrast as significantly different between MDD and healthy controls does not change the SVM accuracy. These results indicate that SVM learning applied to neuroimaging data can classify the presence versus absence of MDD and that predictive information is distributed across brain networks rather than being highly localized. Finally, MDD group differences revealed through typical univariate contrasts do not necessarily reveal patterns that provide accurate predictive information.",

    "abstract": "Some methods for demographic inference based on the observed genetic diversity of current populations rely on the use of summary statistics such as the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS). Demographic models can be either model-constrained with numerous parameters such as growth rates, timing of demographic events and migration rates, or model-flexible, with an unbounded collection of piecewise constant sizes. It is still debated whether demographic histories can be accurately inferred based on the SFS. Here we illustrate this theoretical issue on an example of demographic inference for an African population. The SFS of the Yoruba population (data from the 1000 Genomes Project) is fit to a simple model of population growth described with a single parameter (e.g., founding time). We infer a time to the most recent common ancestor of 1.7 million years for this population. However, we show that the Yoruba SFS is not informative enough to discriminate between several different models of growth. We also show that for such simple demographies, the fit of one-parameter models outperforms the model-flexible method recently developed by Liu and Fu. The use of this method on simulated data suggests that it is biased by the noise intrinsically present in the data.",

In this paper we analyze an important component of HTM, the HTM spatial pooler (SP). The SP models how neurons learn feedforward connections and form efficient representations of the input. It converts arbitrary binary input patterns into sparse distributed representations (SDRs) using a combination of competitive Hebbian learning rules and homeostatic excitability control. We describe a number of key properties of the spatial pooler, including fast adaptation to changing input statistics, improved noise robustness through learning, efficient use of cells and robustness to cell death. In order to quantify these properties we develop a set of metrics that can be directly computed from the spatial pooler outputs. We show how the properties are met using these metrics and targeted artificial simulations. We then demonstrate the value of the spatial pooler in a complete end-to-end real-world HTM system. We discuss the relationship with neuroscience and previous studies of sparse coding. The HTM spatial pooler represents a neurally inspired algorithm for learning sparse representations from noisy data streams in an online fashion.",

However, identifying regulatory changes that underlie human-specific traits has proven very challenging. Here, we use 63 DNA methylation maps of ancient and present-day humans, as well as of six chimpanzees, to detect differentially methylated regions that emerged in modern humans after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans. We show that genes affecting the face and vocal tract went through particularly extensive methylation changes. Specifically, we identify widespread hypermethylation in a network of face- and voice-affecting genes (SOX9, ACAN, COL2A1, NFIX and XYLT1). We propose that these repression patterns appeared after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans, and that they might have played a key role in shaping the modern human face and vocal tract.View Full Text",

Nonetheless, TEs have been initially proposed as positive control elements acting in synergy with the host. Nowadays, it is well known that TE movement into genome host comprise an important evolutionary mechanism capable to produce diverse chromosome rearrangements and thus increase the adaptive fitness. According to as insights into TE functioning are increasing day to day, the manipulation of transposition has raised an interesting possibility to setting the host functions, although the lack of appropriate genome engineering tools has unpaved it. Fortunately, the emergence of genome editing technologies based on programmable nucleases, and especially the arrival of a multipurpose RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease system, has made it possible to reconsider this challenge. For such purpose, a particular type of transposons referred as Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Elements (MITEs) has demonstrated a series of interesting characteristics for designing functional drivers. Here, recent insights into MITE elements and versatile RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering system are given to outline an effective strategy that allows to deploy the TE potential for control of the host transcriptional activity.",

    "abstract": "Cellular protein levels are dictated by the balance between gene transcription, mRNA translation and protein degradation, among other factors. Cells must manage their proteomes during stress; one way in which they may do so, in principle, is by differential translation. We used ribosome profiling to directly monitor translation in E. coli at 30 {degrees}C and investigate how this changes after 10-20 minutes of heat shock at 42 {degrees}C. Translation is controlled by the interplay of several RNA hybridization processes, which are expected to be temperature sensitive. However, translation efficiencies are robustly maintained after thermal heat shock and after mimicking the heat shock response transcriptional program at 30 {degrees}C. Several gene-specific parameters correlated with translation efficiency, including predicted mRNA structure and whether a gene is cotranslationally translocated into the inner membrane. Genome-wide predictions of the temperature dependence of mRNA structure suggest that relatively few genes show a melting transition between 30 {degrees}C and 42 {degrees}C, consistent with our observations. A linear model with five parameters can predict 33% of the variation in translation efficiency between genes, which may be useful in interpreting transcriptome data.",

    "abstract": "Converging evidence supports the \\\"non-monotonic plasticity\\\" hypothesis that although complete retrieval may strengthen memories, partial retrieval weakens them. Yet, the classic experimental paradigms used to study effects of partial retrieval are not ideally suited to doing so, because they lack the parametric control needed to ensure that the memory is activated to the appropriate degree (i.e., that there is some retrieval, but not enough to cause memory strengthening). Here we present a novel procedure designed to accommodate this need. After participants learned a list of word-scene associates, they completed a cued mental visualization task that was combined with a multiple-object tracking (MOT) procedure, which we selected for its ability to interfere with mental visualization in a parametrically adjustable way (by varying the number of MOT targets). We also used fMRI data to successfully train an \\\"associative recall\\\" classifier for use in this task: this classifier revealed greater memory reactivation during trials in which associative memories were cued while participants tracked one, rather than five MOT targets. However, the classifier was insensitive to task difficulty when recall was not taking place, suggesting it had indeed tracked memory reactivation rather than task difficulty per se. Consistent with the classifier findings, participants' introspective ratings of visualization vividness were modulated by task difficulty. In addition, classifier output and slowing of responses in a post-reactivation memory test suggested that partial reactivation, induced by MOT, weakened memory. We argue that this procedure has desirable properties for future investigation of partial retrieval effects, e.g., in closed-loop experiments.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric cell divisions are of fundamental importance for developmental processes, e.g. for the generation of founder cells. Prime examples are asymmetric cell divisions in the P lineage during early embryogenesis of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. However, due to a lack of quantitative data it has remained unclear how frequent unequal daughter cell sizes emerge in the nematodes early embryogenesis, and whether these originate from sterical or biochemical cues. Using quantitative light-sheet microscopy, we have found that about 40% of all cell divisions in C. elegans until gastrulation generate daughter cells with significantly different volumes. Removing the embryos rigid eggshell revealed asymmetric divisions in somatic cells to be primarily induced by steric effects. Division asymmetries in the germline remained unaltered and were correctly reproduced by a model based on a cell-size independent, eccentric displacement of the metaphase plate. Our data suggest asymmetric cell divisions to be essential for establishing important cell-cell interactions that eventually fuel a successful embryogenesis.\\n\\nSummary statementAbout 40% of all cell divisions in early C. elegans embryogenesis are found to be asymmetric. A cell-size independent displacement of the mitotic spindle explains division asymmetries in the germline whereas the confining eggshell induces asymmetries of somatic cells.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are among the most abundant photosynthetic organisms in the oceans; viruses infecting cyanobacteria (cyanophages) can alter cyanobacterial populations, and therefore affect the local food web and global biochemical cycles. These phages carry auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), which rewire various metabolic pathways in the infected host cell, resulting in increased phage fitness. Coping with stress resulting from photodamage appears to be a central necessity of cyanophages, yet the overall mechanism is poorly understood. Here we report a novel, widespread cyanophage AMG, encoding a fatty acid desaturase (FAD), found in two genotypes with distinct geographical distribution. FADs are capable of modulating the fluidity of the hosts membrane, a fundamental stress response in living cells. We show that both viral fatty acid desaturases (vFADs) families are {Delta}9 lipid desaturases, catalyzing the desaturation at carbon 9 in C16 fatty acid chains. In addition, we present the first fatty acid profiling for marine cyanobacteria, which suggests a unique desaturation pathway of medium to long chain fatty acids no longer than C16, in accordance to the vFADs activity. Our findings suggest that cyanophages fiddle with the infected hosts cell, leading to increased photoprotection and potentially enhancing viral-encoded photosynthetic proteins, resulting in a new viral metabolic network.",

This developmental downregulation of axonal growth may facilitate axonal pruning and neural circuit formation but limits functional recovery following nerve damage. While external factors influencing axonal growth have been extensively investigated, relatively little is known about the intrinsic molecular changes underlying the age-dependent reduction in regeneration capacity. We report that developmental downregulation of LIS1 is responsible for the decreased axonal extension capacity of mature dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. In contrast, exogenous LIS1 expression or endogenous LIS1 augmentation by calpain inhibition restored axonal extension capacity in mature DRG neurons and facilitated regeneration of the damaged sciatic nerve. The insulator protein CTCF suppressed LIS1 expression in mature DRG neurons, and this reduction resulted in excessive accumulation of phosphoactivated GSK-3{beta} at the axon tip, causing failure of the axonal extension. Conversely, sustained LIS1 expression inhibited developmental axon pruning in the mammillary body. Thus, LIS1 regulation may coordinate the balance between axonal growth and pruning during maturation of neuronal circuits.\\n\\nSummary StatementDevelopmental downregulation of LIS1 coordinates the balance between axonalelongation and pruning, which is essential for proper neuronal circuit formation but limits nerve regeneration.",

The unique  representation learning capability of deep learning enables direct training from raw images instead of manually extracted features. The method automatically recognizes key biological traits encoded in the images and exploits them as fingerprints. This remarkable learning ability makes the proposed method readily applicable to classifying various single cells in addition to B. anthracis, as demonstrated for the diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes, without any modification.

These applications involve multiple hypotheses per gene, leading to challenging multiple testing problems. Conventional approaches provide separate top-lists for every contrast and false discovery rate (FDR) control at individual hypothesis level. Hence, they fail to establish proper gene-level error control, which compromises downstream validation experiments. Tests that aggregate individual hypotheses are more powerful and provide gene-level FDR control, but in the RNA-seq literature no methods are available for post-hoc analysis of individual hypotheses.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a two-stage procedure that leverages the increased power of aggregated hypothesis tests while maintaining high biological resolution by post-hoc analysis of genes passing the screening hypothesis. Our method is evaluated on simulated and real RNA-seq experiments. It provides gene-level FDR control in studies with complex designs while boosting power for interaction effects without compromising the discovery of main effects. In a differential transcript usage/expression context, stage-wise testing gains power by aggregating hypotheses at the gene level, while providing transcript-level assessment of genes passing the screening stage. Finally, a prostate cancer case study highlights the relevance of combining gene with transcript level results.\\n\\nConclusionStage-wise testing is a general paradigm that can be adopted whenever individual hypotheses can be aggregated. In our context, it achieves an optimal middle ground between biological resolution and statistical power while providing gene-level FDR control, which is beneficial for downstream biological interpretation and validation.",

The San Juan Bay Estuary System in Puerto Rico is one such ecosystem that has undergone an increase in hypoxic events over the past few years. We collected white grunts (Haemulon plumieri) from one of the estuary lagoons to study the effects of hypoxia on fast startle responses (fast-starts). We hypothesized that exposure to hypoxia would significantly decrease the frequency of fast-starts evoked by an abrupt sound stimulus. After an exposure to an oxygen concentration of 2.5 mg L-1 (40% of air saturation), there is a significant reduction in the frequency of fast-starts that is maintained for at least 24 h after the exposure. Exposure to a random sequence of oxygen levels of 5.0, 4.3 and 3.7 mg L-1 (80, 70, and 60% of air saturation) did not show a significant effect until one hour after exposure. We speculate that the lasting effect of hypoxia on fast-starts, thought to be involved in escape, will result in a greater susceptibility of the white grunt to predation. We have identified the Mauthner cell, known to initiate fast-starts, to allow future studies on how low oxygen levels impact a single cell and its circuit, the behavior it initiates and ultimately how changes in the behavior affect population and ecosystem levels.",

Such models are relatively \\\"theory-free\\\". In contrast, theories for explaining species, distributions draw on concepts like fitness, niche, and environmental suitability. This paper proposes that environmental suitability be defined as the conditional probability of occurrence of a species given the state of the environment at a location. Any quantity that is proportional to this probability is a measure of relative suitability and the support of this probability is the niche. This formulation suggests new methods for presence-background modeling of species distributions that unify statistical methodology with the conceptual framework of niche theory. One method, the plug-and-play approach, is introduced for the first time. Variations on the plug-and-play approach were studied with respect to their numerical performance on 106 species from an exhaustively sampled presence/absence survey of vegetation in the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland. Additionally, we looked at the robustness of these methods to the presence of irrelevant information and sample size. Although irrelevant variables eroded the predictive performance of all methods, these methods were found to be both numerically and statistically robust.",

    "abstract": "It has long been thought that sleep scoring could not be achieved with brain signals alone despite the deep neuromodulatory transformations that accompany sleep state changes. Here we demonstrate using multi-site electrophysiological LFP recordings in freely moving mice that gamma power in the olfactory bulb (OB) allows for clear classification of sleep and wake. Coupled with hippocampal theta activity, it allows the construction of a sleep scoring algorithm that relies on brain activity alone. This method reaches over 90% homology with classical methods based on muscular activity (EMG) and video tracking. Moreover, contrary to EMG, OB gamma power allows correct discrimination between sleep and immobility in ambiguous situations such as fear-related freezing. We use the instantaneous power of hippocampal theta oscillation and OB gamma oscillation to construct a 2D phase-space that is highly robust across mice and days. Dynamic analysis of trajectories within this space yields a novel characterization of sleep/wake and wake/sleep transitions as deeply divergent phenomena. Whereas waking up is a fast and direct transition, falling asleep is best described as stochastic and gradual change. Altogether this methodology opens the avenue for multi-timescale characterization of sleep states with high temporal resolution based on brain signals only.",

Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) is expected to be one of the potential water management practice for saving water while maintaining crop yield. A field experiment was conducted at the AgriLIFE Research center in Uvalde in summer 2008 to examine the water saving potential. Seven irrigation schemes and four varieties were assigned to the experimental field to test their effects on lint yield. As the spatial correlation of the soil moisture/ soil water content were suspected, a spatial analysis on lint yield and soil water content was conducted. The analysis results showed that: 1) The soil water contents showed spatial correlations, while the lint yield did not. 2) The relationship between lint yield and soil water content can be described by linear model better than spatial autocorrelation model. 3) The variogram fit of the soil water content showed a completed curve; the contour map generated using ordinary kriging illustrated the irrigation schemes effect well, and gradient effect was suspected. The variogram of the lint yield could not be fitted by a completed curve, which indicated that the sample field was not large enough to determine the variance function. Further study is needed to determine the slope effect on soil water content, and to improve the contour map precision of the lint yield.",

    "abstract": "Currently, non-invasive methods for studying the human brain do not reliably measure spike-rate-dependent signals, independent of other responses such as hemodynamic coupling (fMRI) and subthreshold neuronal synchrony (oscillations and event-related potentials). In contrast, invasive methods - animal microelectrode recordings and human electrocorticography (ECoG) - have recently measured broadband power elevation in field potentials (~50-200Hz) as a proxy for the locally averaged spike rates. Here, we sought to detect and quantify stimulus-related broadband responses using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in individual subjects. Because extracranial measurements like MEG have multiple global noise sources and a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, we developed an automated denoising technique, adapted from (Kay et al., 2013), that helps reveal the broadband signal of interest. Subjects viewed 12-Hz contrast-reversing patterns in the left, right, or bilateral visual field. Sensor time series were separated into an evoked component (12-Hz amplitude) and a broadband component (60-150Hz, excluding stimulus harmonics). In all subjects, denoised broadband responses were reliably measured in sensors over occipital cortex. The spatial pattern of the broadband measure depended on the stimulus, with greater broadband power in sensors contralateral to the stimulus. Because we obtain reliable broadband estimates with relatively short experiments (~20 minutes), with a sufficient signal-to-noise-ratio to distinguish responses to different stimuli, we conclude that MEG broadband signals, denoised with our method, offer a practical, non-invasive means for characterizing spike-rate-dependent neural activity for a wide range of scientific questions about human brain function.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNeuronal activity causes perturbations in nearby electrical fields. These perturbations can be measured non-invasively in the living human brain using EEG and MEG. These techniques have emphasized two kinds of measurements: oscillations and event-related responses. A third type of signal, a stimulus-related increase in power spanning a wide range of frequencies ( broadband), is routinely measured in invasive recordings, but not with MEG and EEG. This broadband response is of great interest because unlike oscillations and event-related responses, it is correlated with neuronal spike rates. Here we report quantitative, spatially specific measurements of broadband fields in individual human subjects using MEG. These results demonstrate that a spike-rate-dependent measure of brain activity can be obtained non-invasively from the living human brain.",

Using standard similarity measures, these would be scored as being similar, despite in fact being opposites.\\n\\nIn this paper, we use information about opposite ontology classes to extend two large phenotype ontologies, the human and the mammalian phenotype ontology. We also show that this information can be used to improve rankings based on similarity measures that incorporate this information. In particular, cosine similarity based measures show large improvements. We hypothesize this is due to the natural embedding of opposite phenotypes in vector space.\\n\\nWe support the idea that the expressivity of semantic web technologies should be explored more extensively in biomedical ontologies and that similarity measures should be extended to incorporate more than the pure graph structure defined by the subclass or part-of relationships of the underlying ontologies.",

    "abstract": "Drug development effort against GVHD is hampered by the lack of clinically relevant humanized animal models for preclinical testing. Current humanized GVHD models rely on adoptive transfer of a high number of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into immunodeficient mice. Here we report a novel humanized GVHD model by transplanting a small number of human BM cells into newborn NOD. SCID IL2ry0 (NSG) mice. Transplantation of human BM cells (BMT) causes acute GVHD, with lethality between 15 to 60 days. Pervasive human T-cell infiltration into multiple organs, including lung, intestine, skin, kidney, liver, and stomach, was observed in all mice analyzed. Surprisingly, the human T cells express high levels of hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1) protein even under normoxic environment. Administration of Echinomycin, a potent inhibitor for HIF1, rapidly ablated HIF1 protein in T cells and gradually reduced the frequency of human cells in the peripheral blood and target organs. Echinomycin provides a sustained therapeutic effect, as demonstrated by dramatic reduction of clinical symptoms, pathology score and by doubling of the median life span of the chimeric mice. Our results reveal a critical role of HIF1 in GVHD and demonstrate that HIF1 inhibitors such as Echinomycin should be explored for clinical drug development against GVHD.",

    "abstract": "How are perceptual decisions made? The answer to this seemingly simple question necessitates that we specify the nature of perceptual representations on which decisions are based. Recent work has taken for granted that the representation at the decision stage consists of a full probability distribution over all possible stimuli. However, to date, no empirical evidence has supported this assumption. Here I present five possible perceptual representation schemes that allow the extraction of different levels of sensory uncertainty. I review the empirical evidence from both continuous and discrete judgments and show that, at present, only the most primitive scheme based on a single point estimate can be rejected. In other words, at least four different representational schemes are consistent with the available data and therefore full probability distributions cannot be assumed. There is an urgent need for empirical research to adjudicate between these theoretical possibilities.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages are the most abundant viruses on earth and display an impressive genetic as well as morphologic diversity. Among those, the most common order of phages is the Caudovirales, whose viral particles packages linear double stranded DNA (dsDNA). In this study we investigated how the information gathered by high throughput sequencing technologies can be used to determine the DNA termini and packaging mechanisms of dsDNA phages. The wet-lab procedures traditionally used for this purpose rely on the identification and cloning of restriction fragment which can be delicate and cumbersome. Here, we developed a theoretical and statistical framework to analyze DNA termini and phage packaging mechanisms using next-generation sequencing data. Our methods, implemented in the PhageTerm software, work with sequencing reads in fastq format and the corresponding assembled phage genome.\\n\\nPhageTerm was validated on a set of phages with well-established packaging mechanisms representative of the termini diversity: 5cos (lambda), 3cos (HK97), pac (P1), headful without a pac site (T4), DTR (T7) and host fragment (Mu). In addition, we determined the termini of 9 Clostridium difficile phages and 6 phages whose sequences where retrieved from the sequence read archive (SRA).\\n\\nA direct graphical interface is available as a Galaxy wrapper version at https://galaxy.pasteur.fr and a standalone version is accessible at https://sourceforge.net/projects/phageterm/.",

    "abstract": "Fibrotic diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a central role in the development of tissue/organ fibrosis. We discovered that eupatilin, a member of the chromone scaffold (CS)-containing compounds found ubiquitously in the plant kingdom, completely reversed fibrogenesis in vitro and substantially ameliorated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (BILF). Furthermore, eupatilin-induced growth arrest and morphological changes in primary fibroblasts derived from a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). To better understand fibrosis, we established a mouse hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line that was robustly differentiated into myofibroblasts upon treatment with TGF{beta}. HSC-derived fibrogenesis was completely blocked by eupatilin, which caused dramatic morphological changes while inhibiting expression of EMT-related genes. The chemical groups linked to the 2nd carbon (C2), C3, C6, and C7 on the CS of eupatilin were essential for its anti-fibrogenic effects. Unlike eupatilin, pirfenidone failed to block HSC fibrogenesis and did not affect the morphology of HSCs or lung fibroblasts. Although pirfenidone affected local production of TGF{beta}, as reflected by a reduction in the TGF{beta} level in lung lysates of BILF model mice, eupatilin is likely to act via a different therapeutic mechanism. In particular, eupatilin had greater anti-fibrotic capacity and EMT-inhibitory activity and significantly attenuated the phosphorylation of Erk by TGF{beta}. Based on the interactome, Integrin{beta}3 seems to be a major player in integration of TGF{beta} signaling into the eupatilin-mediated anti-fibrosis. Our findings suggest that combinatorial use of eupatilin and pirfenidone may augment the therapeutic efficacy of IPF treatment.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGrowth rate is a major component of the evolutionary fitness of microbial organisms and an excellent surrogate for cell health. In the high-throughput procedures QFA and SGA, microbial cultures are inoculated in an array on solid agar, and growth is measured to obtain quantitative fitness estimates. Neighbouring cultures, which are often different genetic strains, consume nutrients at different rates, creating gradients in nutrient density. We believe that diffusion of nutrients between cultures is affecting growth in these experiments. Current analysis does not account for this; instead, it is assumed that cultures grow independently. I use a network model of nutrient diffusion and nutrient-dependent growth, to correct for competition, to try to improve the accuracy and precision of fitness estimates. I test the model against QFA data from studies on telomere function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ultimately, the model might be used to improve the reliability of screens for genetic interaction and drug sensitivity.\\n\\nResultsI fit the competition model to a QFA plate from Addinall et al. (2011). Using far fewer parameters (387 vs 1152), the new model fits timecourses with similar closeness to the previous model. Fitness estimates are less precise for the fastest growing strains, but more precise for the majority of strains (36 out of 50). Fitness rankings agree in the positions of the fastest and slowest growing strains, but disagree in the middle positions. In a cross-plate validation experiment, the competition model overestimates timecourses to a similar degree that the previous model underestimates. A different method of fitting is required to find globally optimal solutions which might improve reliability.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationCANS, a Python package developed for the analysis in this paper, is freely available at https://github.com/lwlss/CANS.",

    "abstract": "Summary (Abstract)Macromolecular crowding has a profound impact on reaction rates and the physical properties of the cell interior, but the mechanisms that regulate crowding are poorly understood. We developed Genetically Encoded Multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs) to dissect these mechanisms. GEMs are homomultimeric scaffolds fused to a fluorescent protein. GEMs self-assemble into bright, stable fluorescent particles of defined size and shape. By combining tracking of GEMs with genetic and pharmacological approaches, we discovered that the mTORC1 pathway can tune the effective diffusion coefficient of macromolecules [&ge;]15 nm in diameter more than 2-fold without any discernable effect on the motion of molecules [&ge;]5 nm. These mTORCI-dependent changes in crowding and rheology affect phase-separation both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results establish a role for mTORCI in controlling both the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm and the phase-separation of biopolymers.",
