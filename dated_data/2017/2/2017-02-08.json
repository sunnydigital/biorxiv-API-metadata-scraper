    "abstract": "Recent research has uncovered an important role for de novo variation in neurodevelopmental disorders. Using aggregated data from 9246 families with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, or developmental delay, we show ~1/3 of de novo variants are independently observed as standing variation in the Exome Aggregation Consortiums cohort of 60,706 adults, and these de novo variants do not contribute to neurodevelopmental risk. We further use a loss-of-function (LoF)-intolerance metric, pLI, to identify a subset of LoF-intolerant genes that contain the observed signal of associated de novo protein truncating variants (PTVs) in neurodevelopmental disorders. LoF-intolerant genes also carry a modest excess of inherited PTVs; though the strongest de novo impacted genes contribute little to this, suggesting the excess of inherited risk resides lower-penetrant genes. These findings illustrate the importance of population-based reference cohorts for the interpretation of candidate pathogenic variants, even for analyses of complex diseases and de novo variation.",

    "abstract": "As a global issue the effects of climate change are difficult to manage on a region scale. However, more often than not it is only one of many problems that need to be addressed in species conservation. Non-climatic factors - especially those of anthropogenic origins - play equally if not more important roles with regards to population developments of species and often provide much better toeholds for conservation activities. We examined the population trends of the endangered Yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) in New Zealand using monitoring data dating back to the 1980s. We developed a Bayesian population model incorporating various climatic factors to assess the relative influence of climate change on the penguin numbers over the past 30 years. Sea surface temperature (SST) proved to be the dominating factor influencing survival of both adult birds and fledglings. Increasing SST since the mid-1990s went along with a reduction in survival rates and population decline. The population model showed that 33% of the variation in population numbers could be explained by SST alone, significantly increasing pressure on the penguin population. Consequently, the population becomes less resilient to nonclimate related impacts, such as fisheries interactions, habitat degradation and human disturbance. But their exact contribution towards population trends is extremely difficult to assess principally due to the absence of quantifiable data. This potentially creates an analysis bias towards climate variables, effectively distracting from non-climate factors that can be managed on a regional scale to ensure the viability of the population.",

    "abstract": "Plant morphology is inherently mathematical in that morphology describes plant form and architecture with geometrical and topological descriptors. The geometries and topologies of leaves, flowers, roots, shoots and their spatial arrangements have fascinated plant biologists and mathematicians alike. Beyond providing aesthetic inspiration, quantifying plant morphology has become pressing in an era of climate change and a growing human population. Modifying plant morphology, through molecular biology and breeding, aided by a mathematical perspective, is critical to improving agriculture, and the monitoring of ecosystems with fewer natural resources. In this white paper, we begin with an overview of the mathematical models applied to quantify patterning in plants. We then explore fundamental challenges that remain unanswered concerning plant morphology, from the barriers preventing the prediction of phenotype from genotype to modeling the movement of leafs in air streams. We end with a discussion concerning the incorporation of plant morphology into educational programs. This strategy focuses on synthesizing biological and mathematical approaches and ways to facilitate research advances through outreach, cross-disciplinary training, and open science. This white paper arose from bringing mathematicians and biologists together at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS) workshop titled \\\"Morphological Plant Modeling: Unleashing Geometric and Topological Potential within the Plant Sciences\\\" held at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in September, 2015. Never has the need to quantify plant morphology been more imperative. Unleashing the potential of geometric and topological approaches in the plant sciences promises to transform our understanding of both plants and mathematics.",

Accurate estimation of these parameters is crucial because much recent work has sought to link them to genotypes. The original goal of this study was to fit the anthesis date component of the CERES-Maize model to 5266 genetic lines grown at 11 site-years and genetically map the resulting parameter estimates. Although the resulting estimates had high predictive quality, numerous artifacts emerged during estimation. The first arose in situations where the model was unable to express the observed data for many lines, which ended up sharing the same parameter value. In the second (2254 lines), the model reproduced the data but there were often many parameter sets that did so equally well (equifinality). These artifacts made genetic mapping impossible, thus, revealing cautionary insights regarding a major current paradigm for linking process based models to genetics.",

Despite significant interest in the influence of age on structural covariance patterns, no study to date has provided a complete lifespan perspective--bridging childhood with early, middle, and late adulthood--on the development of structural covariance networks. Here, we investigate the lifespan trajectories of structural covariance in six canonical neurocognitive networks: default, dorsal attention, frontoparietal control, somatomotor, ventral attention, and visual. By combining data from five open access data sources, we examine the structural covariance trajectories of these networks from 6-94 years of age in a sample of 1580 participants. Using partial least squares, we show that structural covariance patterns across the lifespan exhibit two significant, age-dependent trends. The first trend is a stable pattern whose integrity declines over the lifespan. The second trend is an inverted-U that differentiates young adulthood from other age groups. Hub regions, including posterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, appear particularly influential in the expression of this second age-dependent trend. Overall, our results suggest that structural covariance provides a reliable definition of neurocognitive networks across the lifespan and reveal both shared and network-specific trajectories.",

Specifically, the analysis compares the impact of the global signal regression of gray matter signal on the graph parameters and community structure derived of functional data. It was found that, without gray matter signal regression (GSR), the group comparison showed no significant changes of the global metrics between the two conditions studied. With gray matter signal regression, significant differences between the global (local) metrics for the conditions were obtained. The mean degree, the clustering coefficient of the network and the mean value of the local efficiency were metrics with significant changes. The community structure of group connectivity matrices was explored for both conditions (RS and LT) and for different preprocessing steps. When gray matter signal regression was performed, small changes of the community structure were observed. Approximately, the same regions were classified in the same communities before and after GSR. This means, that the community structure of the data is weakly affected by this preprocessing step. The modularity index presented significant changes between conditions (RS and LT) and between different preprocessing pipeline.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) can be developed by computational approaches that infer regulator-target gene interactions from transcriptional assays. Successful algorithms that generate predictive, accurate TRNs enable the identification of regulator-target relationships in conditions where experimentally determining regulatory interactions is a challenge. Improving the ability of TRNs to successfully predict known regulator-target relationships in model species will enhance confidence in applying these approaches to determine regulator-target interactions in non-model species where experimental validation is challenging. Many transcriptional profiling experiments are performed across multiple time points; therefore we sought to improve regulator-target predictions by adjusting how time is incorporated into the network. We created ExRANGES, which incorporates Expression in a Rate-Normalized GEne Specific manner that adjusts how expression data is provided to the network algorithm. We tested this on a two different network construction approaches and found that ExRANGES prioritizes targets differently than traditional expression and improves the ability of these networks to accurately predict known regulator targets. ExRANGES improved the ability to correctly identify targets of transcription factors in large data sets in four different model systems: mouse, human, Arabidopsis, and yeast. Finally, we examined the performance of ExRANGES on a small data set from field-grown Oryza sativa and found that it also improved the ability to identify known targets even with a limited data set.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTo understand how organisms can turn a collection of genes into a physiological response, we need to understand how certain genes are turned on and off. In model organisms, the ability to identify direct targets of transcription factors via ChIP-Seq in a high-throughput manner has advanced our understanding of transcriptional regulatory networks and how organisms regulate gene expression. However, for non-model organisms, it remains a challenge to identify TF-target relationships through experimental approaches such as ChIP-Seq. Without this information, the ability to understand regulatory control is limited. Computational approaches to identify regulator-target relationships in silico from easily attainable transcriptional data offer a solution. Several approaches exist for identifying gene regulatory networks, including many that take advantage of time series data. Most of these approaches weigh the relationship between regulators and putative targets at all time points equally. However, many regulators may control a single target in response to different inputs. In our approach, we focus on the association between regulators and targets primarily at times when there is a significant change in expression. ExRANGES essentially weights the expression value of each time point by the slope change after that time point so that relationships between regulators and targets are emphasized at the time points when the transcript levels are changing. This change in input into network identification algorithms improves the ability to predict regulator-target interactions and could be applied to many different algorithms We hope this improvement will increase the ability to identify regulators of interest in non-model species.",

    "abstract": "Biological model curation provides new insights by integrating biological knowledge-fragments, assessing their uncertainty, and analyzing the reliability of potential interpretations. Here we integrate published results about circadian clocks in Drosophila melanogaster while exploring economies of scale in biological model curation. Clocks govern rhythms of gene-expression that impact fitness, health, cancer, memory, mental functions, and more. Human clock insights have been repeatedly pioneered in flies. Flies simplify investigating complex gene regulatory networks, which express proteins cyclically using environmentally entrained interlocking feedback loops that act as clocks. Simulations could simplify research further. We found that very few computational models test their quality directly against experimentally observed time series scattered in the literature. We designed FlyClockbase for integrating such scattered data to enable robust efficient access for biologists and modelers. To this end we have been defining data structures that simplify the construction and maintenance of Versioned Biological Information Resources (VBIRs) that prioritize simplicity, openness, and therefore maintainability. We aim to simplify the preservation of more raw data and relevant annotations from experiments in order to multiply the long-term value of wet-lab datasets for modelers interested in meta-analyses, parameter estimates, and hypothesis testing. Currently FlyClockbase contains over 400 wildtype time series of core circadian components systematically curated from 86 studies published between 1990 and 2015. Using FlyClockbase, we show that PERIOD protein amount peak time variance unexpectedly exceeds that of TIMELESS. We hypothesize that PERIODs exceedingly more complex phosphorylation rules are responsible. Variances of daily event times are easily confounded by errors. We improved result reliability by a human error analysis of our data handling; this revealed significance-degrading outliers, possibly violating a presumed absence of wildtype heterogeneity or lab evolution. Separate analyses revealed elevated stochasticity in PCR-based peak time variances; yet our reported core difference in peak time variances appears robust. Our study demonstrates how biological model curation enhances the understanding of circadian clocks. It also highlights diverse broader challenges that are likely to become recurrent themes if models in molecular systems biology aim to integrate  all relevant knowledge. We developed a trans-disciplinary workflow, which demonstrates the importance of developing compilers for VBIRs with a more biology-friendly logic that is likely to greatly simplify biological model curation. Curation-limited grand challenges, including personalizing medicine, critically depend on such progress if they are indeed to integrate  all relevant knowledge.\\n\\nGeneral Article SummaryCircadian clocks impact health and fitness by controlling daily rhythms of gene-expression through complex gene-regulatory networks. Deciphering how they work requires experimentally tracking changes in amounts of clock components. We designed FlyClockbase to simplify data-access for biologists and modelers, curating over 400 time series observed in wildtype fruit flies from 25 years of clock research. Substantial biological model curation was essential for identifying differences in peak time variance of the clock-proteins  PERIOD and  TIMELESS, which probably stem from differences in phosphorylation-network complexity.\\n\\nWe repeatedly encountered systemic limitations of contemporary data analysis strategies in our work on circadian clocks. Thus, we used it as an opportunity for composing a panoramic view of the broader challenges in biological model curation, which are likely to increase as biologists aim to integrate all existing expertise in order to address diverse grand challenges. We developed and tested a trans-disciplinary research workflow, which enables biologists and compiler-architects to define biology-friendly compilers for efficiently constructing and maintaining Versioned Biological Information Resources (VBIRs). We report insights gleaned from our practical clock research that are essential for defining a VBIRs infrastructure, which improves the efficiency of biological model curation to the point where it can be democratized.\\n\\nStatement of data availabilityStabilizing Versioned Variant of this file: QQv1r4_2017m07d14_Lion\\n\\nBefore final publication FlyClockbase will be at https://github.com/FlyClockbase For review purposes FlyClockbase QQv1r4 will be provided as a zip-archive in the uploaded Supplemental Material; it is also available upon request from L.

    "abstract": "To understand cellular coordination of multiple transcriptome regulation mechanisms, we simultaneously measured transcription rate (TR), mRNA abundance (RA) and translation activity (TA). This revealed multiple quantitative insights. First, the genomic profiles of the three parameters are systematically different in key statistical features. Sequentially more genes exhibit extreme low or high expression values from TR to RA, then to TA. That is, because of cellular coordination of these regulatory mechanisms, sequentially higher levels of gene expression selectivity are achieved as genetic information flow from the genome to the proteome. Second, the contribution of the stabilization-by-translation regulatory mechanism to the cellular coordination process was assessed. The data enabled an estimation of mRNA stability, revealing a moderate but significant positive correlation between the estimated mRNA stability and translation activity. Third, the proportion of a mRNA occupied by un-translated regions (UTR) exhibits a negative relationship with the level of this correlation, and is thus a major determinant of the mode of regulation of the mRNA. High-UTR-proportion mRNAs tend to defy the stabilization-by-translation regulatory mechanism, staying out of the polysome but remaining stable; mRNAs with little UTRs largely follow this regulation. In summary, we quantitatively delineated the relationship among multiple transcriptome regulation parameters, i.e., cellular coordination of corresponding regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila melanogaster P transposable element provides one of the best cases of horizontal transfer of a mobile DNA sequence in eukaryotes. Invasion of natural populations by the P element has led to a syndrome of phenotypes known as P-M hybrid dysgenesis that emerges when strains differing in their P element composition mate and produce offspring. Despite extensive research on many aspects of P element biology, many questions remain about the genomic basis of variation in P-M dysgenesis phenotypes in natural populations. Here we compare gonadal dysgenesis phenotypes and genomic P element predictions for isofemale strains obtained from three worldwide populations of D. melanogaster to illuminate the molecular basis of natural variation in cytotype status. We show that the number of predicted P element insertions in genome sequences from isofemale strains is highly correlated across different bioinformatics methods, but the absolute number of insertions per strain is sensitive to method and filtering strategies. Regardless of method used, we find that the number of euchromatic P element insertions predicted per strain varies significantly across populations, with strains from a North American population having fewer P element insertions than strains from populations sampled in Europe or Africa. Despite these geographic differences, numbers of euchromatic P element insertions are not strongly correlated with the degree of gonadal dysgenesis exhibited by an isofemale strain. Thus, variation in P element insertion numbers across different populations does not necessarily lead to corresponding geographic differences in gonadal dysgenesis phenotypes. Additionally, we show that pool-seq samples can uncover population differences in the number of P element insertions observed from isofemale lines, but that efforts to rigorously detect differences in the number of P elements across populations using pool-seq data must properly control for read depth per strain. Our work supports the view that euchromatic P element copy number is not sufficient to explain variation in gonadal dysgenesis across strains of D. melanogaster, and informs future efforts to decode the genomic basis of geographic and temporal differences in P element induced phenotypes.",

Assigning genes or genetic elements to chromosomes is an important step when considering how genomes evolved. The monarch butterfly has a reported haploid chromosome number of 30. The specimens that this count is based on are from Madras, India where D. plexippus does not occur. As a consequence the reported haplotype for the D. plexippus is incorrect. A literature review revealed that the specimens this count was based on were most likely Danaus genutia (Cramer 1779), which Linnaeus and others conflated with D. plexippus. In a 1954 Opinion (#282) the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature decided that the name D. genutia refers to specimens originating from the Orient and D. plexippus to those from North America. To clarify the haplotype number of D. plexippus from North America I conducted chromosome squashes of male 5th instar larvae. All specimens examined had a haploid chromosome count of n = 28. Following these new data, I then reconstructed the evolution of haplotypes throughout the Danainae subfamily to provide a testable hypothesis on the evolution of chromosome number for this group.",

Here, we present rxncon 2.0, the second generation rxncon language, as a tool to define signal transduction networks at the level of empirical data. By expressing both reactions and contingencies (contextual constraints on reactions) in terms of elemental states, both the combinatorial complexity and the discrepancy to empirical data can be minimised. It works as a higher-level language natural to biologists, which can be compiled into a range of graphical formats or executable models.

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is present in urine, saliva, tears, and breast milk, but the transmission risk associated with these body fluids is currently unknown. We evaluated the risk of ZIKV transmission through mucosal contact in rhesus macaques. Application of high-dose ZIKV directly to the tonsils of 3 rhesus macaques resulted in detectable plasma viremia in all animals by 2 days post-exposure; virus replication kinetics were similar to those observed in animals infected subcutaneously. Three additional macaques inoculated subcutaneously with ZIKV served as saliva donors to assess the transmission risk from contact with oral secretions from an infected individual. Seven naive animals repeatedly exposed to donor saliva via the conjunctivae, tonsils, or nostrils did not become infected. Our results suggest that there is a risk of ZIKV transmission via the mucosal route, but that the risk posed by oral secretions from individuals with a typical course of ZIKV infection is low.",

    "abstract": "Category learning is a critical neurobiological function that allows organisms to simplify a complex world. Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (rlPFC) is often active in neurobiological studies of category learning; however, the specific role this region serves in category learning remains uncertain. Previous category learning studies have hypothesized that the rlPFC is involved in switching between rules, whereas others have emphasized rule abstraction and evaluation. We aimed to clarify the role of rlPFC in category learning and dissociate switching and evaluation accounts using two common types of category learning tasks: matching and classification. The matching task involved matching a reference stimulus to one of four target stimuli. In the classification task, participants were shown a single stimulus and learned to classify it into one of two categories. Matching and classification are similar but place different demands on switching and evaluation. In matching, a rule can be known with certainty after a single correct answer. In classification, participants may need to evaluate evidence for a rule even after an initial correct response. This critical difference allows isolation of evaluative functions from switching functions. If the rlPFC is primarily involved in switching between representations, it should cease to be active once participants settle on a given rule in both tasks. If the rlPFC is involved in rule evaluation, its activation should persist in the classification task, but not matching. The results revealed that rlPFC activation persisted into correct trials in classification, but not matching, suggesting that it continues to be involved in the evaluations of evidence for a rule even after participants have arrived at the correct rule.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDifferences between rule-based matching and classification tasks were highlighted.\\nC_LIO_LIRostrolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in evaluation of evidence for a rule in rule-based category learning tasks.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cells, like many other organisms, face a tradeoff between longevity and fecundity. Planktonic cells are fast growing and fragile, while biofilm cells are often slower growing but stress resistant. Here we ask: why do bacterial lineages invest simultaneously in both fast and slow growing types? We develop a population dynamical model of lineage expansion across a patchy environment, and find that mixed investment is favored across a broad range of environmental conditions, even when transmission is entirely via biofilm cells. This mixed strategy is favored because of a division of labor, where exponentially dividing planktonic cells can act as an engine for the production of future biofilm cells, which grow more slowly. We use experimental evolution to test our predictions, and show that phenotypic heterogeneity is persistent even under selection for purely planktonic or purely biofilm transmission. Furthermore, simulations suggest that maintenance of a biofilm subpopulation serves as a cost-effective hedge against environmental uncertainty, which is also consistent with our experimental findings.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants, especially in low-income settings. Asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for disease, and the duration of carriage is an important consideration in modelling transmission dynamics and vaccine response. Existing studies of carriage duration variability are based at the serotype level only, and do not probe variation within lineages or fully quantify interactions with other environmental factors.\\n\\nHere we developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data. By combining these results with whole genome sequence data we estimate that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, whereas host traits accounted for less than 5%. We further partitioned this heritability into both lineage and locus effects, and quantified the amount attributable to the largest sources of variation in carriage duration: serotype (17%), drug-resistance (9%) and other significant locus effects (7%). For the locus effects, a genome-wide association study identified 16 loci which may have an effect on carriage duration independent of serotype. Hits at a genome-wide level of significance were to prophage sequences, suggesting infection by such viruses substantially affects carriage duration.\\n\\nThese results show that both serotype and non-serotype specific effects alter carriage duration in infants and young children and are more important than other environmental factors such as host genetics. This has implications for models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance, and leads the way for the analysis of heritability of complex bacterial traits.\\n\\nSignificance statementOther than serotype, the genetic determinants of pneumococcal carriage duration are unknown. In this study we used longitudinal sampling to measure the duration of carriage in infants, and searched for any associated variation in the pan-genome. While we found that the pathogen genome explains most of the variability in duration, serotype did not fully account for this. Recent theoretical work has proposed the existence of alleles which alter carriage duration to explain the puzzle of continued coexistence of antibiotic-resistant and sensitive strains. Here we have shown that these alleles do exist in a natural population, and also identified candidates for the loci which fulfil this role. Together these findings have implications for future modelling of pneumococcal epidemiology and resistance.",

Here we present a number-theoretic analysis of grid coding and derive an upper bound on the distance that a population of grid cells can represent without error. We show that in the absence of neuronal noise, the capacity of the system would be extremely sensitive to the choice of the grid periods. However, when the accuracy of the representation is limited by neuronal noise, the capacity becomes gradually more robust against the choice of grid scales as the number of modules increases and remains near optimal even for random scale choices. Our study reveals that robust and efficient coding can be achieved without parameter tuning in the case of grid cell representation.",

Cigarette smoke increases the metabolism of caffeine, so this association may represent a causal effect of smoking on caffeine intake.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed a Mendelian randomisation analysis in 114,029 individuals from the UK Biobank, 56,664 from the Norwegian HUNT study and 78,650 from the Copenhagen General Population Study. We used a genetic variant in the CHRNA5 nicotinic receptor (rs16969968) as a proxy for smoking heaviness. Coffee and tea consumption were self-reported. Analyses were conducted using linear regression and meta-analysed across studies.\\n\\nResultsEach additional cigarette per day consumed by current smokers was associated with higher coffee consumption (0.10 cups per day, 95% CI:0.03,0.17). There was weak evidence for an increase in tea consumption per additional cigarette smoked per day (0.04 cups per day, 95% CI:-0.002,0.07). There was strong evidence that each additional copy of the minor allele of rs16969968 (which increases daily cigarette consumption) in current smokers was associated with higher coffee consumption (0.15 cups per day, 95% CI:0.11,0.20), but only weak evidence for an association with tea consumption (0.04 cups per day, 95% CI:- 0.01,0.09). There was no clear evidence that rs16969968 was associated with coffee or tea consumption in never or former smokers.\\n\\nConclusionThese findings suggest that higher cigarette consumption causally increases coffee intake.

In particular, the Cre and FLP enzymes are widely used to either activate or inactivate genes in a precise spatiotemporal manner.

To increase the utility of the FLP system in C. elegans we have generated a series of single-copy transgenic strains that stably express an optimized version of FLP in specific tissues or by heat induction. We show that recombination efficiencies reach 100 percent in several cell types, such as muscles, intestine and serotonin producing neurons. Moreover, we demonstrate that most promoters drive recombination exclusively in the expected tissues. As examples of the potentials of the FLP lines we describe novel tools for induced cell ablation by expression of the PEEL-1 toxin and a versatile FLP-out cassette for generation of GFP-tagged conditional knockout alleles. Together with other recombinase-based reagents created by the C. elegans community this toolkit increases the possibilities for detailed analyses of specific biological processes at developmental stages inside intact animals.",

    "abstract": "The process by which species evolve can be illuminated by investigating barriers that limit gene flow between taxa. Recent radiations, such as Heliconius butterflies, offer the opportunity to compare isolation between pairs of taxa at different stages of ecological, geographic and phylogenetic divergence. We carry out a comparative analysis of existing and novel data in order to quantify the strength and direction of isolating barriers within a well-studied clade of Heliconius. Our results highlight that increased divergence is associated with the accumulation of stronger and more numerous barriers to gene flow. Wing pattern is both under natural selection for Mullerian mimicry and involved in mate choice, and therefore underlies several isolating barriers. However, pairs which share a similar wing pattern, also display strong reproductive isolation mediated by traits other than wing pattern. This suggests that, while wing pattern is a key factor for early stages of divergence, it is not essential at a higher level. Additional factors including habitat isolation, hybrid sterility and chemically-mediated mate choice are associated with complete speciation. Therefore, although most previous work has emphasised the role of wing pattern, our comparative results highlight that speciation is a multidimensional process, whose completion is stabilized by many factors.",

    "abstract": "We have cloned and characterized the gene encoding to Taenia solium TATA binding protein 1 (TsTBP1). It spans 1481 bp and its coding region is interrupted by four introns that possess the consensus donor/acceptor sequences. It produces a protein of 238 amino acids residues, which presented all the classical motives of the TBP1. On the core promoter region we identified putative binding sites for NF1, AP-1, YY1, TAF1/TAF2 and TAF6/TAF9, and the TSS that corresponds to an A+1. Southern and Northern blot analysis showed that TsTBP1 is encoded by a single gene, which produce a messenger of about 1.1 kbp with a higher differential expression in adult than the larval stage. Moreover, two putative TATA boxes were identified at -97 and -69 bp (relative to the TSS), likewise a Downstream Promoter Element (DPE) was located at +27 to +31 bp. EMSA experiments did not show any component of cysticerci nuclear extracts bound to the putative TATA-box elements; in contrast TAF6 and TAF9 bind to the DPE, showing that TsTBP1 is a TATA-less gen. On the other hand, TAF6 and TAF9 were localized on the nucleus from cells of T. crassiceps cysticerci bladder walls. By using the amino acid sequences of T. solium TAF6 (TsTAF6) and TAF9 (TsTAF9), we constructed a molecular model showing interaction between DPE-TsTAF6 and TsTAF6-TsTAF9. Finally, an in silico analysis of the core promoters of Taeniidae family genes showed that TATA-box and DPE are homologous to the mammalian elements, but not so the Inr. The low identity between TAF9 from cestodes and mammals open the possibility to use it as target to interrupt or modulate the transcription of TATA-box less genes in cestodes as a novel therapeutic strategy.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNeurocysticercosis still being a health problem in developing countries. Mexico reports a prevalence of 2.5% in the total patients from National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery. Several efforts have been made in different fields to study Taenia solium, and although the Genome Project has been published and released the genomic sequence of this parasite; the transcriptional mechanisms this organism remains unexplored. We isolated and characterized Taenia solium TATA-Binding Protein 1 (TsTBP1) gene and TBP-associated factor 6 and 9 cDNAs (TsTAF6 and TsTAF9, respectively). Our principal findings are: 1.- Identification of cis and trans elements in the core promoter of TsTBP1 gene. 2.- The TsTBP1 gene is a TATA-less promoter. 3.- Cloning of cDNAs to TsTAF6 and TsTAF9, 4.- Identification of a DPE in the core promoter of TsTBP1 gene, which interacts with TAF6 and TAF9, 5.- Construction of a molecular model that shows the interaction between DPE, TAF6, and TAF9; and 6.- A proposal of consensus sequences for TATA-box, Inr and DPE presented on Taeniidae family core promoters.",

    "abstract": "Thermosipho species inhabit various extreme environments such as marine hydrothermal vents, petroleum reservoirs and terrestrial hot springs. A 16S rRNA phylogeny of available Thermosipho spp. sequences suggested habitat specialists adapted to living in hydrothermal vents only, and habitat generalists inhabiting oil reservoirs, hydrothermal vents and hotsprings. Comparative genomics and recombination analysis of the genomes of 15 Thermosipho isolates separated them into three species with different habitat distributions, the widely distributed T. africanus and the more specialized, T. melanesiensis and T. affectus. The three Thermosipho species can also be differentiated on the basis of genome content. For instance the T. africanus genomes had the largest repertoire of carbohydrate metabolism, which could explain why these isolates were obtained from ecologically more divergent habitats. The three species also show different capacities for defense against foreign DNA. T. melanesiensis and T. africanus both had a complete RM system, while this was missing in T. affectus. These observations also correlated with Pacbio sequencing, which revealed a methylated T. melanesiensis BI431 genome, while no methylation was detected among two T. affectus isolates. All the genomes carry CRISPR arrays accompanied by more or less complete CRISPR-cas systems. Interestingly, some isolates of both T. melanesiensis and T. africanus carry integrated prophage elements, with spacers matching these in their CRISPR arrays. Taken together, the comparative genomic analyses of Thermosipho spp. revealed genetic variation allowing habitat differentiation within the genus as well as differentiation with respect to invading mobile DNA that is present in subsurface ecosystems.",

Confocal microscopy and live cell imaging of actin in U2OS cells indicate that PAWS1 is also involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and organization. Loss of PAWS1 causes severe defects in F-actin organization and distribution as well as in lamellipodial organization, resulting in impaired cell migration. PAWS1 interacts in a dynamic fashion with the actin/cytoskeletal regulator CD2AP at lamellae, suggesting that its association with CD2AP controls actin organization and cellular migration.\\n\\nSummary statementPAWS1/FAM83G controls cell migration by influencing the organisation of F-actin and focal adhesions and the distribution of the actin stress fibre network through its association with CD2AP.",

Existing tools try to address this using indirect features, such as expression levels and biochemical pathways. Here, we present Gene ORGANizer (geneorganizer.huji.ac.il), a phenotype-based tool that directly links human genes to the body parts they affect. It is built upon an exhaustive curated database that links more than 7,000 genes to [~]150 anatomical parts using >150,000 gene-organ associations. The tool offers user-friendly platforms to analyze the anatomical effects of individual genes, and identify trends within groups of genes. We demonstrate how Gene ORGANizer can be used to make new discoveries, showing that chromosome X is enriched with genes affecting facial features, that positive selection targets genes with more constrained phenotypic effects, and more. We expect Gene ORGANizer to be useful in a variety of evolutionary, medical and molecular studies aimed at understanding the phenotypic effects of genes.",

    "abstract": "mRNA translation plays an evolutionarily conserved role in homeostasis and when dysregulated results in various disorders. Optimal and universally applicable analytical methods to study transcriptome-wide changes in translational efficiency are therefore critical for understanding the complex role of translation regulation under physiological and pathological conditions. Techniques used to interrogate translatomes, including polysome- and ribosome-profiling, require adjustment for changes in total mRNA levels to capture bona fide alterations in translational efficiency. Herein, we present the anota2seq algorithm for such analysis using data from ribosome- or polysome-profiling quantified by DNA-microarrays or RNA sequencing, which outperforms current methods for identification of changes in translational efficiency. In contrast to available analytical methods, anota2seq also allows capture of an underappreciated mode for regulation of gene expression whereby translation acts as a buffering mechanism which maintains constant protein levels despite fluctuations in mRNA levels (\\\"translational buffering\\\"). Application of anota2seq shows that insulin affects gene expression at multiple levels, in a largely mTOR-dependent manner. Moreover, insulin induces levels of a subset of mRNAs independently of mTOR that undergo translational buffering upon mTOR inhibition. Thus, the universal anota2seq algorithm allows efficient and hitherto unprecedented interrogation of translatomes and enables studies of translational buffering which represents an unexplored mechanism for regulating of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences, colloquially known as  jumping genes because of their ability to replicate to new genomic locations. Given a vector of transfer (e.g. tick or virus), TEs can jump further: between organisms or species in a process known as horizontal transfer (HT). Here we propose that LINE-1 (L1) and Bovine-B (BovB), the two most abundant TE families in mammals, were initially introduced as foreign DNA via ancient HT events. Using a 503-genome dataset, we identify multiple ancient L1 HT events in eukaryotes and provide evidence that L1s infiltrated the mammalian lineage after the monotreme-therian split. We also extend the BovB paradigm by increasing the number of estimated transfer events compared to previous studies, finding new potential blood-sucking parasite vectors and occurrences in new lineages (e.g. bats, frog). Given that these TEs make up nearly half of the genome sequence in todays mammals, our results provide the first evidence that HT can have drastic and long-term effects on the new host genomes. This revolutionizes our perception of genome evolution to consider external factors, such as the natural introduction of foreign DNA. With the advancement of genome sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, we anticipate our study to be the first of many large-scale phylogenomic analyses exploring the role of HT in genome evolution.\\n\\nSignificance statementLINE-1 (L1) elements occupy about half of most mammalian genomes (1), and they are believed to be strictly vertically inherited (2). Mutagenic L1 insertions are thought to account for approximately 1 of every 1000 random, disease-causing insertions in humans (4-7). Our research indicates that the very presence of L1s in humans, and other therian mammals, is due to an ancient transfer event - which has drastic implications for our perception of genome evolution. Using a machina analyses over 503 genomes, we trace the origins of L1 and BovB retrotransposons across the tree of life, and provide evidence of their long-term impact on eukaryotic evolution.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need for new antibacterial drugs effective against bacterial pathogens resistant to current drugs1-2. Nucleoside-analog inhibitors (NAIs) of viral nucleotide polymerases have had transformative impact in treatment of HIV3 and HCV4. NAIs of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) potentially could have major impact on treatment of bacterial infection, particularly because functional constraints on substitution of RNAP nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) binding sites4-5 could limit resistance emergence4-5. Here we report the discovery, from microbial extract screening, of an NAI that inhibits bacterial RNAP and exhibits antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant bacterial pathogens: pseudouridimycin (PUM). PUM is a novel microbial natural product consisting of a formamidinylated, N-hydroxylated Gly-Gln dipeptide conjugated to 6'-amino-pseudouridine. PUM potently and selectively inhibits bacterial RNAP in vitro, potently and selectively inhibits bacterial growth in culture, and potently clears infection in a mouse model of Streptococcus pyogenes peritonitis. PUM inhibits RNAP through a binding site on RNAP (the \\\"i+1\\\" NTP binding site) and mechanism (competition with UTP for occupancy of the \\\"i+1\\\" NTP binding site) that differ from those of the RNAP inhibitor and current antibacterial drug rifampin (Rif). PUM exhibits additive antibacterial activity when co-administered with Rif, exhibits no cross-resistance with Rif, and exhibits a spontaneous resistance rate an order-of-magnitude lower than that of Rif. The results provide the first example of a selective NAI of bacterial RNAP, provide an advanced lead compound for antibacterial drug development, and provide structural information and synthetic routes that enable lead optimization for antibacterial drug development.",

    "abstract": "CTLA4 is an essential negative regulator of T cell immune responses and is a key checkpoint regulating autoimmunity and anti-tumour immunity. Genetic mutations resulting in a quantitative defect in CTLA4 are associated with the development of an immune dysregulation syndrome. Endocytosis of CTLA4 is rapid and continuous with subsequent degradation or recycling. CTLA4 has two natural ligands, the surface transmembrane proteins CD80 and CD86 that are shared with the T cell co-stimulatory receptor CD28. Upon ligation with CD80/CD86, CTLA4 can remove these ligands from the opposing cells by transendocytosis. The efficiency of ligand removal is thought to be highly dependent on the processes involved in CTLA4 trafficking. With a combined in vitro-in silico study, we quantify the rates of CTLA4 internalization, recycling and degradation. We incorporate experimental data from cell lines and primary human T cells. Our model provides a framework for exploring the impact of altered affinity of natural ligands or therapeutic anti-CTLA4 antibodies and for predicting the effect of clinically relevant CTLA4 pathway mutations. The presented methodology for extracting trafficking rates can be transferred to the study of other transmembrane proteins.",

While most sporadic lung cancer cases are related to environmental factors such as smoking, genetic susceptibility may also play an important role and a number of lung cancer associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified although many remain to be found. The collective effects of genome wide minor alleles of common SNPs, or the minor allele content (MAC) in an individual, have been linked with quantitative variations of complex traits and diseases. Here we studied MAC in lung cancer using previously published SNP datasets and found higher MAC in cases relative to matched controls. A set of 25883 SNPs with MA (MAF < 0.5) more common in cases (P < 0.1) was found to have the best predictive accuracy. A weighted risk score calculated by using this set can predict 2.6% of lung cancer cases (100% specificity).

    "abstract": "An explosion in the number of available genome sequences obtained through metagenomics and single-cell genomics has enabled a new view of the diversity of microbial life, yet we know surprisingly little about how microbes interact with each other or their environment. In fact, the majority of microbial species remain uncultivated, while our perception of their ecological niches is based on reconstruction of their metabolic potential. In this work, we demonstrate how the \\\"seed set framework\\\", which computes the set of compounds that an organism must acquire from its environment (1), enables computational analysis of metabolic reconstructions, while providing new insights into a microbes metabolic capabilities, such as nutrient use and auxotrophies. We apply this framework to members of the ubiquitous freshwater Actinobacterial lineage acI, confirming and extending previous experimental and genomic observations implying that acI bacteria are heterotrophs reliant on peptides and saccharides. We also present the first metatranscriptomic study of the acI lineage, revealing high expression of transport proteins and the light-harvesting protein actinorhodopsin. Putative transport proteins complement predictions of nutrients and essential metabolites while providing additional support to the hypothesis that members of the acI are photoheterotrophs.\\n\\nImportanceThe metabolic activity of uncultivated microorganisms contributes to numerous ecosystem processes, ranging from nutrient cycling in the environment to influencing human health and disease. Advances in sequencing technology have enabled the assembly of genomes for these microorganisms, but our ability to generate reference genomes far outstrips our ability to analyze them. Common approaches to analyzing microbial metabolism require reconstructing the entirety of an organisms metabolic pathways, or performing targeted searches for genes involved in a specific process. This paper presents a third approach, in which draft metabolic reconstructions are used to identify compounds through which an organism may interact with its environment. These compounds can then guide more intensive metabolic reconstruction efforts, and also provide new hypotheses about the specific contributions microbes make to ecosystem-scale metabolic processes.",

A number of large scale genome wide association studies have identified numerous individual risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) whose precise roles in schizophrenia remain unknown. Accumulation of many of these risk alleles has been found to be a more important risk factor. Consistently, recent studies showed a role for enrichment of minor alleles (MAs) in complex diseases. Here we studied the role of MAs in general in schizophrenia using public datasets. Relative to matched controls, schizophrenia cases showed higher minor allele content (MAC), especially for the sporadic cases. By linkage analysis, we identified 82 419 SNPs that could be used to predict 2.2% schizophrenia cases with 100% certainty. Pathway enrichment analysis of these SNPs identified 17 pathways, 15 of which are known to be linked with Schizophrenia with the remaining 2 associated with other mental disorders. These results suggest a role for a collective effect of MAs in schizophrenia and provide a method to genetically screen for schizophrenia.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Indigenous populations of the Americas experienced high mortality rates during the early contact period as a result of infectious diseases, many of which were introduced by Europeans. Most of the pathogenic agents that caused these outbreaks remain unknown. Using a metagenomic tool called MALT to search for traces of ancient pathogen DNA, we were able to identify Salmonella enterica in individuals buried in an early contact era epidemic cemetery at Teposcolula-Yucundaa, Oaxaca in southern Mexico. This cemetery is linked to the 1545-1550 CE epidemic locally known as \\\"cocoliztli\\\", the cause of which has been debated for over a century. Here we present two reconstructed ancient genomes for Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Paratyphi C, a bacterial cause of enteric fever. We propose that S. Paratyphi C contributed to the population decline during the 1545 cocoliztli outbreak in Mexico.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryGenomic evidence of enteric fever identified in an indigenous population from early contact period Mexico.",

    "abstract": "Myosin Vc (myoVc) is unique among vertebrate class V myosin isoforms in that it requires teams of motors to transport cargo. Single molecules of myoVc cannot take multiple steps on single actin filaments, in stark contrast to the well-studied myosin Va (myoVa) isoform. Consistent with in vivo studies (1), only teams of myoVc motors can move continuously on actin bundles at physiologic ionic strength (2), raising the question of how motor-motor interactions cause this preference. Here, using DNA nanostructures as synthetic cargos for linking defined numbers of myoVa or myoVc molecules, we compared the stepping behavior of myoVa versus myoVc teams, and myoVc stepping patterns on single actin filaments versus actin bundles. Run lengths of both myoVa and myoVc teams increased with motor number, but the run lengths of myoVc teams were longer on actin bundles than on filaments. By resolving the stepping behavior of individual myoVc motors with a Qdot bound to the motor domain, we found that coupling of two myoVc molecules significantly decreases futile back/side steps, which were frequently observed for single myoVc motors. Data showing how changes in the inter-motor distance of two coupled myoVc motors affected stepping dynamics suggested that mechanical tension coordinates the stepping behavior of two molecules for efficient directional motion. Our study thus provides a molecular basis to explain how teams of myoVc motors are suited to transport cargos such as zymogen granules on actin bundles.",

    "abstract": "DNA (meta)barcoding is used to study biodiversity and is available for standardised assessments. However, it suffers from PCR bias, which can lead to the loss of specific taxa. PCR-free techniques such as shotgun metagenomics are therefore thought to be more suited for biodiversity assessments, but are currently limited by incomplete reference libraries.\\n\\nThe technique of  mitogenome-skimming or  mitogenomics, in which complete mitochondrial genomes are sequenced, is ideal to bridge the techniques of (meta)barcoding and metagenomics. However, without the enrichment of mitochondria, roughly 99 % of all sequencing reads are of non-mitochondrial origin and mostly useless for common applications, e.g. species identification.\\n\\nHere, we present a simple centrifugation protocol that leads to an average 140-fold enrichment of mitochondrial DNA. By sequencing six  mock- communities - comprising the freshwater taxa Corbicula fluminea, Gammarus roeselii and Hydropsyche exocellata each - we recovered whole mitochondrial genomes of these species and the acanthocephalan endoparasite Pomphorhynchus laevis.\\n\\nThe presented protocol will greatly speed up building reference libraries for whole mitochondrial genomes, as dozens of species could be sequenced on a single MiSeq run. Subsequently, it will also allow biodiversity assessments using mitogenomics at greatly reduced costs in comparison to mitogenomic approaches without prior enrichment for mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "The duplication of genes can occur through various mechanisms and is thought to make a major contribution to the evolutionary diversification of organisms. There is increasing evidence for a large-scale duplication of genes in some chelicerate lineages including two rounds of whole genome duplication (WGD) in horseshoe crabs. To investigate this further we sequenced and analyzed the genome of the common house spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum. We found pervasive duplication of both coding and non-coding genes in this spider, including two clusters of Hox genes. Analysis of synteny conservation across the P. tepidariorum genome suggests that there has been an ancient WGD in spiders. Comparison with the genomes of other chelicerates, including that of the newly sequenced bark scorpion Centruroides sculpturatus, suggests that this event occurred in the common ancestor of spiders and scorpions and is probably independent of the WGDs in horseshoe crabs. Furthermore, characterization of the sequence and expression of the Hox paralogs in P. tepidariorum suggests that many have been subject to neofunctionalization and/or subfunctionalization since their duplication, and therefore may have contributed to the diversification of spiders and other pulmonate arachnids.",
