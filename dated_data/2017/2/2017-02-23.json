    "abstract": "Empathy is the ability to recognize and respond to the emotional states of other individuals. It is an important psychological process that facilitates navigating social interactions and maintaining relationships, which are important for wellbeing. Several psychological studies have identified difficulties in both self-report and performance-based measures of empathy in a range of psychiatric conditions. To date, no study has systematically investigated the genetic architecture of empathy using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we report the results of the largest GWAS of empathy to date using a well-validated self-report measure of empathy, the Empathy Quotient (EQ), in 46,861 research participants from 23andMe, Inc. We identify 11 suggestive loci (P < 1x10-6), though none were significant at P < 2.5x10-8 after correcting for multiple testing. The most significant SNP was identified in the non-stratified analysis (rs4882760; P = 4.29x10-8), and is an intronic SNP in TMEM132C. The EQ had a modest but significant narrow-sense heritability (0.11{+/-}0.014; P = 1.7x10-14). As predicted, based on earlier work, we confirmed a significant female-advantage on the EQ (P < 2x10-16 Cohens d = 0.65). We identified similar SNP heritability and high genetic correlation between the sexes. Also, as predicted, we identified a significant negative genetic correlation between autism and the EQ (rg = -0.27{+/-}0.07, P = 1.63x10-4). We also identified a significant positive genetic correlation between the EQ and risk for schizophrenia (rg = 0.19{+/-}0.04; P= 1.36x10-5), risk for anorexia nervosa (rg = 0.32{+/-}0.09; P = 6x10-4), and extraversion (rg = 0.45{+/-}0.08; 5.7x10-8). This is the first GWAS of self-reported empathy. The results suggest that the genetic variations associated with empathy also play a role in psychiatric conditions and psychological traits.",

    "abstract": "Experimental evolution (EE) studies are powerful tools for observing molecular evolution \\\"in-action\\\" from populations sampled in controlled and natural environments. The advent of next generation sequencing technologies has made whole-genome and whole-population sampling possible, even for eukaryotic organisms with large genomes, and allowed us to locate the genes and variants responsible for genetic adaptation. While many computational tests have been developed for detecting regions under selection, they are mainly designed for static (single time) data, and work best when the favored allele is close to fixation.\\n\\nEE studies provide samples over multiple time points, underscoring the need for tools that can exploit the data. At the same time, EE studies are constrained by the limited time span since onset of selection, depending upon the generation time for the organism. This constraint impedes adaptation studies, as the population can only be evolve-and-resequenced for a small number of generations relative to the fixation time of the favored allele. Moreover, coverage in pool-sequenced experiments varies across replicates and time points, leading to heterogeneous ascertainment bias in measuring population allele frequency across different measurements.\\n\\nIn this article, we directly address these issues while developing tools for identifying selective sweep in pool-sequenced EE of sexual organisms and propose Composition of Likelihoods for Evolve-And-Resequence experiments (CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW). Extensive simulations show that CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW achieves higher power in detecting and localizing selection over a wide range of parameters. In contrast to existing methods, the CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW statistics are robust to variation of coverage. CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW also provides robust estimates of model parameters, including selection strength and overdominance, as byproduct of the statistical test, while being orders of magnitude faster than existing methods. Finally, we apply the CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW statistic to data from a study of D. melanogaster adaptation to alternating temperatures and discover enrichment of genes related to \\\"response to heat\\\" and \\\"cold acclimation\\\".",

    "abstract": "Modern systems biology requires extensive, carefully curated measurements of cellular components in response to different environmental conditions. While high-throughput methods have made transcriptomics and proteomics datasets widely accessible and relatively economical to generate, systematic measurements of both mRNA and protein abundances under a wide range of different conditions are still relatively rare. Here we present a detailed, genome-wide transcriptomics and proteomics dataset of E. coli grown under 34 different conditions. We manipulate concentrations of sodium and magnesium in the growth media, and we consider four different carbon sources glucose, gluconate, lactate, and glycerol. Moreover, samples are taken both in exponential and stationary phase, and we include two extensive time-courses, with multiple samples taken between 3 hours and 2 weeks. We find that exponential-phase samples systematically differ from stationary-phase samples, in particular at the level of mRNA. Regulatory responses to different carbon sources or salt stresses are more moderate, but we find numerous differentially expressed genes for growth on gluconate and under salt and magnesium stress. Our data set provides a rich resource for future computational modeling of E. coli gene regulation, transcription, and translation.",

    "abstract": "Humans and animals are capable of evaluating actions by considering their long-run future rewards through a process described using model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The mechanisms by which neural circuits perform the computations prescribed by model-based RL remain largely unknown; however, multiple lines of evidence suggest that neural circuits supporting model-based behavior are structurally homologous to and overlapping with those thought to carry out model-free temporal difference (TD) learning. Here, we lay out a family of approaches by which model-based computation may be built upon a core of TD learning. The foundation of this framework is the successor representation, a predictive state representation that, when combined with TD learning of value predictions, can produce a subset of the behaviors associated with model-based learning, while requiring less decision-time computation than dynamic programming. Using simulations, we delineate the precise behavioral capabilities enabled by evaluating actions using this approach, and compare them to those demonstrated by biological organisms. We then introduce two new algorithms that build upon the successor representation while progressively mitigating its limitations. Because this framework can account for the full range of observed putatively model-based behaviors while still utilizing a core TD framework, we suggest that it represents a neurally plausible family of mechanisms for model-based evaluation.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAccording to standard models, when confronted with a choice, animals and humans rely on two separate, distinct processes to come to a decision. One process deliberatively evaluates the consequences of each candidate action and is thought to underlie the ability to flexibly come up with novel plans. The other process gradually increases the propensity to perform behaviors that were previously successful and is thought to underlie automatically executed, habitual reflexes. Although computational principles and animal behavior support this dichotomy, at the neural level, there is little evidence supporting a clean segregation. For instance, although dopamine -- famously implicated in drug addiction and Parkinsons disease -- currently only has a well-defined role in the automatic process, evidence suggests that it also plays a role in the deliberative process. In this work, we present a computational framework for resolving this mismatch. We show that the types of behaviors associated with either process could result from a common learning mechanism applied to different strategies for how populations of neurons could represent candidate actions. In addition to demonstrating that this account can produce the full range of flexible behavior observed in the empirical literature, we suggest experiments that could detect the various approaches within this framework.",

In each system, self-assembly into oligomers is observed and can also result in poration of artificial membranes. Structural requirements for poration and the relationship of structure to cytotoxicity is unaddressed. Here, we focus on islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) mediated loss of insulin secreting cells in diabetics. Newly developed methods enable structure-function inquiry to focus on intracellular oligomers composed of hundreds of IAPP. The key insights are that porating oligomers are internally dynamic, grow in discrete steps and are not canonical amyloid. Moreover, two class of pores coexist; an IAPP-specific ligand establishes that only one is cytotoxic. Toxic rescue occurs by stabilizing non-toxic poration without displacing IAPP from mitochondria. These insights illuminate cytotoxic mechanism in diabetes and also provide a generalizable approach for inquiry applicable to other partially ordered protein assemblies.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe peptide amyloid precursor, IAPP, forms two classes of membrane porating oligomers.\\nC_LIO_LIThe two classes have a >100-fold difference in pore size with the large pore form correlated with mitochondrial depolarization and toxicity.\\nC_LIO_LIA drug-like molecule distinguishes between the two oligomer classes and rescues toxicity by stabilizing non-toxic poration without displacing IAPP from the mitochondria.\\nC_LIO_LIThe mechanism of pore-forming oligomer assembly includes stepwise coalescence of smaller, dynamic assemblies.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Trees represent the largest terrestrial carbon sink and a renewable source of ligno-cellulose. There is significant scope for yield and quality improvement in these largely undomesticated species, and efforts to engineer new, elite varieties will benefit from an improved understanding of the transcriptional network underlying cambial growth and wood formation. We generated high-spatial-resolution RNA Sequencing data spanning the secondary phloem, vascular cambium and wood forming tissues. The transcriptome comprised 28,294 expressed, previously annotated genes, 78 novel protein-coding genes and 567 long intergenic non-coding RNAs. Most paralogs originating from the Salicaceae whole genome duplication were found to have diverged expression, with the notable exception of those with high expression during secondary cell wall deposition. Co-expression network analysis revealed that the regulation of the transcriptome underlying cambial growth and wood formation comprises numerous modules forming a continuum of active processes across the tissues. The high spatial resolution enabled identification of novel roles for characterised genes involved in xylan and cellulose biosynthesis, regulators of xylem vessel and fiber differentiation and lignification.

    "abstract": "Episodic memory impairment is a consistent, pronounced deficit in pre-clinical stages of late-onset Alzheimers disease (AD). Individuals with risk factors for AD exhibit altered brain function several decades prior to the onset of AD-related symptoms. In the current event-related fMRI study of spatial context memory we tested the hypothesis that middle-aged adults (MA; 40-58yrs) with a family history of late onset AD (MA+FH), or a combined +FH and apolipoprotein E {varepsilon}4 allele risk factors for AD (MA+FH+APOE4), will exhibit differences in encoding and retrieval-related brain activity, compared to - FH-APOE4 MA controls. We also hypothesized that the two at-risk MA groups will exhibit distinct patterns of correlation between brain activity and memory performance, compared to controls. To test these hypotheses we conducted multivariate task, and behavior, partial least squares analysis of fMRI data obtained during successful context encoding and retrieval. Our results indicate that even though there were no significant group differences in context memory performance, there were significant differences in brain activity and brain-behavior correlations involving hippocampus, left angular gyrus, cingulate, and precuneus in MA with AD risk factors, compared to controls. In addition, we observed that brain activity and brain-behavior correlations in anterior-medial PFC and in ventral visual cortex differentiated the two MA risk groups from each other, and from MAcontrols. This is the first study to show that there are differences in the brain areas engaged during context memory encoding and retrieval in middle-aged adults with +FH and +APOE-4 risk factors for late onset AD, compared to controls.",

    "abstract": "Bioinformatics sequence databases such as Genbank or UniProt contain hundreds of millions of records of genomic data. These records are derived from direct submissions from individual laboratories, as well as from bulk submissions from large-scale sequencing centres; their diversity and scale means that they suffer from a range of data quality issues including errors, discrepancies, redundancies, ambiguities, incompleteness, and inconsistencies with the published literature. In this work, we seek to investigate and analyze the data quality of sequence databases from the perspective of a curator, who must detect anomalous and suspicious records.\\n\\nSpecifically, we emphasize the detection of inconsistent records with respect to the literature. Focusing on GenBank, we propose a set of 24 quality indicators, which are based on treating a record as a query into the published literature, and then use query quality predictors. We then carry out an analysis that shows that the proposed quality indicators and the quality of the records have a mutual relationship, in which one depends on the other. We propose to represent record-literature consistency as a vector of these quality indicators. By reducing the dimensionality of this representation for visualization purposes using Principal Component Analysis, we show that records which have been reported as inconsistent with the literature fall roughly in the same area, and therefore share similar characteristics. By manually analyzing records not previously known to be erroneous that fall in the same area than records know to be inconsistent, we show that 1 record out of 4 is inconsistent with respect to the literature. This high density of inconsistent record opens the way towards the development of automatic methods for the detection of faulty records. We conclude that literature inconsistency is a meaningful strategy for identifying suspicious records.",

Under this reciprocally imposed selective regime, we expect to see a runaway evolutionary arms race, ultimately leading to the extinction of one species. Despite this prediction, in many systems host and pathogen coexist with minimal coevolution even when well-mixed. Previous work explained this puzzling phenomenon by invoking fitness tradeoffs, which can diminish an arms race dynamic. Here we propose that the regular loss of immunity by the bacterial host can also produce host-phage coexistence. We pair a general model of immunity with an experimental and theoretical case study of the CRISPR-Cas immune system to contrast the behavior of tradeoff and loss mechanisms in well-mixed systems. We find that, while both mechanisms can produce stable coexistence, only immune loss does so robustly within realistic parameter ranges.",

    "abstract": "Currently, non-invasive methods for studying the human brain do not reliably measure spike-rate-dependent signals, independent of other responses such as hemodynamic coupling (fMRI) and subthreshold neuronal synchrony (oscillations and event-related potentials). In contrast, invasive methods - animal microelectrode recordings and human electrocorticography (ECoG) - have recently measured broadband power elevation in field potentials (~50-200Hz) as a proxy for the locally averaged spike rates. Here, we sought to detect and quantify stimulus-related broadband responses using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in individual subjects. Because extracranial measurements like MEG have multiple global noise sources and a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, we developed an automated denoising technique, adapted from (Kay et al., 2013), that helps reveal the broadband signal of interest. Subjects viewed 12-Hz contrast-reversing patterns in the left, right, or bilateral visual field. Sensor time series were separated into an evoked component (12-Hz amplitude) and a broadband component (60-150Hz, excluding stimulus harmonics). In all subjects, denoised broadband responses were reliably measured in sensors over occipital cortex. The spatial pattern of the broadband measure depended on the stimulus, with greater broadband power in sensors contralateral to the stimulus. Because we obtain reliable broadband estimates with relatively short experiments (~20 minutes), with a sufficient signal-to-noise-ratio to distinguish responses to different stimuli, we conclude that MEG broadband signals, denoised with our method, offer a practical, non-invasive means for characterizing spike-rate-dependent neural activity for a wide range of scientific questions about human brain function.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNeuronal activity causes perturbations in nearby electrical fields. These perturbations can be measured non-invasively in the living human brain using EEG and MEG. These techniques have emphasized two kinds of measurements: oscillations and event-related responses. A third type of signal, a stimulus-related increase in power spanning a wide range of frequencies ( broadband), is routinely measured in invasive recordings, but not with MEG and EEG. This broadband response is of great interest because unlike oscillations and event-related responses, it is correlated with neuronal spike rates. Here we report quantitative, spatially specific measurements of broadband fields in individual human subjects using MEG. These results demonstrate that a spike-rate-dependent measure of brain activity can be obtained non-invasively from the living human brain.",

    "abstract": "The availability of a whole-genome sequenced mutant population and the cataloging of mutations of each line at a single-nucleotide resolution facilitates functional genomic analysis. To this end, we generated and sequenced a fast-neutron-induced mutant population in the model rice cultivar Kitaake (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica), which completes its life cycle in 9 weeks. We sequenced 1,504 mutant lines at 45-fold coverage and identified 91,513 mutations affecting 32,307 genes, 58% of all rice genes. We detected an average of 61 mutations per line. Mutation types include single base substitutions, deletions, insertions, inversions, translocations, and tandem duplications. We observed a high proportion of loss-of-function mutations.

This result reveals the usefulness of the resource for efficient identification of genes conferring specific phenotypes.

This biosynthesis is essential for individuals subsisting on LCPUFAs-poor, plant-based diets. Positive selection on FADS genes has been reported in multiple populations, but its presence and pattern in Europeans remain elusive. Here, with analyses of ancient and modern DNA, we demonstrated that positive selection acted on the same FADS variants both before and after the advent of farming in Europe, but on opposite alleles. Selection in recent farmers also varied geographically, with the strongest signal in Southern Europe. These varying selection patterns concur with anthropological evidence of differences in diets, and with the association of recently-adaptive alleles with higher FADS1 expression and enhanced LCPUFAs biosynthesis. Genome-wide association studies revealed associations of recently-adaptive alleles with not only LCPUFAs, but also other lipids and decreased risk of several inflammation-related diseases.",

We use this method to map loci for flowering time within natural populations of Mimulus guttatus, collecting the early and late flowering plants from each of three neighboring populations and two consecutive generations. We find appreciable variation in genetic effects on flowering time across both time and space; the greatest differences evident between populations.

    "abstract": "Genome dynamics relate to regulation of gene expression, the most fundamental process in biology. Yet we still do not know whether the very process of transcription drives spatial organization and chromatin conformation at specific gene loci. To address this issue, we have optimized the ANCHOR/ParB DNA labeling system for real-time imaging and quantitative analysis of the dynamics of a single-copy transgene in human cells. Transcription of the transgene under the control of the endogenous Cyclin D1 promoter was induced by addition of 17{beta}-estradiol. Motion of the ANCHOR3-tagged DNA locus was recorded in the same cell prior to and during appearance of nascent mRNA visualized using the MS2 system. We found that transcription initiation resulted in rapid confinement of the mRNA-producing gene. The confinement was maintained even upon inhibition of pol2 elongation. It did not occur when recruitment of pol2 or transcription initiation was blocked by anti-estrogens or Triptolide. These results suggest that preinitiation complex formation and concomitant reorganization of the chromatin domain constrains freedom of movement of an induced genes promoter within minutes. Confined diffusion reflects assembly of functional protein hubs and DNA processing during the rate-limiting steps of transcription.",

    "abstract": "Microbes may maximize the number of daughter cells per time or per amount of nutrients consumed. These two strategies correspond, respectively, to the use of enzyme-efficient or substrate-efficient metabolic pathways. In reality, fast growth is often associated with wasteful, yield-inefficient metabolism, and a general thermodynamic trade-off between growth rate and biomass yield has been proposed to explain this. We studied growth rate/yield trade-offs by using a novel modeling framework, Enzyme-Flux Cost Minimization (EFCM) and by assuming that the growth rate depends directly on the enzyme investment per rate of biomass production. In a comprehensive mathematical model of core metabolism in E. coli, we screened all elementary flux modes leading to cell synthesis, characterized them by the growth rates and yields they provide, and studied the shape of the resulting rate/yield Pareto front. By varying the model parameters, we found that the rate/yield trade-off is not universal, but depends on metabolic kinetics and environmental conditions. A prominent trade-off emerges under oxygen-limited growth, where yield-inefficient pathways support a 2-to-3 times higher growth rate than yield-efficient pathways. EFCM can be widely used to predict optimal metabolic states and growth rates under varying nutrient levels, perturbations of enzyme parameters, and single or multiple gene knockouts.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWhen cells compete for nutrients, those that grow faster and produce more offspring per time are favored by natural selection. In contrast, when cells need to maximize the cell number at a limited nutrient supply, fast growth does not matter and an efficient use of nutrients (i.e. high biomass yield) is essential. This raises a basic question about metabolism: can cells achieve high growth rates and yields simultaneously, or is there a conflict between the two goals? Using a new modeling method called Enzymatic Flux Cost Minimization (EFCM), we predict cellular growth rates and find that growth rate/yield trade-offs and the ensuing preference for enzyme-efficient or substrate-efficient metabolic pathways are not universal, but depend on growth conditions such as external glucose and oxygen concentrations.",

It is therefore important to quantitatively understand how spatial proximity affects interactions in different environments. We test how proximity influences colony size when either Escherichia coli or Salmonella enterica are grown on different carbon sources. The importance of colony location changes with species and carbon source. Spatially-explicit, genome-scale metabolic modeling predicts colony size variation, supporting the hypothesis that metabolic mechanisms and diffusion are sufficient to explain the majority of observed variation. Geometrically, individual colony sizes are best predicted by Voronoi diagrams, which identify the territory that is closest to each colony. This means that relative colony growth is largely independent of the distance to colonies beyond those that set territory boundaries. Further, the effect of location increases when colonies take-up resource quickly relative to the diffusion of limiting resources. These analyses made it apparent that the importance of location was smaller than expected for experiments with colonies growing on sugars. The accumulation of toxic byproducts appears to limit the growth of large colonies and reduce variation in colony size. Our work provides an experimentally and theoretically grounded understanding of how location interacts with metabolism and diffusion to influence microbial interactions.",

    "abstract": "Many animal social structures are organized hierarchically, with dominant individuals monopolizing resources. Dominance hierarchies have received great attention from behavioural and evolutionary ecologists. As a result, there are many methods for inferring hierarchies from social interactions. Yet, there are no clear guidelines about how many observed dominance interactions (i.e. sampling effort) are necessary for inferring reliable dominance hierarchies, nor are there any established tools for quantifying their uncertainty. In this study, we simulated interactions (winners and losers) in scenarios of varying steepness (the probability that a dominant defeats a subordinate based on their difference in rank). Using these data, we (1) quantify how the number of interactions recorded and hierarchy steepness affect the performance of three methods, (2) propose an amendment that improves the performance of a popular method, and (3) suggest two easy procedures to measure uncertainty in the inferred hierarchy. First, we found that the ratio of interactions to individuals required to infer reliable hierarchies is surprisingly low, but depends on the hierarchy steepness and method used. We then show that Davids score and our novel randomized Elo-rating are the two best methods, whereas the original Elo-rating and the recently described ADAGIO perform less well. Finally, we propose two simple methods to estimate uncertainty at the individual and group level. These uncertainty measures further allow to differentiate non-existent, very flat and highly uncertain hierarchies from intermediate, steep and certain hierarchies. Overall, we find that the methods for inferring dominance hierarchies are relatively robust, even when the ratio of observed interactions to individuals is as low as 10 to 20. However, we suggest that implementing simple procedures for estimating uncertainty will benefit researchers, and quantifying the shape of the dominance hierarchies will provide new insights into the study organisms.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDavids score and the randomized Elo-rating perform best.\\nC_LIO_LIMethod performance depends on hierarchy steepness and sampling effort.\\nC_LIO_LIGenerally, inferring dominance hierarchies requires relatively few observations.\\nC_LIO_LIThe R package \\\"aniDom\\\" allows easy estimation of hierarchy uncertainty.\\nC_LIO_LIHierarchy uncertainty provides insights into the shape of the dominance hierarchy.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Genomic rearrangements are a hallmark of childhood solid tumors, but their mutational causes remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the piggyBac transposable element derived 5 (PGBD5) gene as an enzymatically active human DNA transposase expressed in the majority of rhabdoid tumors, a lethal childhood cancer. Using assembly-based whole-genome DNA sequencing, we observed previously unknown somatic genomic rearrangements in primary human rhabdoid tumors. These rearrangements were characterized by deletions and inversions involving PGBD5-specific signal (PSS) sequences at their breakpoints, with some recurrently targeting tumor suppressor genes, leading to their inactivation. PGBD5 was found to be physically associated with human genomic PSS sequences that were also sufficient to mediate PGBD5-induced DNA rearrangements in rhabdoid tumor cells. We found that ectopic expression of PGBD5 in primary immortalized human cells was sufficient to promote penetrant cell transformation in vitro and in immunodeficient mice in vivo. This activity required specific catalytic residues in the PGBD5 transposase domain, as well as end-joining DNA repair, and induced distinct structural rearrangements, involving PSS-associated breakpoints, similar to those found in primary human rhabdoid tumors. This defines PGBD5 as an oncogenic mutator and provides a plausible mechanism for site-specific DNA rearrangements in childhood and adult solid tumors.",

To succeed, the search must stop only when the perfect homology is found. The biological process that ensures such a genomic integrity is called Homologous Recombination and is promoted by the Recombinase proteins.

Whilst we do not detect interaction with known H3-H4 chaperones in the cytosol we do detect interaction with a number of importin-{beta} proteins, that may serve a dual import and chaperoning function, preventing aggregation of histones until they are handed-off to the core histone chaperoning machinery in the nucleus.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which rewards deviate from learned expectations is tracked by a signal known as a \\\"reward prediction error\\\", but it is unclear how this signal interacts with episodic memory. Here, we investigated whether learning in a high-risk environment, with frequent large prediction errors, gives rise to higher fidelity memory traces than learning in a low-risk environment. In Experiment 1, we showed that higher magnitude prediction errors, positive or negative, improved recognition memory for trial-unique items. Participants also increased their learning rate after large prediction errors. In addition, there was an overall higher learning rate in the low-risk environment. Although unsigned prediction errors enhanced memory and increased learning rate, we did not find a relationship between learning rate and memory, suggesting that these two effects were due to separate underlying mechanisms. In Experiment 2, we replicated these results with a longer task that posed stronger memory demands and allowed for more learning. We also showed improved source and sequence memory for high-risk items. In Experiment 3, we controlled for the difficulty of learning in the two risk environments, again replicating the previous results. Moreover, equating the range of prediction errors in the two risk environments revealed that learning in a high-risk context enhanced episodic memory above and beyond the effect of prediction errors to individual items. In summary, our results across three studies showed that (absolute) prediction error magnitude boosted both episodic memory and incremental learning, but the two effects were not correlated, suggesting distinct underlying systems.",

Signal propagation is demonstrated across transmission lines of different lengths and orientations, and logic gates are modularly combined into circuits that establish the universality of our approach. Because reactions preferentially occur between neighbors, identical DNA hairpins can be reused across circuits.

    "abstract": "Counteracting the destabilizing force of gravity is usually considered to be the main purpose of postural control. However, from the consideration of the mechanical requirements for movement, we argue that posture is adjusted in view of providing impetus for movement. Thus, we show that the posture that is usually adopted in quiet standing in fact allows torque for potential movement. Moreover, when performing a movement - either voluntarily or in response to an external perturbation - we show that the postural adjustments are organized both spatially and temporally so as to provide the required torque for the movement. Thus, when movement is performed skillfully, the force of gravity is not counteracted but actually used to provide impetus to movement. This ability to move ones weight so as to exploit the torque of gravity seems to be dependent on development and skill learning, and is impaired in aging.",

    "abstract": "The field of microbiology has experienced significant growth due to transformative advances in technology and the influx of scientists driven by a curiosity to understand how microbes sustain myriad biochemical processes that maintain the Earth. With this explosion in scientific output, a significant bottleneck has been the ability to rapidly disseminate new knowledge to peers and the public. Preprints have emerged as a tool that a growing number of microbiologists are using to overcome this bottleneck. Posting preprints can help to transparently recruit a more diverse pool of reviewers prior to submitting to a journal for formal peer-review. Although use of preprints is still limited in the biological sciences, early indications are that preprints are a robust tool that can complement and enhance peer-reviewed publications. As publishing moves to embrace advances in internet technology, there are many opportunities for preprints and peer-reviewed journals to coexist in the same ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "On November 18-19, 2016, the Human Frontier Science Program Organization (HFSPO) hosted a meeting of senior managers of key data resources and leaders of several major funding organizations to discuss the challenges associated with sustaining biological and biomedical (i.e., life sciences) data resources and associated infrastructure. A strong consensus emerged from the group that core data resources for the life sciences should be supported through a coordinated international effort(s) that better ensure long-term sustainability and that appropriately align funding with scientific impact. Ideally, funding for such data resources should allow for access at no charge, as is presently the usual (and preferred) mechanism. Below, the rationale for this vision is described, and some important considerations for developing a new international funding model to support core data resources for the life sciences are presented.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe type and variety of learning strategies used by individuals to acquire behaviours in the wild are poorly understood, despite the presence of behavioural traditions in diverse taxa. Social learning strategies such as conformity can be broadly adaptive, but may also retard the spread of adaptive innovations. Strategies like payoff-biased learning, in contrast, are effective at diffusing new behaviour but may perform poorly when adaptive behaviour is common. We present a field experiment in a wild primate, Cebus capucinus, that introduced a novel food item and documented the innovation and diffusion of successful extraction techniques. We develop a multilevel, Bayesian statistical analysis that allows us to quantify individual-level evidence for different social and individual learning strategies. We find that payoff-biased social learning and age-biased social learning are primarily responsible for the diffusion of new techniques. We find no evidence of conformity; instead rare techniques receive slightly increased attention. We also find substantial and important variation in individual learning strategies that is patterned by age, with younger individuals being more influenced by both social information and their own individual experience. The aggregate cultural dynamics in turn depend upon the variation in learning strategies and the age structure of the wild population.",

    "abstract": "One of the major challenges in visual neuroscience is represented by foreground-background segmentation. Data from nonhuman primates show that segmentation leads to two distinct, but associated processes: the enhancement of neural activity during figure processing (i.e., foreground enhancement) and the suppression of background-related activity (i.e., background suppression). To study foreground-background segmentation in ecological conditions, we introduce a novel method based on parametric modulation of low-level image properties followed by application of simple computational image-processing models. By correlating the outcome of this procedure with human fMRI activity measured during passive viewing of 334 natural images, we reconstruct easily interpretable \\\"neural images\\\" from seven visual areas: V1, V2, V3, V3A, V3B, V4 and LOC. Results show evidence of foreground enhancement for all tested regions, while background suppression specifically occurs in V4 and LOC. \\\"Neural images\\\" reconstructed from V4 and LOC revealed a preserved spatial resolution of foreground textures, indicating a richer representation of the salient part of natural images, rather than a simplistic model of object shape. Our results indicate that scene segmentation is an automatic process that occurs during natural viewing, even when individuals are not required to perform any particular task.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is an important global public health problem. Human gut human microbiota is an accumulator of resistance genes potentially providing them to pathogens. It is important to develop tools for identifying the mechanisms of how resistance is transmitted between gut microbial species and pathogens. We developed MetaCherchant - an algorithm for extracting the genomic environment of antibiotic resistance genes from metagenomic data in the form of a graph. The algorithm was validated on simulated datasets and applied to new \\\"shotgun\\\" metagenomes of gut microbiota from patients with Helicobacter pylori who underwent antibiotic therapy. Genomic context was reconstructed for several dominant resistance genes; taxonomic annotation of the context showed the species carrying the genes. Application of MetaCherchant in differential mode produced specific graph structures suggesting the evidence of possible resistance gene transmission within a mobile element that occurred as a result of the antibiotic therapy. MetaCherchant is a promising tool giving researchers an opportunity to get an insight into dynamics of resistance transmission in vivo based on metagenomic data.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the Middle Temporal area (MT) of the primate cerebral cortex respond to moving visual stimuli. The sensitivity of MT neurons to motion signals can be characterized by using random-dot stimuli, in which the strength of the motion signal is manipulated by adding different levels of noise (elements that move in random directions). In macaques, this has allowed the calculation of \\\"neurometric\\\" thresholds. We characterized the responses of MT neurons in sufentanil/nitrous oxide anesthetized marmoset monkeys, a species which has attracted considerable recent interest as an animal model for vision research. We found that MT neurons show a wide range of neurometric thresholds, and that the responses of the most sensitive neurons could account for the behavioral performance of macaques and humans. We also investigated factors that contributed to the wide range of observed thresholds. The difference in firing rate between responses to motion in the preferred and null directions was the most effective predictor of neurometric threshold, whereas the direction tuning bandwidth had no correlation with the threshold. We also showed that it is possible to obtain reliable estimates of neurometric thresholds using stimuli that were not highly optimized for each neuron, as is often necessary when recording from large populations of neurons with different receptive field concurrently, as was the case in this study. These results demonstrate that marmoset MT shows an essential physiological similarity to macaque MT, and suggest that its neurons are capable of representing motion signals that allow for comparable motion-in-noise judgments.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyWe report the activity of neurons in marmoset MT in response to random-dot motion stimuli of varying coherence. The information carried by individual MT neurons was comparable to that of the macaque, and that the maximum firing rates were a strong predictor of sensitivity. Our study provides key information regarding the neural basis of motion perception in the marmoset, a small primate species that is becoming increasingly popular as an experimental model.",
