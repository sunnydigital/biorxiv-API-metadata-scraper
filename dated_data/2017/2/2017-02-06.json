    "abstract": "Zika is an emerging virus whose rapid spread is of great public health concern. Knowledge about transmission remains incomplete, especially concerning potential transmission in geographic areas in which it has not yet been introduced. To identify unknown vectors of Zika, we developed a data-driven model linking vector species and the Zika virus via vector-virus trait combinations that confer a propensity toward associations in an ecological network connecting flaviviruses and their mosquito vectors. Our model predicts that thirty-five species may be able to transmit the virus, seven of which are found in the continental United States, including Culex quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens. We suggest that empirical studies prioritize these species to confirm predictions of vector competence, enabling the correct identification of populations at risk for transmission within the United States.",

However, there are different non-correlated findings that need explanations. Examples include a) a delay of at least thirty seconds for LTP induction after stimulation that does not match with milliseconds of time required for associative learning, and b) the deficiency of the LTP mechanism for providing a structure-function mechanism for working memory. By viewing memories as first-person inner sensations, a derived mechanism can explain various features of LTP and its mismatched findings with that of normal learning.",

    "abstract": "We outline what we believe could be an improvement in future discussions of the brain acting as a Bayesian-Laplacian system. We do so by distinguishing between two broad classes of priors on which the brains inferential systems operate: in one category are biological priors ({beta} priors) and in the other artifactual ones ( priors). We argue that {beta} priors, of which colour categories and faces are good examples, are inherited or acquired very rapidly after birth, are highly or relatively resistant to change through experience, and are common to all humans. The consequence is that the probability of posteriors generated from {beta} priors having universal assent and agreement is high. By contrast,  priors, of which man-made objects are examples, are acquired post-natally and modified at various stages throughout post-natal life; they are much more accommodating of, and hospitable to, new experiences. Consequently, posteriors generated from them are less likely to find universal assent. Taken together, in addition to the more limited capacity of experiment and experience to alter the {beta} priors compared to  priors, another cardinal distinction between the two is that the probability of posteriors generated from {beta} priors having universal agreement is greater than that for  priors. The two categories are not, however, always totally distinct and can merge into one another to varying extents, resulting in posteriors that draw upon both categories.",

    "abstract": "Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia via nitrite to nitrate, has always been considered to be catalyzed by the concerted activity of ammonia and nitrite-oxidizing microorganisms. Only recently, complete ammonia oxidizers ( comammox), which oxidize ammonia to nitrate on their own, were identified in the bacterial genus Nitrospira, previously assumed to contain only canonical nitrite oxidizers. Nitrospira are widespread in nature, but for assessments of the distribution and functional importance of comammox Nitrospira in ecosystems, cultivation-independent tools to distinguish comammox from strictly nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospira are required. Here we developed new PCR primer sets that specifically target the amoA genes coding for subunit A of the distinct ammonia monooxygenase of comammox Nitrospira. While existing primers capture only a fraction of the known comammox amoA diversity, the new primer sets cover as much as 95% of the comammox amoA clade A and 92% of the clade B sequences in a reference database containing 326 comammox amoA genes with sequence information at the primer binding sites. Application of the primers to 13 samples from engineered systems (a groundwater well, drinking water treatment and wastewater treatment plants) and other habitats (rice paddy and forest soils, rice rhizosphere, brackish lake sediment and freshwater biofilm) detected comammox Nitrospira in all samples and revealed a considerable diversity of comammox in most habitats. Excellent primer specificity for comammox amoA was achieved by avoiding the use of highly degenerate primer preparations and by using equimolar mixtures of oligonucleotides that match existing comammox amoA genes. Quantitative PCR with these equimolar primer mixtures was highly sensitive and specific, and enabled the efficient quantification of clade A and clade B comammox amoA gene copy numbers in environmental samples. The measured relative abundances of comammox Nitrospira, compared to canonical ammonia oxidizers, were highly variable across environments. The new comammox amoA-targeted primers will enable more encompassing studies of nitrifying microorganisms in diverse ecosystems.",

We suggest a novel methodology, called Googlomics, for the structural analysis of directed biological networks using spectral analysis of their Google matrices, using parallels with quantum scattering theory, developed for nuclear and mesoscopic physics and quantum chaos. We introduce the reduced Google matrix method for the regulatory biological networks and demonstrate how its computation allows inferring hidden causal relations between the members of a signaling pathway or a functionally related group of genes. We investigate how the structure of hidden causal relations can be reprogrammed as the result of changes in the transcriptional network layer during cancerogenesis. The suggested Googlomics approach rigorously characterizes complex systemic changes in the wiring of large causal biological networks.",

Polygenic risk profiles could aid in unraveling the role that common variation confers on disease risk within a pedigree that would have traditionally been viewed through the prism of monogenic inheritance only. We illustrate our discussion by analyzing polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder in a large pedigree (n~260) in which 30% of family members suffer from major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. We apply polygenic risk scores to study patterns of assortative mating and anticipation, whereby it appears increased polygenic risk for psychiatric disorders is contributed by affected individuals who married into the family, resulting in an increasing genetic risk over generations in the family. This may explain the observation of anticipation in mood disorders, whereby onset is earlier and the severity of a disease increases over the generations of a family. Joint analyses of both rare and common variation may be the most powerful way to understand the familial genetics of mood and psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "RNA viruses replicate with high mutation rates, creating closely related viral populations. The heterogeneous virus populations, referred to as viral quasispecies, rapidly adapt to environmental changes thus adversely affecting efficiency of antiviral drugs and vaccines. Therefore, studying the underlying genetic heterogeneity of viral populations plays a significant role in the development of effective therapeutic treatments. Recent high-throughput sequencing technologies have provided invaluable opportunity for uncovering the structure of quasispecies populations (i.e., reconstruction of viral sequences and discovery of their relative frequencies). However, accurate reconstruction of viral quasispecies remains difficult due to limited read-lengths and presence of sequencing errors. The problem is particularly challenging when the strains in a population are highly similar, i.e., the sequences are characterized by low mutual genetic distances, and further exacerbated if some of those strains are relatively rare; this is the setting where state-of-the-art methods struggle. In this paper, we present a novel viral quasispecies reconstruction algorithm, aBayesQR, that employs a maximum-likelihood framework to infer individual sequences in a mixture from high-throughput sequencing data. The search for the most likely quasispecies is conducted on long contigs that our method constructs from the set of short reads via agglomerative hierarchical clustering; operating on contigs rather than short reads enables identification of close strains in a population and provides computational tractability of the Bayesian method. Results on both simulated and real HIV-1 data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm generally outperforms state-of-the-art methods; aBayesQR particularly stands out when reconstructing a set of closely related viral strains (e.g., quasispecies characterized by low diversity).",

Despite its importance for biogeography, the specific role of mountain ranges as a dispersal barrier between South and Central American lowland plant lineages is still poorly understood. The swan orchids (Cycnoches) comprise ca 34 epiphytic species distributed in lowland and pre-montane forests of Central and South America. Here, we study the historical biogeography of Cycnoches to better understand the impact of the Andean uplift on the diversification of Neotropical lowland plant lineages. Using novel molecular sequences (five nuclear and plastid regions) and twelve biogeographic models with and without founder-event speciation, we infer that the most recent common ancestor of Cycnoches may have originated in Amazonia ca 5 Mya. The first colonization of Central America occurred from a direct migration event from Amazonia, and multiple bidirectional trans-Andean migrations between Amazonia and Central America took place subsequently. Notably, such biological exchange occurred well after major mountain building periods. The Andes have not acted as an impassable barrier for epiphytic lowland lineages such as orchids having a great potential for effortless dispersal because of the very light, anemochorous seeds.",

    "abstract": "The effects of motor learning, such as motor adaptation, in stroke rehabilitation are often transient, thus mandating approaches that enhance the amount of learning and retention. Previously, we showed in young individuals that reward-and punishment-feedback have dissociable effects on motor adaptation, with punishment improving adaptation and reward enhancing retention. If these findings were able to generalise to stroke patients, they would provide a way to optimize motor learning in these patients. Therefore, we tested this in 45 chronic stroke patients allocated in three groups. Patients performed reaching movements with their paretic arm with a robotic manipulandum. After training (day 1), day 2 involved adapting to a novel force-field. During this adaptation phase, patients received performance-based feedback according to the group they were allocated: reward, punishment or no feedback (neutral). On day 3, patients readapted to the force-field but all groups now received neutral feedback. All patients adapted, with reward and punishment groups displaying greater adaptation and readaptation than the neutral group, irrespective of demographic, cognitive or functional differences. Remarkably, the reward and punishment groups adapted to similar degree as healthy controls. Finally, the reward group showed greater retention. This study provides, for the first time, evidence that reward and punishment can enhance motor adaptation in stroke patients. Further research on reinforcement-based motor learning regimes is warranted to translate these promising results into clinical practice and improve motor rehabilitation outcomes in stroke patients.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic drive occurs when a selfish element increases its transmission frequency above the Mendelian ratio by hijacking the asymmetric divisions of female meiosis. Meiotic drive causes genomic conflict and potentially has a major impact on genome evolution, but only a few drive loci of large effect have been described. New methods to reliably detect meiotic drive are therefore needed, particularly for discovering moderate-strength drivers that are likely to be more prevalent in natural populations than strong drivers. Here we report an efficient method that uses sequencing of large pools of backcross (BC1) progeny to test for deviations from Mendelian segregation genome-wide of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that distinguish the parental strains. We show that meiotic drive can be detected by a characteristic pattern of decay in distortion of SNP frequencies, caused by recombination unlinking the driver from distal loci. We further show that control crosses allow allele-frequency distortion caused by meiotic drive to be distinguished from distortion resulting from developmental effects. We used this approach to test whether chromosomes with extreme telomere-length differences segregate at Mendelian ratios, as telomeric regions are a potential hotspot for meiotic drive due to their roles in meiotic segregation and multiple observations of high rates of telomere sequence evolution. Using four different pairings of long and short telomere strains, we find no evidence that extreme telomere-length variation causes meiotic drive in Drosophila. However, we identify one candidate meiotic driver in a centromere-linked region that shows an ~8% increase in transmission frequency, corresponding to a ~54:46 segregation ratio. Our results show that candidate meiotic drivers of moderate strength can be readily detected and localized in pools of F1 progeny.",

The influence of fossil data on the probabilistic distribution of trees is the crux of the matter considered here. More specifically, among all the phylogenies that a tree model (e.g., the birth-death process) generates, only a fraction of them \\\"agree\\\" with the fossil data at hands. Bayesian inference of divergence times using Markov Chain Monte Carlo requires taking this fraction into account. Yet, doing so is challenging and most Bayesian samplers have simply overlooked this hurdle so far, thereby providing approximate estimates of divergence times and tree process parameters. A generic solution to this issue is presented here. This solution relies on an original technique, the so-called exchange algorithm, dedicated to drawing samples from \\\"doubly intractable\\\" distributions. A small example illustrates the problem of interest and the impact of the approximation aforementioned on tree parameter estimates. The analysis of land plant sequences and multiple fossils further illustrates the importance of proper mathematical handling of calibration data in order to derive accurate estimates of node age.",

    "abstract": "Both common and rare genetic variation play a role in the causes for mood disorders. Very large families pose unique opportunities and analytical challenges but may provide a way to identify regions and mutations associated with mood disorders. We identified a family with a high prevalence (~30%) of mood disorders in a rural village in Brazil, featuring decreasing age of onset over generations. The pattern of inheritance was complex with 32 Bipolar type I cases, 11 Bipolar type II and 59 recurrent and/or severe Depression cases in addition to other phenotypes. We enrolled 333 participants with DNA samples from a broader pedigree of 960 subjects for genotyping using the Affymetrix 10K array. Non-parametric linkage was carried out via MERLIN and parametric with both MERLIN and MCLINKAGE. We exome sequenced a subset of the family (n=27) in order to identify rare variation within the linkage regions shared by affected family members. We identified four genome wide significant and four suggestive linkage regions on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 11 and 12 for different phenotype definitions. However, no region received strong joint support in both the parametric and non-parametric analyses. Exome sequencing revealed potential deleterious variants in 11p15.4 for MDD and 1q21.1-1q21.3 and 12p23.1-p22.3, implicated in cell signaling, adhesion, translation and neurogenesis processes. Overall, our results suggest promising, but not definitive or confirmed evidence, that rare genetic variation contributes to the high prevalence of mood disorders in this multi-generational family. We note that a substantial role for common genetic variation is likely given the strength of the linkage signals observed.\\n\\nThe World Health Organisation reports depression and bipolar disorder as the second and seventh most important causes of years lost due to disability worldwide[1]. The heritability of bipolar disorder is between 60-90% with a lower but still substantial heritability for major depression (40-45%) [2]; [3]. First-degree relatives of bipolar disorder probands have a 5-10 fold increase in risk of developing the illness compared to relatives of controls but also show a three fold increase in unipolar depression, indicating that bipolar disorder does not \\\"breed true\\\" [4]. Large collaborative genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered several common genetic variants of small effect [5]. Genomewide estimates of heritability suggest that up to 60% of the genetic risk is contributed by common variants [6]. Overall, the current picture for bipolar disorder (and almost all complex traits) is a genetic architecture formed of both common and rare variants.\\n\\nLinkage studies have been pursued on the basis that there may be variants of greater effect shared between and within affected families. However these studies have usually focused on collections of comparatively small families or sib pairs and few consistent findings have emerged [7]. Large multigenerational families (e. g. of >30 affected individuals) theoretically offer a powerful means for mapping complex disease loci that are individually rare but common in a single family. These loci may be more highly penetrant and of larger effect than loci found with GWAS [8]. Here we report the results of the Brazilian Bipolar Family (BBF) study on a five-generation family of 639 members of which 333 were enrolled in the current analyses. Our objectives were to perform a linkage analysis with genome coverage and try to identify new genes/mutations related to bipolar and other mood disorders in the family. Here we report our findings and preliminary results of sequencing of linkage regions.",

    "abstract": "While second generation sequencing led to a vast increase in sequenced data, the shorter reads which came with it made assembly a much harder task and for some regions impossible with only short read data. This changed again with the advent of third generation long read sequencers. The length of the long reads allows a much better resolution of repetitive regions, their high error rate however is a major challenge. Using the data successfully requires to remove most of the sequencing errors. The first hybrid correction methods used low noise second generation data to correct third generation data, but this approach has issues when it is unclear where to place the short reads due to repeats and also because second generation sequencers fail to sequence some regions which third generation sequencers work on. Later non hybrid methods appeared. We present a new method for non hybrid long read error correction based on De Bruijn graph assembly of short windows of long reads with subsequent combination of these correct windows to corrected long reads. Our experiments show that this method yields a better correction than other state of the art non hybrid correction approaches.",

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mek1 is a CHK2/Rad53-family kinase that regulates meiotic recombination and progression upon its activation in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The full catalog of direct Mek1 phosphorylation targets remains unknown. Here, we show that phosphorylation of histone H3 on threonine 11 (H3 T11ph) is induced by meiotic DSBs in S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Molecular genetic experiments in S. cerevisiae confirmed that Mek1 is required for H3 T11ph and revealed that phosphorylation is rapidly reversed when Mek1 kinase is no longer active. Reconstituting histone phosphorylation in vitro with recombinant proteins demonstrated that Mek1 directly catalyzes H3 T11 phosphorylation. Mutating H3 T11 to nonphosphorylatable residues conferred no detectable defects in otherwise unperturbed meiosis, although the mutations modestly reduced spore viability in certain strains where Rad51 is used for strand exchange in place of Dmc1. H3 T11ph is therefore mostly dispensable for Mek1 function. However, H3 T11ph provides an excellent marker of ongoing Mek1 kinase activity in vivo. Anti-H3 T11ph chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing demonstrated that H3 T11ph was highly enriched at presumed sites of attachment of chromatin to chromosome axes, gave a more modest signal along chromatin loops, and was present at still lower levels immediately adjacent to DSB hotspots. These localization patterns closely tracked the distribution of Red1 and Hop1, axis proteins required for Mek1 activation. These findings provide insight into the spatial disposition of Mek1 kinase activity and the higher order organization of recombining meiotic chromosomes.\\n\\nbioRxiv version 2 (June 2017)One major experimental change was incorporated into the revised manuscript: We repeated the anti-H3 T11ph ChIP-seq experiment on larger scale, including two meiotic time points from each of two wild type cultures and one time point from a spo11-Y135F mutant culture. To facilitate comparison of different samples, we used meiotic S. pombe cells as a spike-in control for all samples for both anti-H3 and anti-H3 T11ph ChIP-seq. Most conclusions described in the first bioRxiv submission were confirmed, but the improved datasets allowed us to derive more detailed information in particular about H3 T11ph patterns around DSB sites.\\n\\nbioRxiv version 3 (October 2017)The following experimental changes were incorporated, along with more minor changes in response to reviewer comments: O_LIWe added previously unpublished ChIP-seq data for Red1 protein, generated by Masaru Ito and Kunihiro Ohta, who have been added as coauthors.\\nC_LIO_LIWe repeated key experiments with the H3-T11V single point mutant. No conclusions were changed relative to prior experiments with the H3-S10, T11V mutant.\\nC_LIO_LIWe repeated the analysis of spore viability in a dmc1 rad54-T132A background using a more appropriate isogenic control, and recapitulated the original conclusion that the H3-T11V mutation modestly decreases spore viability in this sensitized background.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is a fundamental cellular process. Its stochastic fluctuations due to intrinsic and extrinsic sources, known generically as  gene expression noise, trigger both beneficial and harmful consequences for the cell behavior.\\n\\nControlling gene expression noise is of interest in many applications in biotechnology, biomedicine and others. Yet, control of the mean expression level is an equally desirable goal. Here, we analyze a gene synthetic network designed to reduce gene expression noise while achieving a desired mean expression level. The circuit combines a negative feedback loop over the gene of interest, and a cell-to-cell communication mechanism based on quorum sensing. We analyze the ability of the circuit to reduce noise as a function of parameters that can be tuned in the wet-lab, and the role quorum sensing plays. Intrinsic noise is generated by the inherent stochasticity of biochemical reactions. On the other hand, extrinsic noise is due to variability in the cell environment and the amounts of cellular components that affect gene expression. We develop a realistic model of the gene synthetic circuit over the population of cells using mass action kinetics and the stochastic Chemical Langevin Equation to include intrinsic noise, with parameters drawn from a distribution to account for extrinsic noise. Stochastic simulations allow us to quantify the mean expression level and noise strength of all species under different scenarios, showing good agreement with system-wide available experimental data of protein abundance and noise in E. coli. Our in silico experiments reveal significant noise attenuation in gene expression through the interplay between quorum sensing and the negative feedback, allowing control of the mean expression and variance of the protein of interest. These in silico conclusions are validated by preliminary experimental results. This gene network could have important implications as a robust protein production system in industrial biotechnology.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryControlling gene expression level is of interest in many applications in biotechnology, biomedicine and others. Yet, the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions plays an important role in biological systems, and cannot be disregarded. Gene expression noise resulting from this stochasticity has been studied over the past years both in vivo, and in silico using mathematical models. Nowadays, synthetic biology approaches allow to design novel biological circuits, drawing on principles elucidated from biology and engineering, for the purpose of decoupled control of mean gene expression and its variance. We propose a gene synthetic circuit with these characteristics, using negative feedback and quorum sensing based cell-to-cell communication to induce population consensus. Our in silico analysis using stochastic simulations with a realistic model reveal significant noise attenuation in gene expression through the interplay between quorum sensing and the negative feedback, allowing control of the mean expression and variance of the protein of interest. Preliminary in vivo results fully agree with the computational ones.",

    "abstract": "Pedigree-based analyses of intelligence have reported that genetic differences account for 50-80% of the phenotypic variation. For personality traits these effects are smaller, with 34-48% of the variance being explained by genetic differences. However, molecular genetic studies using unrelated individuals typically report a heritability estimate of around 30% for intelligence and between 0% and 15% for personality variables. Pedigree-based estimates and molecular genetic estimates may differ because current genotyping platforms are poor at tagging causal variants, variants with low minor allele frequency, copy number variants, and structural variants. Using [~]20 000 individuals in the Generation Scotland family cohort genotyped for [~]700 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we exploit the high levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) found in members of the same family to quantify the total effect of genetic variants that are not tagged in GWASs of unrelated individuals. In our models, genetic variants in low LD with genotyped SNPs explain over half of the genetic variance in intelligence, education, and neuroticism. By capturing these additional genetic effects our models closely approximate the heritability estimates from twin studies for intelligence and education, but not for neuroticism and extraversion. We then replicated our finding using imputed molecular genetic data from unrelated individuals to show that [~]50% of differences in intelligence, and [~]40% of the differences in education, can be explained by genetic effects when a larger number of rare SNPs are included. From an evolutionary genetic perspective, a substantial contribution of rare genetic variants to individual differences in intelligence and education is consistent with mutation-selection balance.",

    "abstract": "Researchers can investigate the mechanistic and molecular basis of many physiological phenomena in cells by analyzing the fundamental properties of single ion channels. These analyses entail recording single channel currents and measuring current amplitudes and transition rates between conductance states. Since most electrophysiological recordings contain noise, the data analysis can proceed by idealizing the recordings to isolate the true currents from the noise. This de-noising can be accomplished with threshold crossing algorithms and Hidden Markov Models, but such procedures generally depend on inputs and supervision by the user, thus requiring some prior knowledge of underlying processes. Channels with unknown gating and/or functional sub-states and the presence in the recording of currents from uncorrelated background channels present substantial challenges to unsupervised analyses.\\n\\nHere we describe and characterize an idealization algorithm based on Rissanens Minimum Description Length (MDL) Principle. This method uses minimal assumptions and idealizes ion channel recordings without requiring a detailed user input or a priori assumptions about channel conductance and kinetics.. Furthermore, we demonstrate that correlation analysis of conductance steps can resolve properties of single ion channels in recordings contaminated by signals from multiple channels. We first validated our methods on simulated data defined with a range of different signal-to-noise levels, and then showed that our algorithm can recover channel currents and their substates from recordings with multiple channels, even under conditions of high noise. We then tested the MDL algorithm on real experimental data from human PIEZO1 channels and found that our method revealed the presence of substates with alternate conductances.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis -the spread of cancer to other parts of the body- causes 90% of cancer deaths, underlies major health complications in cancer patients and renders most cancers incurable. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying the process are poorly understood and therapeutics to block it remain elusive. Here, we present a computational technique for scanning genome-scale regulatory networks for potential genes associated with metastasis. First, we demonstrate that in the breast cancer cell line MCF7, the commonly dysregulated cancer biomarkers TP53, ERBB2, ESR1 and PGR are closely connected to known metastasis genes with a significant proportion being 2nd degree neighbors of a given biomarker. Next, we identify genes whose 2nd degree neighbors are connected in a similar manner to these biomarkers. Consequently, these are referred to as metastasis associated genes or MAGs. We identify 190 genes that are TP53-MAGs, 22 ERBB2-MAGs, 240 ESR1-MAGs and 84 PGR-MAGs (FDR adjusted P <0.001). Analysis of the MAGs reveals statistically significant enrichment with biological functions previously associated with metastasis including the extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction, focal adhesion, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling. The biological significance of MAGs is further supported by their enrichment with experimentally validated binding sites for transcription factors that regulate metastasis, for example BACH1- a master regulator of breast cancer metastasis to bone. The predicted MAGs are also clinically relevant as therapeutic targets for metastasis blocking agents. Specifically, genes that are perturbed by drugs and miRNAs that influence metastasis are enriched with MAGs. Furthermore, some MAGs are associated with patient survival and provide insights into the proclivity for breast cancer subtypes to preferentially spread to specific organs. The results of this study imply that aberrations in primary tumors may constrict metastasis trajectories. This could enable the prediction of organ specific metastases based on aberrations in the primary tumor and lay a foundation for future studies on individualized or personalized models of metastasis. The approach is potentially scalable across other cancers and has clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees are an important analytical tool for evaluating community diversity and evolutionary history. In the case of microorganisms, the decreasing cost of sequencing has enabled researchers to generate ever-larger sequence datasets, which in turn have begun to fill gaps in the evolutionary history of microbial groups. However, phylogenetic analyses of these types of datasets create complex trees that can be challenging to interpret. Scientific inferences made by visual inspection of phylogenetic trees can be simplified and enhanced by customizing various parts of the tree. Yet, manual customization is time-consuming and error prone, and programs designed to assist in batch tree customization often require programming experience or complicated file formats for annotation. Iroki, a user-friendly web interface for tree visualization, addresses these issues by providing automatic customization of large trees based on metadata contained in tab-separated text files. Irokis utility for exploring biological and ecological trends in sequencing data was demonstrated through a variety of microbial ecology applications in which trees with hundreds to thousands of leaf nodes were customized according to extensive collections of metadata.

In pursuing our studies, we thought it especially interesting to study another cardinal visual attribute, namely colour, to learn whether colour stimuli also provoke very early responses, at less than 50 ms, from visual cortex. To address the question, we asked participants to view stimuli that changed in colour and used magneto-encephalography to detect very early responses (< 50 ms) in the occipital visual cortex. Our results show that coloured stimuli also provoke an early cortical response (M30), with an average peak time at 30.8 ms, thus bringing the colour system into line with the visual motion and form systems. We conclude that colour signals reach visual cortex, including prestriate visual cortex, earlier than previously supposed.\\n\\nKey points summaryO_LIWe measured visual evoked responses to colour stimuli using magnetoencephalography.\\nC_LIO_LIAn early response was identified, at around 30 ms after stimulation.\\nC_LIO_LIThe sources of the response were estimated to be in prestriate cortex.\\nC_LIO_LIColour signals thus appear to evoke very early cortical responses, just like form and motion signals.\\nC_LI\\n\\nAbbreviations list",

Next-generation sequencing technologies and bioinformatics procedures predict the existence of tens of thousands of lncRNAs, from which we know the functions of only a handful of them, and very little is known in cancer types such as head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs).\\n\\nResultsHere, we use RNA-seq expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and various statistic and software tools in order to get insight about the lncRNome in HNSCC. Based on lncRNAs expression across 426 samples, we discover five distinct tumor clusters that we compare with reported clusters based on various genomic/genetic features. Results demonstrate significant associations between lncRNA-based clustering and DNA-methylation, TP53 mutation, and human papillomavirus infection. Using \\\"guilt by association\\\" procedures, we infer the possible biological functions of representative lncRNAs of each cluster. Furthermore, we found that lncRNA clustering is correlated with some important clinical and pathologic features, including patient survival after treatment, tumor grade or sub-anatomical location.\\n\\nConclusionsWe present a landscape of lncRNAs in HNSCC, and provide associations with important genotypic and phenotypic features that may help to understand the disease.",

    "abstract": "1. Statistical approaches for inferring the spatial distribution of taxa (Species Distribution Models, SDMs) commonly rely on available occurrence data, which is often non-randomly distributed and geographically restricted. Although available SDM methods address some of these problems, the errors could be more directly and accurately modelled using a spatially-explicit approach. Software to implement spatial autocorrelation terms into SDMs are now widely available, but whether such approaches for inferring SDMs are an improvement over existing methodologies is unknown.\\n\\n2. Here, within a simulated environment using 1000 generated species ranges, we compared the performance of two commonly used non-spatial SDM methods (Maximum Entropy Modelling, MAXENT and Boosted Regression Trees, BRT) to a spatially-explicit Bayesian SDM method (Integrated Laplace Approximation, INLA), when the underlying data exhibit varying combinations of clumping and geographic restriction. Finally, we tested whether any recommended methodological settings for all methods were further impacted by spatially non-random patterns in these data.\\n\\n3. Spatially-explicit INLA was the most consistently accurate method, being most or equal most accurate in 5 out of 8 data sampling scenarios. Within high-coverage sample datasets, all methods performed fairly similarly, but when sampling points were randomly spread BRT had a 1-3% greater accuracy over the other methods and when samples were clumped, spatial-INLA had a 4%-8% better in AUC score. Alternatively, when sampling points were restricted to a small section of the true range, all methods were on average 10-12% less accurate, with higher variation among the methods. None of the recommended settings for the different methods were found to be sensitive to clumping or restriction of data, except the complexity of the INLA spatial term.\\n\\n4. INLA-based modelling approaches can be successfully used to account for spatial autocorrelation in an SDM context and, by taking account of random effects, produce outputs that can better elucidate the role of covariates in predicting species occurrence. Given that it is often unclear what the drivers are behind data clumping in an empirical occurrence dataset, or indeed how geographically restricted these data are, spatially-explicit INLA-based SDMs may be the better choice when modelling the spatial distribution of target species.",

    "abstract": "Predicting a multicellular organisms phenotype quantitatively from its genotype is challenging, as genetic effects must propagate across scales. Circadian clocks are intracellular regulators that control temporal gene expression patterns and hence metabolism, physiology and behaviour. Here we explain and predict canonical phenotypes of circadian timing in a multicellular, model organism. We used diverse metabolic and physiological data to combine and extend mathematical models of rhythmic gene expression, photoperiod-dependent flowering, elongation growth and starch metabolism within a Framework Model for the vegetative growth of Arabidopsis thaliana, sharing the model and data files in a structured, public resource. The calibrated model predicted the effect of altered circadian timing upon each particular phenotype in clock-mutant plants under standard laboratory conditions. Altered night-time metabolism of stored starch accounted for most of the decrease in whole-plant biomass, as previously proposed. Mobilisation of a secondary store of malate and fumarate was also mis-regulated, accounting for any remaining biomass defect. We test three candidate mechanisms for the accumulation of these organic acids. Our results link genotype through specific processes to higher-level phenotypes, formalising our understanding of a subtle, pleiotropic syndrome at the whole-organism level, and validating the systems approach to understand complex traits starting from intracellular circuits.\n\nThis work updates the first biorXiv version, February 2017, https://doi.org/10.1101/105437, with an expanded description and additional analysis of the same core data sets and the same FMv2 model, summary tables and supporting, follow-on data from three further studies with further collaborators.

    "abstract": "MotivationAlthough high-content image cytometry is becoming increasingly routine, processing the large amount of data acquired during time-lapse experiments remains a challenge. The majority of approaches for automated single-cell segmentation focus on flat, uniform fields of view covered with a single layer of cells. In the increasingly popular microfluidic devices that trap individual cells for long term imaging, these conditions are not met. Consequently, most segmentation techniques perform poorly. Incorporating information about the microfluidic features, media flow and morphology of the cells can substantially improve performance, though it may constrain the generalizability of software.\\n\\nResultsHere we present DISCO (Data Informed Segmentation of Cell Objects), a framework for using the physical constraints imposed by microfluidic traps, the shape based morphological constraints of budding yeast and temporal information about cell growth and motion, to allow tracking and segmentation of cells in micrflouidic devices. Using manually curated data sets, we demonstrate substantial improvements in both tracking and segmentation for this approach when compared with existing software.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe MATLAB(R) code for the algorithm and for measuring performance is available at https://github.com/pswain/segmentation-software.

Each introduced copy encodes guide RNAs that target one or more engineered loci carrying the CRISPR nuclease gene and the desired traits. When organisms encoding a drive system are released into the environment, each generation of mating with wild-type organisms will reduce the average number of the guide RNA elements per  daisyfield organism by half, serving as a generational clock.

    "abstract": "Working memory (WM) and decision making (DM) are fundamental cognitive functions involving a distributed interacting network of brain areas, with the posterior parietal and prefrontal cortices (PPC and PFC) at the core. However, the shared and distinct roles of these areas and the nature of their coordination in cognitive function remain poorly understood. Biophysically-based computational models of cortical circuits have provided insights into the mechanisms supporting these functions, yet they have primarily focused on the local microcircuit level, raising questions about the principles for distributed cognitive computation in multi-regional networks. To examine these issues, we developed a distributed circuit model of two reciprocally interacting modules representing PPC and PFC circuits. The circuit architecture includes hierarchical differences in local recurrent structure and implements reciprocal long-range projections. This parsimonious model captures a range of behavioral and neuronal features of fronto-parietal circuits across multiple WM and DM paradigms. In the context of WM, both areas exhibit persistent activity, but in response to intervening distractors, PPC transiently encodes distractors, while PFC filters distractors and supports WM robustness. With regards to DM, the PPC module generates graded representations of accumulated evidence supporting target selection, while the PFC module generates more categorical responses related to action or choice. These findings suggest computational principles for distributed, hierarchical processing in cortex during cognitive function, and provide a framework for extension to multi-regional models.",
