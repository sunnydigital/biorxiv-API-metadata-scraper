    "abstract": "BackgroundDisagreements over genetic signatures associated with disease have been particularly prominent in the field of psychiatric genetics, creating a sharp divide between disease burdens attributed to common and rare variation, with study designs independently targeting each. Meta-analysis within each of these study designs is routine, whether using raw data or summary statistics, but combining results across study designs is atypical. However, tests of functional convergence are used across all study designs, where candidate gene sets are assessed for overlaps with previously known properties. This suggests one possible avenue for combining not study data, but the functional conclusions that they reach.\\n\\nMethodIn this work, we test for functional convergence in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) across different study types, and specifically whether the degree to which a gene is implicated in autism is correlated with the degree to which it drives functional convergence. Because different study designs are distinguishable by their differences in effect size, this also provides a unified means of incorporating the impact of study design into the analysis of convergence.\\n\\nResultsWe detected remarkably significant positive trends in aggregate (p < 2.2e-16) with 14 individually significant properties (FDR<0.01), many in areas researchers have targeted based on different reasoning, such as the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) interactor enrichment (FDR 0.003). We are also able to detect novel technical effects and we see that network enrichment from protein-protein interaction data is heavily confounded with study design, arising readily in control data.\\n\\nConclusionsWe see a convergent functional signal for a subset of known and novel functions in ASD from all sources of genetic variation. Meta-analytic approaches explicitly accounting for different study designs can be adapted to other diseases to discover novel functional associations and increase statistical power.",

    "abstract": "Most studies of aquatic plankton focus on either macroscopic or microbial communities, and on either eukaryotes or prokaryotes. This separation is primarily for methodological reasons, but can overlook potential interactions among groups. We tested whether DNA-metabarcoding of unfractionated water samples with universal primers could be used to qualitatively and quantitatively study the temporal dynamics of the total plankton community in a shallow temperate lake. We found significant changes in the relative proportions of normalized sequence reads of eukaryotic and prokaryotic plankton communities over a three-month period in spring. Patterns followed the same trend as plankton estimates using traditional microscopic methods. We characterized the bloom of a conditionally rare bacterial taxon belonging to Arcicella, which rapidly came to dominate the whole lake ecosystem and would have remained unnoticed without metabarcoding. Our data demonstrate the potential of universal DNA-metabarcoding applied to unfractionated samples for providing a more holistic view of plankton communities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIron is an essential element of most living organisms but is a dangerous substance when poorly liganded in solution. The hormone hepcidin regulates the export of iron from tissues to the plasma contributing to iron homeostasis and also restricting its availability to infectious agents. Disruption of iron regulation in mammals leads to disorders such as anemia and hemochromatosis, and contributes to the etiology of several other diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we test the hypothesis that hepcidin alone is able to regulate iron distribution in different dietary regimes in the mouse using a computational model of iron distribution calibrated with radioiron tracer data.\\n\\nResultsA model was developed and calibrated to the data from adequate iron diet, which was able to simulate the iron distribution under a low iron diet. However simulation of high iron diet shows considerable deviations from the experimental data. Namely the model predicts more iron in red blood cells and less iron in the liver than what was observed in experiments.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results suggest that hepcidin alone is not sufficient to regulate iron homeostasis in high iron conditions and that other factors are important. The model was able to simulate anemia when hepcidin was increased but was unable to simulate hemochromatosis when hepcidin was suppressed, suggesting that in high iron conditions additional regulatory interactions are important.",

    "abstract": "Brain Computer Interface (BCI), a direct pathway between the human brain and computer, is one of the most pragmatic applications of EEG signal. The electroencephalograph (EEG) signal is one of the monitoring techniques to observe brain functionality. Mental Task Classification (MTC) based on EEG signals is a demanding BCI. Success of BCI system depends on the efficient analysis of these signals. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a filter based heuristic technique which is utilized to analyze EEG signal in recent past. There are several variants of EMD algorithms which have their own merits and demerits. In this paper, we have explored three variants of EMD algorithms named Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) on EEG data for MTC-based BCI. Features are extracted from EEG signal in two phases; in the first phase, the signal is decomposed into different oscillatory functions with the help of different EMD algorithms and eight different parameters (features) are calculated for each function for compact representation in the second phase. These features are fed into Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify the different mental tasks. We have formulated two different types of MTC, the first one is binary and second one is multi-MTC. The proposed work outperforms the existing work for both binary and multi mental tasks classification.",

Previous studies have indicated high levels of genetic heterogeneity, with estimates of more than 2500 autosomal ID genes, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (AR). Here, we combined microarray genotyping, homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) mapping, copy number variation (CNV) analysis, and whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify disease genes/mutations in 192 multiplex Pakistani and Iranian consanguineous families with non-syndromic ID. We identified definite or candidate mutations (or CNVs) in 51% of families in 72 different genes, including 26 not previously reported for ARID. The new ARID genes include nine with loss-of-function mutations (ABI2, MAPK8, MPDZ, PIDD1, SLAIN1, TBC1D23, TRAPPC6B, UBA7, and USP44), and missense mutations include the first reports of variants in BDNF or TET1 associated with ID. The genes identified also showed overlap with de novo gene sets for other neuropsychiatric disorders. Transcriptional studies showed prominent expression in the prenatal brain. The high yield of AR mutations for ID indicated that this approach has excellent clinical potential and should inform clinical diagnostics, including clinical whole exome and genome sequencing, for populations in which consanguinity is common. As with other AR disorders, the relevance will also apply to outbred populations.",

    "abstract": "A frequent event in the evolution of prokaryotic genomes is homologous recombination, where a foreign DNA stretch replaces a genomic region similar in sequence. Recombination can affect the relative position of two genomes in a phylogenetic reconstruction in two different ways: (i) one genome can recombine with a DNA stretch that is similar to the other genome, thereby reducing their pairwise sequence divergence; (ii) one genome can recombine with a DNA stretch from an outgroup genome, increasing the pairwise divergence. While several recombination-aware phylogenetic algorithms exist, many of these cannot account for both types of recombination; some algorithms can, but do so inefficiently. Moreover, many existing algorithms require that a substantial portion of each genome has not been affected by recombination, a sometimes unrealistic assumption. Here, we propose a novel coarse-graining approach for phylogenetic reconstruction (CGP), which is recombination-aware, applicable even if all genomic regions have experienced substantial amounts of recombination, and can be used on both nucleotide and amino acid sequences. CGP considers the local density of substitutions along pairwise genome alignments, fitting a model to the empirical distribution of substitution density to infer the pairwise coalescent time. Given all pairwise coalescent times, CGP reconstructs an ultrametric tree representing vertical inheritance. Based on simulations, we show that the proposed approach can reconstruct ultrametric trees with accurate topology, branch lengths, and root positioning. Applied to a set of E. coli strains, the reconstructed trees are most consistent with gene distributions when inferred from amino acid sequences, a data type that cannot be utilized by many alternative approaches.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn homologous recombination, segments of foreign DNA overwrite similar segments of a prokaryotic genome. A single recombination event can simultaneously introduce many DNA substitutions. This disturbs phylogenetic signals, making it difficult to reconstruct prokaryotic family trees. While a handful of recombination-aware phylogenetic algorithms have been proposed, most do not take all effects of recombination into account; others rely on the frequently unrealistic assumption that a substantial part of a genome has not been affected by recombination at all. Here, we introduce a novel approach to phylogenetic reconstruction, which estimates the age of the most recent common ancestor of two strains from the density distribution of DNA or amino acid substitutions between their genomes. The proposed phylogenetic tree is the tree most compatible with these age estimates. Based on nucleotide or amino acid sequences, our approach accurately predicts the topology, branch lengths, and root positioning of prokaryotic family trees.",

    "abstract": "The duplication of genes can occur through various mechanisms and is thought to make a major contribution to the evolutionary diversification of organisms. There is increasing evidence for a large-scale duplication of genes in some chelicerate lineages including two rounds of whole genome duplication (WGD) in horseshoe crabs. To investigate this further we sequenced and analyzed the genome of the common house spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum. We found pervasive duplication of both coding and non-coding genes in this spider, including two clusters of Hox genes. Analysis of synteny conservation across the P. tepidariorum genome suggests that there has been an ancient WGD in spiders. Comparison with the genomes of other chelicerates, including that of the newly sequenced bark scorpion Centruroides sculpturatus, suggests that this event occurred in the common ancestor of spiders and scorpions and is probably independent of the WGDs in horseshoe crabs. Furthermore, characterization of the sequence and expression of the Hox paralogs in P. tepidariorum suggests that many have been subject to neofunctionalization and/or subfunctionalization since their duplication, and therefore may have contributed to the diversification of spiders and other pulmonate arachnids.",

    "abstract": "Predicting whether individuals will colonize a novel habitat is of fundamental ecological interest and is crucial to both conservation efforts and invasive species management. A consistently supported predictor of colonization success is the number of individuals introduced, also called propagule pressure. Propagule pressure increases with the number of introductions and the number of individuals per introduction (the size of the introduction), but it is unresolved which process is a stronger driver of colonization success. Furthermore their relative importance may depend upon the environment, with multiple introductions potentially enhancing colonization of fluctuating environments. To evaluate the relative importance of the number and size of introductions and its dependence upon environmental variability, we paired demographic simulations with a microcosm experiment. Using Tribolium flour beetles as a model system, we introduced a fixed number of individuals into replicated novel habitats of stable or fluctuating quality, varying the number of introductions through time and size of each introduction. We evaluated establishment probability and the size of extant populations after 7 generations. In the simulations and microcosms, we found that establishment probability increased with more, smaller introductions, but was not affected by biologically realistic fluctuations in environmental quality. Population size was not significantly affected by environmental variability in the simulations, but populations in the microcosms grew larger in a stable environment, especially with more introduction events. In general, the microcosm experiment yielded higher establishment probability and larger populations than the demographic simulations. We suggest that genetic mechanisms likely underlie these differences and thus deserve more attention in efforts to parse propagule pressure. Our results highlight the importance of preventing further introductions of undesirable species to invaded sites, and suggest conservation efforts should focus on increasing the number of introductions or re-introductions of desirable species rather than increasing the size of those introduction events.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBemisia tabaci species (whiteflies) are the worlds most devastating insect pests within crops in the tropics. They cause billions of dollars (US) of damage each year and are leaving farmers in the developing world food insecure. Understanding the genetic and transcriptomic composition of these insect pests, the viruses they transmit and the microbiota is crucial to sustainable insect and virus management solutions for farmers. Currently, publically available transcriptome data for B. tabaci has been generated from pooled samples (mainly inbred lab colonies) consisting of several individuals because whiteflies are small (approximately 0.2 mm wide and 0.1 mm in height). Pooling individuals can lead to high heterozygosity and skewed representation of the genetic diversity. The ability to extract enough RNA from a single whitefly has remained elusive due to their small size and technology limitations. Therefore, the understanding of whitefly-microbiotad-viral species composition of an individual field-collected whitefly has also remained unknown. In this study, we developed a single whitefly RNA extraction procedure and subsequently successfully sequenced the transcriptome of four individual adult SubdSaharan Africa (SSA1) B. tabaci.\\n\\nResultsTranscriptome sequencing on individual whiteflies resulted in between 39-42 million raw reads. De novo assembly of trimmed reads yielded between 65,000-162,000 transcripts across all four B. tabaci transcriptomes. In addition, Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrion cytochrome I oxidase (mtCOI) grouped the four whiteflies within the SSA1 clade. BLAST searches on assembled transcripts within the four individual transcriptomes identified five endosymbionts; the primary endosymbiont Portiera,aleyrodidarum and four secondary endosymbionts: Arsenophonus, Wolbachia, Rickettsia, and Cardinium spp. These five endosymbionts were predominant across all four SSA1 B. tabaci study samples with prevalence levels of between 54.1d75%. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments of the NusG gene of P. aleyrodidarum for the SSA1 B. tabaci transcriptomes of samples WF2 and WF2b revealed an eleven amino acid residue deletion that was absent in samples WF1 and WF2a. Comparison of the protein structure of the NusG protein from P. aleyrodidarum in SSA1 with known NusG structures showed the deletion resulted in a shorter D loop. Although NusG is key in regulating of transcription elongation, it is believed that the shortening of the loop region in the N-terminal domain is unlikely to affect transcription termination. Therefore, the effect of variability in this region across species is unknown.\\n\\nConclusionIn this study, we optimised a single whitefly high quality RNA extraction procedure and successfully carried out individual whitefly transcriptome sequencing on adult B. tabaci whiteflies. This enabled the detection of unique genetic differences in the NusG genes of the primary endosymbiont P. aleyrodidarum in four field-collected SSA1 whiteflies that may not have been detected using lab-pooled B. tabaci isolines. The use of field-collected specimens means that both time and money will be saved in future studies using single whitefly transcriptomes in monitoring vector and viral interactions. In addition, the methods we have developed here are applicable to any small organism where RNA quantity has limited transcriptome studies.",

To better understand the evasive nature of the tubercle bacilli and its molecular manifest on the macrophage response to infection, we conducted a global quantitative proteomic profile of infected macrophages. By examining four independent controlled infection experiments, we detected 42,007 peptides resulting in the characterization of 4,868 distinct proteins. Of these, we identified 845 macrophage proteins whose expression is modulated upon infection in all replicates. We showed that the macrophages response to M. tuberculosis infection includes simultaneous and concerted upregulation of selected proteins. Using a number of statistical methods, we identified 27 proteins whose expression levels are significantly regulated outside of a 90% confidence interval about the mean. These host proteins represent the macrophage transcriptional, translational, and innate immune response to infection as well as its signaling capacity. The contribution of PtpA, an M. tuberculosis secreted virulence factor, modulated the expression levels of 11 host macrophage proteins, as categorized by RNA metabolism, translation, and cellular respiration.",

    "abstract": "Numerous brain lesion and fMRI studies have linked individual differences in executive abilities and fluid intelligence to brain regions of the fronto-parietal \"multiple-demand\" (MD) network. Yet, fMRI studies have yielded conflicting evidence as to whether better executive abilities are associated with stronger or weaker MD activations and whether this relationship is restricted to the MD network. Here, in a large-sample (n=216) fMRI investigation, we found that stronger activity in MD regions - functionally defined in individual participants - was robustly associated with more accurate and faster responses on a spatial working memory task performed in the scanner, as well as fluid intelligence measured independently (n=114). In line with some prior claims about a relationship between language and fluid intelligence, we also found a weak association between activity in the brain regions of the left fronto-temporal language network during an independent passive reading task, and performance on the working memory task. However, controlling for the level of MD activity abolished this relationship, whereas the MD activity-behavior association remained highly reliable after controlling for the level of activity in the language network. Finally, we demonstrate how unreliable MD activity measures, coupled with small sample sizes, could falsely lead to the opposite, negative, association that has been reported in some prior studies. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a core component of individual differences variance in executive abilities and fluid intelligence is selectively and robustly positively associated with the level of activity in the MD network, a result that aligns well with lesion studies.",

However, the behavior of these collectives is difficult to understand, as cellular growth and division as well as extra-cellular fluid flow lead to complex, changing arrangements of cells within the population. To rationally engineer and control the behavior of cell collectives we need theoretical and computational tools to understand their emergent spatiotemporal dynamics. Here, we present an agent-based model that allows growing cells to detect and respond to mechanical interactions. Crucially, our model couples the dynamics of cell growth to the cells environment: Mechanical constraints can affect cellular growth rate and a cell may alter its behavior in response to these constraints. This coupling links the mechanical forces that influence cell growth and emergent behaviors in cell assemblies. We illustrate our approach by showing how mechanical interactions can impact the dynamics of bacterial collectives growing in microfluidic traps.",

However, microorganisms mediate processes sustaining plant life and the soil environment. To understand the role of microbes we first must understand what controls soil microbial community assembly. We assessed the distribution and composition of prokaryotic communities from soils representing four geographic regions on the South Island of New Zealand. These soils are under three different uses (dairy, sheep and beef, and high country farming) and are representative of major soil classification groups (brown, pallic, gley and recent). We hypothesized that pH would account for major community patterns based on 16S profiles, but that land use and location would be secondary modifiers. Community diversity and structure was linked to pH, coinciding with land use. Soil classification correlated with microbial community structure and evenness, but not richness in high country and sheep and beef communities. The impact of land use and pH remained significant at the regional scale, but soil classification provided support for community variability not explained by either of those factors. These results suggest that several edaphic properties must be examined at multiple spatial scales to robustly examine soil prokaryotic communities.",

    "abstract": "Leaf wax n-alkanes are broadly used to reconstruct paleoenvironmental information. However, the utility of the n-alkane paleoclimate proxy is modulated by the extent to which genetic as well as environmental factors influence the structural and isotopic variability of leaf waxes. In paleoclimate applications, there is an implicit assumption that most variation of leaf wax traits through a time series can be attributed to environmental change and that biological sources of variability within plant communities are small. For example, changes in hydrology affect the {delta}2 H of waxes though rainwater and the {delta}13C of leaf waxes by changing plant communities (i.e., C3 versus C4 input). Here we test the assumption of little genetic control over 5 C variation of leaf wax by presenting the results of an experimental greenhouse growth study in which we estimate the role of genetic variability on structural and isotopic leaf wax traits in a set of 76 introgression lines (ILs) between two interfertile Solanum (tomato) species: S. lycopersicum cv M82 (hereafter cv M82) and S. pennellii. We found that the leaves of S. pennellii, a wild desert tomato relative, produces significantly more iso-alkanes than cv M82, a domesticated tomato cultivar adapted to water-replete conditions; we introduce a methylation index to summarize the ratio of branched (iso- and anteiso-) to total alkanes. Between S. pennellii and cv M82, the iso-alkanes were found to be enriched in 13C by 1.2-1.4%o over n-alkanes. By modeling our results from the ILs, we report the broad-sense heritability values (H2) of leaf wax traits to describe the degree to which genetic variation contributes to variation of these traits. Individual carbon isotope values of alkanes are of low heritability (H2 = 0.13-0.19), suggesting that {delta}13C of leaf waxes from this study are strongly influenced by environmental variance, which supports the interpretation that variation in the 5 C of wax compounds recorded in sediments reflects paleohydrological changes. Average chain length (ACL) values of n-alkanes are of intermediate heritability (H2 = 0.30), suggesting that ACL values are strongly influenced by genetic cues.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, genomic regions with enhancer activity turnover rapidly; in contrast, gene expression patterns and transcription factor binding preferences are largely conserved. Based on this conservation, we hypothesized that enhancers active in different mammals would exhibit conserved sequence patterns in spite of their different genomic locations. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the conservation of sequence patterns underlying histone-mark defined enhancers across six diverse mammals in two machine learning frameworks. We first trained support vector machine (SVM) classifiers based on the frequency spectrum of short DNA sequence patterns. These classifiers accurately identified many adult liver, developing limb, and developing brain enhancers in each species. Then, we applied these classifiers across species and found that classifiers trained in one species and tested in another performed nearly as well as classifiers trained and tested on the same species. This indicates that the short sequence patterns predictive of enhancers are largely conserved. We also observed similar cross-species conservation when applying the models to human and mouse enhancers validated in transgenic assays. The sequence patterns most predictive of enhancers in each species matched the binding motifs for a common set of TFs enriched for expression in relevant tissues, supporting the biological relevance of the learned features. To test the conservation of more complex sequences patterns, we trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on enhancer sequences in each species. The CNNs demonstrated better performance overall, but worse cross-species generalization than SVMs, suggesting the importance of combinatorial interactions between motifs, but less conservation of these more complex sequence patterns. Thus, despite the rapid change of active enhancer locations between mammals, cross-species enhancer prediction is often possible. Furthermore, short sequence patterns encoding enhancer activity have been maintained across more than 180 million years of mammalian evolution, with evolutionary change in more complex sequence patterns.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAlterations in gene expression levels are a driving force of both speciation and complex disease; therefore, it is of great importance to understand the mechanisms underlying the evolution and function gene regulatory DNA sequences. Recent studies have revealed that while gene expression patterns and transcription factor binding preferences are broadly conserved across diverse animals, there is extensive turnover in distal gene regulatory regions, called enhancers, between closely related species. We investigate this seeming incongruence by analyzing genome-wide enhancer datasets from six diverse mammalian species. We trained two machine-learning classifiers--a k-mer spectrum support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN)--to distinguish enhancers from the genomic background. The k-mer spectrum SVM models the occurrences of short sequence patterns while the CNN models both the short sequences patterns and their combinatorial patterns. Both the SVM and CNN enhancer prediction models trained in one species are able to predict enhancers in the same cellular context in other species. However, CNNs performed better at predicting enhancers in each species, but they generalize less well across species than the SVMs. This argues that the short sequence properties encoding regulatory activity are remarkably conserved across more than 180 million years of mammalian evolution with more evolutionary turnover in the more complex combinations of the conserved short sequence motifs.",

Monocle 2 learns an explicit principal graph to describe the data, greatly improving the robustness and accuracy of its trajectories compared to other algorithms. Monocle 2 uncovered a new, alternative cell fate in what we previously reported to be a linear trajectory for differentiating myoblasts. We also reconstruct branched trajectories for two studies of blood development, and show that loss of function mutations in key lineage transcription factors diverts cells to alternative branches on the a trajectory.

    "abstract": "Niches have traditionally been characterized as signalling microenvironments that allow stem cells to maintain their fate. This definition implicitly assumes that the various niche signals are integrated towards a binary fate decision between stemness and differentiation. However, observations in multiple systems have demonstrated that stem cell properties such as proliferation and self renewal can be uncoupled at the level of niche signalling input, which is incompatible with this simplified view. We have studied the role of the transcriptional regulator Zfh1, a shared target of the Hedgehog and Jak/Stat niche signalling pathways, in the somatic stem cells of the Drosophila testis. We found that Zfh1 binds and downregulates salvador and kibra, two tumour suppressor genes of the Hippo/Wts/Yki pathway, thereby restricting Yki activation and proliferation to the Zfh1 positive stem cells. These observations provide an unbroken link from niche signal input to an individual aspect of stem cell behaviour that does not, at any step, involve a fate decision. We discuss the relevance of our observations and other reports in the literature for an overall concept of stemness and niche function.\\n\\nSummary statementWe demonstrate that the fly testis niche controls stem cell proliferation by repressing Hippo pathway genes independent of a binary cell fate decision between stemness and proliferation.",

In this study, we investigate gene expression and regulation across 38 tissues profiled in the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. We find that network edges (transcription factor to target gene connections) have higher tissue-specificity than network nodes (genes) and that regulating nodes (transcription factors) are less likely to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner as compared to their targets (genes). Gene set enrichment analysis of network targeting also indicates that regulation of tissue-specific function is largely independent of transcription factor expression. In addition, tissue-specific genes are not highly targeted in their corresponding tissue-network. However, they do assume bottleneck positions due to variability in transcription factor targeting and the influence of non-canonical regulatory interactions. These results suggest that tissue-specificity is driven by context-dependent regulatory paths, providing transcriptional control of tissue-specific processes.",

In this study, deep sequencing, genetic linkage analysis, and transcriptome data were used to produce and annotate a high quality reference genome sequence. Reference genome sequence order was improved, 29.6 Mbp of additional sequence was incorporated, the number of genes annotated increased 24% to 34,211, average gene length and N50 increased, and error frequency was reduced 10-fold to 1 per 100 kbp.

To determine whether the respective proportions of AMPA and NMDA receptors are similar or vary across a neuron's synapse, we analyzed the variability of NMDA and AMPA currents in quantal responses recorded from neurons located in the nucleus tractus solitarii. We found that the average NMDA to AMPA current ratio strongly differed between recorded neurons and that most of the intra-neuronal current ratio variability was attributable to fluctuations in NMDA current. We next performed computer simulations with a Monte Carlo model of a glutamatergic synapse to estimate the part of AMPA and NMDA currents fluctuations induced by stochastic factors. We found that NMDA current variability mainly resulted from strong channel noise with few influence of release variations. On the contrary, partly because of the presence of subconductance states, AMPA receptor channel noise was low and AMPA current fluctuations tightly reflected changes in the amount of glutamate released. We next showed that these two factors, channel noise and fluctuations in glutamate release, were sufficient to explain the observed variability of the NMDA to AMPA current ratio in quantal events recorded from the same neuron. We therefore concluded that the proportion of AMPA and NMDA receptors was similar, or roughly similar, across synapses onto the same target cell.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring changes in influenza A virus genomes is crucial to understand its rapid evolution and adaptation to changing conditions e.g. establishment within novel host species. Selective sweeps represent a rapid mode of adaptation and are typically observed in human influenza A viruses. We describe Sweep Dynamics (SD) plots, a computational method combining phylogenetic algorithms with statistical techniques to characterize the molecular adaptation of rapidly evolving viruses from longitudinal sequence data. To our knowledge, it is the first method that identifies selective sweeps, the time periods in which these occurred and associated changes providing a selective advantage to the virus. We studied the past genome-wide adaptation of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A (pH1N1) and seasonal H3N2 influenza A (sH3N2) viruses. The pH1N1 influenza virus showed simultaneous amino acid changes in various proteins, particularly in seasons of high pH1N1 activity. Partially, these changes resulted in functional alterations facilitating sustained human-to-human transmission. In the evolution of sH3N2 influenza viruses, we detected changes characterizing vaccine strains, which were occasionally revealed in selective sweeps one season prior to the WHO recommendation. Taken together, SD plots allow monitoring and characterizing the adaptive evolution of influenza A viruses by identifying selective sweeps and their associated signatures.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe thousands of species of closely related cichlid fishes in the great lakes of East Africa are a powerful model for understanding speciation and the genetic basis of trait variation. Recently, the genomes of five species of African cichlids representing five distinct lineages were sequenced and used to predict protein products at a genome-wide level. Here we characterize the evolutionary relationship of each cichlid protein to previously sequenced animal species.\\n\\nResultsWe used the Treefam database, a set of preexisting protein phylogenies built using 109 previously sequenced genomes, to identify Treefam families for each protein annotated from four cichlid species: Metriaclima zebra, Astatotilapia burtoni, Pundamilia nyererei and Neolamporologus brichardi. For each of these Treefam families, we built new protein phylogenies containing each of the cichlid protein hits. Using these new phylogenies we identified the evolutionary relationship of each cichlid protein to its nearest human and zebrafish protein. This data is available either through download or through a webserver we have implemented.\\n\\nConclusionThese phylogenies will be useful for any cichlid researchers trying to predict biological and protein function for a given cichlid gene, understanding the evolutionary history of a given cichlid gene, identifying recently duplicated cichlid genes, or performing genome-wide analysis in cichlids that relies on using databases generated from other species.",

    "abstract": "It has long been suspected that the rate of mutation varies across the human genome at a large scale based on the divergence between humans and other species. It is now possible to directly investigate this question using the large number of de novo mutations (DNMs) that have been discovered in humans through the sequencing of trios. We show that there is variation in the mutation rate at the 100KB, 1MB and 10MB scale that cannot be explained by variation at smaller scales, however the level of this variation is modest at large scales - at the 1MB scale we infer that ~90% of regions have a mutation rate within 50% of the mean. Different types of mutation show similar levels of variation and appear to vary in concert which suggests the pattern of mutation is relatively constant across the genome and hence unlikely to generate variation in GC-content. We confirm this using two different analyses. We find that genomic features explain less than 50% of the explainable variance in the rate of DNM. As expected the rate of divergence between species and the level of diversity within humans are correlated to the rate of DNM. However, the correlations are weaker than if all the variation in divergence was due to variation in the mutation rate. We provide evidence that this is due the effect of biased gene conversion on the probability that a mutation will become fixed. We find no evidence that linked selection affects the relationship between divergence and DNM density. In contrast to divergence, we find that most of the variation in diversity can be explained by variation in the mutation rate. Finally, we show that the correlation between divergence and DNM density declines as increasingly divergent species are considered.\\n\\nAuthor summaryUsing a dataset of 40,000 de novo mutations we show that there is large-scale variation in the mutation rate at the 100KB and 1MB scale. We show that different types of mutation vary in concert and in a manner that is not expected to generate variation in base composition; hence mutation bias is not responsible for the large-scale variation in base composition that is observed across human chromosomes. As expected large-scale variation in the rate of divergence between species and the variation within species across the genome, are correlated to the rate of mutation, but the correlation between divergence and the mutation rate is not as strong as they could be. We show that biased gene conversion is responsible for weakening the correlation. In contrast we find that most of the variation across the genome in diversity can be explained by variation in the mutation rate. Finally, we show that the correlation between the rate of mutation in humans and the divergence between humans and other species, weakens as the species become more divergent.",

    "abstract": "Boron is an essential plant micronutrient; but is toxic at high concentrations. Boron toxicity can severely affect crop productivity in arid and semi-arid environments. Puccinellia distans (Jacq.) Par1., common alkali grass, is found throughout the world and can survive under boron concentrations that are lethal for other plant species. In addition, P. distans can accumulate very high levels of this element. Despite these interesting features, very little research has been performed to elucidate the boron tolerance mechanism in this species. In this study, P. distans samples were analyzed by RNA sequencing to identify genes related to boron tolerance and hyperaccumulation. Abundance levels of selected differentially expressed transcripts were validated by real-time PCR. The results indicated that the hyperaccumulation mechanism of P. distans involves many transcriptomic changes including those that lead to: alterations in the malate pathway, changes in cell wall components that allow sequestration of excess boron without toxic effects, and increased expression of at least one putative boron transporter and two putative aquaporins. Elucidation of the boron accumulation mechanism is important to develop approaches for bioremediation of boron contaminated soils.",

    "abstract": "Despite the promise that molecular data would provide a seemingly unlimited source of independent characters, many plant phylogenetic studies are based on only two regions, the plastid genome and nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA). Their popularity can be explained by high copy numbers and universal PCR primers that make their sequences easily amplified and converted into parallel datasets. Unfortunately, their utility is limited by linked loci and limited characters resulting in low confidence in the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates, especially when rapid radiations occur. In another contribution on anchored phylogenomics in angiosperms, we presented flowering plant-specific anchored enrichment probes for hundreds of conserved nuclear genes and demonstrated their use at the level of all angiosperms. In this contribution, we focus on a common problem in phylogenetic reconstructions below the family level: weak or unresolved backbone due to rapid radiations ([&le;] 10 million years) followed by long divergence, using the Cariceae-Dulichieae-Scirpeae clade (CDS, Cyperaceae) as a test case. By comparing our nuclear matrix of 461 genes to a typical Sanger-sequence dataset consisting of a few plastid genes (matK, ndhF) and an nrDNA marker (ETS), we demonstrate that our nuclear data is fully compatible with the Sanger dataset and resolves short backbone internodes with high support in both concatenated and coalescence-based analyses. In addition, we show that nuclear gene tree incongruence is inversely proportional to phylogenetic information content, indicating that incongruence is mostly due to gene tree estimation error. This suggests that large numbers of conserved nuclear loci could produce more accurate trees than sampling rapidly evolving regions prone to saturation and long-branch attraction. The robust phylogenetic estimates obtained here, and high congruence with previous morphological and molecular analyses, are strong evidence for a complete tribal revision of CDS. The anchored hybrid enrichment probes used in this study should be similarly effective in other flowering plant groups.

We have developed a way to control integrase activity on identical attP/attB sites by using catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) as a programmable binding protein that can compete with integrase for binding to specific attachment sites. Utilizing a plasmid that contains two identical Bxb1 attP sites, integration can be repressed up to 8 fold at either one of the two attP sites when guide RNA and dCas9 are present. Guide RNA sequences that bind specifically to attB, or either of two attP sites, have been developed.

We demonstrate that in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, MLL3/4-dependent deposition of H3K4me1 at enhancers correlates with increased levels of chromatin interactions, whereas loss of MLL3/4 leads to greatly reduced frequencies of chromatin interactions and failure of lineage-specific gene expression programs. We further show that H3K4me1 facilitates recruitment of the Cohesin complex to chromatin in vitro and in vivo, providing a potential mechanism for MLL3/4 to promote chromatin looping. Taken together, our results support an active role for MLL3/4 in modulating chromatin organization at enhancers in mammalian cells.",

Social learning strategies such as conformity can be broadly adaptive, but may also retard the spread of adaptive innovations. Strategies like payoff-biased learning, in contrast, are effective at diffusing new behaviour but may perform poorly when adaptive behaviour is common. We present a field experiment in a wild primate, Cebus capucinus, that introduced a novel food item and documented the innovation and diffusion of successful extraction techniques. We develop a multilevel, Bayesian statistical analysis that allows us to quantify individual-level evidence for different social and individual learning strategies. We find that payoff-biased social learning and age-biased social learning are primarily responsible for the diffusion of new techniques. We find no evidence of conformity; instead rare techniques receive slightly increased attention. We also find substantial and important variation in individual learning strategies that is patterned by age, with younger individuals being more influenced by both social information and their own individual experience. The aggregate cultural dynamics in turn depend upon the variation in learning strategies and the age structure of the wild population.",

    "abstract": "Influenza virus has a high mutation rate, and this low replicative fidelity contributes to its capacity for rapid evolution. Clonal sequencing and fluctuation tests have suggested that the mutation rate of influenza A virus is 7.1 x 10-6 - 4.5 x 10-5 substitutions per nucleotide per cell infection cycle and 2.7 x 10-6 - 3.0 x 10-5 substitutions per nucleotide per strand copied (s/n/r). However, sequencing assays are biased toward mutations with minimal impacts on viral fitness and fluctuation tests typically investigate only a subset of the twelve mutational classes. We developed a fluctuation test based on reversion to fluorescence in a set of virally encoded mutant green fluorescent proteins. This method allowed us to measure the rates of selectively neutral mutations representative of all 12 mutational classes in the context of an unstructured RNA. We measured an overall mutation rate of 1.8 x 10-4 s/n/r for PR8 (H1N1) and 2.5 x 10-4 s/n/r for Hong Kong 2014 (H3N2). The replication mode was linear. The mutation rates of these divergent strains are significantly higher than previous estimates and suggest that each replicated genome will have an average of 2-3 mutations. The viral mutational spectrum is heavily biased toward A to G and U to C transitions, resulting in a transition to transversion bias of 2.7 and 3.6 for the two strains. These mutation rates were relatively constant over a range of physiological temperatures. Our high-resolution analysis of influenza virus mutation rates will enable more refined models of its molecular evolution.\\n\\nSignificanceThe rapid evolution of influenza virus is a major problem in public health. A key factor driving this rapid evolution is the virus very high mutation rate. We developed a new method for measuring the rates of all 12 mutational classes in influenza virus, which eliminates some of the biases of existing assays. We find that the influenza virus mutation rate is much higher than previously reported and is consistent across two distinct strains and a range of temperatures. Our data suggest that influenza viruses replicate at their maximally tolerable mutation rates, highlighting both the virus evolutionary potential and its significant constraints.",

    "abstract": "Cholera emergence is strongly linked to local environmental and ecological context. The 1991-2004 pandemic emerged in Peru and spread north into Ecuadors El Oro province, making this a key site for potential re-emergence. Machala, El Oro, is a port city of 250,000, near the Peruvian border. Many livelihoods depend on the estuarine system, from fishing for subsistence and trade, to domestic water use. In 2014, we conducted biweekly sampling for 10 months in five estuarine locations, across a gradient of human use, and ranging from inland to ocean. We measured water characteristics implicated in V. cholerae growth and persistence: pH, temperature, salinity, and algal concentration, and evaluated samples in five months for pathogenic and non-pathogenic Vibrio cholerae, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We found environmental persistence of strains O1 and O139, but no evidence for toxigene presence. V. cholerae presence was coupled to algal and salinity concentration, and sites exhibited considerable seasonal and spatial heterogeneity. This study indicates that environmental conditions in Machala are optimal for human cholera re-emergence, with risk peaking during September, and higher risk near urban periphery low-income communities. This highlights a need for surveillance of this coupled cholera- estuarine system to anticipate potential future outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Sparse, sequential patterns of neural activity have been observed in numerous brain areas during time-keeping and motor sequence tasks. Inspired by such observations, we construct a model of the striatum, an all-inhibitory circuit where sequential activity patterns are prominent, addressing the following key challenges: (i) obtaining control over temporal rescaling of the sequence speed, with the ability to generalize to new speeds; (ii) facilitating flexible expression of distinct sequences via selective activation, concatenation, and recycling of specific subsequences; and (iii) enabling the biologically plausible learning of sequences, consistent with the decoupling of learning and execution suggested by lesion studies showing that cortical circuits are necessary for learning, but that subcortical circuits are sufficient to drive learned behaviors. The same mechanisms that we describe can also be applied to circuits with both excitatory and inhibitory populations, and hence may underlie general features of sequential neural activity pattern generation in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Human populations living in Eurasia during the Holocene experienced significant evolutionary change. It has been predicted that the transition of Holocene populations into agrarianism and urbanization brought about culture-gene co-evolution that favoured via directional selection genetic variants associated with higher general cognitive ability (GCA). Population expansion and replacement has also been proposed as an important source of GCA gene-frequency change during this time period. To examine whether GCA might have risen during the Holocene, we compare a sample of 99 ancient Eurasian genomes (ranging from 4,557 to 1,208 years of age) with a sample of 503 modern European genomes, using three different cognitive polygenic scores. Significant differences favouring the modern genomes were found for all three polygenic scores (Odds Ratio=0.92, p=0.037; 0.81, p=0.001 and 0.81, p=0.02). Furthermore, a significant increase in positive allele count over 3,249 years was found using a sample of 66 ancient genomes (r=0.217, pone-tailed=0.04). These observations are consistent with the expectation that GCA rose during the Holocene.",
