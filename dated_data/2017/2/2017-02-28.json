    "abstract": "Background Background References Many areas of neuroscience are now critically dependent on computational tools to help understand the large volumes of data being created. Furthermore, computer models are increasingly being used to help predict and understand the function of the nervous system. Many of these computations are complex and usually cannot be concisely reported in the methods section of a scientific article. In a few areas there are widely used software packages for analysis (e.g., SPM, FSL, AFNI, FreeSurfer, Civet in neuroimaging) or simulation (e.g. NEURON, NEST, Brian). However, we often write new computer programs to solve specific problems in the course of our research. Some of these programs may be relatively small scripts that help analyze all of our data, and these rarely get described in papers.

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-seq technologies enable high throughput gene expression measurement of individual cells, and allow the discovery of heterogeneity within cell populations. Measurement of cell-to-cell gene expression similarity is critical to identification, visualization and analysis of cell populations. However, single-cell data introduce challenges to conventional measures of gene expression similarity because of the high level of noise, outliers and dropouts. Here, we propose a novel similarity-learning framework, SIMLR (single-cell interpretation via multi-kernel learning), which learns an appropriate distance metric from the data for dimension reduction, clustering and visualization applications. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods for these applications, we used SIMLR to re-analyse seven representative single-cell data sets, including high-throughput droplet-based data sets with tens of thousands of cells. We show that SIMLR greatly improves clustering sensitivity and accuracy, as well as the visualization and interpretability of the data.",

    "abstract": "The dopamine partial agonist aripiprazole is increasingly used to treat pathologies for which other antipsychotics are indicated because it displays fewer side effects, such as sedation and depression-like symptoms, than other dopamine receptor antagonists. Previously, we showed that aripiprazole may protect motivational function by preserving reinforcement-related signals used to sustain reward-maximization behaviour in a simple action-outcome learning task. However, the effect of aripiprazole on more cognitive facets of human reinforcement learning, such as learning from the hypothetical outcomes of alternative courses of action (i.e., counterfactual learning), is unknown.\\n\\nTo test the influence of aripiprazole on counterfactual learning, we administered a reinforcement-learning task that involves both direct learning from obtained outcomes and indirect learning from forgone outcomes to two groups of Gilles de la Tourette (GTS) patients, one consisting of patients who were completely unmedicated and the other consisting of patients who were receiving aripiprazole monotherapy, and to healthy subjects. We replicated a previous finding showing that aripiprazole does not affect direct learning from obtained outcomes in GTS. We also found that whereas learning performance improved in the presence of counterfactual feedback in both healthy controls and unmedicated GTS patients, this was not the case in aripiprazole-medicated GTS patients.\\n\\nOur results suggest that whereas aripiprazole preserves direct learning of action-outcome associations, it may impair more complex inferential processes, such as counterfactual learning, from forgone outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) include some of the worlds most widespread and virulent pathogens. Our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms these parasites use to invade and exploit hosts other than mice and primates is, however, extremely limited. It is therefore imperative to characterize transcriptome-wide gene expression from non-model malaria parasites and how this varies across host individuals. Here, we used high-throughput Illumina RNA-sequencing on blood from wild-caught Eurasian siskins experimentally infected with a clonal strain of the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium ashfordi (lineage GRW2). By using a multi-step approach to filter out host transcripts, we successfully assembled the blood-stage transcriptome of P. ashfordi. A total of 11 954 expressed transcripts were identified, and 7 860 were annotated with protein information. We quantified gene expression levels of all parasite transcripts across three hosts during two infection stages - peak and decreasing parasitemia. Interestingly, parasites from the same host displayed remarkably similar expression profiles during different infection stages, but showed large differences across hosts, indicating that P. ashfordi may adjust its gene expression to specific host individuals. We further show that the majority of transcripts are most similar to the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and a large number of red blood cell invasion genes were discovered, suggesting evolutionary conserved invasion strategies between mammalian and avian Plasmodium. The transcriptome of P. ashfordi and its host-specific gene expression advances our understanding of Plasmodium plasticity and is a valuable resource as it allows for further studies analysing gene evolution and comparisons of parasite gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Proper cell size is essential for cellular function (Hall et al., 2004). Nonetheless, despite more than 100 years of work on the subject, the mechanisms that maintain cell size homeostasis are largely mysterious (Marshall et al., 2012). Cells in growing populations maintain cell size within a narrow range by coordinating growth and division. Bacterial and eukaryotic cells both demonstrate homeostatic size control, which maintains population-level variation in cell size within a certain range, and returns the population average to that range if it is perturbed (Marshall et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2012; Amodeo and Skotheim, 2015). Recent work has proposed two different strategies for size control: budding yeast has been proposed to use an inhibitor-dilution strategy to regulate size at the G1/S transition (Schmoller et al., 2015), while bacteria appear to use an adder strategy, in which a fixed amount of growth each generation causes cell size to converge on a stable average, a mechanism also suggested for budding yeast (Campos et al., 2014; Jun and Taheri-Araghi, 2015; Taheri-Araghi et al., 2015; Tanouchi et al., 2015; Soifer et al., 2016). Here we present evidence that cell size in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is regulated by a third strategy: the size dependent expression of the mitotic activator Cdc25. The cdc25 transcript levels are regulated such that smaller cells express less Cdc25 and larger cells express more Cdc25, creating an increasing concentration of Cdc25 as cell grow and providing a mechanism for cell to trigger cell division when they reach a threshold concentration of Cdc25. Since regulation of mitotic entry by Cdc25 is well conserved, this mechanism may provide a wide spread solution to the problem of size control in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "A common approach to design genetic circuits is to compose gene expression cassettes together. While appealing, this modular approach is challenged by the fact that expression of each gene depends on the availability of transcriptional/translational resources, which is in turn determined by the presence of other genes in the circuit. This raises the question of how competition for resources by different genes affects a circuits behavior. Here, we create a library of genetic activation cascades in bacteria E. coli, where we explicitly tune the resource demand by each gene. We develop a general Hill-function-based model that incorporates resource competition effects through resource demand coefficients. These coefficients lead to non-regulatory interactions among genes that reshape circuits behavior. For the activation cascade, such interactions result in surprising biphasic or monotonically decreasing responses. Finally, we use resource demand coefficients to guide the choice of ribosome binding site (RBS) and DNA copy number to restore the cascades intended monotonically increasing response. Our results demonstrate how unintended circuits behavior arises from resource competition and provide a model-guided methodology to minimize the resulting effects.\\n\\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decisions vary in the speed at which we make them. Evidence suggests that translating sensory information into behavioral decisions relies on distributed interacting neural populations, with decision speed hinging on power modulations of neural oscillations. Yet, the dependence of perceptual decisions on the large-scale network organization of coupled neural oscillations has remained elusive. We measured magnetoencephalography signals in human listeners who judged acoustic stimuli made of carefully titrated clouds of tone sweeps. These stimuli were used under two task contexts where the participants judged the overall pitch or direction of the tone sweeps. We traced the large-scale network dynamics of source-projected neural oscillations on a trial-by-trial basis using power envelope correlations and graph-theoretical network discovery. Under both tasks, faster decisions were predicted by higher segregation and lower integration of coupled beta-band (~16-28 Hz) oscillations. We also uncovered brain network states that promoted faster decisions and emerged from lower-order auditory and higher-order control brain areas. Specifically, decision speed in judging tone-sweep direction critically relied on nodal network configurations of anterior temporal, cingulate and middle frontal cortices. Our findings suggest that global network communication during perceptual decision-making is implemented in the human brain by large-scale couplings between beta-band neural oscillations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe speed at which we make perceptual decisions varies. This translation of sensory information into behavioral decisions hinges on dynamic changes in neural oscillatory activity. However, the large-scale neural network embodiment supporting perceptual decision-making is unclear. Alavash et al. address this question by experimenting two auditory perceptual decision-making situations. Using graph-theoretical network discovery, they trace the large-scale network dynamics of coupled neural oscillations to uncover brain network states supporting the speed of auditory perceptual decisions. They find that higher network segregation of coupled beta-band oscillations supports faster auditory perceptual decisions over trials. Moreover, when auditory perceptual decisions are relatively difficult, the decision speed benefits from higher segregation of frontal cortical areas, but lower segregation and integration of auditory cortical areas.",

    "abstract": "Human populations living in Eurasia during the Holocene experienced significant evolutionary change. It has been predicted that the transition of Holocene populations into agrarianism and urbanization brought about culture-gene co-evolution that favoured via directional selection genetic variants associated with higher general cognitive ability (GCA). Population expansion and replacement has also been proposed as an important source of GCA gene-frequency change during this time period. To examine whether GCA might have risen during the Holocene, we compare a sample of 99 ancient Eurasian genomes (ranging from 4,557 to 1,208 years of age) with a sample of 503 modern European genomes, using three different cognitive polygenic scores. Significant differences favouring the modern genomes were found for all three polygenic scores (Odds Ratio=0.92, p=0.037; 0.81, p=0.001 and 0.81, p=0.02). Furthermore, a significant increase in positive allele count over 3,249 years was found using a sample of 66 ancient genomes (r=0.217, pone-tailed=0.04). These observations are consistent with the expectation that GCA rose during the Holocene.",

    "abstract": "When cells enter meiosis, their chromosomes reorganize as linear arrays of chromatin loops anchored to a central axis. Meiotic chromosome axes form a platform for the assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC), and play central roles in other meiotic processes, including homologous pairing, recombination, and chromosome segregation. However, little is known about the three-dimensional organization of components within the axes, which consist of cohesin complexes and additional meiosis-specific proteins. Here we investigate the molecular organization of meiotic chromosome axes in C. elegans through STORM and PALM superresolution imaging of intact germline tissue. By tagging one axis protein (HIM-3) with a photoconvertible fluorescent protein, we established a spatial reference for other components, which were localized using antibodies against epitope tags inserted by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Using three-dimensional averaging, we determined the 3D-organization of all known components within synapsed chromosome axes to a precision of 2-5 nanometers. We find that meiosis-specific HORMA-domain proteins span a gap between cohesin complexes and the central region of the SC, consistent with their essential roles in SC assembly. Our data further suggest that the two different meiotic cohesin complexes are distinctly arranged within the axes: Cohesin complexes containing COH-3 or -4 kleisins form a central core in the central plane of the axes, whereas complexes containing REC-8 kleisin protrude above and below the plane defined by the SC. This splayed organization may help to explain the role of the chromosome axes in promoting inter-homolog repair of meiotic double strand breaks by inhibiting inter-sister repair.",

    "abstract": "The rapid diversification of Myotis bats into more than 100 species is one of the most extensive mammalian radiations available for study. Efforts to understand relationships within Myotis have primarily utilized mitochondrial markers and trees inferred from nuclear markers lacked resolution. Our current understanding of relationships within Myotis is therefore biased towards a set of phylogenetic markers that may not reflect the history of the nuclear genome. To resolve this, we sequenced the full mitochondrial genomes of 37 representative Myotis, primarily from the New World, in conjunction with targeted sequencing of 3,648 ultraconserved elements (UCEs). We inferred the phylogeny and explored the effects of concatenation and summary phylogenetic methods, as well as combinations of markers based on informativeness or levels of missing data, on our results. Of the 294 phylogenies generated from the nuclear UCE data, all are significantly different from phylogenies inferred using mitochondrial genomes. Even within the nuclear data, quartet frequencies indicate that around half of all UCE loci conflict with the estimated species tree. Several factors can drive such conflict, including incomplete lineage sorting, introgressive hybridization, or even phylogenetic error. Despite the degree of discordance between nuclear UCE loci and the mitochondrial genome and among UCE loci themselves, the most common nuclear topology is recovered in one quarter of all analyses with strong nodal support. Based on these results, we re-examine the evolutionary history of Myotis to better understand the phenomena driving their unique nuclear, mitochondrial, and biogeographic histories.",

    "abstract": "Chemical-genetic approaches offer the potential for unbiased functional annotation of chemical libraries. Mutations can alter the response of cells to a compound, revealing chemical-genetic interactions that can elucidate a compounds mode of action. We developed a highly parallel and unbiased yeast chemical-genetic screening system involving three key components. First, in a drug-sensitive genetic background, we constructed an optimized, diagnostic mutant collection that is predictive all major yeast biological processes. Second, we implemented a multiplexed (768-plex) barcode sequencing protocol, enabling assembly of thousands of chemical-genetic profiles. Finally, based on comparison of the chemical-genetic profiles with a compendium of genome-wide genetic interaction profiles, we predicted compound functionality. Applying this high-throughput approach, we screened 7 different compound libraries and annotated their functional diversity. We further validated biological process predictions, prioritized a diverse set of compounds, and identified compounds that appear to have dual modes of action.",

    "abstract": "Life inside ant colonies is orchestrated with a diverse set of pheromones, but it is not clear how ants perceive these social cues. It has been proposed that pheromone perception in ants evolved via expansions in the numbers of odorant receptors (ORs) and antennal lobe glomeruli. Here we generate the first mutant lines in ants by disrupting orco, a gene required for the function of all ORs. We find that orco mutants exhibit severe deficiencies in social behavior and fitness, suggesting that they are unable to perceive pheromones. Surprisingly, unlike in Drosophila melanogaster, orco mutant ants also lack most of the approximately 500 antennal lobe glomeruli found in wild-types. These results illustrate that ORs are essential for ant social organization, and raise the possibility that, similar to mammals, receptor function is required for the development and/or maintenance of the highly complex olfactory processing areas in the ant brain.",

We discovered a selfish element causing a genetic incompatibility between strains of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The element is made up of sup-35, a maternal-effect toxin that kills developing embryos, and pha-1, its zygotically expressed antidote. pha-1 has long been considered essential for pharynx development based on its mutant phenotype, but this phenotype in fact arises from a loss of suppression of sup-35 toxicity. Inactive copies of the sup-35/pha-1 element show high sequence divergence from active copies, and phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that they represent ancestral stages in the evolution of the element.

Our understanding of how social factors affect song learning however remains surprisingly incomplete. Here we examine the possible role of aggressive interactions in determining song \\\"tutor\\\" choice in song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), a songbird in which individuals display song learning strategies ranging from learning primarily from one tutor, to learning a few songs each from a number of tutors. We test two hypotheses: The Competition hypothesis suggests that young birds learn more from tutors with whom they compete especially intensely and predicts that tutees will respond with high aggression to tutor songs. In contrast the Cooperation hypothesis suggests that song learning reflects a cooperative relationship between the tutor and the tutee and predicts that tutees will respond with low aggression to tutor songs. In a playback experiment we found that birds respond more aggressively to songs of their tutors than they do to songs of strangers and that the strength of aggressive response correlated positively with how much they had learned from that tutor. These results provide the first field evidence for the hypothesis that young males preferentially learn their songs from adult males with whom they compete most intensely during the song-learning phase, and perhaps afterwards.",

    "abstract": "Face perception is accomplished by face-selective neural processes, involving holistic processing that enables highly efficient integration of facial features into a whole face representation. It has been shown that in face-selective regions of the ventral temporal cortex, neural resources involved in holistic processing are primarily dedicated to the central portion of the visual field. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that holistic processing might be the privilege of centrally presented faces and could be strongly diminished in the case of peripheral faces. We addressed this question using the face inversion effect, a well established marker of holistic face processing. The behavioral results revealed impaired identity discrimination performance for inverted peripheral faces scaled according to the V1 magnification factor, compared to upright presented faces. The size of peripheral face inversion effect (FIE) was comparable to that found for centrally displayed faces. Face inversion affected the early ERP responses to faces in two time intervals. The earliest FIE was most pronounced in the time window between 130-140 ms following stimulus presentation, for both centrally and peripherally displayed faces and in the latter case, it was present only over the contralateral hemisphere. The timing of the next component FIE corresponded closely with the temporal interval of the N170 ERP component and showed strong right hemisphere lateralization, both when faces were displayed in the left or right visual field. Furthermore, we also showed that centrally presented face masks impaired peripheral face identity discrimination performance, but did not reduce the magnitude of the FIE. These findings revealed robust behavioral and neural inversion effects for peripheral faces and thus suggest that faces are processed holistically throughout the visual field.\\n\\nHighlightsRobust behavioral and neural inversion effect was found for peripheral faces.\\n\\nP1 ERP component is modulated by inverted central and contralateral faces.\\n\\nN170 ERP component is modulated by centrally and peripherally presented faces.\\n\\nNeural face inversion effect shows strong right hemisphere lateralization.\\n\\nFaces are processed holistically throughout the visual field.",

    "abstract": "In the case of tuberculosis (TB), the capabilities of epidemic models to produce quantitatively robust forecasts are limited by multiple hindrances. Among these, understanding the complex relationship between disease epidemiology and populations' age structure has been highlighted as one of the most relevant. TB dynamics depends on age in multiple ways, some of which are traditionally simplified in the literature. That is the case of the heterogeneities in contact intensity among different age-strata that are common to all air-borne diseases, but still typically neglected in the TB case. Furthermore, whilst demographic structures of many countries are rapidly aging, demographic dynamics is pervasively ignored when modeling TB spreading. In this work, we present a TB transmission model that incorporates country-specific demographic prospects and empirical contact data around a data-driven description of TB dynamics. Using our model, we find that the inclusion of demographic dynamics is followed by an increase in the burden levels prospected for the next decades in the areas of the world that are most hit by the disease nowadays. Similarly, we show that considering realistic patterns of contacts among individuals in different age-strata reshapes the transmission patterns reproduced by the models, a result with potential implications for the design of age-focused epidemiological interventions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementEven though tuberculosis (TB) is acknowledged as a strongly age-dependent disease, it remains unclear how TB epidemics would react, in the following decades, to the generalized aging that human populations are experiencing worldwide. This situation is partly caused by the limitations of current transmission models at describing the relationship between demography and TB transmission. Here, we present a data-driven epidemiological model that, unlike previous approaches, explicitly contemplates relevant aspects of the coupling between agestructure and TB dynamics, such as demographic evolution and contact heterogeneities. Using our model, we identify substantial biases in epidemiological forecasts rooted in an inadequate description of these aspects, both at the level of aggregated incidence and mortality rates and their distribution across age-strata.",

Most predictive models use only environmental parameters, although a long history of ecological literature suggests that community complexity should also be an informative parameter. Thus, we hypothesize that incorporating information about a communitys complexity might improve predictive power in microbial models. Here, we present a new metric, called community \\\"cohesion,\\\" that quantifies the degree of connectivity of a microbial community. We validate our approach using long-term (10+ year) phytoplankton datasets, where absolute abundance counts are available. As a case study of our metrics utility, we show that community cohesion is a strong predictor of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (R2 = 0.47) between phytoplankton communities in Lake Mendota, WI, USA. Our cohesion metrics outperform a model built using all available environmental data collected during a long-term sampling program. The result that cohesion corresponds strongly to Bray-Curtis dissimilarity is consistent across the five lakes analyzed here. Our cohesion metrics can be used as a predictor for many community-level properties, such as phylogenetic diversity, nutrient fluxes, or ecosystem services. We explain here the calculation of our cohesion metrics and their potential uses in microbial ecology.\\n\\nConflict of InterestThe authors declare no conflict of interest.",

Whether and how such kinship preference translates into differential neurocognitive evaluation of social interactions has remained an open question. Here, we investigated how the human brain is engaged when viewing a moral dilemma between genetic vs. non-genetic sisters. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, a movie depicting refusal of organ donation between two sisters was shown, with participants guided to believe the sisters were related either genetically or by adoption. The participants selfreported that genetic relationship was not relevant to them, yet their brain activity told a different story. When the participants believed that the sisters were genetically related, inter-subject similarity of brain activity was significantly stronger in areas supporting response-conflict resolution, emotion regulation, and self-referential social cognition. Our results show that mere knowledge of a genetic relationship between interacting persons can robustly modulate social cognition of the perceiver.",

After analysed 46,692,922 SSM of 10,878 samples, we proposed a pan-cancer scale landscape of SSM for 60 cancer projects in ICGC. In addition, the whole genome sequencing (WGS) and whole exome sequencing (WXS) techniques were compared according to the landscape of SSM. The result indicates numbers of SSM vary dramatically in different cancers. WGS can detect 10 times more single base substitutions and insertions than WXS. In terms of WXS, it called 10 times more deletions than insertions. Multiple base substitutions have not been well studied so they were just observed in a few cancer projects. Cancers generally show high prevalence of C > T substitutions at NpCpG trinucleotide contexts. Skin cancer showed distinct mutational spectra. Breast cancer, bladder cancer, and cervical cancer were found to have similar mutational spectra. Acute myeloid leukemia and lung cancer from South Korea, and colorectal cancer from China show high density of single base substitutions per mega base in chromosome Y.

Extract degradation associated with the freeze-thaw process can be substantially reduced by using centrifugal filter-based dehydration and slow sample cooling. Large amounts of frozen extract stocks from single batch preparations allowed us to collect a large number of data in micromanipulation experiments that are intrinsically low-throughput and, hence, clarify correlations between metaphase spindle size and stiffness.

Tbx1 can activate and repress transcription and previous work has shown that one of its functions is to negatively modulate cardiomyocyte differentiation. Tbx1 occupies the anterior heart field (AHF) enhancer of the Mef2c gene, which encodes a key cardiac differentiation transcription factor. Here we show that increased dosage of Tbx1 is associated with down regulation of Mef2c expression and reduced acetylation of its AHF enhancer in cultured mouse myoblasts. Consistently, 22q11.2DS-derived and in vitro differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) expressed higher levels of Mef2c and showed increased AHF acetylation, compared to hiPSCs from a healthy donor. Most importantly, we show that in mouse embryos, loss of Tbx1 enhances the expression of the Mef2c-AHF-Cre transgene in a specific region of the splanchnic mesoderm, and in a dosage-dependent manner, providing an in vivo correlate of our cell culture data. These results indicate that Tbx1 regulates the Mef2c-AHF enhancer by inducing histone deacetylation.",

Single cell imaging of the locus folding was performed to test model predictions. While CTCF occupancy alone fails to predict the in vivo folding at genomic length scale of 10 kb, we found that homotypic interactions between active and Polycomb-repressed promoters co-occurring in the same DNA fibre fully explain the HoxB folding patterns imaged in single cells.
