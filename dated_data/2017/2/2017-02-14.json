    "abstract": "Analysis of coupled variables is a core concept of cell biological inference, with co-localization of two molecules as a proxy for protein interaction being a ubiquitous example. However, external effectors may influence the observed co-localization independently from the local interaction of two proteins. Such global bias, although biologically meaningful, is often neglected when interpreting co-localization. Here, we describe DeBias, a computational method to quantify and decouple global bias from local interactions between variables by modeling the observed co-localization as the cumulative contribution of a global and a local component. We showcase four applications of DeBias in different areas of cell biology, and demonstrate that the global bias encapsulates fundamental mechanistic information of cellular behavior.

    "abstract": "We propose and validate a clear strategy to efficiently and comprehensively characterize neurobehavioral deficits in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome. This novel approach uses neurocognitive theory to design and select behavioral tasks that test specific hypotheses concerning the results of Down syndrome. In this manuscript we model in Ts65Dn mice the Arizona Cognitive Task Battery used to study human populations with Down syndrome. We observed specific deficits for spatial memory, impaired long-term memory for visual objects, acquisition and reversal of motor responses, reduced motor dexterity, and impaired adaptive function as measured by nesting and anxiety tasks. The Ts65Dn mice showed intact temporal ordering, novelty detection, and visual object recognition with short delays. These results phenocopy the performance of participants with Down syndrome on the Arizona Cognitive Task Battery. This approach extends the utility of mouse models of Down syndrome by integrating the expertise of clinical neurology and cognitive neuroscience into the mouse behavioral laboratory. Further, by directly emphasizing the reciprocal translation of research between human disease states and the associated mouse models, we demonstrate that it is possible for both groups to mutually inform each others research to more efficiently generate hypotheses and elucidate treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder entailing social and cognitive deficits, including marked problems with language. Its complex multifactorial etiopathogenesis, including genetic and environmental factors, is still widely uncertain. SZ incidence has always been high and quite stable in human populations, across time and regardless of cultural implications, due to unclear reasons. It has been hypothesised that SZ pathophysiology may involve the biological components that changed during the recent human evolutionary history and led to our distinctive mode of cognition, which includes language skills. In this paper we explore this possibility, focusing on the self-domestication of the human species. This has been claimed to account for many human-specific distinctive traits, including aspects of our behaviour and cognition, and to favour the emergence of complex languages through cultural evolution. The \\\"domestication syndrome\\\" in mammals comprises the constellation of traits exhibited by domesticated strains, seemingly resulting from the hypofunction of the neural crest. It is our intention to show that people with SZ exhibit more marked domesticated traits at the morphological, physiological, and behavioural levels. We also show that genes involved in domestication and neural crest development and function comprise nearly 20% SZ candidates, most of which exhibit altered expression profiles in the brain of SZ patients, specifically in areas involved in language processing. Based on these observations, we conclude that SZ may represent an abnormal ontogenetic itinerary for the human faculty of language, resulting, at least in part, from changes in genes important for the \\\"domestication syndrome\\\" and, primarily involving the neural crest.",

SJB and JSW wrote the paper.\\n\\nScientific significance statementZooplankton grazing is an important driver of plankton mortality and is a core component of the microbial loop. The dilution method is the prevailing tool used to measure the impact of zooplankton in marine microbial communities. However, the theoretical model underlying the interpretation of experimental measurements using this method does not account for niche competition between plankton. As a consequence, we show that the dilution method may conflate the effects of grazing with those of niche competition, implying that previously reported grazing rates could be overestimated. We propose modifying the classical dilution method by diluting only the zooplankton and then measuring the response of plankton. This \\\"Z-dilution\\\" method explicitly accounts for the effects of niche competition in limiting net plankton growth. We find the Z-dilution method provides robust grazing rate estimates in theory and suggest ways in which the relative strength of niche competition to zooplankton grazing could be measured by combining the Z-dilution and classical dilution methods.\\n\\nData availability statementCode is available from http://github.com/WeitzGroup/DilutionMethod-NicheCompetition and is archived on Zenodo at http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.61196 (Beckett and Weitz, 2016).\\n\\nAbstractThe dilution method is the principal tool used to infer in situ microzooplankton grazing rates. However, grazing is the only mortality process considered by the theoretical model underlying the interpretation of dilution method experiments. We show an alternative interpretation arises when there is concurrent niche competition within the plankton community. We find that grazing rates may be overestimated - the degree of overestimation is related to the importance of niche competition relative to zooplankton grazing. Thus, we propose a modification to the dilution method to disentangle the effects of niche competition and zooplankton grazing. Our theoretical results suggest the revised \\\"Z-dilution\\\" method can robustly infer grazing mortality, regardless of the dominant plankton mortality driver. Further, we show it is possible to independently estimate both grazing mortality and niche competition when the classical and Z-dilution methods are used in tandem. We discuss the significance of these results for quantifying plankton mortality rates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCircadian clocks are found in organisms of almost all domains including photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, whereby large diversity exists within the protein components involved. In the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 circadian rhythms are driven by a unique KaiABC protein clock, which is embedded in a network of input and output factors. Homologous proteins to the KaiABC clock have been observed in Bacteria and Archaea, where evidence for circadian behavior in these domains is accumulating. However, interaction and function of non-cyanobacterial Kai-proteins as well as homologous input and output components remain mainly unclear.\\n\\nResultsUsing a universal BLAST analyses, we identified putative KaiC-based timing systems in organisms outside as well as variations within Cyanobacteria. A systematic analyses of publicly available microarray data elucidated interesting variations in circadian gene expression between different cyanobacterial strains, which might be correlated to the diversity of genome encoded clock components. Based on statistical analyses of co-occurrences of the clock components homologous to Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, we propose putative networks of reduced and fully functional clock systems. Further, we studied KaiC sequence conservation to determine functionally important regions of diverged KaiC homologs. Biochemical characterization of exemplary cyanobacterial KaiC proteins as well as homologs from two thermophilic Archaea demonstrated that kinase activity is always present. However, a KaiA-mediated phosphorylation is only detectable in KaiC1 orthologs.\\n\\nConclusionOur analysis of 11,264 genomes clearly demonstrates that components of the Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 circadian clock are present in Bacteria and Archaea. However, all components are less abundant in other organisms than Cyanobacteria and KaiA, Pex, LdpA, and CdpA are only present in the latter. Thus, only reduced KaiBC-based or even simpler, solely KaiC-based timing systems might exist outside of the cyanobacterial phylum, which might be capable of driving diurnal oscillations.",

    "abstract": "Aim: Although there is a vast body of literature on the causes of variation in species composition in ecological communities, less effort has been invested in understanding how interactions between these species vary. Since interactions are crucial to the structure and functioning of ecological communities, we need to develop a better understanding of their spatial distribution. Here, we investigate whether species interactions vary more in response to different climate variables, than individual species do. Location: Eurasia. Time period: 2000s. Major taxa: Animalia. Methods: We used a measure of Local Contribution to Beta-Diversity to evaluate the compositional uniqueness of 51 host-parasite communities of rodents and their ectoparasitic fleas across Eurasia, using publicly available data. We measured uniqueness based on the species composition, and based on potential and realized biotic interactions (here, host-parasite interactions). Results: We show that species interactions vary more, across space, than species do. In particular, we show that species interactions respond to some climatic variables that have no effect on species distributions or dissimilarity. Main conclusions: Species interactions capture some degree of variation which is not apparent when looking at species occurrences only. In this system, this appeared as hosts and parasites interacting in different ways as a reponse to different environments, especially the temperature and dryness. We discuss the implications of this finding for the amount of information that should be considered when measuring community dissimilarity.",

    "abstract": "The theoretical investigation of how spatial structure affects the evolution of social behavior has mostly been done under the assumption that parent-offspring strategy transmission is perfect, i.e., for genetically transmitted traits, that mutation is very weak or absent. Here, we investigate the evolution of social behavior in structured populations under arbitrary mutation probabilities. We consider populations of fixed size N, structured such that in the absence of selection, all individuals have the same probability of reproducing or dying (neutral reproductive values are the all same). Two types of individuals, A and B, corresponding to two types of social behavior, are competing; the fidelity of strategy transmission from parent to offspring is tuned by a parameter . Social interactions have a direct effect on individual fecundities. Under the assumption of small phenotypic differences (implyingweak selection), we provide a formula for the expected frequency of type A individuals in the population, and deduce conditions for the long-term success of one strategy against another. We then illustrate our results with three common life-cycles (Wright-Fisher, Moran Birth-Death and Moran Death-Birth), and specific population structures (graph-structured populations). Qualitatively, we find that some life-cycles (Moran Birth-Death, Wright-Fisher) prevent the evolution of altruistic behavior, confirming previous results obtained with perfect strategy transmission. We also show that computing the expected frequency of altruists on a regular graph may require knowing more than just the graphs size and degree.",

    "abstract": "During rest, envelopes of band-limited on-going MEG signals co-vary across the brain in consistent patterns, which have been related to resting-state networks measured with fMRI. To investigate the genesis of such envelope correlations, we consider a whole-brain network model assuming two distinct fundamental scenarios: one where each brain area generates oscillations in a single frequency, and a novel one where each brain area can generate oscillations in multiple frequency bands. The models share, as a common generator of damped oscillations, the normal form of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation operating at the critical border between the steady state and the oscillatory regime. The envelopes of the simulated signals are compared with empirical MEG data using new methods to analyse the envelope dynamics in terms of their phase coherence and stability across the spectrum of carrier frequencies.\\n\\nConsidering the whole-brain model with a single frequency generator in each brain area, we obtain the best fit with the empirical MEG data when the fundamental frequency is tuned at 12Hz. However, when multiple frequency generators are placed at each local brain area, we obtain an improved fit of the spatio-temporal structure of on-going MEG data across all frequency bands. Our results indicate that the brain is likely to operate on multiple frequency channels during rest, introducing a novel dimension for future models of large-scale brain activity.",

We directly estimated the spontaneous mutation rate and the mutational spectrum in the non-biting midge C. riparius with a new approach. Individuals from ten mutation accumulation lines over five generations were deep genome sequenced to count de novo mutations (DNMs) that were not present in a pool of F1 individuals, representing parental genotypes. We identified 51 new single site mutations of which 25 were insertions or deletions and 26 single point mutations. This shift in the mutational spectrum compared to other organisms was explained by the high A/T content of the species. We estimated a haploid mutation rate of 2.1 x 10-9 (95% confidence interval: 1.4 x 10-9 - 3.1 x 10-9) which is in the range of recent estimates for other insects and supports the drift barrier hypothesis. We show that accurate mutation rate estimation from a high number of observed mutations is feasible with moderate effort even for non-model species.",

    "abstract": "Genomewide selection is hailed for its ability to facilitate greater genetic gains per unit time. Over breeding cycles, the requisite linkage disequilibrium (LD) between quantitative trait loci (QTL) and markers is expected to change as a result of recombination, selection, and drift, leading to a decay in prediction accuracy. Previous research has identified the need to update the training population using data that may capture new LD generated over breeding cycles, however optimal methods of updating have not been explored. In a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) breeding simulation experiment, we examined prediction accuracy and response to selection when updating the training population each cycle with the best predicted lines, the worst predicted lines, both the best and worst predicted lines, random lines, criterion-selected lines, or no lines. In the short-term, we found that updating with the best predicted lines or the best and worst predicted lines resulted in high prediction accuracy and genetic gain, but in the long-term, all methods (besides not updating) performed similarly. We also examined the impact of including all data in the training population or only the most recent data. Though patterns among update methods were similar, using a smaller, but more recent training population provided a slight advantage in prediction accuracy and genetic gain. In an actual breeding program, a breeder might desire to gather phenotypic data on lines predicted to be the best, perhaps to evaluate possible cultivars. Therefore, our results suggest that an optimal method of updating the training population is also very practical.",

Yet we know little about how the attentional modulations of single RFs contribute to the encoding of an entire visual scene. Addressing this issue requires (1) measuring a group of RFs that tile a continuous portion of visual space, (2) constructing a population-level measurement of spatial representations based on these RFs, and (3) linking how different types of RF attentional modulations change the population-level representation. To accomplish these aims, we used fMRI to characterize the responses of thousands of voxels in retinotopically organized human cortex. First, we found that the response modulations of voxel RFs (vRFs) depend on the spatial relationship between the RF center and the visual location of the attended target. Second, we used two analyses to assess the spatial encoding quality of a population of voxels. We found that attention increased fine spatial discriminability and representational fidelity near the attended target. Third, we linked these findings by manipulating the observed vRF attentional modulations and recomputing our population measures. Surprisingly, we discovered that attentional enhancements of population-level representations largely depend on position shifts of vRFs, rather than changes in size or gain. Our data suggest that position shifts of single RFs are a principal mechanism by which attention enhances population-level representations in visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "Estrogens act by binding to estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ER, ER{beta}), ligand-dependent transcription factors that play crucial roles in sex differentiation, tumor growth and cardiovascular physiology. Estrogens also activate the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), however the function of GPER in vivo is less well understood. Here we find that GPER is required to maintain normal heart rate in zebrafish embryos. Acute exposure to estrogens increased heart rate in wildtype and in ER and ER{beta} mutant embryos but not in GPER mutants. Nuclear estrogen receptor signaling remained normal in GPER mutant embryos, however GPER mutant embryos exhibited reduced basal heart rate while heart rate was normal in ER and ER{beta} mutants. We detected GPER transcript in discrete regions of the brain but not in the heart. In the brain, we observed gper expression in cells lacking nuclear estrogen receptor activity, suggesting that GPER acts in the brain to regulate heart rate independently of nuclear estrogen receptor signaling. Our results demonstrate that estradiol plays a previously unappreciated role in the acute modulation of heart rate during zebrafish embryonic development and that GPER functions as an autonomous estrogen receptor in vivo to regulate basal heart rate.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTransposable element (TE) insertions are among the most challenging type of variants to detect in genomic data because of their repetitive nature and complex mechanisms of replication. Nevertheless, the recent availability of large resequencing datasets has spurred the development of many new methods to detect TE insertions in whole genome shotgun sequences. These methods generate output in diverse formats and have a large number of software and data dependencies, making their comparative evaluation challenging for potential users.\\n\\nResultsHere we develop an integrated bioinformatics pipeline for the detection of TE insertions in whole genome shotgun data, called McClintock (https://github.com/bergmanlab/mcclintock), that automatically runs and generates standardized output for multiple TE detection methods. We demonstrate the utility of the McClintock system by performing comparative evaluation of six TE detection methods using simulated and real genome data from the model microbal eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find substantial variation among McClintock component methods in their ability to detect non-reference insertions in the yeast genome, but show that non-reference TEs at nearly all biologically-realistic locations can be detected in simulated data by combining multiple methods that use split-read and read-pair evidence. In general, our results reveal that split-read methods detect fewer non-reference TE insertions than read-pair methods, but generally have much higher positional accuracy. Analysis of a large sample of real yeast genomes reveals that most, but not all, McClintock component methods can recover known aspects of TE biology in yeast such as the transpositional activity status of families, tRNA gene target preferences, and target site duplication structure, albeit with varying levels of positional accuracy.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results suggest that no single TE detection method currently provides comprehensive detection of non-reference TEs, even in the context of a simplified model eukaryotic genome like S. cerevisiae. In spite of these limitations, the McClintock system provides a framework for testing, developing and integrating results from multiple TE detection methods to achieve this ultimate aim, as well as useful guidance for yeast researchers to select appropriate TE detection tools.",

While today a potentially lethal infection of humans that occurs in Africa and Asia, early 20th century observations in Eastern Europe suggest it may once have had a wider-ranging impact on human societies. We recovered a draft Paratyphi C genome from the 800-year-old skeleton of a young woman in Trondheim, Norway, who likely died of enteric fever. Analysis of this genome against a new, significantly expanded database of related modern genomes demonstrated that Paratyphi C is descended from the ancestors of swine pathogens, serovars Choleraesuis and Typhisuis, together forming the Para C Lineage. Our results indicate that Paratyphi C has been a pathogen of humans for at least 1,000 years, and may have evolved after zoonotic transfer from swine during the Neolithic period.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe combination of an 800-year-old Salmonella enterica Paratyphi C genome with genomes from extant bacteria reshapes our understanding of this pathogens origins and evolution.",

However, identifying regulatory changes that underlie human-specific traits has proven very challenging. Here, we use 63 DNA methylation maps of ancient and present-day humans, as well as of six chimpanzees, to detect differentially methylated regions that emerged in modern humans after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans. We show that genes affecting the face and vocal tract went through particularly extensive methylation changes. Specifically, we identify widespread hypermethylation in a network of face- and voice-affecting genes (SOX9, ACAN, COL2A1, NFIX and XYLT1). We propose that these repression patterns appeared after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans, and that they might have played a key role in shaping the modern human face and vocal tract.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Inbreeding results from the mating of related individuals and has negative consequence because it brings together deleterious variants in one individual. Inbreeding is associated with recessive diseases and reduced production or fitness. In general, inbreeding is estimated with respect to a base population that needs to be defined. Ancestors in generations anterior to the base population are considered unrelated. We herein propose a model that estimates inbreeding relative to multiple age-based classes. Each inbreeding distribution is associated to a different time in the past: recent inbreeding generating longer homozygous stretches than more ancient. Our model is a mixture of exponential distribution implemented in a hidden Markov model framework that uses marker allele frequencies, genetic distances, genotyping error rates and the sequences of observed genotypes. Based on simulations studies, we show that the inbreeding coefficients and the age of inbreeding are correctly estimated. Mean absolute errors of estimators are low, the efficiency depending on the available information. When several inbreeding classes are simulated, the model captures them if their ages are sufficiently different. Genotyping errors or low-fold sequencing data are easily accommodated in the hidden Markov model framework. Application to real data sets illustrate that the method can reveal recent different demographic histories among populations, some of them presenting very recent bottlenecks or founder effects. The method also clearly identifies individuals resulting from extreme consanguineous matings.",

Several genes have been linked or associated to the disease, many of which contribute to the development and function of brain areas that are important for auditory and phonological processing. Nonetheless, a clear link between genes, the brain, and the symptoms of dyslexia is still pending. The goal of this paper is contributing to bridge this gap. With this aim, we have focused on how the dyslexic brain fails to process speech sounds and reading cues. We have adopted an oscillatory perspective, according to which dyslexia results from a deficient integration of different brain rhythms during reading/spellings tasks. Moreover, we show that some candidates for this condition are related to brain rhythms. This approach should help gain a better understanding of the aetiology and the clinical presentation of developmental dyslexia, but also achieve an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Population demographic history may be learned from contemporary genetic variation data. Methods based on aggregating the statistics of many single loci into an allele frequency spectrum (AFS) have proven powerful, but such methods ignore potentially informative patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between neighboring loci. To leverage such patterns, we developed a composite-likelihood framework for inferring demographic history from aggregated statistics of pairs of loci. Using this framework, we show that two-locus statistics are indeed more sensitive to demographic history than single-locus statistics such as the AFS. In particular, two-locus statistics escape the notorious confounding of depth and duration of a bottleneck, and they provide a means to estimate effective population size based on the recombination rather than mutation rate. We applied our approach to a Zambian population of Drosophila melanogaster. Notably, using both single- and two-locus statistics, we found substantially lower estimates of effective population size than previous works. Together, our results demonstrate the broad potential for two-locus statistics to enable powerful population genetic inference.",

    "abstract": "Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a clonally propagated staple food crop in the tropics. Genomic selection (GS) reduces selection cycle times by the prediction of breeding value for selection of unevaluated lines based on genome-wide marker data. GS has been implemented at three breeding programs in sub-Saharan Africa. Initial studies provided promising estimates of predictive abilities in single populations using standard prediction models and scenarios. In the present study we expand on previous analyses by assessing the accuracy of seven prediction models for seven traits in three prediction scenarios: (1) cross-validation within each population, (2) cross-population prediction and (3) cross-generation prediction. We also evaluated the impact of increasing training population size by phenotyping progenies selected either at random or using a genetic algorithm. Cross-validation results were mostly consistent across breeding programs, with non-additive models like RKHS predicting an average of 10% more accurately. Accuracy was generally associated with heritability. Cross-population prediction accuracy was generally low (mean 0.18 across traits and models) but prediction of cassava mosaic disease severity increased up to 57% in one Nigerian population, when combining data from another related population. Accuracy across-generation was poorer than within (cross-validation) as expected, but indicated that accuracy should be sufficient for rapid-cycling GS on several traits. Selection of prediction model made some difference across generations, but increasing training population (TP) size was more important. In some cases, using a genetic algorithm, selecting one third of progeny could achieve accuracy equivalent to phenotyping all progeny. Based on the datasets analyzed in this study, it was apparent that the size of a training population (TP) has a significant impact on prediction accuracy for most traits. We are still in the early stages of GS in this crop, but results are promising, at least for some traits. The TPs need to continue to grow and quality phenotyping is more critical than ever. General guidelines for successful GS are emerging. Phenotyping can be done on fewer individuals, cleverly selected, making for trials that are more focused on the quality of the data collected.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Owing to the emergence and increase of multi drug resistance to various conventional drugs, and the continuing importance on health-care expenditure, many researchers have focused to develop novel and effective anticancer compounds. In the present study, a series of in-house synthesized quinazoline and quinazolino-benzothiadiazine derivatives were investigated for their anticancer efficacy against a panel of five cancer (DU145, MCF7, HepG2, SKOV3 and MDA-MB-231) and one normal (MRC5) cell lines. Among all the tested compounds, fifteen of them exhibited promising growth-inhibitory effect (0.15 - 5.0 M) and induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. In addition, the selected compounds inhibited the microtubule assembly; altered mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced the levels of caspase-9 in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the active compound with combination of drugs showed synergistic effect at lower concentrations and the drug uptake was mediated through clathrin mediated endocytic pathway. Our results indicated that quinazoline and quinazolino-benzothiadiazine conjugates could serve as potential leads in the development of personalized cancer therapeutics.\\n\\nSummaryThe present study describes the exploration of small molecules based on heterocyclic scaffolds for tubulin target based development of anticancer agents.",

    "abstract": "Mlh1-Mlh3 (MutL{gamma}) is a mismatch repair factor with a central role in formation of meiotic crossovers, presumably through resolution of double Holliday junctions. MutL{gamma} has DNA binding, nuclease, and ATPase activities, but how these relate to one another and to in vivo functions are unclear. Here, we combine biochemical and genetic analyses to characterize Saccharomyces cerevisiae MutL{gamma}. Limited proteolysis and atomic force microscopy showed that purified recombinant MutL{gamma} undergoes ATP-driven conformational changes. In vitro, MutL{gamma} displayed separable DNA-binding activities toward Holliday junctions (HJ) and, surprisingly, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which was not predicted from current models. MutL{gamma} bound DNA cooperatively, could bind multiple substrates simultaneously, and formed higher-order complexes. FeBABE hydroxyl radical footprinting indicated that the DNA-binding interfaces of MutL{gamma} for ssDNA and HJ substrates only partially overlap. Most contacts with HJ substrates were located in the linker regions of MutL{gamma}, whereas ssDNA contacts mapped within linker regions as well as the N-terminal ATPase domains. Using yeast genetic assays for mismatch repair and meiotic recombination, we found that mutations within different DNA-binding surfaces exert separable effects in vivo. For example, mutations within the Mlh1 linker conferred little or no meiotic phenotype but led to mismatch repair deficiency. Interestingly, mutations in the N-terminal domain of Mlh1 caused a stronger meiotic defect than mlh1{Delta}, suggesting that the mutant proteins retain an activity that interferes with alternative recombination pathways. Furthermore, mlh3{Delta} caused more chromosome missegregation than mlh1{Delta}, whereas mlh1{Delta} but not mlh3{Delta} partially alleviated meiotic defects of msh5{Delta} mutants. These findings illustrate functional differences between Mlh1 and Mlh3 during meiosis and suggest that their absence impinges on chromosome segregation not only via reduced formation of crossovers. Taken together, our results offer insights into the structure-function relationships of the MutL{gamma} complex and reveal unanticipated genetic relationships between components of the meiotic recombination machinery.\\n\\nAuthor summarySexual reproduction involves the fusion of two gametes that each contain half of the DNA from each parent. These gametes are generated through a specialized cellular division called meiosis. During meiosis, the cell faces the challenge of identifying the appropriate pairs of chromosomes that need to be separated. This involves an elaborate mechanism whereby the parental chromosomes recombine and form crossovers, i.e. exchange DNA fragments. These crossovers are thus important for the accurate segregation of chromosomes and are also fundamental to evolution because they help shuffle linkage groups from one generation to another. Here, we have studied a complex of proteins called MutL{gamma} that is important for the formation of crossovers, and is also involved in an unrelated mechanism that repairs mistakes that spontaneous arise in DNA when it is synthesized. We uncovered intriguing features of the interaction of this complex with DNA. In addition, by studying a collection of mutants of MutL{gamma}, we identified mutants that affect one biological function but not another. For example, surprisingly, we found mutations that decrease the frequency of crossovers but did not affect chromosome segregation as much as expected. Taken together, our findings allow us to reconsider the ways in which we think about these processes.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal responses in visual cortex show a diversity of complex temporal properties. These properties include sub-additive temporal summation, response reduction with repeated or sustained stimuli (adaptation), and slower dynamics at low stimulus contrast. Here, we hypothesize that these seemingly disparate effects can be explained by a single, shared computational mechanism. We propose a model consisting of a linear stage, followed by history-dependent gain control. The model accounts for these various temporal phenomena, tested against an unusually diverse set of measurements - intracranial electrodes in patients, fMRI, and macaque single unit spiking. The model further enables us to uncover a systematic and rich variety of temporal encoding strategies across visual cortex: First, temporal receptive field shape differs both across and within visual field maps. Second, later visual areas show more rapid and pronounced adaptation. Our study provides a new framework to understand the transformation between visual input and dynamical cortical responses.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe nervous system extracts meaning from the distribution of light over space and time. Spatial vision has been a highly successful research area, and the spatial receptive field has served as a fundamental and unifying concept that spans perception, computation, and physiology. While there has also been a large interest in temporal vision, the temporal domain has lagged the spatial domain in terms of quantitative models of how signals are transformed across the visual hierarchy. Here we present a model of temporal dynamics of neuronal responses in human cerebral cortex. We show that the model can accurately predict responses at the millisecond scale using intracortical electrodes in patient volunteers, and that the same model generalizes to multiple types of other measurements, including functional MRI and action potentials from monkey cortex. Further, we show that a single model can account for a variety of temporal phenomena, including short-term adaptation and slower dynamics at low stimulus contrast. By developing a computational model and showing that it successfully generalizes across measurement types, cortical areas, and stimuli, we provide new insights into how time-varying images are encoded and transformed into dynamic cortical responses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryMuscle is a calcium responsive tissue and requires calcium for initiation of muscle contraction. Calcium concentration in muscle is tightly regulated by calcium binding proteins. Calcineurin-B2 (canB2), a calcium binding, regulatory subunit of calcineurin, is the isoform maximally expressed in the indirect flight muscles (IFMs) of Drosophila. The developmental and functional roles of CanB2 particularly in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis are not understood. In this study, we show that the loss of canB2 causes hypercontraction of IFMs. Genetic interaction studies with hypercontraction mutants suggest a synergistic interaction between Calcineurin-B2 and structural protein Troponin-T. Similarly, interaction studies with dSERCA mutant reveal that Calcineurin-B2 is important for regulating calcium homeostasis in muscles. In vivo calcium imaging showed that Calcineurin-B2 deficiency leads to arrhythmicity in the calcium oscillations. We show that Calcineurin-B2 knockdown causes deregulation of calcium homeostasis, which results in unregulated acto-myosin interaction. However, overexpression of Calcineurin-A, which inhibits calcium oscillations, had no effect on myofibrillogenesis suggesting that calcium activation is dispensable for myofibrillar assembly. Our findings contribute to the understanding of muscle physiology in normal as well as pathophysiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (<http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100022>). Understanding Ebola Virus (EBOV) virulence evolution is not only timely but also raises specific questions because it causes one of the most virulent human infections and it is capable of transmission after the death of its host. Using a compartmental epidemiological model that captures three transmission routes (by regular contact, via dead bodies and by sexual contact), we infer the evolutionary dynamics of case fatality ratio (CFR) on the scale of an outbreak and on the long term. Our major finding is that the viruss specific life cycle imposes selection for high levels of virulence and that this pattern is robust to parameter variations in biological ranges. In addition to shedding a new light on the ultimate causes of EBOVs high virulence, these results generate testable predictions and contribute to informing public health policies. In particular, burial management stands out as the most appropriate intervention since it decreases the R0 of the epidemics, while imposing selection for less virulent strains.\\n\\nImpact SummaryThe severe haemorrhagic fever caused by Ebola Virus (EBOV) usually kills more than one infected individual out of two in the absence of treatment, which makes this pathogen one of the most virulent known to humans. The recent outbreak in West Africa (2013-2016) revealed that the virus is able to spread and persist for months across countries. It is often thought that virulence could be due to the fact that the virus is adapted to its reservoir host. Given that microbes evolve rapidly, it is important to determine whether EBOV virulence is likely to decrease as the virus adapts to its human host. To address this problem, we developed a novel mathematical model tailored to EBOVs life cycle, notably by capturing its three main transmission routes (by regular contact, sexual contact and via dead bodies). We investigated the evolutionary trends of EBOVs virulence on different time scales (outbreak initiation, short term and long term). Our results reveal that the virulence of EBOV might not be due to the maladaptation of the virus, but could rather originate from its unique life cycle. These results are robust to the parameter values chosen. From a public health perspective, burial management stands out as the main leverage to fight the virulence of EBOV, both on the short and long terms.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease has relied upon the use of amyloid peptides from a variety of sources, but most predominantly synthetic peptides produced using t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) or 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. These synthetic methods can lead to minor impurities which can have profound effects on the biological activity of amyloid peptides. Here we used a combination of cytotoxicity assays, fibrillation assays and high resolution mass spectrometry (MS) to identify impurities in synthetic amyloid preparations that inhibit both cytotoxicity and aggregation. We identify the A{beta}42{Delta}39 species as the major peptide contaminant responsible for limiting both cytotoxicity and fibrillation of the amyloid peptide. In addition, we demonstrate that the presence of this minor impurity inhibits the formation of a stable A{beta}42 dimer observable by MS in very pure peptide samples. These results highlight the critical importance of purity and provenance of amyloid peptides in Alzheimers research in particular, and biological research in general.",

    "abstract": "Detailed and realistic tree form generators have numerous applications in ecology and forestry. Here, we present an algorithm for generating morphological tree \\\"clones\\\" based on the detailed reconstruction of the laser scanning data, statistical measure of similarity, and a plant growth algorithm with simple stochastic rules. The algorithm is designed to produce tree forms, i.e. morphological clones, similar as a whole (coarse-grain scale), but varying in minute details of organization (fine-grain scale). We present a general procedure for obtaining these morphological clones. Although we opted for certain choices in our algorithm, its various parts may vary depending on the application. Namely, we have shown that specific multi-purpose procedural stochastic growth model can be algorithmically adjusted to produce the morphological clones replicated from the target experimentally measured tree. For this, we have developed a statistical measure of similarity (structural distance) between any given pair of trees, which allows for the comprehensive comparing of the tree morphologies in question by means of empirical distributions describing geometrical and topological features of a tree. Our algorithm can be used in variety of applications and contexts for exploration of the morphological potential of the growth models, arising in all sectors of plant science research.\\n\\nSummary StatementWe present an algorithmic framework, based on the Bayesian inference, for generating morphological tree clones using a combination of stochastic growth models and experimentally derived tree structures.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMotion correction is a challenging pre-processing problem that arises early in the analysis pipeline of calcium imaging data sequences. The motion artifacts in two-photon microscopy recordings can be non-rigid, arising from the finite time of raster scanning and non-uniform deformations of the brain medium.\\n\\nNew methodWe introduce an algorithm for fast Non-Rigid Motion Correction (NoRMCorre) based on template matching. NoRMCorre operates by splitting the field of view into overlapping spatial patches that are registered at a sub-pixel resolution for rigid translation against a continuously updated template. The estimated alignments are subsequently up-sampled to create a smooth motion field for each frame that can efficiently approximate non-rigid motion in a piecewise-rigid manner.\\n\\nExisting methodsExisting approaches either do not scale well in terms of computational performance or are targeted to motion artifacts arising from low speed scanning, whereas modern datasets with large field of view are more prone to non-rigid brain deformation issues.\\n\\nResultsNoRMCorre can be run in an online mode resulting in comparable to or even faster than real time motion registration on streaming data. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method with simple yet intuitive metrics and compare against other non-rigid registration methods on two-photon calcium imaging datasets. Open source Matlab and Python code is also made available.\\n\\nConclusionsThe proposed method and code provide valuable support to the community for solving large scale image registration problems in calcium imaging, especially when non-rigid deformations are present in the acquired data.",

    "abstract": "Mlh1-Mlh3 is an endonuclease hypothesized to act in meiosis to resolve double Holliday junctions into crossovers. It also plays a minor role in eukaryotic DNA mismatch repair (MMR). To understand how Mlh1-Mlh3 functions in both meiosis and MMR, we analyzed in bakers yeast 60 new mlh3 alleles. Five alleles specifically disrupted MMR, whereas one (mlh3-32) specifically disrupted meiotic crossing over. Mlh1-mlh3 representatives for each separation of function class were purified and characterized. Both Mlh1-mlh3-32 (MMR+, crossover-) and Mlh1-mlh3-45 (MMR-, crossover+) displayed wild-type endonuclease activities in vitro. Msh2-Msh3, an MSH complex that acts with Mlh1-Mlh3 in MMR, stimulated the endonuclease activity of Mlh1-mlh3-32 but not Mlh1-mlh3-45, suggesting that Mlh1-mlh3-45 is defective in MSH interactions. Whole genome recombination maps were constructed for two mlh3 mutants with opposite separation of function phenotypes, and an endonuclease defective mutant. Unexpectedly, all three showed increases in the number of non-crossover events that were not observed in mlh3{Delta}. Our observations provide a structure-function map for Mlh3 that reveals the importance of protein-protein interactions in regulating Mlh1-Mlh3s enzymatic activity. They also illustrate how defective meiotic components can alter the fate of meiotic recombination intermediates, providing new insights for how meiotic recombination pathways are regulated.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDuring meiosis, diploid germ cells that become eggs or sperm undergo a single round of DNA replication followed by two consecutive chromosomal divisions. The segregation of chromosomes at the first meiotic division is dependent in most organisms on at least one genetic exchange, or crossover event, between chromosome homologs. Homologs that do not receive a crossover frequently undergo non-disjunction at the first meiotic division, yielding gametes that lack chromosomes or contain additional copies. Such events have been linked to human disease and infertility. Recent studies suggest that the Mlh1-Mlh3 complex is an endonuclease that resolves recombination intermediates into crossovers. Interestingly, this complex also acts as a matchmaker in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) to remove DNA replication errors. How does one complex act in two different processes? We investigated this question by performing a mutational analysis of the bakers yeast Mlh3 protein. Five mutations were identified that disrupted MMR but not crossing over, and one mutation disrupted crossing over while maintaining MMR. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic analyses to further characterize these mutants we illustrate the importance of protein-protein interactions for Mlh1-Mlh3s activity. Importantly, we illustrate how defective meiotic components can alter the outcome of meiotic recombination events. They also provide new insights in our understanding of the basis of infertility syndromes.",

    "abstract": "An estimated quarter of a trillion US dollars is invested in the biomedical research enterprise annually. There is growing alarm that a significant portion of this investment is wasted, due to problems in reproducibility of research findings and in the rigor and integrity of research conduct and reporting. Recent years have seen a flurry of activities focusing on standardization and guideline development to enhance the reproducibility and rigor of biomedical research. Research activity is primarily communicated via textual artifacts, ranging from grant applications to journal publications. These artifacts can be both the source and the end result of practices leading to research waste. For example, an article may describe a poorly designed experiment, or the authors may reach conclusions not supported by the evidence presented. In this article, we pose the question of whether biomedical text mining techniques can assist the stakeholders in the biomedical research enterprise in doing their part towards enhancing research integrity and rigor. In particular, we identify four key areas in which text mining techniques can make a significant contribution: plagiarism/fraud detection, ensuring adherence to reporting guidelines, managing information overload, and accurate citation/enhanced bibliometrics. We review the existing methods and tools for specific tasks, if they exist, or discuss relevant research that can provide guidance for future work. With the exponential increase in biomedical research output and the ability of text mining approaches to perform automatic tasks at large scale, we propose that such approaches can add checks and balances that promote responsible research practices and can provide significant benefits for the biomedical research enterprise.\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary material is available at BioRxiv.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of the neutrophil elastase inhibitor sivelestat on gefitinib-induced pneumonitis in mice.\\n\\nMethodsC57BL/6J mice received naphthalene (200 mg/kg) intraperitoneally on day 0.

Divergent feedforward networks separate overlapping activity patterns by mapping them onto larger numbers of neurons, aiding learning in downstream circuits. However, the relationship between the synaptic connectivity within these circuits and their ability to separate patterns is poorly understood. To investigate this we built simplified and biologically detailed models of the cerebellar input layer and systematically varied the spatial correlation of their inputs and their synaptic connectivity. Performance was quantified by the learning speed of a classifier trained on either the mossy fiber input or granule cell output patterns. Our results establish that the extent of synaptic connectivity governs the pattern separation performance of feedforward networks by counteracting the beneficial effects of expanding coding space and threshold-mediated decorrelation. The sparse synaptic connectivity in the cerebellar input layer provides an optimal solution to this trade-off, enabling efficient pattern separation and faster learning.",

We focused on zoonotic bacterial communities depicted using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing approach in both invasive and native rodents sampled along two well-defined invasion routes. Overall, this study provided new ecological evidence connecting parasitism and rodent invasion process, with diverse potential roles of zoonotic bacteria in the invasion success.

    "abstract": "BackgroundSelection of the right reference gene(s) is crucial in the analysis and interpretation of gene expression data. In head and neck cancer, studies evaluating the efficacy of internal reference genes are rare. Here, we present data for a minimal set of candidates as internal control genes for gene expression studies in head and neck cancer.\\n\\nMethodsWe analyzed data from multiple sources (in house whole-genome gene expression microarrays, n=21; TCGA RNA-seq, n=42, and published gene expression studies in head and neck tumors from literature) to come up with a set of genes (discovery set) for their stable expression across tumor and normal tissues. We then performed independent validation of their expression using qPCR in 14 tumor:normal pairs. Genes in the discovery set were ranked using four different algorithms (BestKeeper, geNorm, NormFinder, and comparative delta Ct) and a web-based comparative tool, RefFinder, for their stability and variance in expression across tissues.\\n\\nResultsOur analyses resulted in 18 genes (discovery set) that had lowest variance and high level of expression across tumor and normal samples. Independent experimental validation and analyses with multiple tools resulted in top ranked five genes (RPL30, RPL27, PSMC5, OAZ1 and MTCH1) out of which, RPL30 (60S ribosomal protein L30) and RPL27 (60S ribosomal protein L27), performed best and were abundantly expressed across tumor and normal tissues.\\n\\nConclusionsRPL30 and RPL27 are stably expressed in HNSCC and should be used as internal control genes in gene expression in head and neck tumors studies.",

    "abstract": "The majority of human chromosome ends remain incompletely assembled due to their highly repetitive structure. In this study, we use BioNano data to anchor and extend chromosome ends from two European trios as well as two unrelated Asian genomes. BioNano assembled chromosome ends are structurally divergent from the reference genome, including both missing sequence (10%) and extensions(22%). These extensions are heritable and in some cases divergent between Asian and European samples. Six ninths of the extension sequence in NA12878 can be confirmed and filled by nanopore data. We identify two sequence families in these sequences which have undergone substantial duplication in multiple primate lineages. We show that these sequence families have arisen from progenitor interstitial sequence on the ancestral primate chromosome 7. Comparison of chromosome end sequences from 15 species revealed that chromosome end missing sequence matches the corresponding phylogenetic relationship and revealed a rate of chromosome extension per chromosome of 0.0020 bp per year in average.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary biomedical research is performed by increasingly large teams. As a consequence, an increasingly large number of individuals are being listed as authors in the byline of biomedical articles, which complicates the proper attribution of credit and responsibility to individual authors for their work. Typically, more importance is given to the first and last authors of biomedical papers, and the others (the middle authors) are considered to have made smaller contributions. However, we argue that this distinction between first, middle and last authors does not properly reflect the actual division of labor and does not allow a fair allocation of credit among the members of the research teams. In this paper, we use partial alphabetical authorship to divide the authors of all biomedical articles in the Web of Science published over the 1980-2015 period in three groups: primary authors, middle authors, and supervisory authors. We show that alphabetical ordering of middle authors is frequent in biomedical research, and that the prevalence of this practice is positively correlated with the number of authors in the bylines. We also find that, for articles with 7 or more authors, the average proportion of team members in each group is independent of the team size, more than half of the authors being middle authors. This suggests that growth in authors lists are not due to an increase in secondary contributions but, rather, in equivalent increases of all types of roles and contributions. Nevertheless, we show that the relative contribution of middle authors to the overall production of knowledge in the biomedical field as increased dramatically over the last 35 years.",

    "abstract": "In a recent past, Transposable Elements (TEs) were referred as selfish genetic components only capable of copying themselves with the aim to increase the odds that will be inherited. Nonetheless, TEs have been initially proposed as positive control elements acting in synergy with the host. Nowadays, it is well known that TE movement into genome host comprise an important evolutionary mechanism capable to produce diverse chromosome rearrangements and thus increase the adaptive fitness. According to as insights into TE functioning are increasing day to day, the manipulation of transposition has raised an interesting possibility to setting the host functions, although the lack of appropriate genome engineering tools has unpaved it. Fortunately, the emergence of genome editing technologies based on programmable nucleases, and especially the arrival of a multipurpose RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease system, has made it possible to reconsider this challenge. For such purpose, a particular type of transposons referred as Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Elements (MITEs) has demonstrated a series of interesting characteristics for designing functional drivers. Here, recent insights into MITE elements and versatile RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering system are given to outline an effective strategy that allows to deploy the TE potential for control of the host transcriptional activity.",

We apply our method to GTEx whole blood transcriptomes and GWAS cohorts for seven diseases from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium and find 45 TWAS genes, of which 17 do not overlap previously reported case-control GWAS or differential expression associations.

    "abstract": "Due to the complexity of genotype-phenotype relationships, simultaneous analyses of genomic associations with multiple traits will be more powerful and more informative than a series of univariate analyses. In most cases, however, studies of genotype-phenotype relationships have analyzed only one trait at a time, even as the rapid advances in molecular tools have expanded our view of the genotype to include whole genomes. Here, we report the results of a fully integrated multivariate genome-wide association analysis of the shape of the Drosophila melanogaster wing in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel. Genotypic effects on wing shape were highly correlated between two different labs. We found 2,396 significant SNPs using a 5% FDR cutoff in the multivariate analyses, but just 4 significant SNPs in univariate analyses of scores on the first 20 principal component axes. A key advantage of multivariate analysis is that the direction of the estimated phenotypic effect is much more informative than a univariate one. Exploiting this feature, we show that the directions of effects were on average replicable in an unrelated panel of inbred lines. Effects of knockdowns of genes implicated in the initial screen were on average more similar than expected under a null model. Association studies that take a phenomic approach in considering many traits simultaneously are an important complement to the power of genomics. Multivariate analyses of such data are more powerful, more informative, and allow the unbiased study of pleiotropy.",

Here we use [~]36 million singleton variants from 3,560 whole-genome sequences to infer fine-scale patterns of mutation rate heterogeneity. Mutability is jointly affected by adjacent nucleotide context and diverse genomic features of the surrounding region, including histone modifications, replication timing, and recombination rate, sometimes suggesting specific mutagenic mechanisms. Remarkably, GC content, DNase hypersensitivity, CpG islands, and H3K36 trimethylation are associated with both increased and decreased mutation rates depending on nucleotide context. We validate these estimated effects in an independent dataset of [~]46,000 de novo mutations, and confirm our estimates are more accurate than previously published estimates based on ancestrally older variants without considering genomic features. Our results thus provide the most refined portrait to date of the factors contributing to genome-wide variability of the human germline mutation rate.",

Ageing was associated with profound structural alterations of murine uterine arteries, including the occurrence of outward hypertrophic remodelling and increased stiffness. Endothelial and smooth muscle function were diminished in uterine (and tail) arteries from aged mice and post-menopausal women. The acute vasodilatory effects of 17{beta}-oestradiol (non-specific oestrogen receptor (ER) agonist), PPT (ER-specific agonist) and DPN (ER{beta}-specific agonist) on resistance arteries were attenuated by ageing and the menopause. However, the impairment of oestrogenic relaxation was evident after the occurrence of age-related endothelial dysfunction and diminished distensibility. The data indicate, therefore, that adverse resistance arterial ageing is a dominant factor leading to weakened vasodilatory action of oestrogenic compounds.",

    "abstract": "What causes individuals to produce quantitatively different phenotypes? While substantial research has focused on the allelic changes that affect phenotype, we know less about how gene expression accompanies variable phenotypes. Here, we investigate the transcriptional basis of variation in parental provisioning using two species of burying beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis and Nicrophorus vespilloides. Specifically, we used RNA-seq to compare the transcriptomes of parents that provided high amounts of provisioning behavior versus low amounts in males and females of each species. We found that there were no overarching transcriptional patterns that distinguish high from low caring parents, and no informative transcripts that displayed particularly large expression differences in females or males. However, we did find more subtle gene expression changes between high and low provisioning parents that are consistent across sexes as well as between the two species. Furthermore, we show that transcripts previously implicated in transitioning into parental care in N. vespilloides had high variance in the levels of transcription and were unusually likely to display differential expression between high and low provisioning parents. Thus, quantitative behavioral variation appears to reflect many transcriptional differences of small effect. We show that nuanced regulation of the same gene products that are required for the transition of one behavioral state to another are also those influencing variation within a behavioral state.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBurying beetles in the genus Nicrophorus breed on vertebrate carcasses and provide advanced parental care to their offspring by regurgitating partially digested flesh. However, all adult beetles do not uniformly express this trait. Some provide a large amount of parenting to their offspring, and some only a little. Here, we investigate the genetic causes of why some Nicrophorus beetles feed their offspring more than others. We demonstrate that this difference is likely caused by many small changes in gene expression, rather than a few genes that have major effects. We also find that some of the same genes that help to turn on parental care behavior in burying beetles also seem to play a role in determining how much care a beetle gives. These results provide new angles on longstanding questions about the complexity of the mechanisms that underlie quantitative variation in populations.",

It consists of a cytoplasmic bacteriophage tail-like structure anchored in the bacterial cell envelope via a cytoplasmic baseplate and a periplasmic membrane complex. Rapid contraction of the sheath in the bacteriophage tail-like structure propels an inner tube/spike complex through the target cell envelope to deliver effectors. While structures of purified contracted sheath and purified membrane complex have been solved, because sheaths contract upon cell lysis and purification, no structure is available for the extended sheath. Structural information about the baseplate is also lacking. Here we use electron cryotomography to directly visualize intact T6SS structures inside Myxococcus xanthus cells. Using sub-tomogram averaging, we resolve the structure of the extended sheath and membrane-associated components including the baseplate. Moreover, we identify novel extracellular bacteriophage tail fiber-like antennae. These results provide new structural insights into how the extended sheath prevents premature disassembly and how this sophisticated machine may recognize targets.",

    "abstract": "Phenomics, which ideally involves in-depth phenotyping at the whole-organism scale, may enhance our functional understanding of genetic variation. Here, we demonstrate methods to profile hundreds of measures comprised of morphological and densitometric traits from a large number sites in the axial skeleton of adult zebrafish. We show the potential for vertebral patterns to confer heightened sensitivity, with similar specificity, in discriminating mutant populations compared to analyzing individual vertebrae in isolation. We identify phenotypes associated with human brittle bone disease and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor hyperactivity. Finally, we develop allometric models and show their potential to aid in the discrimination of mutant phenotypes masked by alterations in growth. Our studies demonstrate virtues of deep phenotyping in a spatially distributed organ. Analyzing phenotypic patterns may increase productivity in genetic screens, and could facilitate the study of genetic variants associated with smaller effect sizes, such as those that underlie complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cycling cells duplicate their DNA content during S phase, following a defined program called replication timing (RT). Early and late replicating regions differ in terms of mutation rates, transcriptional activity, chromatin marks and sub-nuclear position. Moreover, RT is regulated during development and is altered in disease. Exploring mechanisms linking RT to other cellular processes in normal and diseased cells will be facilitated by rapid and robust methods with which to measure RT genome wide. Here, we describe a protocol to analyse genome-wide RT by next-generation sequencing (NGS). This protocol yields highly reproducible results across laboratories and platforms. We also provide the computational pipelines for analysis, parsing phased genomes using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for analyzing imprinted RT, and for direct comparison to Repli-chip data obtained by analyzing nascent DNA by microarrays.",

    "abstract": "The racial composition of treatment centers in the SPRINT trial is an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Independent of individual race or ethnicity, patients face a 39% increase in relative risk of MI or stroke when associated to treatment centers with a high proportion of African Americans. The magnitude of this effect is comparable to smoking. This suggests the strong influence of social determinants on health outcomes among hypertensive patients.",
