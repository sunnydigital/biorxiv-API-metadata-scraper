    "abstract": "The growth factor and cytokine regulated transcription factor STAT3 is required for the self-renewal of several stem cell types including tumor stem cells from glioblastoma. Here we show that STAT3 inhibition leads to the upregulation of the histone H3K27me2/3 demethylase Jmjd3 (KDM6B), which can reverse polycomb complex-mediated repression of tissue specific genes. STAT3 binds to the Jmjd3 promoter, suggesting that Jmjd3 is a direct target of STAT3. Overexpression of Jmjd3 slows glioblastoma stem cell growth and neurosphere formation, whereas knockdown of Jmjd3 rescues the STAT3 inhibitor-induced neurosphere formation defect. Consistent with this observation, STAT3 inhibition leads to histone H3K27 demethylation of neural differentiation genes, such as Myt1, FGF21, and GDF15. These results demonstrate that the regulation of Jmjd3 by STAT3 maintains repression of differentiation specific genes and is therefore important for the maintenance of self-renewal of normal neural and glioblastoma stem cells.",

    "abstract": "The functions of human brains highly depend on the precise temporal regulation of gene expression, and substantial transcriptome changes across lifespan have been observed. While cell type composition is known to be temporally variable in brains, it remains unclear whether it is the primary cause of age-related transcriptome changes. Here, taking advantage of published human brain single-cell RNA-seq data, we applied a two-step transcriptome deconvolution procedure to the public age series RNA-seq data to quantify the contribution of cell type composition in shaping the temporal transcriptome in human brains. We estimated that composition change contributed to around 25% of the total variance and was the primary factor of age-related transcriptome changes. On the other hand, genes with substantial composition-independent temporal expression changes were also observed, which had diverged expression properties, functions and regulators as genes with temporal expression changes related to composition. This indicates a second independent mechanism shaping the human brains temporal transcriptome properties, which is important for human brain functions.",

    "abstract": "Factor V Leiden (F5L) is a common genetic risk factor for venous thromboembolism in humans. We conducted a sensitized ENU mutagenesis screen for dominant thrombosuppressor genes based on perinatal lethal thrombosis in mice homozygous for F5L (F5L/L) and haploinsufficient for tissue factor pathway inhibitor (Tfpi+/-). F8 deficiency enhanced survival of F5L/L Tfpi+/- mice, demonstrating that F5L/L Tfpi+/- lethality is genetically suppressible. ENU-mutagenized F5L/L males and F5L/+ Tfpi+/- females were crossed to generate 6,729 progeny, with 98 F5L/L Tfpi+/- offspring surviving until weaning. Sixteen lines exhibited transmission of a putative thrombosuppressor to subsequent generations, with these lines referred to as MF5L (Modifier of Factor 5 Leiden) 1-16. Linkage analysis in MF5L6 identified a chromosome 3 locus containing the tissue factor gene (F3). Though no ENU-induced F3 mutation was identified, haploinsufficiency for F3 (F3+/-) suppressed F5L/L Tfpi+/- lethality. Whole exome sequencing in MF5L12 identified an Actr2 gene point mutation (p.R258G) as the sole candidate. Inheritance of this variant is associated with suppression of F5L/L Tfpi+/- lethality (p=1.7x10-6), suggesting that Actr2p.R258G is thrombosuppressive. CRISPR/Cas9 experiments to generate an independent Actr2 knockin/knockout demonstrated that Actr2 haploinsufficiency is lethal, supporting a hypomorphic or gain of function mechanism of action for Actr2p.R258G. Our findings identify F8 and the Tfpi/F3 axis as key regulators in determining thrombosis balance in the setting of F5L and also suggest a novel role for Actr2 in this process.\\n\\nSignificance StatementVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disease characterized by the formation of inappropriate blood clots. Inheritance of specific genetic variants, such as the Factor V Leiden polymorphism, increases VTE susceptibility. However, only ~10% of people inheriting Factor V Leiden develop VTE, suggesting the involvement of other genes that are currently unknown. By inducing random genetic mutations into mice with a genetic predisposition to VTE, we identified two genomic regions that reduce VTE susceptibility. The first includes the gene for blood coagulation Factor 3 and its role was confirmed by analyzing mice with an independent mutation in this gene. The second contains a mutation in the Actr2 gene. These findings identify critical genes for the regulation of blood clotting risk.",

    "abstract": "Recently, multiple focused efforts have resulted in substantial increase in the availability of connectome data in the fruit fly brain. Elucidating neural circuit function from such structural data calls for a scalable computational modeling methodology. We propose such a methodology that includes i) a brain emulation engine, with an architecture that can tackle the complexity of whole brain modeling, ii) a database that supports tight integration of biological and modeling data along with support for domain specific queries and circuit transformations, and iii) a graphical interface that allows for total flexibility in configuring neural circuits and visualizing run-time results, both anchored on model abstractions closely reflecting biological structure. Towards the realization of such a methodology, we have developed NeuroGFX and integrated it into the architecture of the Fruit Fly Brain Observatory (http://fruitflybrain.org). The computational infrastructure in NeuroGFX is provided by Neurokernel, an open source platform for the emulation of the fruit fly brain, and NeuroArch, a database for querying and executing fruit fly brain circuits. The integration of the two enables the algorithmic construction/manipulation/revision of executable circuits on multiple levels of abstraction of the same model organism. The power of this computational infrastructure can be leveraged through an intuitive graphical interface that allows visualizing execution results in the context of biological structure. This provides an environment where computational researchers can present configurable, executable neural circuits, and experimental scientists can easily explore circuit structure and function ultimately leading to biological validation. With these capabilities, NeuroGFX enables the exploration of function from circuit structure at whole brain, neuropil, and local circuit level of abstraction. By allowing for independently developed models to be integrated at the architectural level, NeuroGFX provides an open plug and play, collaborative environment for whole brain computational modeling of the fruit fly.",

    "abstract": "The nitrogen (N) cycle represents one of the most well studied systems yet the taxonomic diversity of the organisms that contribute to it is mostly unknown, or linked to poorly characterized microbial groups. While progress has allowed functional groups to be refined, they still rely on a priori knowledge of enzymes involved, and the assumption of functional conservation, with little connection to the role the transformation plays for specific organisms. Here, we use soil microcosms to test the impact of N deposition on prokaryotic communities. By combining chemical, genomic and transcriptomic analysis we are able to identify and link changes in community structure to specific organisms catalyzing given chemical reactions. Urea deposition led to a decrease in prokaryotic richness, and a shift in community composition. This was driven by replacement of stable native populations, which utilize energy from N-linked redox reactions for physiological maintenance, with fast responding populations that use this energy for growth. This model can be used to predict response to N disturbances and allows us to identify putative life strategies of different functional, and taxonomic, groups thus providing insights into how they persist in ecosystems by niche differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Half a century ago, Donald Hebb posited that mental imagery is a constructive process that emulates perception. Specifically, Hebb claimed that visual imagery results from the reactivation of neural activity associated with viewing images. He also argued that neural reactivation and imagery benefit from the re-enactment of eye movement patterns that first occurred at viewing (fixation reinstatement). To investigate these claims, we applied multivariate pattern analyses to functional MRI (fMRI) and eye-tracking data collected while healthy human participants repeatedly viewed and visualized complex images. We observed that the specificity of neural reactivation correlated positively with vivid imagery and with memory for stimulus image details. Moreover, neural reactivation correlated positively with fixation reinstatement, meaning that image-specific eye movements accompanied image-specific patterns of brain activity during visualization. These findings support the conception of mental imagery as a simulation of perception, and provide evidence of the supportive role of eye-movement in neural reactivation.",

    "abstract": "The sea contains various microbes which have an ability to reduce and oxidize substances like iron, sulphur, and nitrate. Most of these processes happen in the seawater, but can also be applied for puri[fi]cation of wastewater. In the present work, a consortium of seawater bacteria has been used for the first time in a microbial fuel cell to reduce nitrate in synthetic water samples and produce electricity by oxidizing organic matter. The concentrations of [Formula] and [Formula] were reduced to well below their permissible limits. Moreover, the growth of the bacterial consortium at cathode causes an increased electricity production in the cell because of the increased bacterial activity. The performance of the cell with a bicarbonate buffered solution (BBS) at the cathode was superior to that obtained with the commonly used phosphate buffered solution (PBS). As BBS is the natural buffering agent found in the sea, the use of BBS is eco-friendly. The same seawater bacterial consortium could be used at both the anode and the cathode, confirming their adaptability to different environments. Unfortunately, denitrification was accompanied by the generation of high concentrations of [Formula] at the anode and the cathode, probably because of the use of N2 gas for sparging the anolyte. This aspect merits further investigation.",

This debate is especially pertinent to microbial communities, which play crucial roles in biogeochemical cycling3,4, food production5, industrial processes6,7, and human health and disease8. Here we created a synthetic microbial community using heritable genetic barcodes and tracked community composition over time across a range of experimental conditions. We show that a transition exists between the neutral and niche regimes, and, consistent with theory, the crossover point depends on factors including immigration, fitness, and population size. We find that diversity declined most rapidly at intermediate population sizes, which can be explained by a tradeoff between replacement by migration and duration of growth. We then ran an experiment where the community underwent abrupt or gradual changes in size, the outcome of which highlights that selecting the correct model is essential to managing diversity. Taken together these results emphasize the importance of including niche effects to obtain realistic models across a wide range of parameters, even in simple systems.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that neural activity fluctuates spontaneously between different states of global synchronization over a timescale of several seconds. Such fluctuations generate transient states of high and low correlation across distributed cortical areas. It has been hypothesized that such fluctuations in global efficiency might alter patterns of activity in local neuronal populations elicited by changes in incoming sensory stimuli. To test this prediction, we used a linear decoder to discriminate patterns of neural activity elicited by face and motion stimuli presented periodically while participants underwent time-resolved fMRI. As predicted, decoding was reliably higher during states of high global efficiency than during states of low efficiency, and this difference was evident across both visual and non-visual cortical regions. The results indicate that slow fluctuations in global network efficiency are associated with variations in the pattern of activity across widespread cortical regions responsible for representing distinct categories of visual stimulus. More broadly, the findings highlight the importance of understanding the impact of global fluctuations in functional connectivity on specialised, stimulus driven neural processes.",

The disorder has been assigned by linkage to two loci, MCDR1 on chromosome 6q16 and MCDR3 on chromosome 5p15-p13. Recently, noncoding variants upstream of PRDM13 and a large duplication including IRX1 have been identified. However, the underlying disease-causing mechanism remains uncertain. Through a combination of sequencing studies, we report two novel overlapping duplications at the MCDR3 locus, in a gene desert downstream of IRX1 and upstream of ADAMTS16. One duplication of 43 kb was identified in nine NCMD families (with evidence for a shared ancestral haplotype), and another one of 45 kb was found in a single family. The MCDR3 locus is thus refined to a shared region of 39 kb that contains DNAse hypersensitive sites active at a restricted time window during retinal development. Publicly available data confirmed expression of IRX1 and ADAMTS16 in human fetal retina, with IRX1 preferentially expressed in fetal macula. These findings represent a major advance in our understanding of the molecular genetics of NCMD at the MCDR3 locus and provide insights into the genetic pathways involved in human macular development.\\n\\nAbbreviations list",

We studied the behavior of RADAR in a non-inferiority trial in which a beta-lactam monotherapy strategy (BL, n=656) was non-inferior to fluoroquinolone monotherapy (FQL, n=888) for moderately-severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients.\\n\\nMETHODSPatients were ranked according to clinical outcome, using five or eight categories, and antibiotic use. RADAR was calculated as the probability that the BL group had a more favorable ranking than the FQL group. To investigate the sensitivity of RADAR to detrimental clinical outcome we simulated increasing rates of 90-day mortality in the BL group and performed the RADAR and non-inferiority analysis.\\n\\nRESULTSThe RADAR of the BL-group compared to the FQL group was 60.3% (95% confidence interval 57.9%-62.7%) using five and 58.4% (95% CI 56.0%-60.9%) using eight clinical outcome categories, all in favor of BL. Sample sizes for RADAR were 250 and 580 patients per study arm using five or eight clinical outcome categories, respectively, reflecting 38% and 89% of the original non-inferiority sample size calculation. With simulated mortality rates, loss of non-inferiority of the BL-group occurred at a relative risk of 1.125 in the conventional analysis, whereas using RADAR the BL-group lost superiority at a relative risk of mortality of 1.25 and 1.5, with eight and five clinical outcome categories, respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSRADAR favored BL over FQL therapy for CAP.
