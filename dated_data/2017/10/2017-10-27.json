    "abstract": "BackgroundCavefish populations belonging to the Mexican tetra species Astyanax mexicanus are outstanding models to study the tempo and mode of adaptation to a radical environmental change. They share similar phenotypic changes such as blindness and depigmentation resulting from independent and convergent evolution. As such they allow examining whether their evolution involved the fixation of preexisting standing genetic variations and/or de novo mutations. Cavefish populations are currently assigned to two main groups, the so-called \\\"old\\\" and \\\"new\\\" lineages, which would have populated several caves independently and at different times. However, we do not have yet accurate estimations of the time frames of evolution of these populations.\\n\\nResultsFirst, we reanalyzed the geographic distribution of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA polymorphisms and we found that these data do not support the existence of two cavefish lineages, neither the ancient origin of the \\\"old\\\" lineage. Using IMa2, a program based on a method that does not assume that populations are at mutation/migration/drift equilibrium and thus allows dating population divergence in addition to demographic parameters, we found that microsatellite polymorphism strongly supports a very recent origin of cave populations (i.e. less than 20,000 years). Second, we identified a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcript sequences of pools of embryos (Pool-seq) belonging to the \\\"old\\\" Pachon cave population and a surface population from Texas. Pachon cave population has accumulated more neutral substitutions than the surface population and we showed that it could be another signature of its recent origin. Based on summary statistics that can be computed with this SNP data set together with simulations of evolution of SNP polymorphisms in two recently isolated populations, we looked for sets of demographic parameters that allow the computation of summary statistics with simulated populations that are similar to the ones with the sampled populations. In most simulations for which we could find a good fit between the summary statistics of observed and simulated data, the best fit occurred when the divergence between simulated populations was less than 30,000 years.\\n\\nConclusionsAlthough it is often assumed that some cave populations such as Pachon cavefish have a very ancient origin, within the range of the late Miocene to the middle Pleistocene, a recent origin of these populations is strongly supported by our analyses of two independent sets of nuclear DNA polymorphism using two very different methods of analysis. Moreover, the observation of two divergent haplogroups of mitochondrial and nuclear genes with different geographic distributions support a recent admixture of two divergent surface populations before the isolation of cave populations. If cave populations are indeed only several thousand years old, many phenotypic changes observed in cavefish would thus have mainly involved the fixation of genetic variants present in surface fish populations and within a very short period of time.",

    "abstract": "Interacting with others to decide how finite resources should be allocated between parties which may have competing interests is an important part of social life. Considering that not all of our proposals to others are always accepted, the outcomes of such social interactions are, by their nature, probabilistic and risky. Here, we highlight cognitive processes related to value computations in human social interactions, based on mathematical modelling of the proposer behavior in the Ultimatum Game. Our results suggest that the perception of risk is an overarching process across non-social and social decision-making, whereas nonlinear weighting of others acceptance probabilities is unique to social interactions in which others valuation processes needs to be inferred. Despite the complexity of social decision-making, human participants make near-optimal decisions by dynamically adjusting their decision parameters to the changing social value orientation of their opponents through influence by multidimensional inferences they make about those opponents (e.g. how prosocial they think their opponent is relative to themselves).",

    "abstract": "The development of angiosperm flowers is regulated by homeotic MIKC-type MADS-domain transcription factors that activate or repress target genes via the formation of DNA-bound, organ specific tetrameric complexes. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) capabilities differ considerably between different MIKC-type proteins. The floral homeotic protein SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) acts as a hub that incorporates numerous other MADS-domain proteins into tetrameric complexes that would otherwise not form. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these promiscuous interactions remain largely unknown. In this study we created a collection of amino acid substitution mutants of SEP3 to quantify the contribution of individual residues on protein tetramerization during DNA-binding, employing methods of molecular biophysics. We show that leucine residues at certain key positions form a leucine zipper structure that is essential for tetramerization of SEP3, whereas the introduction of physicochemically very similar residues at respective sites impedes the formation of DNA-bound tetramers. Comprehensive molecular evolutionary analyses of MADS-domain proteins from a diverse set of flowering plants revealed exceedingly high conservation of the identified leucine residues within SEP3-subfamily proteins throughout angiosperm evolution. In contrast, MADS-domain proteins that are unable to tetramerize among themselves exhibit preferences for other amino acids at homologous sites. Our findings indicate that the subfamily-specific conservation of amino acid residues at just a few key positions account for subfamily-specific interaction capabilities of MADS-domain transcription factors and shaped the present-day structure of the PPI network controlling flower development.",

    "abstract": "Social animals detect the affective states of others and utilize this information to orchestrate appropriate social interactions. Social affective behaviors include cooperation, reproductive acts and avoiding sick individuals. In a social affective behavioral test in which experimental adult male rats were given the choice to interact with either naive or stressed conspecifics, the experimental rats demonstrated both approach and avoidant behaviors towards the conspecific, depending upon the age of the conspecific; experimental adult rats approached the stressed juvenile but avoided the stressed adult. Optogenetic inhibition of the insular cortex, a region anatomically positioned to contribute to social cognition, disrupted these behaviors. Receptors for the social nonapeptide oxytocin (OT) are found in high density within the insular cortex and here oxytocin increased intrinsic excitability and synaptic efficacy in acute insular cortex slices. Blockade of oxytocin receptors (OTRs) in the insula eliminated the effect of conspecific stress on approach behavior, while insular administration of OT recapitulated the behaviors typically observed in response to stressed conspecifics. Network analysis using Fos immunoreactivity identified functional connectivity between the insular cortex and the network of regions involved in social decision making. These results implicate insular cortex as a novel target of OT and suggest that insula is a key component in the circuit underlying age-dependent social responses to stressed conspecifics.",

    "abstract": "When marked for degradation, surface receptor and transporter proteins are internalized and delivered to endosomes where they are packaged into intralumenal vesicles (ILVs). Many rounds of ILV formation create multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that fuse with lysosomes exposing ILVs to hydrolases for catabolism. Despite being critical for protein degradation, the molecular underpinnings of MVB-lysosome fusion remain unclear, although machinery underlying other lysosome fusion events is implicated. But how then is specificity conferred? And how is MVB maturation and fusion coordinated for efficient protein degradation? To address these questions, we developed a cell-free MVB-lysosome fusion assay using S. cerevisiae as a model. After confirming that the Rab7 ortholog Ypt7 and the multisubunit tethering complex HOPS are required, we found that the Qa-SNARE Pep12 distinguishes this event from homotypic lysosome fusion. Mutations that impair MVB maturation block fusion by preventing Ypt7 activation, confirming that a Rab-cascade mechanism harmonizes MVB maturation with lysosome fusion.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTEndocytosis culminates with multivesicular bodies (MVBs) fusing with lysosomes. But the molecular underpinnings of this event remain unclear. Here, using S. cerevisiae as a model, Karim et al. employ a new in vitro assay to show that MVB-lysosome fusion is driven by ESCRT-dependent Rab-GTPase activation and the syntaxin ortholog Pep12, distinguishing it from other lysosome membrane fusion events.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia (Alphaproteobacteria, Rickettsiales) is the most common, and arguably one of the most important inherited symbionts. Molecular differentiation of Wolbachia strains is routinely performed with a set of five multilocus sequence typing (MLST) markers. However, since its inception in 2006, the performance of MLST in Wolbachia strain typing has not been assessed objectively. Here, we evaluate the properties of Wolbachia MLST markers and compare it to 252 other single copy loci present in the genome of most Wolbachia strains. Specifically, we investigated how well MLST performs at strain differentiation, at reflecting genetic diversity of strains, and as phylogenetic marker. We find that MLST loci are outperformed by other loci at all tasks they are currently employed for, and thus that they do not reflect the properties of a Wolbachia strain very well. We argue that whole genome typing approaches should be used for Wolbachia typing in the future. Alternatively, if few-loci-approaches are necessary, we provide a characterization of 252 single copy loci for a number a criteria, which may assist in designing specific typing systems or phylogenetic studies.",

    "abstract": "Working memory requires information about external stimuli to be represented in the brain even after those stimuli go away. This information is encoded in the activities of neurons, and neural activities change over timescales of tens of milliseconds. Information in working memory, however, is retained for tens of seconds, suggesting the question of how time-varying neural activities maintain stable representations. Prior work shows that, if the neural dynamics are in the  null space of the representation - so that changes to neural activity do not affect the downstream read-out of stimulus information - then information can be retained for periods much longer than the time-scale of individual-neuronal activities. The prior work, however, requires precisely constructed synaptic connectivity matrices, without explaining how this would arise in a biological neural network. To identify mechanisms through which biological networks can self-organize to learn memory function, we derived biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rules that dynamically modify the connectivity matrix to enable information storing. Networks implementing this plasticity rule can successfully learn to form memory representations even if only 10% of the synapses are plastic, they are robust to synaptic noise, and they can represent information about multiple stimuli.",

The evolution of within-host malaria virulence has been the focus of many empirical and theoretical studies. However, the vectors contribution to virulence evolution is not well understood. Here we explored how within-vector resource exploitation impacts evolutionary trajectories of within-host Plasmodium virulence. We developed a nested model of within-vector dynamics and malaria epidemiology, which predicted that non-competitive resource exploitation within-vector restricts within-host parasite virulence. To validate our model, we experimentally manipulated mosquito lipid trafficking and gauged within-vector parasite development, within-host infectivity and virulence. We found that mosquito-derived lipids determine within-host parasite virulence by shaping development and metabolic activity of transmissible sporozoites. Our findings uncover the role of within-vector environment in regulating within-host Plasmodium virulence and identify Plasmodium metabolic traits that may contribute to the evolution of malaria virulence.",

    "abstract": "With ongoing global change, life is continuously forced to move to novel areas, which leads to dynamically changing species ranges. As dispersal is central to range dynamics, factors promoting fast and distant dispersal are key to understanding and predicting species ranges. During range expansions, genetic variation is depleted at the expanding front. Such conditions should reduce evolutionary potential, while increasing kin competition. Organisms able to recognise relatives may be able to assess increased levels of relatedness at expanding range margins and to increase their dispersal in a plastic manner. Using individual-based simulations and experimental range expansions of a spider mite, we demonstrate that plastic responses to kin structure can be at least as important as evolution in driving range expansion speed. Because recognition of kin or kind is increasingly documented across the tree of life, we anticipate it to be a highly important but neglected driver of range expansions.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms initiating a branching process that can lead to new species are broadly classified as chromosomal and genic. Chromosomal mechanisms are supported by breeding studies involving exchanges of individual chromosomes or their segments between mouse subspecies. There are also studies of the rapidly mutating mouse PR/SET-domain 9 (prdm9) gene, which encodes PRDM9, a protein targeting DNA recombination hotspots. When PRDM9 is bound symmetrically with equal strength, the meiotic repair of mutations in one parental strand, based on information on the allelic strand (conversion), would seem to be unbiased in discriminating between strands. So mismatches detected between pairing paternal and maternal DNA strands (heteroduplexes) undergo unbiased conversions (to homoduplexes). This leaves uncertainty on whether a mutation has been corrected or compounded. However, it has been hypothesized that tagging of mismatch regions, so that both strands are epigenetically marked as uncertain, would make it possible over numerous generations for mutations to be corrected (biased conversions) whenever asymmetry is detected. Thus, variation would decrease and members of a species would remain within its bounds. Intriguingly, new experimental studies show that, when chromosomally interpreted, PRDM9 also works through asymmetrical epigenetic labelling to confine members to species bounds. To the extent that the experimentally observed and hypothetical anti-speciation asymmetries can be related, chromosomal mechanisms are further supported.",

When choosing between two options, we often feel conflicted, especially when trading off costs and benefits occurring at different times (e.g., saving for later versus spending now). Although previous work has investigated the neurophysiological basis of conflict during inhibitory control tasks, less is known about subjective conflict resulting from competing subjective preferences. In this pre-registered study, we investigated subjective conflict during intertemporal choice, whereby participants chose between smaller immediate versus larger delayed rewards (e.g., $15 today vs. $22 in 30 days). We used economic modeling to parametrically vary eleven different levels of conflict, and recorded EEG data and pupil dilation. Midfrontal theta power, derived from EEG, correlated with pupil responses, and our results suggest that these signals track different gradations of subjective conflict. Unexpectedly, both signals were also maximally enhanced when decisions were surprisingly easy. Therefore, these signals may track events requiring increased attention and adaptive shifts in behavioral responses, with subjective conflict being only one type of such event. Our results suggest that the neural systems underlying midfrontal theta and pupil responses interact when weighing costs and benefits during intertemporal choice. Thus, understanding these interactions might elucidate how individuals resolve self-control conflicts.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIModeled conflict during intertemporal choice and measured EEG and pupil responses.\\nC_LIO_LIMidfrontal theta and pupil responses parametrically tracked subjective conflict.\\nC_LIO_LIBut theta and pupil responses were also large when decisions were surprisingly easy.\\nC_LIO_LIThese signals may implement adaptive control during value-guided choice.\\nC_LI",

The recent rapid spread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health emergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted mainly by the mosquito Aedes aegypti that also vectors dengue virus, however little is known about the interactions of the virus with the mosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of whole Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in response to ZIKV infection at 2, 7, and 14 days post-infection using RNA-Seq. Results showed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at each time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly changed among the three time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that most of the altered genes are involved in metabolic process, cellular process and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic non-coding RNAs were identified that were altered upon ZIKV infection. Further, we found correlational changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes with that of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic understanding of Ae. aegypti responses to ZIKV and helps to determine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host anti-viral response against the virus.\\n\\nImportanceVector-borne viruses pose great risks on human health. Zika virus has recently emerged as a global threat, rapidly expanding its distribution. Understanding the interactions of the virus with mosquito vectors at the molecular level is vital for devising new approaches in inhibiting virus transmission. In this study, we embarked on analyzing the transcriptional response of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to Zika virus infection. Results showed large changes both in coding and long non-coding RNAs. Analysis of these genes showed similarities with other flaviviruses, including dengue virus, which is transmitted by the same mosquito vector. The outcomes provide a global picture of changes in the mosquito vector in response to Zika virus infection.",

Continuous maximum tolerated dose schedules reduce the sensitive cell population, initially shrinking tumor volume, but subsequently \\\"release\\\" the resistant cells to re-populate and re-grow the tumor in a resistant form. Importantly, a model fit of prostate data shows the emergence of a positive fitness cost associated with a majority of patients for each drug, without predetermining a cost in the model a priori. While the specific mechanism associated with this cost may be very different for each of the drugs, a measurable fitness cost emerges in each. The evolutionary model allows us to quantify responses to conventional therapeutic strategies as well as to design adaptive strategies.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesHematological abnormalities that include changes in bone marrow, such as in anemia and pancytopenia, are common among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, particularly in the advanced stage of disease. This study aimed to provide better experimental evidence of such manifestations in animal models.\\n\\nDesignNOD/SCID/JAK3null (NOJ) mice were transplanted with human cord-derived CD34+ cells with or without transduction with a lentiviral vector expressing a promoter-targeting shRNA called PromA.\\n\\nMethodsAt 16 weeks after transplantation, mice engrafted with CD34+ cells were infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1JRFL.\\n\\nResultsAt week 2 post infection, HIV replication was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and splenocytes. In mice transplanted with unmanipulated CD34+ cells, viral replication was accompanied by a loss of peripheral/spleen CD4+CCR5+ T cells. Interestingly, bone marrow CD34+ cells in HIV-infected mice were also depleted, but in a CXCR4-associated manner. Conversely, the lentiviral transfer of PromA in CD34+ cells prior to transplantation rendered the humanized NOJ mice resistant to HIV replication in CD4+ T cells, resulting in better preservation of peripheral/spleen CD4+CCR5+ T cells and bone marrow CD34+ cells at two weeks after infection.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results implicate the importance of evaluating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell pools in addition to peripheral CD4+ T-cell counts to assess the early stage of HIV infection. Moreover, stable gene transfer of PromA to hematopoietic stem cells not only limited HIV replication but also led to preservation of different subsets of hematopoietic cells, including bone marrow stem/progenitor cells.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomics is a versatile tool for exploring heterogeneous cell populations. As with all genomics experiments, batch effects can hamper data integration and interpretation. The success of batch effect correction is often evaluated by visual inspection of dimension-reduced representations such as principal component analysis. This is inherently imprecise due to the high number of genes and non-normal distribution of gene expression. Here, we present a k-nearest neighbour batch effect test (kBET, https://github.com/theislab/kBET) to quantitatively measure batch effects. kBET is easier to interpret, more sensitive and more robust than visual evaluation and other measures of batch effects. We use kBET to assess commonly used batch regression and normalisation approaches, and quantify the extent to which they remove batch effects while preserving biological variability. Our results illustrate that batch correction based on log-transformation or scran pooling followed by ComBat reduced the batch effect while preserving structure across data sets. Finally we show that kBET can pinpoint successful data integration methods across multiple data sets, in this case from different publications all charting mouse embryonic development. This has important implications for future data integration efforts, which will be central to projects such as the Human Cell Atlas where data for the same tissue may be generated in multiple locations around the world.\\n\\n[Before final publication, we will upload the R package to Bioconductor]",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic annotation studies of genetic risk variants for multiple sclerosis (MS) implicate dysfunctional lymphocytes in MS susceptibility; however, the role of central nervous system (CNS) cells remains unclear. We investigated the effect of the risk variant, rs7665090G, located near NFKB1, on astrocytes. We demonstrated that chromatin is accessible at the risk locus, a prerequisite for its impact on astroglial function. The risk variant was associated with increased NF-{kappa}B signaling and target gene expression driving lymphocyte recruitment in cultured human astrocytes and astrocytes within MS lesions, and with increased lesional lymphocytic infiltrates. In MS patients, the risk genotype was associated with increased lesion volumes on MRI. Thus, we established that the rs7665090G variant perturbs astrocyte function resulting in increased CNS access for peripheral immune cells. MS may thus result from variant-driven dysregulation of the peripheral immune system and the CNS, where perturbed CNS cell function aids in establishing local autoimmune inflammation.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe NF-{kappa}B relevant multiple sclerosis risk variant, rs7665090G, drives astrocyte responses that promote lesion formation.",

    "abstract": "In Gram-negative bacteria, porins span the outer membrane and control the influx of several prominent groups of antibiotics. Thus, it should not be surprising that expression of these porins is often altered in clinical isolates exhibiting multidrug resistance (MDR). The major regulator of porin expression in Escherichia coli is EnvZ, a canonical sensor histidine kinase (SHK). It allosterically processes periplasmic interactions with MzrA and cytoplasmic osmosensing into a single unified change in the ratio of its kinase and phosphatase activities. Unfortunately, the role of the EnvZ transmembrane domain (TMD) in bidirectional communication of these signals remains not well understood. Here, we employed in vivo sulfhydryl-reactivity to probe the dynamics of the TM2 helices and demonstrate that upon stimulus perception, only the region proximal to the periplasm undergoes conformational rearrangement. Furthermore, in silico coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations with aromatically tuned variants of EnvZ TM2 demonstrate the existence of both tilting and azimuthal rotational components to transmembrane communication while ruling out piston-type repositioning of TM2. Finally, in contrast to a similar analysis of TM1, we identified position-specific mutants possessing a \\\"flipped\\\" phenotype by dual-color fluorescent reporter analysis suggesting that both the periplasmic and cytoplasmic ends of TM2 are critical for maintenance of EnvZ signal output. Taken together, these data strongly support that EnvZ employs a non-piston-type mechanism during transmembrane communication. We conclude by discussing these results within the context of allosteric processing by EnvZ and propose that these results can be used to predict and classify transmembrane communication by various SHKs.\\n\\nImportanceThe EnvZ sensor histidine kinase serves as the major regulator of porin expression within Escherichia coli. A long-standing question is how stimulus perception by a bacterial receptor on one side of a biological membrane is transmitted to the opposite side of the membrane. To address this question, we monitored the dynamics of the transmembrane domain of EnvZ in vivo and coupled these results with in silico simulations of membrane-embedded EnvZ transmembrane domains. Taken together, these results demonstrate that detection of osmotic stress by the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ results in non-piston communication across the inner membrane of E. coli. Thus, in addition to understanding how EnvZ regulates porin balance and antibiotic influx, these results contribute to answering the long-standing question of how transmembrane communication is performed by bacterial receptors. Our work concludes with a framework that correlates receptor domain composition and signal transduction mechanisms that could be employed by other research groups on their particular receptors of interest.",

In this Perspective, we explore properties of TWAS as a potential approach to prioritize causal genes, using simulations and case studies of literature-curated candidate causal genes for schizophrenia, LDL cholesterol and Crohns disease. We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene, as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some of which are unlikely to be causal, because they share the same variants as eQTLs. We illustrate that TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization when using expression data from tissues or cell types that are less related to the trait, due to substantial variation in both expression levels and eQTL strengths across cell types. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes at GWAS loci more accurately than simple baselines based on proximity to lead GWAS variant and expression in trait-related tissue. We discuss current strategies and future opportunities for improving the performance of TWAS for causal gene prioritization. Our results showcase the strengths and limitations of using expression variation across individuals to determine causal genes at GWAS loci and provide guidelines and best practices when using TWAS to prioritize candidate causal genes.",

This disease currently has no cure, and despite the global epidemic, little is known about the pathogenesis and virulence of this pathogen.\\n\\nUsing Ion Torrent PGM, Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RSII sequencing platforms with various genome assembly methods, we produced the draft genome sequences of four P. noxius strains isolated from infected trees in Hong Kong to further understand the pathogen and identify the mechanisms behind the aggressive nature and virulence of this fungus. The resulting genomes ranged from 30.8Mb to 31.8Mb in size, and of the four sequences, the YTM97 strain was chosen to produce a high-quality Hong Kong strain genome sequence, resulting in a 31Mb final assembly with 457 scaffolds, an N50 length of 275,889 bp and 96.2% genome completeness. RNA-seq of YTM97 using Illumina HiSeq400 was performed for improved gene prediction. AUGUSTUS and Genemark-ES prediction programs predicted 9,887 protein-coding genes which were annotated using GO and Pfam databases. The encoded carbohydrate active enzymes revealed large numbers of lignolytic enzymes present, comparable to those of other white-rot plant pathogens. In addition, P. noxius also possessed larger numbers of cellulose, xylan and hemicellulose degrading enzymes than other plant pathogens. Searches for virulence genes was also performed using PHI-Base and DFVF databases revealing a host of virulence-related genes and effectors. The combination of non-specific host range, unique carbohydrate active enzyme profile and large amount of putative virulence genes could explain the reasons behind the aggressive nature and increased virulence of this plant pathogen.\\n\\nThe draft genome sequences presented here will provide references for strains found in Hong Kong. Together with emerging research, this information could be used for genetic diversity and epidemiology research on a global scale as well as expediting our efforts towards discovering the mechanisms of pathogenicity of this devastating pathogen.",

Inference of condition-specific interaction networks from epigenomic data enables the characterization of the structural plasticity that regulatory networks can acquire in different tissues of the same organism. From this perspective, uncovering specific patterns of variation by comparing network structure among tissues could provide insights into systems-level mechanisms underlying cell behavior. Following this idea, here we propose an empirical framework to analyze mammalian tissue-specific networks, focusing on characterizing and contrasting their structure and behavior in response to perturbations. We structurally represent the state of the cell/tissue by condition specific transcription factor networks generated using chromatin accessibility data, and we profile their systems behavior in terms of the structural robustness against random and directed perturbations. Using this framework, we unveil the structural heterogeneity existing among tissues at different levels of differentiation. We uncover a novel and conserved systems property of regulatory networks underlying embryonic stem cells (ESCs): in contrast to terminally differentiated tissues, the promiscuous regulatory connectivity of ESCs produces a globally homogeneous network resulting in increased structural robustness. Possible biological consequences of this property are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The demand of non-invasive prenatal testing for autosomal aneuploidy using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma is a highly sought-after diagnostic, with a rapidly growing market. Current approaches developed by next generation sequencing (NGS) need PCR amplifcation during sample preparation, which results in amplification bias in GC-rich areas of the human genome. With these approaches, the minimum fetal fraction in maternal plasma is 4% for the small differences in circulating cfDNA between trisomic and disomic pregnancies to be detectable. In this paper, we performed single molecule sequencing of cell-free DNA from maternal plasma for noninvasive trisomy 13, 18 and 21 detections using the GenoCare platform. We found that single molecule sequencing is sensitive enough to detect these chromosome abnormalities when the fetal DNA fraction is as low as 2%. Compared to the Hiseq2500 platform, no significant GC bias was observed. The improved sensitivity and unbiased GC readout make GenoCare a promising platform for autosomal aneuploidy detections, even in the very early stage of pregnancy.",

CRF-releasing PVN neurons receive inputs from multiple brain regions that convey stressful events, but their rapid neuronal dynamics on the timescale of behavior remain unknown. Here, our optical recordings of PVN CRF neuronal activity in freely behaving mice revealed that PVN CRF neurons are activated immediately by a range of stress-inducing aversive stimuli, including predator odor. By contrast, CRF neuronal activity starts to drop within a second of exposure to appetitive stimuli, such as food. These findings suggest that PVN CRF neurons receive real-time information about aversive and appetitive stimuli. Their role in mediating the sensory detection and regulating the neuroendocrine axis resembles those of AgRP/NPY neurons and SFO neurons that regulate neurophysiology responses and mediate sensory detection of food and water.",

    "abstract": "Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is a major constraint on cassava yields in East and Central Africa and threatens production in West Africa. CBSD is caused by two species of positive sense RNA viruses belonging to the family Potyviridae, genus Ipomovirus: Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). Diseases caused by the family Potyviridae require the interaction of viral genome-linked protein (VPg) and host eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) isoforms. Cassava encodes five eIF4E proteins: eIF4E, eIF(iso)4E-1, eIF(iso)4E-2, novel cap-binding protein-1 (nCBP-1), and nCBP-2. Protein-protein interaction experiments consistently found that VPg proteins associate with cassava nCBPs. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing was employed to generate ncbp-1, ncbp-2, and ncbp-1/ncbp-2 mutants in cassava cultivar 60444. Challenge with CBSV showed that ncbp-1/ncbp-2 mutants displayed delayed and attenuated CBSD aerial symptoms, as well as reduced severity and incidence of storage root necrosis. Suppressed disease symptoms were correlated with reduced virus titer in storage roots relative to wild-type controls. Our results demonstrate the ability to modify multiple genes simultaneously in cassava to achieve tolerance to CBSD. Future studies will investigate the contribution of remaining eIF4E isoforms on CBSD and translate this knowledge into an optimized strategy for protecting cassava from disease.",

    "abstract": "Nearly all eukaryotic messenger RNA precursors must undergo cleavage and polyadenylation at their 3'-end for maturation. A crucial step in this process is the recognition of the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal (PAS), and the molecular mechanism of this recognition has been a long-standing problem. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a quaternary complex of human CPSF-160, WDR33, CPSF-30 and an AAUAAA RNA at 3.4 [A] resolution. Strikingly, the AAUAAA PAS assumes an unusual conformation that allows this short motif to be bound directly by both CPSF-30 and WDR33. The A1 and A2 bases are recognized specifically by zinc finger 2 (ZF2) of CPSF-30 and the A4 and A5 bases by ZF3.

    "abstract": "The classification of human genetic variants into deleterious and neutral is a challenging issue, whose complexity is rooted in the large variety of biophysical mechanisms that can be responsible for disease conditions. For non-synonymous mutations in structured proteins, one of these is the protein stability change, which can lead to functionality loss. We developed a stability-driven knowledge-based classifier that uses protein structure, artificial neural networks and solvent accessibility-dependent combinations of statistical potentials to predict whether destabilizing or stabilizing mutations are disease-causing. Our predictor yields a balanced accuracy of 71% in cross validation. As expected, it has a very high positive predictive value of 89%: it predicts with high accuracy the subset of mutations that are deleterious because of stability issues, but is by construction unable of classifying variants that are deleterious for other reasons. Its combination with an evolutionary-based predictor increases the balanced accuracy up to 75%, and allowed predicting more than 1/4 of the deleterious variants with 95% positive predictive value. Our method, called SNPMuSiC, can be used with both experimental and structural models and compares favorably with other prediction tools on several independent test sets. It constitutes a step towards interpreting variant effects at the molecular scale.",

    "abstract": "Benchtop genome sequencers such as the Illumina MiSeq or MiniSeq [1], [2] are revolutionizing genomics research for smaller, independent laboratories, by enabling access to low-cost Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology in-house. These benchtop genome sequencing instruments require only standard laboratory equipment, in addition to minimal time for sample preparation. However, post-sequencing bioinformatics data analysis still presents a significant bottleneck, for research laboratories lacking specialized software and technical data analysis skills on their teams. While bioinformatics computes clouds providing solutions following a Software as a Service (SaaS) are available ([3]-[6], review in [7]), currently, there are only a few options which are user-friendly for non-experts while at the same time are also low-cost or free. One primary example is Illumina BaseSpace [8] that is very easy to access by non-experts, and also offers an integrated solution where data are streamed directly from the MiSeq sequencing instrument to the cloud. Once the data is on the BaseSpace cloud, users can access a range of bioinformatics applications with pre-installed algorithms through an intuitive web interface. Nonetheless, BaseSpace can be a costly solution as a yearly subscription depending on whether the user is associated with an academic or private institution, ranges in price from $999 - $4,999. Additional \\\"iCredits\\\" [9] might need to be purchased for frequent users that exhaust the base credit allowance as part of the subscription. Considering the reduction of computer hardware cost in recent years, a multi-core Intel Xeon server with 64 GigaByte (GB) of memory and multiple TeraByte (TB) of storage is priced less than the yearly subscription to Basespace [10], and similarly when compared to renting compute cycles from providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) [11]. Furthermore, the current generation of laptops usually come with 6-10 GigaBytes (GB) of memory and 1 TeraByte (TB) of storage, providing enough computational capacity to analyze data from small NGS experiments [12] that include only a few samples.",

Although quite a few computational models were proposed from different standing points to conduct differential expression (D.E.) analysis, almost all these methods do not provide a rigorous feature selection for high-dimensional RNA-seq count data. Instead, most or even all genes are invited into differential calls no matter they have real contributions to data variations or not. Thus, it would inevitably affect the robustness of D.E. analysis and lead to the increase of false positive ratios.\\n\\nIn this study, we presented a novel feature selection method: nonnegative singular value approximation (NSVA) to enhance RNA-seq differential expression analysis by taking advantage of RNA-seq count datas non-negativity. As a variance-based feature selection method, it selects genes according to its contribution to the first singular value direction of input data in a data-driven approach. It demonstrates robustness to depth bias and gene length bias in feature selection in comparison with its five peer methods. Combining with state-of-the-art RNA-seq differential expression analysis, it contributes to enhancing differential expression analysis by lowering false discovery rates caused by the biases. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection by proposing a data-driven differential expression analysis: NSVA-seq, besides conducting network marker discovery.",

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become standard of care as a complement to surgery in locally advanced or poor-prognosis early stage disease. The achievement of a complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy correlates with prognosis but it is not possible to predict who will obtain an excellent response. The molecular analysis of the tumor offers a unique opportunity to unveil predictive factors. In this work, gene expression profiling in 279 tumor samples from patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed and probabilistic graphical models were used. This approach enables addressing biological and clinical questions from a Systems Biology perspective, allowing to deal with large gene expression data and their interactions. Tumors presenting complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy had a higher activity of immune related functions compared to resistant tumors. Similarly, samples from complete responders presented higher expression of lymphocyte cell lineage markers, immune-activating and immune-suppressive markers, which may correlate with tumor infiltration by lymphocytes (TILs). These results suggest that the patients immune system plays a key role in tumor response to neoadjuvant treatment. However, future studies with larger cohorts are necessary to validate these hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Many cell functions rely on the ability of microtubules to self-organize as complex networks. In plants, cortical microtubules are essential to determine cell shape as they guide the deposition of cellulose microfibrils, and thus control mechanical anisotropy in the cell wall. Here we analyze how, in turn, cell shape may influence microtubule behavior. Using a computational model of microtubules enclosed in a three-dimensional space, We show that the microtubule network has spontaneous configurations that could explain many experimental observations without resorting to specific regulation. In particular, we find that the preferred localization of microtubules at the cortex emerges from directional persistence of the microtubules, combined with their growth mode. We identified microtubule parameters that seem relatively insensitive to cell shape, such as length or number. In contrast, microtubule array anisotropy depends strongly on local curvature of the cell surface and global orientation follows robustly the longest axis of the cell. Lastly, we found that the network is capable of reorienting toward weak external directional cues. Altogether our simulations show that the microtubule network is a good transducer of weak external polarity, while at the same time, it easily reaches stable global configurations.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPlants exhibit an astonishing diversity in architecture and shape. A key to such diversity is the ability of their cells to coordinate and grow to reach a broad spectrum of sizes and shapes. Cell growth in plants is guided by the microtubule cytoskeleton. Here, we seek to understand how microtubules self-organize close to the cell surface. We build upon previous two-dimensional models and we consider microtubules as lines growing in three dimensions, accounting for interactions between microtubules or between microtubules and the cell surface. We show that microtubule arrays are able to adapt to various cell shapes and to reorient in response to factors such as signals or environment. Altogether, our results help to understand how the microtubule cytoskeleton contributes to the diversity of plant shapes and to how these shapes adapt to environment.",

    "abstract": "In most systems, dispersal occurs despite clear fitness costs to dispersing individuals. Theory posits that spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality pushes dispersal rates to evolve towards zero, while temporal heterogeneity in habitat quality favours non-zero dispersal rates. One aspect of dispersal evolution that has received a great deal of recent attention is a process known as spatial sorting, which has been referred to as a \\\"shy younger sibling\\\" of natural selection. More precisely, spatial sorting is the process whereby variation in dispersal ability is sorted along density clines and will, in nature, often be a transient phenomenon. Despite this transience, spatial sorting is likely a general mechanism behind non-zero dispersal in spatiotemporally varying environments. While generally transient, spatial sorting is persistent on invasion fronts, where its effect cannot be ignored, causing rapid evolution of traits related to dispersal. Spatial sorting is described in several elegant models, yet these models require a high level of mathematical sophistication and are not accessible to most evolutionary biologists or their students. Here, we frame spatial sorting in terms of the classic haploid and diploid models of natural selection. We show that, on an invasion front, spatial sorting can be conceptualized precisely as selection operating through space rather than (as with natural selection) time, and that genotypes can be viewed as having both spatial and temporal aspects of fitness. The resultant model is strikingly similar to classic models of natural selection. This similarity renders the model easy to understand (and to teach), but also suggests that many established theoretical results around natural selection could apply equally to spatial sorting.",

    "abstract": "Classical theory on the origin and evolution of selfing and outcrossing relies on the role of inbreeding depression created by unlinked partially-deleterious recessive alleles to predict that individuals from natural populations predominantly self or outcross. Comparative data indicates, however, that maintenance of partial selfing and outcrossing at intermediate frequencies is common in nature. In part to explain the presence of mixed reproductive modes within populations, several hypotheses regarding the evolution of inbreeding depression have been put forward based on the complex interaction of linkage and identity disequilibrium among fitness loci, together with Hill-Robertson effects. We here ask what is the genetic basis of inbreeding depression so that populations with intermediate selfing rates can eliminate it while maintain potentially adaptive genetic diversity. For this, we use experimental evolution in the nematode C. elegans under partial selfing and compare it to the experimental evolution of populations evolved under exclusive selfing and predominant outcrossing. We find that the ancestral risk of extinction upon enforced inbreeding by selfing is maintained when populations evolve under predominant outcrossing, but reduced when populations evolve under partial or exclusive selfing. Analysis of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) during experimental evolution and after enforced inbreeding suggests that, under partial selfing, populations were purged of unlinked deleterious recessive alleles that segregate in the ancestral population, which in turn allowed the expression of unlinked overdominant fitness loci. Taken together, these observations indicate that populations evolving under partial selfing gain the short-term benefits of selfing, in purging deleterious recessive alleles, but also the long-term benefits of outcrossing, in maintaining genetic diversity that may important for future adaptation.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWNon-parametric population genetic modeling provides a simple and flexible approach for studying demographic history and epidemic dynamics using pathogen sequence data. Existing Bayesian approaches are premised on stationary stochastic processes which may provide an unrealistic prior for epidemic histories which feature extended period of exponential growth or decline. We show that non-parametric models defined in terms of the growth rate of the effective population size can provide a more realistic prior for epidemic history. We propose a non-parametric autoregressive model on the growth rate as a prior for effective population size, which corresponds to the dynamics expected under many epidemic situations. We demonstrate the use of this model within a Bayesian phylodynamic inference framework. Our method correctly reconstructs trends of epidemic growth and decline from pathogen genealogies even when genealogical data is sparse and conventional skyline estimators erroneously predict stable population size. We also propose a regression approach for relating growth rates of pathogen effective population size and time-varying variables that may impact the replicative fitness of a pathogen. The model is applied to real data from rabies virus and Staphylococcus aureus epidemics. We find a close correspondence between the estimated growth rates of a lineage of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and population-level prescription rates of {beta}-lactam antibiotics.

    "abstract": "This work was inspired by recent report by Bell et al., 2015 who studied potentially biogenic carbon preserved in a 4.1 billion-year-old Zircon and need to assess the potential of Zircons found in Goa. Zircons (ZrSiO4) are naturally occurring silicate minerals which show radioactivity and high ductility and contain traces of Thorium and Uranium useful in Uranium-Thorium /Thorium -230 dating techniques. Zircons can be found in igneous, metamorphic rocks, sedimentary deposits and occurs as a detrital minerals in river and beach sands. Previous reports show that the Zircons can occur in different shapes such as round, elongated and with surface characteristics (Gartner et al.,2013). U-Pb Zircon dating methods had been used to study the continental growth in the western Dharwar craton of southern India (Jayananda et al., 2015). The present study was aimed at detection of subsurface Zircons with biogenic inclusions and assess their use as proxies for studying bygone Precambrium biospheres in Goa. Deep tubewell drilled Cores (60 and 65 m deep from surface) in island of Tiswadi at Taleigao were analyzed by light microscopy, Phase contrast microscopy and SEM to detect and classify the Zircons. In rapid preliminary sampling, total 50 Zircons were identified and 98% indicated the presence of interesting inclusions. These could be bubbles or kerogens or unidentified biological material. Zircons were classified as elongated, slightly rounded with sharp edges and showed widespread variety of surface characteristics like fracturing, cracks, scratches, striations and impact pits which may occur during transport processes. It is suggested that Zircons with presumptive biogenic inclusions can be further studied using techniques such as Raman Spectroscopy, Carbon Isotopic Measurements, X-Ray Microscopy, Trace Element Measurement consistent with Bell et al., 2015. More exhaustive studies have been undertaken to create a detail image database of Zircons from various other local samples to pinpoint those specifically useful for advanced work based on image analysis of the presumptive bioinclusions. Further attempts would be made to develop specific harvesting techniques to select potentially useful Zircons. International collaborations would be sought for applications of advanced techniques to local Zircons. Such studies would shed light on nature of bygone Precambrian biospheres in Goa and help in understanding evolution of life and the impact of plate tectonics and cataclysmic events shaping life on this planet.",

We developed techniques to locate, detect and identify amber samples in local sand. In this pioneer study, we report presumptive microbial forms such as actinobacteria and fungi in amber samples of Goa throwing light on microbial paleobiodiversity. Baltic amber (Succinate) is fossilized resin belonging to the Eocene period (44-49 million years old) derived from the Araucariaceae and Leguminoseae families of trees containing up to 8% of Succinic acid and compounds such as terpenoids and phenolic derivatives. Sooty moulds in the amber fossils have been studied (Schmidt et al., 2014). Samples of imported Baltic amber were validated, studied and used as reference for identification and characterization of amber found in sand of Goa. FTIR Spectroscopic tests diagnostic of presence of Succinate proved that both samples meet the criteria as plant derived Succinate containing products. Fossil fungi in Baltic amber were observed, and compared with similar forms in rare amber fragments of Goa. These samples were subjected to microscopic examination. Actinobacterial and fungal forms embedded in local amber were compared with similar forms found in imported Baltic amber and those published in literature. Detection of fossilized actinobacterial and fungal forms has shown us the potential for further studies for comprehensive collection and microscopic examination of such paleomicrobial forms in rare local amber samples.",

    "abstract": "In the past 50 million years climate cooling has triggered the expansion of temperate biomes. During this period, many extant plant lineages in temperate biomes evolved from tropical ancestors and adapted to seasonality and cool conditions. Among the Poaceae (grass family), one of the subfamilies that successfully shifted from tropical to temperate biomes is the Pooideae (temperate grasses). Subfamily Pooideae contains the most important crops cultivated in the temperate regions including wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Due to the need of well-adapted cultivars, extensive research has produced a large body of knowledge about the mechanisms underlying cold adaptation in cultivated Pooideae species. Especially cold acclimation, a process which increases the frost tolerance during a period of non-freezing cold, plays an important role. Because cold adaptation is largely unexplored in lineages that diverged early in the evolution of the Pooideae, little is known about the evolutionary history of cold acclimation in the Pooideae. Here we test if several species of early diverging lineages exhibit increased frost tolerance after a period of cold acclimation. We further investigate the conservation of five well-studied gene families that are known to be involved in the cold acclimation of Pooideae crop species. Our results indicate that cold acclimation exists in early diverging lineages, but that genes involved in regulation of cold acclimation are not conserved. The investigated gene families show signs of lineage-specific evolution and support the hypothesis that gene family expansion is an important mechanism in adaptive evolution.",

Seed respiration was a large proportion of total berry respiration early in ripening but did not account for O2 deficiency late in ripening. [O2] increased towards the central axis corresponding to the presence of air spaces visualised using x-ray microCT. These connect to lenticels on the pedicel that were critical for berry O2 uptake as a function of temperature, and when blocked caused anoxia in the berry, ethanol accumulation and CD. Lenticel area on Chardonnay pedicels was higher than that for Shiraz probably accounting for the lower sensitivity of Chardonnay berry CD to high temperatures. The implications of hypoxia in grape berries are discussed in terms of its role in ripening and berry water relations.\\n\\nHighlightGrape berry internal oxygen concentration is dependent upon lenticels on the pedicel and cultivar differences in lenticels may account for temperature sensitivity of cell death in the mesocarp.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial genome evolution is characterized by gains, losses, and rearrangements of functional genetic segments. The extent to which genotype-phenotype relationships are influenced by large-scale genomic alterations has not been investigated in a high-throughput manner. In the symbiotic soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, the genome is composed of a chromosome and two large extrachromosomal replicons (pSymA and pSymB, which together constitute 45% of the genome). Massively parallel transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) was employed to evaluate contributions of chromosomal genes to fitness in both the presence and absence of these extrachromosomal replicons. Ten percent of chromosomal genes from diverse functional categories are shown to genetically interact with pSymA and pSymB. These results demonstrate the pervasive robustness provided by the extrachromosomal replicons, which is further supported by constraint-based metabolic modelling. A comprehensive picture of core S. meliloti metabolism was generated through a Tn-seq-guided in silico metabolic network reconstruction, producing a core network encompassing 726 genes. This integrated approach facilitated functional assignments for previously uncharacterized genes, while also revealing that Tn-seq alone misses over a quarter of wild type metabolism. This work highlights the strong functional dependencies and epistatic relationships that may arise between bacterial replicons and across a genome, while also demonstrating how Tn-seq and metabolic modelling can be used together to yield insights not obtainable by either method alone.",

However, paucity or quality of data do not allow for all of these to be taken into account in mathematical models. In order to explore separately the importance of these factors in models, we combined surveillance data with a local-scale cluster study in the rural province of Kampong Cham (Cambodia), in which serotypes and asymptomatic infections were documented. We formulate several mechanistic models, each one relying on a different set of hypotheses, such as explicit vector dynamics, transmission via asymptomatic infections and coexistence of several virus serotypes. Models are confronted with the observed time series using Bayesian inference, through Markov chain Monte Carlo. Model selection is then performed using statistical information criteria, but also by studying the coherence of epidemiological characteristics (reproduction numbers, incidence proportion, dynamics of the susceptible class) in each model. Considering the available data, our analyses on transmission dynamics in a rural endemic setting highlight both the importance of using two-strain models with interacting effects and the lack of added value of incorporating vector and explicit asymptomatic components.",

We use it to evaluate how the epidemic would be modified by changing the rate of vaccination, and improving public health conditions.\\n\\nResultsWe observe that a small decrease of 15% in vaccine coverage, translates an ascent of 47% in infected people. A coverage increase of 15% and 25% decreases a 44% and 66% respectively of infected people. Just improving health care measures a 5%, infected people decreases a 11.31%. Combining high coverage with public health measures produces a bigger reduction in the amount of infected people compare to amelioration of coverage rate or health measures alone.\\n\\nConclusionsOur model estimates the evolution of a diphtheria epidemic outbreak. Small increases in vaccination rates and in public health measures can translate into large differences in the evolution of a possible epidemic.

Many studies have investigated the extent to which patterns of coupling strength between multiple neural populations relates to behavior. For example, studies have used \\\"functional connectivity fingerprints\\\" to characterise individuals' brain activity. Here, we investigate the extent to which the exact spatial arrangement of cortical regions interacts with measures of brain connectivity. We find that the shape and exact location of brain regions interact strongly with the modelling of brain connectivity, and present evidence that the spatial arrangement of functional regions is strongly predictive of non-imaging measures of behaviour and lifestyle. We believe that, in many cases, cross-subject variations in the spatial configuration of functional brain regions are being interpreted as changes in functional connectivity. Therefore, a better understanding of these effects is important when interpreting the relationship between functional imaging data and cognitive traits.",

    "abstract": "Animal experiments and cross-sectional human studies have linked particulate matter (PM) with increased behavioral problems. We conducted a longitudinal study to examine whether the trajectories of delinquent behavior are affected by PM2.5 (PM with aerodynamic diameter [&le;]2.5 m) exposures before and during adolescence. We used the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist at age 9-18 with repeated measures every ~2-3 years (up to 4 behavioral assessments) on 682 children from the Risk Factors for Antisocial Behavior Study conducted in a multi-ethnic cohort of twins born in 1990-1995. Based on prospectively-collected residential addresses and a spatiotemporal model of ambient air concentrations in Southern California, monthly PM2.5 estimates were aggregated to represent long-term (1-, 2-, 3-year average) exposures preceding baseline and cumulative average exposure until the last assessment. Multilevel mixed-effects models were used to examine the association between PM2.5 exposure and individual trajectories of delinquent behavior, adjusting for within-family/within-individual correlations and potential confounders. We also examined whether psychosocial factors modified this association. The results suggest that PM2.5 exposure at baseline and cumulative exposure during follow-up was significantly associated (p<0.05) with increased delinquent behavior. The estimated effect sizes (per interquartile increase of PM2.5 by 3.12-5.18 {micro}g/m3) were equivalent to the difference in delinquency scores between adolescents who are 3.5-4 years apart in age. The adverse effect was stronger in families with unfavorable parent-to-child relationships, increased parental stress or maternal depressive symptoms. Overall, these findings suggest long-term PM2.5 exposure may increase delinquent behavior of urban-dwelling adolescents, with the resulting neurotoxic effect aggravated by psychosocial adversities.",

    "abstract": "Comparative analyses of temporal programs of genome replication revealed either a nearly complete conservation between closely related species or a comprehensive reprogramming between distantly related species. Therefore, many important questions on the evolutionary remodeling of replication timing programs remain unanswered. To address this issue, we generated genome-wide replication timing profiles for ten yeast species from the genus Lachancea, covering a continuous evolutionary range from closely related to more divergent species. The comparative analysis of these profiles revealed that the replication program linearly evolves with increasing evolutionary divergence between these species. We found that the evolution of the timing program mainly results from a high evolutionary turnover rate of the cohort of active replication origins. We detected about one thousand evolutionary events of losses of active replication origins and gains of newborn origins since the species diverged from their last common ancestor about 80 million years ago. We show that the relocation of active replication origins is independent from synteny breakpoints, suggesting that chromosome rearrangements did not drive the evolution of the replication programs. Rather, origin gains and losses are linked both in space, along chromosomes, and in time, along the same branches of the phylogenetic tree. New origins continuously arise with on average low to medium firing efficiencies and increase in efficiency and earliness as they evolutionarily age. Yet, a subset of newborn origins emerges with high firing efficiency and origin losses occur concomitantly to their emergence and preferentially in their direct chromosomal vicinity. These key findings on the evolutionary birth, death and conservation of active replication origins provide the first description of how the temporal program of genome replication has evolved in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "The multilingual brain must implement mechanisms that serve to select the appropriate language as a function of the communicative environment. Engaging these mechanisms on a regular basis appears to have consequences for brain structure and function. Studies have implicated the caudate nuclei as important nodes in polyglot language control processes, and have also shown structural differences in the caudate nuclei in bilingual compared to monolingual populations. However, the majority of published work has focused on the categorical differences between monolingual and bilingual individuals, and little is known about whether these findings extend to multilingual individuals, who have even greater language control demands. In the present paper, we present an analysis of the volume and morphology of the caudate nuclei in 75 multilingual individuals who speak three or more languages. Volumetric analyses revealed a significant relationship between multilingual experience and right caudate volume, as well as a marginally-significant relationship with left caudate volume. Vertexwise analyses revealed a significant enlargement of dorsal and anterior portions of the left caudate nucleus having connectivity to executive brain regions, as a function of multilingual expertise. These results suggest that multilingual expertise might exercise a continuous impact on the brain, and that as additional languages beyond a second are acquired, the additional demands for control result in modifications to brain structures associated with language management processes.",

In addition, a full polysomnographical evaluation was performed, including sleep staging and assessment of respiratory function, limb movements and heart rate. The occurrence of sleep disorders was also assessed.\\n\\nRESULTSIn PTSD patients, NREM sleep shows a substantial loss of slow oscillation power and increased higher frequency activity compared to controls. The change is most pronounced in right-frontal brain areas and correlates with insomnia. PTSD REM sleep shows a large power shift in the opposite direction, with increased slow oscillation power in occipital areas, which is strongly related to nightmare activity and to lesser extent with insomnia. These pronounced spectral changes occur in the context of severe subjective sleep problems, increased occurrence of various sleep disorders and modest changes in sleep macrostructure.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThis is the first study to show pronounced changes in EEG spectral topologies during both NREM and REM sleep in PTSD. Importantly, the observed power changes reflect the hallmarks of PTSD sleep problems: insomnia and nightmares and may thus be specific for PTSD. A spectral index derived from these data distinguishes patients from controls with high effect size, bearing promise as a candidate biomarker.",

    "abstract": "This work presents an efficient framework, based on manifold approximation, for generating brain fingerprints from multi-modal data. The proposed framework represents images as bags of local features, which are used to build a subject proximity graph. Compact fingerprints are obtained by projecting this graph in a low-dimensional manifold, using spectral embedding. Experiments using the T1/T2-weighted MRI, diffusion MRI, and resting state fMRI data of 945 Human Connectome Project subjects demonstrate the benefit of combining multiple modalities, with multi-modal fingerprints more discriminative than those generated from individual modalities. Results also highlight the link between fingerprint similarity and genetic proximity, monozygotic twins having more similar fingerprints than dizygotic or non-twin siblings. This link is also reflected in the differences of feature correspondences between twin/sibling pairs, occurring in major brain structures and across hemispheres. The robustness of the proposed framework to factors like image alignment and scan resolution, as well as the reproducibility of results on retest scans, suggest the potential of multi-modal brain fingerprinting for characterizing individuals in a large cohort analysis. In addition, taking inspiration from the computer vision community, the proposed rank retrieval evaluation based on the task of twin/sibling identification and using Mean Average Precision (MAP) can be used for a standardized comparison of future brain fingerprints.",

    "abstract": "Point mutations underlie many genetic diseases. In this regard, while programmable DNA nucleases have been used to repair mutations, their use for gene therapy poses multiple challenges: one, efficiency of homologous recombination is typically low in cells; two, an active nuclease presents a risk of introducing permanent off-target mutations; and three, prevalent programmable nucleases typically comprise elements of non-human origin raising the potential of in vivo immunogenicity. In light of these, approaches to instead directly target RNA, and use of molecular machinery native to the host would be highly desirable. Towards this, we engineered and optimized two complementary approaches, referred together hereon as tRiAD, based on the use of tRNAs in codon suppression and adenosine deaminases in RNA editing. Specifically, by delivering modified endogenous tRNAs and/or the RNA editing enzyme ADAR2 and an associated guiding RNA (adRNA) via adeno-associated viruses, we enabled premature stop codon read-through and correction in the mdx mouse model of muscular dystrophy that harbors a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene. We further demonstrated inducible restoration of dystrophin expression by pyrolysyl-tRNA mediated incorporation of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) at the stop codon. Additionally, we also engineered ADAR2 mediated correction of a point mutation in liver RNA of the spfash mouse model of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. Taken together, our results establish the use of suppressor tRNAs and ADAR2 for in vivo RNA targeting, and this integrated tRiAD approach is robust, genomically scarless, and potentially non-immunogenic as it utilizes effector RNAs and human proteins.",

We developed a multimodal instrument that can both stimulate cells with subcellular spatial resolution and detect optical pathlength changes with nanometer scale sensitivity. We found that optical pathlength fluctuations following stimulation are consistent with active organelle transport. Furthermore, the results indicate a broadening in the transport velocity distribution, which is significantly higher in stimulated cells compared to optogenetically inactive cells.

    "abstract": "Thousands of biochemical reactions with characterized activities are orphan, meaning they cannot be assigned to a specific enzyme, leaving gaps in metabolic pathways. Novel reactions predicted by pathway-generation tools also lack associated sequences, limiting protein engineering applications. Associating orphan and novel reactions with known biochemistry and suggesting enzymes to catalyze them is a daunting problem. We propose a new method, BridgIT, to identify candidate genes and protein sequences for these reactions, and this method introduces, for the first time, information about the enzyme binding pocket into reaction similarity comparisons. BridgIT assesses the similarity of two reactions, one orphan and one well-characterized, nonorphan reaction, using their substrate reactive sites, their surrounding structures, and the structures of the generated products to suggest protein sequences and genes that catalyze the most similar non-orphan reactions as candidates for also catalyzing the orphan ones.\\n\\nWe performed two large-scale validation studies to test BridgIT predictions against experimental biochemical evidence. For the 234 orphan reactions from KEGG 2011 (a comprehensive enzymatic reaction database) that became non-orphan in KEGG 2018, BridgIT predicted the exact or a highly related enzyme for 211 of them. Moreover, for 334 out of 379 novel reactions in 2014 that were later catalogued in KEGG 2018, BridgIT predicted the exact or highly similar enzyme sequences.\\n\\nBridgIT requires knowledge about only three connecting bonds around the atoms of the reactive sites to correctly identify protein sequences for 93% of analyzed enzymatic reactions. Increasing to six connecting bonds allowed for the accurate identification of a sequence for nearly all known enzymatic reactions.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRecent advances in synthetic biochemistry have resulted in a wealth of novel hypothetical enzymatic reactions that are not matched to protein-encoding genes, deeming them \\\"orphan\\\". Nearly half of known metabolic enzymes are also orphan, leaving important gaps in metabolic network maps. Proposing genes for the catalysis of orphan reactions is critical for applications ranging from biotechnology to medicine. In this work, a novel computational method, BridgIT, identified a potential enzyme sequence to orphan reactions and nearly all theoretically possible biochemical transformations, providing candidate genes to catalyze these reactions to the research community. BridgIT online tool will allow researchers to fill the knowledge gaps in metabolic networks and will act as a starting point for designing novel enzymes to catalyze non-natural transformations.",

    "abstract": "In the endocytic pathway of animals, two related complexes, called CORVET (Class C Core Vacuole/Endosome Transport) and HOPS (Homotypic fusion and protein sorting), act as both tethers and fusion factors for early and late endosomes, respectively. Mutations in CORVET or HOPS lead to trafficking defects and contribute to human disease including immune dysfunction. HOPS and CORVET are conserved throughout eukaryotes but remarkably, in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, the HOPS-specific subunits are absent while CORVET-specific subunits have proliferated. VPS8 (Vacuolar Protein Sorting), a CORVET subunit, expanded to 6 paralogs in Tetrahymena. This expansion correlated with loss of HOPS within a ciliate subgroup including the Oligohymenophorea, which contains Tetrahymena. As uncovered via forward genetics, a single VPS8 paralog in Tetrahymena (VPS8A) is required to synthesize prominent secretory granules called mucocysts. More specifically,{triangleup} vps8a cells fail to deliver a subset of cargo proteins to developing mucocysts, instead accumulating that cargo in vesicles also bearing the mucocyst sorting receptor, Sor4p. Surprisingly, although this transport step relies on CORVET, it does not appear to involve early endosomes. Instead, Vps8a associates with the late endosomal/lysosomal marker Rab7, indicating target specificity switching occurred in CORVET subunits during the evolution of ciliates. Mucocysts belong to a markedly diverse and understudied class of protist secretory organelles called extrusomes. Our results underscore that biogenesis of mucocysts depends on endolysosomal trafficking, revealing parallels with invasive organelles in apicomplexan parasites and suggesting that a wide array of secretory adaptations in protists, like in animals, depend on mechanisms related to lysosome biogenesis.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Small samples or those whose RNA is degraded, such as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, remain challenging to study with nonspecialized RNA-seq protocols. Here we present a new method, Smart-3SEQ, that accurately quantifies transcript abundance even with small amounts of total RNA and effectively characterizes small samples extracted by laser-capture microdissection (LCM) from FFPE tissue. We also obtain distinct biological profiles from FFPE single cells, which have been impossible to study with previous RNA-seq protocols, and we use these data to identify possible new macrophage phenotypes associated with the tumor microenvironment. We propose Smart-3SEQ as a highly cost-effective method to enable large gene-expression profiling experiments unconstrained by sample size and tissue availability. In particular, Smart-3SEQs compatibility with FFPE tissue unlocks an enormous number of archived clinical samples, and combined with LCM it allows unprecedented studies of small cell populations and single cells isolated by their in situ context.",

These include high-throughput sequencing which can be used to measure DNA copy number as a proxy for allele replication timing. Here, we use droplet digital PCR to study DNA replication timing at multiple loci in budding yeast and human cells. We establish that the method has temporal and spatial resolutions comparable to the high-throughput sequencing approaches, while being faster than alternative locus-specific methods. Furthermore, the approach is capable of allele discrimination. We apply this method to determine relative replication timing across timing transition zones in cultured human cells. Finally, multiple samples can be analysed in parallel, allowing us to rapidly screen kinetochore mutants for perturbation to centromere replication timing. Therefore, this approach is well suited to the study of locus-specific replication and the screening of cis- and trans-acting mutants to identify mechanisms that regulate local genome replication timing.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms by which intake of dietary protein is regulated are poorly understood despite their potential involvement in determining food choice and appetite. In particular, it is unclear whether protein deficiency results in a specific appetite for protein and whether influences on diet are immediate or develop over time. To determine the effects of protein restriction on consumption, preference, and palatability for protein we assessed patterns of intake for casein (protein) and maltodextrin (carbohydrate) solutions in adult rats. To induce a state of protein restriction, rats were maintained on a low protein diet (5% casein) and compared to control rats on non-restricted diet (20% casein). Under these dietary conditions, relative to control rats, protein-restricted rats exhibited hyperphagia without weight gain. After two weeks, on alternate conditioning days, rats were given access to either isocaloric casein or maltodextrin solutions that were saccharin-sweetened and distinctly flavoured whilst consumption and licking patterns were recorded. This allowed rats to learn about the post-ingestive nutritional consequences of the two different solutions. Subsequently, during a preference test when rats had access to both solutions, we found that protein-restricted rats exhibited a preference for casein over carbohydrate whereas non-restricted rats did not. Analysis of lick microstructure revealed that this preference was associated with an increase in cluster size and number, reflective of an increase in palatability. In conclusion, protein-restriction induced a conditioned preference for protein, relative to carbohydrate, and this was associated with increased palatability.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEusociality is the highest level of social organization and naked mole-rats (NMR)s are amongst the few mammals showing this unique social behavior; nevertheless, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the eusociality of NMRs.\\n\\nResultsGene expression profiling of NMR brain and gonads (ovary and testis), from animals belonging to different reproductive castes, revealed robust gene expression differences between reproductive and non-reproductive members of NMR colonies. In the brain, dopaminergic pathways appear to be potential players in NMR eusocial behaviour. Breeding animals (queens and breeding males) showed increased expression of genes involved in dopamine metabolism. Using immunohistochemistry, we notably found these differences to be in dopaminergic hypothalamic areas, which provide inhibitory control over the secretion of prolactin, amongst other regions. Furthermore, plasma prolactin concentrations were elevated in many non-breeders (of both sexes), often reaching levels exceeding that of pregnant or lactating queens, suggesting a role for hyperprolactinaemia in socially-induced reproductive suppression. We also found that the ovaries of non-breeding females are arrested at pre-pubertal stage. They contained fewer supporting stromal cells compared to queens, and had very low expression of the aromatase gene Cyp19A1 (a key enzyme in estrogen synthesis) compared to non-breeding females. In the testes, genes involved in post meiosis spermatogenesis and sperm maturation (Prm1, Prm2, Odf3 and Akap4) were highly expressed in breeding males compared to non-breeders, explaining the low sperm number and impaired sperm motility characteristic of non-breeding males.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study suggests that extreme reproductive skew, one of the defining features of eusociality, is associated with changes in expression of key components of dopamine pathways, which could lead to hypogonadism and a lifetime of socially-induced sterility for most NMRs.",

    "abstract": "Pollinator foraging behavior has direct consequences for plant reproduction and has been implicated in driving floral trait evolution. Exploring the degree to which pollinators exhibit flexibility in foraging behavior will add to a mechanistic understanding of how pollinators can impact selection on plant traits. Although plants have evolved suites of floral traits to attract pollinators, flower color is a particularly important aspect of the floral display. Some pollinators show strong innate color preference, but many pollinators display flexibility in preference due to learning associations between rewards and color, or due to variable perception of color in different environments or plant communities. This study examines the flexibility in flower color preference of two groups of native butterfly pollinators under natural field conditions. Our study reveals that pipevine swallowtails and skippers, the predominate pollinators of the two native Texas Phlox species, display distinct patterns of color preferences across different contexts. Pipevine swallowtails exhibit highly flexible color preferences and likely utilize other floral traits to make foraging decisions. In contrast, skippers have consistent color preferences and likely use flower color as a primary cue for foraging. As a result of this variation in color preference flexibility, the two pollinator groups impose concordant selection on flower color in some contexts but discordant selection in other contexts. This variability could have profound implications for how flower traits respond to pollinator-mediated selection. Our findings suggest that studying dynamics of behavior in natural field conditions is important for understanding plant-pollinator interactions.",

    "abstract": "RNA binding protein (RBP) plays an important role in cell processes. Identifying RBPs by computation and experiment are both essential. Recently, RBPPred is proposed in our group to predict RBP with a high performance. However, RBPPred is too slow for that it will generate PSSM matrix as its feature. Herein, we develop a deep learning model called Deep-RBPPred. The model has three advantages comparing to previous models. 1. Deep-RBPPred only needs few physicochemical properties. 2. Deep-RBPPred runs much faster. 3. Deep-RBPPred has a good generalization ability. In the meantime, the performance is still as good as the stats-of-the-art method. In the testing in A. thaliana, S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens proteomics, MCC (AUC) are 0.6077 (0.9421), 0.573 (0.9034) and 0.8141(0.9515) respectively when the score cutoff is set to 0.5. In the verifying in Gerstberger-1538, the SN of our model is 90.38%. The running times are 9s, 7s, 8s and 10s, respectively, for H.sapiens, A.thaliana, S.cerevisiae and Gerstberger-1538 when it is tested in GPU. Deep-RBPPred forecasts 94.65% of 299 new RBP and about 8% higher sensitivity than RBPPred. We also apply deep-RBPPred in 19 eukaryotes proteomics and 11 bacteria proteomics downloaded from Uniprot. The result shows that rate of RBPs in eukaryotes proteome are much higher than bacteria proteome. Testing in 6 proteomics shows the many RBPs may be still undiscovered so far.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease is histologically marked by fibrils of Amyloid beta (A{beta}) peptide within the extracellular matrix. Fibrils themselves are benign compared to the cytotoxicity of the oligomers and pre-fibrillary aggregates. The conformational space and structural ensembles of A{beta} peptides and their oligomers in solution are inherently disordered and proven to be challenging to study. Optimum force field selection for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the biophysical relevance of results are still unknown. We compared the conformational space of the A{beta}(1-40) dimers by 300 ns replica exchange MD simulations at physiological temperature (310 K) using: the AMBER-ff99sb-ILDN, AMBER-ff99sb*-ILDN, AMBER-ff99sb-NMR, and CHARMM22* force fields. Statistical comparisons of simulation results to experimental data and previously published simulations utilizing the CHARMM22* and CHARMM36 force fields were performed. All force fields yield sampled ensembles of conformations with collision cross sectional areas for the dimer that are statistically significantly larger than experimental results. All force fields, with the exception of AMBER-ff99sb-ILDN (8.8{+/-}6.4%) and CHARMM36 (2.7{+/-}4.2%), tend to overestimate the -helical content compared to experimental CD (5.3{+/-}5.2%). Using the AMBER-ff99sb-NMR force field resulted in the greatest degree of variance (41.3{+/-}12.9%). Except for the AMBER-ff99sb-NMR force field, the others tended to under estimate the expected amount of {beta}-sheet and over estimate the amount of turn/bend/random coil conformations. All force fields, with the exception AMBER-ff99sb-NMR, reproduce a theoretically expected {beta}-sheet-turn-{beta}-sheet conformational motif, however, only the CHARMM22* and CHARMM36 force fields yield results compatible with collapse of the central and C-terminal hydrophobic cores from residues 17-21 and 30-36.

Existing methods either require an interface or knowledge of the relative orientations of the domains, are not designed for domain assembly, and none of them are developed for membrane proteins. Here we describe the first domain assembly protocol specifically designed for membrane proteins that assembles intra- and extracellular soluble domains and the transmembrane domain into models of the full-length membrane protein. Our protocol does not require an interface between the domains and samples possible domain orientations based on backbone dihedrals in the flexible linker regions, created via fragment insertion, while keeping the transmembrane domain fixed in the membrane. Our method, mp_domain_assembly, implemented in RosettaMP samples domain orientations close to the native structure and is best used in conjunction with experimental data to reduce the conformational search space.",

    "abstract": "Chemical activation rate is traditionally determined by the diffusion flux into an absorbing ball, as computed by Smoluchowski in 1916. Thus the rate is set by the mean first passage time (MFPT) of a Brownian particle to a small target. This paradigm is shifted in this manuscript to set the time scale of activation in cellular biology to the mean time of the first among many arrivals of particles at the activation site. This rate is very different from the MFPT and depends on different geometrical parameters. The shift calls for the reconsideration of physical modeling such as deterministic and stochastic chemical reactions based on the traditional forward rate, especially for fast activation processes occurring in living cells. Consequently, the biological activation time is not necessarily exponential. The new paradigm clarifies the role of population redundancy in accelerating search processes and in defining cellular-activation time scales. This is the case, for example, in cellular transduction or in the nonlinear dependence of fertilization rate on the number of spermatozoa. We conclude that statistics of the extreme set the new laws of biology, which can be very different from the physical laws derived for individuals.",

    "abstract": "Periosteum and bone marrow (BM) both contain skeletal stem/progenitor cells (SSCs) that participate in fracture repair. However, the functional difference and selective regulatory mechanisms of SSCs in different location are unknown due to the lack of specific markers. Here, we report a comprehensive gene expression analysis of bone marrow SSCs (BM-SSCs), periosteal SSCs (P-SSCs), and more differentiated osteoprogenitors by using reporter mice expressing Interferon-inducible Mx1 and NestinGFP, previously known SSC markers. We first defined that the BM-SSCs can be enriched by the combination of Mx1 and NestinGFP expression, while endogenous P-SSCs can be isolated by positive selection of Mx1, CD105 and CD140a (known SSC markers) combined with the negative selection of CD45, CD31, and osteocalcinGFP (a mature osteolineage marker). Comparative gene experession analysis with FACS-sorted BM-SSCs, P-SSCs, Osterix+ (OSX) preosteoblasts, CD51+ stroma cells and CD45+ hematopoietic cells as controls revealed that BM-SSCs and P-SSCs have high similarity with few potential differences without statistical significance. We also found that CD51+ cells are highly heterogeneous and little overlap with SSCs. This was further supported by the microarray cluster analysis, and the two populations clustered together. However, when comparing SSC population to controls, we found several genes that were uniquely upregulated in endogenous SSCs. Amongst these genes, we found KDR (aka Flk1 or VEGFR2) to be most interesting and discovered that it is highly and selectively expressed in P-SSCs. This finding suggests that endogenous P-SSCs are functionally very similar to BM-SSCs with undetectable significant differences in gene expression but there are distinct molecular signatures in P-SSCs, which can be useful to specify P-SSC subset in vivo.",

We reconstructed M.tb migration in Africa and Eurasia, and investigated lineage specific patterns of spread. Applying evolutionary rates inferred with ancient M.tb genome calibration, we link M.tb dispersal to historical phenomena that altered patterns of connectivity throughout Africa and Eurasia: trans-Indian Ocean trade in spices and other goods, the Silk Road and its predecessors, the expansion of the Roman Empire and, the European Age of Exploration. We find that Eastern Africa and Southeast Asia have been critical in the dispersal of M.tb.

    "abstract": "PCSK9 inhibitors are a potent new therapy for hypercholesterolemia and have been shown to decrease risk of coronary heart disease. Although short-term clinical trial results have not demonstrated major adverse effects, long-term data will not be available for some time. Genetic studies in large well-phenotyped biobanks offer a unique opportunity to predict drug effects and provide context for the evaluation of future clinical trial outcomes. We tested association of the PCSK9 loss-of-function variant rsll591147 (R46L) in a hypothesis-driven 11 phenotype set and a hypothesis-generating 278 phenotype set in 337,536 individuals of British ancestry in the United Kingdom Biobank (UKB), with independent discovery (n = 225K) and replication (n = 112K). In addition to the known association with lipid levels (OR 0.63) and coronary heart disease (OR 0.73), the T allele of rs11591147 showed a protective effect on ischemic stroke (OR 0.61, p = 0.002) but not hemorrhagic stroke in the hypothesis-driven screen. We did not observe an association with type 2 diabetes, cataracts, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and cognitive dysfunction. In the phenome-wide screen, the variant was associated with a reduction in metabolic disorders, ischemic heart disease, coronary artery bypass graft operations, percutaneous coronary interventions and history of angina. A single variant analysis of UKB data using TreeWAS, a Bayesian analysis framework to study genetic associations leveraging phenotype correlations, also showed evidence of association with cerebral infarction and vascular occlusion. This result represents the first genetic evidence in a large cohort for the protective effect of PCSK9 inhibition on ischemic stroke, and corroborates exploratory evidence from clinical trials. PCSK9 inhibition was not associated with variables other than those related to low density lipoprotein cholesterol and atherosclerosis, suggesting that other effects are either small or absent.",

Processes for measurement assurance are critical components of genome-scale measurements. Here, we evaluated the utility of a set of total RNA samples, designed with between-sample differences in the relative abundance of miRNAs, as process controls.\\n\\nResultsThree pure total human RNA samples (brain, liver, and placenta) and two different mixtures of these components were evaluated as measurement assurance control samples on multiple measurement systems at multiple sites and over multiple rounds. In silico modeling of mixtures provided benchmark values for comparison with physical mixtures. Biomarker development laboratories using next-generation sequencing (NGS) or genome-scale hybridization assays participated in the study and returned data from the samples using their routine workflows. Multiplexed and single assay reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was used to confirm in silico predicted sample differences. Data visualizations and summary metrics for genome-scale miRNA profiling assessment were developed using this dataset, and a range of performance was observed. These metrics have been incorporated into an online data analysis pipeline and provide a convenient dashboard view of results from experiments following the described design. The website also serves as a repository for the accumulation of performance values providing new participants in the project an opportunity to learn what may be achievable with similar measurement processes.\\n\\nConclusionsThe set of reference samples used in this study provides benchmark values suitable for assessing genome-scale miRNA profiling processes. Incorporation of these metrics into an online resource allows laboratories to periodically evaluate their performance and assess any changes introduced into their measurement process.",

    "abstract": "Variation in gut microbiome is associated with wellness and disease in humans, yet the molecular mechanisms by which this variation affects the host are not well understood. A likely mechanism is through changing gene regulation in interfacing host epithelial cells. Here, we treated colonic epithelial cells with live microbiota from five healthy individuals and quantified induced changes in transcriptional regulation and chromatin accessibility in host cells. We identified over 5,000 host genes that change expression, including 588 distinct associations between specific taxa and host genes. The taxa with the strongest influence on gene expression alter the response of genes associated with complex traits. Using ATAC-seq, we show that a subset of these changes in gene expression are likely the result of changes in host chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding induced by exposure to gut microbiota. We then created a manipulated microbial community with titrated doses of Collinsella, demonstrating that both natural and controlled microbiome composition leads to distinct, and predictable, gene expression profiles in host cells. Together, our results suggest that specific microbes play an important role in regulating expression of individual host genes involved in human complex traits. The ability to fine tune the expression of host genes by manipulating the microbiome suggests future therapeutic routes.",

    "abstract": "The genome of all organisms is constantly threatened by numerous agents that cause DNA damages. When the replication fork encounters an unrepaired DNA lesion, two DNA damage tolerance pathways are possible: error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS) that requires specialized DNA polymerases, and error-free Damage Avoidance (DA) that relies on homologous recombination. The balance between these two mechanisms is essential since it defines the level of mutagenesis during lesion bypass, allowing genetic variability and adaptation to the environment, but also introducing the risk of generating genome instability. Here we report that the mere proximity of replication-blocking lesions that arise in Escherichia colis genome during a genotoxic stress, leads to a strong increase in the use of the error-prone TLS. We show that this increase is caused by the local inhibition of homologous recombination due to the overlapping of single-stranded DNA regions generated downstream the lesions. This increase in TLS is independent of SOS activation, but its mutagenic effect is additive with the one of SOS. Hence, the combination of SOS induction and lesions proximity leads to a strong increase in TLS that becomes the main lesion tolerance pathway used by the cell during a genotoxic stress.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal damage results in profound retrograde, but no anterograde amnesia in contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Although the content learned in the latter have been discussed, the compensating regions were seldom proposed and never empirically addressed. Here, we employed network analysis of pCREB expression quantified from brain slices of rats with dorsal hippocampal lesion (dHPC) after undergoing CFC session. Using inter-regional correlations of pCREB-positive nuclei between brain regions, we modelled functional networks using different thresholds. The dHPC network showed small-world topology, equivalent to SHAM (control) network. However, diverging hubs were identified in each network. In a direct comparison, hubs in both networks showed consistently higher centrality values compared to the other network. Further, the distribution of correlation coefficients was different between the groups, with most significantly stronger correlation coefficients belonging to the SHAM network. These results suggest that dHPC network engaged in CFC learning is partially different, and engage alternative hubs. We next tested if pre-training lesions of dHPC and one of the new dHPC network hubs (perirhinal, Per; or disgranular retrosplenial, RSC, cortices) would impair CFC. Only dHPC-RSC, but not dHPC-Per, impaired CFC. Interestingly, only RSC showed a consistently higher centrality in the dHPC network, suggesting that the increased centrality reflects an increased functional dependence on RSC. Our results provide evidence that, without hippocampus, the RSC, an anatomically central region in the medial temporal lobe memory system might support CFC learning and memory.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYWhen determined cognitive performances are not affected by brain lesions of regions generally involved in that performance, the interpretation is that the remaining regions can compensate the damaged one. In contextual fear conditioning, a memory model largely used in laboratory rodents, hippocampal lesions produce amnesia for events occurred before, but not after the lesion, although the hippocampus is known to be important for new learning. Addressing compensation in animal models has always been challenging as it requires large-scale brain mapping. Here, we quantified 30 brain regions and used mathematical tools to model how a brain network can compensate hippocampal loss and learn contextual fear. We described that the damaged network preserved general interactivity characteristics, although different brain regions were identified as highly important for the network (e.g. highly connected). Further, we empirically validated our network model by performing double lesions of the hippocampus and the alternative hubs observed in the network models. We verified that double lesion of the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex, one of the hubs, impaired contextual fear learning. We provide evidence that without hippocampus, the remaining network relies on alternative important regions from the memory system to coordinate contextual fear learning.",

    "abstract": "Abuse of prescription opioids is a growing public health crisis in the United States, with drug overdose deaths increasing dramatically over the past 15 years. Few preclinical studies exist on the reinforcing effects of oxycodone or on the development of therapies for oxycodone abuse. This study was conducted to determine if immunopharmacotherapy directed against oxycodone would be capable of altering oxycodone-induced antinociception and intravenous self-administration. Male Wistar rats were administered a small-molecule immunoconjugate vaccine (Oxy-TT) or the control carrier protein, tetanus toxoid (TT), and trained to intravenously self-administer oxycodone (0.06 or 0.15 mg/kg/infusion). Brain oxycodone concentrations were 50% lower in Oxy-TT rats compared to TT rats 30 minutes after injection (1 mg/kg, s.c.) whereas plasma oxycodone was 15-fold higher from drug sequestration by circulating antibodies. Oxy-TT rats were also less sensitive to 1-2 mg/kg, s.c. oxycodone on a hot water nociception assay. Half of the Oxy-TT rats failed to acquire intravenous self-administration under the 0.06 mg/kg/infusion training dose. Oxycodone self-administration of Oxy-TT rats trained on 0.15 mg/kg/infusion was higher than controls; however under progressive ratio (PR) conditions the Oxy-TT rats decreased their oxycodone intake, unlike TT controls. These data demonstrate that active vaccination provides protection against the reinforcing effects of oxycodone. Anti-oxycodone vaccines may entirely prevent repeated use in some individuals who otherwise would become addicted. Vaccination may also reduce dependence in those who become addicted and therefore facilitate the effects of other therapeutic interventions which either increase the difficulty of drug use or incentivize other behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The suppression of growth during infection should facilitate resource allocation towards effective immune function. Work supporting this hypothesis has been recently reported in teleosts, demonstrating immune-responsive regulation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system - a key endocrine growth pathway that acts downstream of growth hormone (GH). Skeletal muscle is the main target for growth and energetic storage in fish, yet little is known about how growth is regulated in this tissue during an immune response. We addressed this knowledge gap by characterizing muscle immune responses in size-matched coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) achieving different growth rates. We compared a wild-type strain with two GH transgenic groups achieving either maximal or highly-suppressed growth - an experimental design that separates GHs direct effects from its influence on growth rate. Fish were sampled 30h post-injection with PBS (control) or mimics of bacterial (peptidoglycan) or viral (Poly:IC) infection. We quantified the mRNA level expression of genes from the GH, GH receptor (GHR), IGF hormone, IGF1 receptor (IGF-1R) and IGF binding protein (IGFBP) families, along with marker genes for muscle growth and host defence genes involved in inflammatory or antiviral responses. We provide strong evidence for dampened immunity in the GH transgenics compared to wild-type animals. Strikingly, the muscle of GH transgenics achieving rapid growth showed no detectable antiviral response, coupled with evidence of a constitutive inflammatory state. GH and IGF system gene expression was also strongly altered by GH transgenesis and fast growth, both for baseline expression levels and responses to immune stimulation. Overall, our findings demonstrate that GH transgenesis disrupts normal immune function and growth-immune cross-talk in muscle, with implications for the health and welfare of farmed salmon.",

    "abstract": "Genetically identical cells exhibit diverse phenotypes, even when experiencing the same environment. This phenomenon, in part, originates from cell-to-cell variability (noise) in protein expression. While various kinetic schemes of stochastic transcription initiation are known to affect gene expression noise, how post-transcription initiation events contribute to noise at the protein level remains incompletely understood. To address this question, we developed a stochastic simulation-based model of bacterial gene expression that integrates well-known dependencies between transcription initiation, transcription elongation dynamics, mRNA degradation and translation. We identified realistic conditions under which mRNA lifetime and transcriptional pauses modulate the protein expression noise initially introduced by the promoter architecture. For instance, we found that the short lifetime of bacterial mRNAs facilitates the production of protein bursts. Conversely, RNA polymerase (RNAP) pausing at specific sites during transcription elongation can attenuate protein bursts by fluidizing the RNAP traffic to the point of erasing the effect of a bursty promoter. Pause-prone sites, if located close to the promoter, can also affect noise indirectly by reducing both transcription and translation initiation due to RNAP and ribosome congestion. Our findings highlight how the interplay between transcription initiation, transcription elongation, translation and mRNA degradation shapes the distribution in protein numbers. They also have implications for our understanding of gene evolution and suggest combinatorial strategies for modulating phenotypic variability by genetic engineering.",

    "abstract": "Unlike synaptic strength, intrinsic excitability is assumed to be a stable property of neurons. For example, learning of somatic conductances is generally not incorporated into computational models, and the discharge pattern of neurons in response to test stimuli is frequently used as a basis for phenotypic classification. However, it is increasingly evident that signal processing properties of neurons are more generally plastic on the timescale of minutes. Here we demonstrate that the intrinsic firing patterns of CA3 neurons of the rat hippocampus in vitro undergo rapid long-term plasticity in response to a few minutes of only subthreshold synaptic conditioning. This plasticity on the spike-timing could also be induced by intrasomatic injection of subthreshold depolarizing pulses and was blocked by kinase inhibitors, indicating that discharge dynamics are modulated locally. Cluster analysis of firing patterns before and after conditioning revealed systematic transitions towards adapting and intrinsic burst behaviours, irrespective of the patterns initially exhibited by the cells. We used a conductance-based model to decide appropriate pharmacological blockade, and found that the observed transitions are likely due to recruitment of calcium and M-type potassium conductances. We conclude that CA3 neurons adapt their conductance profile to the subthreshold activity of their input, so that their intrinsic firing pattern is not a static signature, but rather a reflection of their history of subthreshold activity. In this way, recurrent output from CA3 neurons may collectively shape the temporal dynamics of their embedding circuits.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyDespite being widely conserved across the animal phyla, it is still a mystery why nerve cells present diverse discharge dynamics upon somatic step currents. Adding a new timing dimension to the intrinsic plasticity literature, here we show that CA3 neurons rapidly adapt through the space of known firing patterns in response to the subthreshold signals that they receive from their embedding circuit. This result implies that CA3 neurons collectively adjust their network processing to the temporal statistics of their circuit.",
