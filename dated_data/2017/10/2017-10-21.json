    "abstract": "The classical theory of enzymatic inhibition aims to quantitatively describe the effect of certain molecules--called inhibitors--on the progression of enzymatic reactions, but growing signs indicate that it must be revised to keep pace with the single-molecule revolution that is sweeping through the sciences. Here, we take the single enzyme perspective and rebuild the theory of enzymatic inhibition from the bottom up. We find that accounting for multi-conformational enzyme structure and intrinsic randomness cannot undermine the validity of classical results in the case of competitive inhibition; but that it should strongly change our view on the uncompetitive and mixed modes of inhibition. There, stochastic fluctuations on the single-enzyme level could give rise to inhibitor-activator duality--a phenomenon in which, under some conditions, the introduction of a molecule whose binding shuts down enzymatic catalysis will counter intuitively work to facilitate product formation. We state--in terms of experimentally measurable quantities--a mathematical condition for the emergence of inhibitor-activator duality, and propose that it could explain why certain molecules that act as inhibitors when substrate concentrations are high elicit a non-monotonic dose response when substrate concentrations are low. The fundamental and practical implications of our findings are thoroughly discussed.",

    "abstract": "Short tandem repeat (STR) mutations may be responsible for more than half of the mutations in eukaryotic coding DNA, yet STR variation is rarely examined as a contributor to complex traits. We assess the scope of this contribution across a collection of 96 strains of Arabidopsis thaliana by massively parallel STR genotyping. We found that 95% of examined STRs are polymorphic, with a median of six alleles per STR in these strains. Modest STR expansions are found in most strains, some of which have evident functional effects. For instance, three of six intronic STR expansions are associated with intron retention. Coding STRs are depleted of variation relative to non-coding STRs, consistent with the action of purifying selection, and some STRs show hypervariable patterns consistent with diversifying selection. Finally, we detect dozens of novel STR-phenotype associations that could not be detected with SNPs alone, validating several with follow-up experiments. Our results demonstrate that STRs comprise a large, unascertained reservoir of functionally relevant genomic variation.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMost genetic variants implicated in complex diseases by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are non-coding, making it challenging to understand the causative genes involved in disease. Integrating external information such as quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of molecular traits (e.g., expression, methylation) is a powerful approach to identify the subset of GWAS signals explained by regulatory effects. In particular, expression QTLs (eQTLs) help pinpoint the responsible gene among the GWAS regions that harbor many genes, while methylation QTLs (mQTLs) help identify the epigenetic mechanisms that impact gene expression which in turn affect disease risk. In this work we propose multiple-trait-coloc (moloc), a Bayesian statistical framework that integrates GWAS summary data with multiple molecular QTL data to identify regulatory effects at GWAS risk loci.\\n\\nResultsWe applied moloc to schizophrenia (SCZ) and eQTL/mQTL data derived from human brain tissue and identified 52 candidate genes that influence SCZ through methylation. Our method can be applied to any GWAS and relevant functional data to help prioritize disease associated genes.\\n\\nAvailabilitymoloc is available for download as an R package (https://github.com/clagiamba/moloc). We also developed a web site to visualize the biological findings (icahn.mssm.edu/moloc).

High light and herbaceous growth form have been hypothesized to favor amphistomy, but these hypotheses have not been rigourously tested together using phylogenetic comparative methods.\\nC_LIO_LII leveraged a large dataset including stomatal ratio, Ellenberg light indicator value, growth form, and phylogenetic relationships for 372 species of British angiosperms. I used phylogenetic comparative methods to test how light and/or growth form influence stomatal ratio and density.\\nC_LIO_LIHigh light and herbaceous growth form are correlated with amphistomy, as predicted, but they also interact; the effect of light is pronounced in therophytes (annuals) and perennial herbs, but muted in phanerophytes (shrubs and trees). Furthermore, amphistomy and stomatal density evolve together in response to light.\\nC_LIO_LIComparative analyses of British angiosperms reveal two major insights into physiological evolution. First, light and growth form interact to shape variation in stomatal ratio; amphistomy is common under high light, but mostly for herbs. Second, coordinated evolution of adaxial stomatal density and light tolerance indicates that amphistomy is an important adaptation to optimally balance light acquisition with gas exchange. These results advance our understanding of why stomatal ratio evolves and its potential as a functional trait for paleoecology and crop improvement.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "How does the brain combine information predictive of the value of a visually guided task (incentive value) with information predictive of where task relevant stimuli may occur (spatial certainty)? Human behavioural evidence indicates that these two predictions may be combined additively to bias visual selection (additive hypothesis), whereas neuroeconomic studies posit that they may be multiplicatively combined (expected value hypothesis). We sought to adjudicate between these two alternatives. Participants viewed two coloured placeholders that specified the potential value of correctly identifying an imminent letter target if it appeared in that placeholder. Then, prior to the targets presentation, an endogenous spatial cue was presented indicating the targets more likely location. Spatial cues were parametrically manipulated with regards to the information gained (in bits). Across two experiments, performance was better for targets appearing in high versus low value placeholders and better when targets appeared in validly cued locations. Interestingly, as shown with a Bayesian model selection approach, these effects did not interact, clearly supporting the additive hypothesis. Even when conditions were adjusted to increase the optimality of a multiplicative operation, support for it remained. These findings refute recent theories that expected value computations are the singular mechanism driving the deployment of endogenous spatial attention. Instead, incentive value and spatial certainty seem to act independently to influence visual selection.",

The genetic basis of HRD is very complicated, with more than 100 disease-causing genes being identified. Though NGS has allowed rapid and large-scale mutation screening of Mendelian disease, the cost of NGS still prevents its universal application all over the world, for an accurate molecular diagnosis. Here, by clinical guidance from patient phenotypes, we performed targeted molecular diagnosis by direct Sanger sequencing of the most likely candidate gene in two families diagnosed with HRD. Then we identified two novel protein-truncating variants in the gene CRB1.

We conducted a population-based molecular epidemiological study to understand TB transmission in Ghana.\\n\\nMethodsMycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates obtained from prospectively-sampled pulmonary TB patients between July, 2012 and December, 2015 were confirmed as MTBC using IS6110 PCR. MTBC lineages were identified by large sequence polymorphism and single nucleotide polymorphism assays and further characterized using spoligotyping and standard 15-loci MIRU-VNTR typing. We used the n-1 method to estimate recent TB transmission and identified associated risk factors using logistic regression analysis.\\n\\nFindingsOut of 2,309 MTBC isolates, we identified 1,082 (46{middle dot}9%) single cases with 1,227 (53{middle dot}1%) isolates belonging to one of 276 clustered cases (clustering range; 2-35). Recent TB transmission rate was estimated to be 41{middle dot}2%. While we see no significant difference in the recent transmission rates between lineages of Mycobacterium africanum (lineage-5 (31{middle dot}8%); lineage-6 (24{middle dot}7%), p=0{middle dot}118), we found that lineage-4 belonging to the M. tuberculosis transmitted significantly higher (44{middle dot}9%, p<0{middle dot}001). Finally, apart from age being significantly associated with recent TB transmission (p=0{middle dot}007), we additionally identified a significant departure in the male/female ratio among very large clustered cases compared to the general TB patient population (3:1 vs. 2:1, p=0{middle dot}022).\\n\\nInterpretationsOur findings indicate high recent TB transmission suggesting occurrences of unsuspected outbreaks.

    "abstract": "We used an agent-based network model to examine the effect of targeting different risk groups with unsuppressed HIV viral load for linkage or re-linkage to HIV-related treatment services in a heterosexual population with annual testing. Our model identifies prevention strategies that can reduce incidence to negligible levels (i.e., less than 0.1 infections per 100 person-years) 20 years after a targeted Treatment-as-Prevention (TasP) campaign. The model assumes that most (default 95%) of the population is reachable (i.e., could, in principle, be linked to effective care) and a modest (default 5% per year) probability of a treated person dropping out of care. Under random allocation or CD4-based targeting, the default version of our model predicts that the TasP campaign would need to suppress viral replication in ~80% of infected people to halt the epidemic. Under age-based strategies, by contrast, this percentage drops to 50% to 60% (for strategies targeting those <30 and <25, respectively). Age-based targeting did not need to be highly exclusive to yield significant benefits; e.g. the scenario that targeted those <25 years old saw ~80% of suppressed individuals fall outside the target group. This advantage to youth-based targeting remained in sensitivity analyses in which key age-related risk factors were eliminated one by one. As testing rates increase in response to UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals, we suggest that efforts to link all young people to effective care could be an effective long-term method for ending the HIV epidemic. Linking greater numbers of young people to effective care will be critical for developing countries in which a demographic \\\"youth bulge\\\" is starting to increase the number of young people at risk for HIV infection.",

    "abstract": "Background- Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a colossal threat to global health and incurs high economic costs to society. Economic evaluations of antimicrobials and interventions such as diagnostics and vaccines that affect their consumption rarely include the costs of AMR, resulting in sub-optimal policy recommendations. We estimate the economic cost of AMR per antibiotic consumed, stratified by drug class and national income level.\\n\\nMethods- The model is comprised of three components: correlation coefficients between human antibiotic consumption and subsequent resistance; the economic costs of AMR for five key pathogens; and consumption data for antibiotic classes driving resistance in these organisms. These were used to calculate the economic cost of AMR per antibiotic consumed for different drug classes, using data from Thailand and the United States (US) to represent low/middle and high-income countries.\\n\\nResults- The correlation coefficients between consumption of antibiotics that drive resistance in S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumanii, and P. aeruginosa and resistance rates were 0.37, 0.27, 0.35, 0.45, and 0.52, respectively. The total economic cost of AMR due to resistance in these five pathogens was $0.5 billion and $2.8 billion in Thailand and the US, respectively. The cost of AMR associated with the consumption of one standard unit (SU) of antibiotics ranged from $0.1 for macrolides to $0.7 for quinolones, cephalosporins and broad-spectrum penicillins in the Thai context. In the US context, the cost of AMR per SU of antibiotic consumed ranged from $0.1 for carbapenems to $0.6 for quinolones, cephalosporins and broad spectrum penicillins.\\n\\nConclusion- The economic costs of AMR per antibiotic consumed were considerable, often exceeding their purchase cost. Differences between Thailand and the US were apparent, corresponding with variation in the overall burden of AMR and relative prevalence of different pathogens. Notwithstanding their limitations, use of these estimates in economic evaluations can make better-informed policy recommendations regarding interventions that affect antimicrobial consumption and those aimed specifically at reducing the burden of AMR.",

    "abstract": "Animal-borne or zoonotic human diseases (e.g., SARS, Rabies) represent major health and economic burdens throughout the world, disproportionately impacting poor communities. In 2013-2016, an outbreak of the Ebola virus disease (EVD), a zoonotic disease spread from animal reservoirs caused by the Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV), infected approximately 30,000 people, causing considerable negative social and economic impacts in an unexpected geographical location(Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia). It is not known whether the spatial distribution of this outbreak and unprecedented severity was precipitated by environmental changes and, if so, which areas might be at risk in the future. To better address the major health and economic impacts of zoonotic diseases we develop a system-dynamics approach to capture the impact of future climate, land use and human population change on Ebola (EVD). We create future risk maps for affected areas and predict between a 1.75-3.2 fold increase in EVD outbreaks per year by 2070. While the best case future scenarios we test saw a reduction in the likelihood of epidemics, other future scenarios with high human population growth and low rates of socioeconomic development saw a fourfold increase in the risk of epidemics occurring and almost 50% increase in the risk of catastrophic epidemics. As well as helping to target where health infrastructure might be further developed or vaccines best deployed, our modelling framework can be used to target global interventions and forecast risk for many other zoonotic diseases.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDespite the severe health and economic impacts of outbreaks of diseases like SARS or Zika, there has been surprisingly little progress in predicting where and when human infectious disease outbreaks will occur next. By modelling the impacts of future climate, land use and human population change on one particular disease Ebola, we develop future risk maps for the affected areas and predict 1.7-3.2 times as many human Ebola outbreaks per year by 2070, and a 50% increase in the chance that these outbreaks will become epidemics. As well as helping to target where health infrastructure might be further developed or vaccines deployed, our approach can also be used to target actions and predict risk hotspots for many other infectious diseases.",

Analyses of processing speed (using a timed letter search task) and episodic memory (a 15-item word learning test) were conducted at ages 43, 53, 60-64 and 69 years using linear and multivariable regression, adjusting for gender and childhood cognition. Linear mixed models, with random intercepts and slopes, were conducted to test the association between APOE and the rate of decline in these cognitive scores from age 43 to 69. Model fit was assessed with the Bayesian Information Criterion. A cross-sectional association between APOE-{varepsilon}4 and memory scores was detected at age 69 for both heterozygotes and homozygotes ({beta}=-0.68 & {beta}=-1.38 respectively, p=.03) with stronger associations in homozygotes; no associations were observed before this age. Homozygous carriers of APOE-{varepsilon}4 had a faster rate of decline in memory between ages 43 and 69, when compared to noncarriers, after adjusting for gender and childhood cognition ({beta}=-0.05, p=.04). There were no cross-sectional or longitudinal associations between APOE-{varepsilon}4 and processing speed. We conclude that APOE-{varepsilon}4 is associated with a subtly faster rate of memory decline from midlife to early old age; this may be due to effects of APOE-{varepsilon}4 becoming manifest around the latter stage of life. Continuing follow-up will determine what proportion of this increase will become clinically significant.",

    "abstract": "Nucleosomal DNA sequences generally follow a well-known pattern with [~]10-bp periodic WW (where W is A or T) dinucleotides that oscillate in phase with each other and out of phase with SS (where S is G or C) dinucleotides. However, nucleosomes having a DNA sequence pattern inverse to the conventional one have not been systematically analyzed in eukaryotes. Here, we show that anti-WW/SS nucleosomes are widespread and exhibit a species- and context-specific distribution in the genomes. The enrichment of anti-WW/SS nucleosomes in mammalian genomes is positively correlated with RNA Pol II transcriptional levels, but negatively correlated with the presence of the periodic WW or SS sequence patterns. In addition, chromatin remodeling complexes have an impact on the abundance of anti-WW/SS nucleosomes. The data reveal distinct roles of cis- and trans-acting factors in the rotational positioning of nucleosomes between non-mammals and mammals. Implications of the anti-WW/SS sequence pattern for RNA Pol II transcription are discussed.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPartial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) is a popular machine learning tool that is gaining increasing attention as a useful feature selector and classifier. In an effort to understand its strengths and weaknesses, we performed a series of experiments with synthetic data and compared its performance to its close relative from which it was initially invented, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that even though PCA ignores the information regarding the class labels of the samples, this unsupervised tool can be remarkably effective as a feature selector. In some cases, it outperforms PLS-DA, which is made aware of the class labels in its input. Our experiments range from looking at the signal-to-noise ratio in the feature selection task, to considering many practical distributions and models encountered when analyzing bioinformatics and clinical data. Other methods were also evaluated. Finally, we analyzed an interesting data set from 396 vaginal microbiome samples where the ground truth for the feature selection was available. All the 3D figures shown in this paper as well as the supplementary ones can be viewed interactively at http://biorg.cs.fiu.edu/plsda\n\nConclusionsOur results highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of PLS-DA in comparison with PCA for different underlying data models.",

We have recently introduced a multispot version of SMFS, which allows achieving high-throughput SMFS by virtue of parallelization, and relies on custom silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detector arrays. Here, we examine the premise of this parallelization approach, which is that data acquired from different spots is uncorrelated. In particular, we measure the optical crosstalk characteristics of the two 48-SPAD arrays used in our recent SMFS studies, and demonstrate that it is negligible (crosstalk probability [&le;] 1.1 10-3) and is undetectable in cross-correlation analysis of actual single-molecule fluorescence data.",

DDK has also been reported to have diverse and sometimes conflicting roles in the replication checkpoint response in various organisms but the underlying mechanisms are far from settled. Here we show that human DDK promotes limited resection of newly synthesized DNA at stalled replication forks or sites of DNA damage to initiate replication checkpoint signaling. DDK is also required for efficient fork restart and G2/M cell cycle arrest. DDK exhibits genetic interactions with the ssDNA exonuclease EXO1, and we show that EXO1 is also required for nascent strand degradation following exposure to HU, raising the possibility that DDK regulates EXO1 directly. Thus, DDK has a primary and previously undescribed role in the replication checkpoint to promote ssDNA accumulation at stalled forks, which is required to initiate a robust checkpoint response and cell cycle arrest to maintain genome integrity.",

    "abstract": "Muscle morphogenesis is tightly coupled with that of motor neurons (MNs). Both MNs and muscle progenitors simultaneously explore the surrounding tissues while exchanging reciprocal signals to tune their behaviors. We previously identified the Fat1 cadherin as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis, and showed that it is required in the myogenic lineage to control the polarity of progenitor migration. To expand our knowledge on how Fat1 exerts its tissue-morphogenesis regulator activity, we dissected its functions by tissu-specific genetic ablation. An emblematic example of muscle under such morphogenetic control is the cutaneous maximus (CM) muscle, a flat subcutaneous muscle in which progenitor migration is physically separated from the process of myogenic differentiation, but tightly associated with elongating axons of its partner motor neurons. Here, we show that constitutive Fat1 disruption interferes with expansion and differentiation of the CM muscle, with its motor innervation and with specification of its associated MN pool. Fat1 is expressed in muscle progenitors, in associated mesenchymal cells, and in MN subsets including the CM-innervating pool. We identify mesenchyme-derived connective tissue as a cell type in which Fat1 activity is required for the non-cell-autonomous control of CM muscle progenitor spreading, myogenic differentiation, motor innervation, and for motor pool specification. In parallel, Fat1 is required in MNs to promote their axonal growth and specification, indirectly influencing muscle progenitor progression. These results illustrate how Fat1 coordinates the coupling of muscular and neuronal morphogenesis by playing distinct but complementary actions in several cell types.\\n\\nAuthor summaryFat cadherins are evolutionarily conserved cell adhesion molecules playing key roles in modulating tissue morphogenesis, through the control of collective cell behavior and polarity. We previously identified the mouse Fat1 gene as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis. The present study explores how Fat1 influences neuromuscular morphogenesis in the context of development of a flat subcutaneous muscle, the cutaneous maximus muscle (CM), formed by migratory progenitors emerging from forelimb levels somites, and innervated by a pool of brachial spinal motor neurons (MNs). CM development involves the rostrocaudal planar migration of muscle progenitors and subsequent elongation of muscle fibers to form a fan-shaped muscle. We previously reported that Fat1 was required in muscle progenitors to modulate their migration polarity. Here, these results were expanded by exploring the contribution of Fat1 activities in two other cell types, mesenchymal cells and MNs. We show that Fat1 disruption in connective tissue robustly alters CM muscle morphogenesis, affecting not only progenitor migration and myofiber expansion, but also subsequently impairing axon growth and specification of cognate MNs. In parallel, Fat1 acts in MNs to modulate axonal growth and neuronal specification, modestly influencing muscle morphology. Together, these results show that Fat1 coordinates the coupling between muscle and neuronal development by playing complementary functions in mesenchyme, muscles and MNs. These findings could guide research on muscle pathologies associated with FAT1 alterations in humans.",

The core Mediator complex is organized into head, middle, and tail modules, and in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Mediator recruitment has generally been ascribed to sequence-specific activators engaging the tail module triad of Med2-Med3-Med15 at upstream activating sequences (UASs). We show that med2{Delta} med3{Delta} med15{Delta} yeast are viable and that Mediator lacking Med2-Med3-Med15 is associated with active promoters genome-wide. To test whether Mediator might alternatively be recruited via interactions with the PIC, we examined Mediator association genome-wide after depleting PIC components. We found that depletion of Taf1, Rpb3, and TBP profoundly affected Mediator association at active gene promoters, with TBP being critical for transit of Mediator from UAS to promoter, while Pol II and Taf1 stabilize Mediator association at proximal promoters.",

    "abstract": "Studies of nervous system connectivity, in a wide variety of species and at different scales of resolution, have identified several highly conserved motifs of network organization. One such motif is a heterogeneous distribution of connectivity across neural elements, such that some elements act as highly connected and functionally important network hubs. These brain network hubs are also densely interconnected, forming a so-called rich-club. Recent work in mouse has identified a distinctive transcriptional signature of neural hubs, characterized by tightly coupled expression of oxidative metabolism genes, with similar genes characterizing macroscale inter-modular hub regions of the human cortex. Here, we sought to determine whether hubs of the neuronal C. elegans connectome also show tightly coupled gene expression. Using open data on the chemical and electrical connectivity of 279 C. elegans neurons, and binary gene expression data for each neuron across 948 genes, we computed a correlated gene expression score for each pair of neurons, providing a measure of their gene expression similarity. We demonstrate that connections between hub neurons are the most similar in their gene expression while connections between nonhubs are the least similar. Genes with the greatest contribution to this effect are involved in glutamatergic and cholinergic signalling, and other communication processes. We further show that coupled expression between hub neurons cannot be explained by their neuronal subtype (i.e., sensory, motor, or interneuron), separation distance, chemically secreted neurotransmitter, birth time, pairwise lineage distance, or their topological module affiliation. Instead, this coupling is intrinsically linked to the identity of most hubs as command interneurons, a specific class of interneurons that regulates locomotion. Our results suggest that neural hubs may possess a distinctive transcriptional signature, preserved across scales and species, that is related to the involvement of hubs in regulating the higher-order behaviors of a given organism.\\n\\nAuthor summarySome elements of neural systems possess many more connections than others, marking them as network hubs. These hubs are often densely interconnected with each other, forming a so-called rich-club that is thought to support integrated function. Recent work in the mouse suggests that connected pairs of hubs show higher levels of transcriptional coupling than other pairs of brain regions. Here, we show that hub neurons of the nematode C. elegans also show tightly coupled gene expression and that this effect cannot be explained by the spatial proximity or anatomical location of hub neurons, their chemical composition, birth time, neuronal lineage or topological module affiliation. Instead, we find that elevated coexpression is driven by the identity of most hubs of the C. elegans connectome as command interneurons, a specific functional class of neurons that regulate locomotion. These findings suggest that coupled gene expression is a highly conserved genomic signature of neural hubs that may be related to the specific functional role that hubs play in broader network function.",

Using minute by minute EMR data from fifty thousand surgeries we developed and tested a machine learning based system called Prescience that predicts real-time hypoxemia risk and presents an explanation of factors contributing to that risk during general anesthesia. Prescience improved anesthesiologists performance when providing interpretable hypoxemia risks with contributing factors. The results suggest that if anesthesiologists currently anticipate 15% of events, then with Prescience assistance they could anticipate 30% of events or an estimated additional 2.4 million annually in the US, a large portion of which may be preventable because they are attributable to modifiable factors. The prediction explanations are broadly consistent with the literature and anesthesiologists prior knowledge. Prescience can also improve clinical understanding of hypoxemia risk during anesthesia by providing general insights into the exact changes in risk induced by certain patient or procedure characteristics.

Host preference assays using odour-baited traps revealed no effect of infection on mosquito long-range anthropophily.

We test this hypothesis by studying a model in which the demography and genetic composition of the population are both determined by the behavior of the individuals within the population. We propose an effective population size that allows us to compare our model with the classical Wright-Fisher diffusion both for neutral alleles and those under selection. We find that using our approximation for the effective population size, the Wright-Fisher diffusion provides good results for the times to absorption and probabilities of fixation of a given neutral allele and in cases where selection is not too strong. However, the times and laws to fixation are not always well predicted due to large fluctuations in population size caused by small growth rates or strong competition between individuals, that cannot be captured by the constant population size approximation. The discrepancy between our model and the Wright-Fisher diffusion is accentuated in the presence of demo-genetic feed-back. Our results imply that the Wright-Fisher diffusion is not appropriate when studying probabilities and times to fixation in long-lived species with low reproductive rates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChanges in development in response to seasonally variable environments can produce phenotypes adjusted to fluctuating seasonal conditions and help organisms cope with temporal heterogeneity. In contrast to what happens in natural situations, experimental studies of developmental plasticity typically use environmental factors held constant during development, precluding assessment of potential environment-by-environment interaction effects.\\n\\nResultsWe tested effects of circadian fluctuations in temperature on a series of thermally plastic traits in a model of adaptive seasonal plasticity, the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Comparing phenotypes from individuals reared under two types of fluctuations (warmer days with cooler nights, and cooler days with warmer nights) and those reared under a constant temperature of the same daily average allowed us to identify complex patterns of response to day and night temperatures. We found evidence of additive-like effects (for body size), but also different types of \\\"dominance\\\"-type effects where one particular period of the light cycle (for development time) or one particular extreme temperature (for eyespot size) had a relatively larger contribution to phenotype expression. We also gathered evidence against the hypothesis that thermal plasticity in development time drives thermal plasticity in other traits.\\n\\nConclusionsCombined effects of fluctuating day and night temperatures include additive-like effects as well as different types of environmental-dominance interaction effects. Differences between plastic traits reveal independent responses to temperature, and possible independent assessment of temperature conditions. Our study underscores the importance of understanding how organisms integrate complex environmental information towards a complete understanding of natural phenotypic variation and of the potential impact of environmental change thereon.",

    "abstract": "Transposable Elements are biologically important components of eukaryote genomes. In particular, non-LTR retrotransposons (N-LTRrs) extensively shaped the human genome throughout evolution. In this study, we compared retrotransposon insertions differentially present in the genomes of Anatomically Modern Humans, Neanderthals, Denisovans and Chimpanzees, in order to assess the possible impact of retrotransposition in the differentiation of the human lineage. Briefly, we first identified species-specific N-LTRrs and established their distribution in present day human populations. These analyses shortlisted a group of N-LTRr insertions that were found exclusively in Anatomically Modern Humans. Notably, these insertions targeted genes more frequently than randomly expected and are associated with an increase in the number of transcriptional/splicing variants of those genes they inserted in. The analysis of the functionality of genes targeted by human-specific N-LTRr insertions seems to reflect phenotypic changes that occurred during human evolution. Furthermore, the expression of genes containing the most recent N-LTRr insertions is enriched in the brain, especially in undifferentiated neurons, and these genes associate in networks related to neuron maturation and migration. Additionally, we also identified candidate N-LTRr insertions that have likely produced new functional variants exclusive to modern humans, which show traces of positive selection and are now fixed in all present-day human populations. In sum, our results strongly suggest that N-LTRr impacted our differentiation as a species and have been a constant source of genomic variability all throughout the evolution of the human lineage.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies exert several of their effector functions by binding to cell surface receptors. For murine IgG3 (mIgG3) the identity of its receptors (and the very existence of a receptor) is still under debate, as not all mIgG3 functions can be explained by interaction with Fc{gamma}-receptor I (Fc{gamma}RI). This implies the existence of an alternate receptor, whose identity we sought to pinpoint. We found that blockage of the alpha4/beta1 integrin (Itga4/Itgb1) selectively hampered binding of mIgG3 to macrophages and mIgG3-mediated phagocytosis. Manganese, an integrin activator, increased mIgG3 binding to macrophages. Blockage of Fc{gamma}RI or Itgb1 inhibited binding of different mIgG3 antibodies to variable extents. Our results indicate an integrin component in the mIgG3 receptor. Given the more ancient origin of integrins in comparison with Fc{gamma}R, this observation could have far ranging implications for our understanding of the evolution of antibody-mediated immunity, as well as in immunity to microorganisms, pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and antibody engineering.",

    "abstract": "Neural stem cells in the adult murine brain have only a limited capacity to self-renew, and the number of neurons they generate drastically declines with age. How cellular dynamics sustain neurogenesis and how alterations with age may result in this decline, are both unresolved issues. Therefore, we clonally traced neural stem cell lineages using confetti reporters in young and old adult mice. To understand underlying mechanisms, we derived mathematical population models of adult neurogenesis that explain the observed clonal cell type abundances. Models fitting the data best consistently show self renewal of transit amplifying progenitors and rapid neuroblast cell cycle exit. Most importantly, we identified an increase of asymmetric stem cell divisions at the expense of symmetric stem cell differentiation with age. Beyond explaining existing longitudinal population data, our model identifies a particular cellular strategy underlying adult neural stem cell homeostasis that gives insights into the aging of a stem cell compartment.",

    "abstract": "The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are poorly understood and difficult to treat. Estrogens may mitigate these symptoms via unknown mechanisms. To examine these mechanisms, we tested whether increasing estradiol (E) or decreasing luteinizing hormone (LH) could rescue declarative memory in a phencyclidine (PCP) model of schizophrenia. We then assessed whether changes in cortical or hippocampal GABA may underlie these effects. Female rats were ovariectomized and injected subchronically with PCP. To modulate E and LH, animals received hormone capsules or Antide injections. Short-term episodic memory was assessed using the novel object recognition task. Brain expression of GAD67 was analyzed via western blot, and parvalbumin-containing cells were counted using immunohistochemistry. Some rats received hippocampal infusions of a GABAA agonist, GABAA antagonist, or GAD inhibitor before behavioral testing. We found that PCP reduced hippocampal GAD67 and abolished object recognition. Antide restored hippocampal GAD67 and rescued recognition memory in PCP-treated animals. Estradiol reversed PCPs amnesic effect but failed to restore hippocampal GAD67. PCP did not cause significant differences in number of parvalbumin-expressing cells or cortical expression of GAD67. Hippocampal infusions of a GABAA agonist restored memory in PCP-treated rats. Blocking hippocampal GAD or GABAA receptors in ovx animals reproduced memory loss similar to PCP and inhibited estradiols memory rescue in PCP-treated animals. In summary, decreasing LH or increasing E can reverse memory loss in a PCP model of schizophrenia. Alterations in hippocampal GABA may contribute to both PCPs effects on declarative memory and the hormones ability to reverse them.",

    "abstract": "Transcellular propagation of aggregate \\\"seeds\\\" has been proposed to mediate progression of neurodegenerative diseases in tauopathies and -synucleinopathies. We have previously determined that tau and -synuclein aggregates bind heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the cell surface. This mediates uptake and intracellular seeding. The specificity and mode of binding to HSPGs has been unknown. We used modified heparins to determine the size and sulfation requirements of glycosaminoglycan (GAGs) binding to aggregates in biochemical and cell uptake and seeding assays. Aggregates of tau require a precise GAG architecture with defined sulfate moieties in the N- and 6-O-positions, whereas -synuclein and A{beta} rely slightly more on overall charge on the GAGs. To determine the genetic requirements for aggregate uptake, we individually knocked out the major genes of the HSPG synthesis pathway using CRISPR/Cas9 in HEK293T cells. Knockout of EXT1, EXT2 and EXTL3, N-sulfotransferase (NDST1), and 6-O-sulfotransferase (HS6ST2) significantly reduced tau uptake. -Synuclein was not sensitive to HS6ST2 knockout. Good correlation between pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of GAG binding by tau and -synuclein indicates specificity that may help elucidate a path to mechanism-based inhibition of transcellular propagation of pathology.",
