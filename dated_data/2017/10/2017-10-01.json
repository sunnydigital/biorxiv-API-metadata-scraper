    "abstract": "Adaptation to human-induced environmental change has the potential to profoundly influence the genomic architecture of affected species. This is particularly true in agricultural ecosystems, where anthropogenic selection pressure is strong. Heliothis virescens feeds on cotton in its larval stages and US populations have been declining since the widespread planting of transgenic cotton, which endogenously express proteins derived Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). No physiological adaptation to Bt toxin has been found in the field, so adaptation to this altered environment could involve: 1) shifts in host plant selection mechanisms to avoid cotton, 2) changes in detoxification mechanisms required for cotton-feeding versus feeding on other host plants, or 3) loss of resistance to previously used management practices including insecticides. Here we begin to address the question of whether such changes occurred in H. virescens populations between the years 1997 and 2012. As part of our study, we produced an H. virescens genome assembly and used this in concert with a ddRAD-seq enabled genome scan to identify loci with significant allele frequency changes over the 15 year period after Bt crops became widespread in the agricultural landscape. Confirmation that a known genetic change at a previously described H. virescens target of selection was detectable in our genome scan increased our confidence in this methodology. We quantified the strength of selection required to elicit the observed allele frequency changes at loci under selection. Potential contributions of genes near the loci under selection to adaptive phenotypes in the H. virescens cotton system are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Data quality is increasingly recognized as one of the most important confounding factors in brain imaging research. It is particularly important for studies of brain development, where age is systematically related to in-scanner motion and data quality. Prior work has demonstrated that in-scanner head motion biases estimates of structural neuroimaging measures. However, objective measures of data quality are not available for most structural brain images. Here we sought to identify quantitative measures of data quality for T1-weighted volumes, describe how such measures of quality relate to cortical thickness, and delineate how this in turn may bias inference regarding associations with age in youth. Three highly-trained raters provided manual ratings of 1,840 raw T1-weighted volumes. These images included a training set of 1,065 images from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), a test set of 533 images from the PNC, as well as an external test set of 242 adults acquired on a different scanner. Manual ratings were compared to automated quality measures provided by the Preprocessed Connectomes Projects Quality Assurance Protocol (QAP), as well as FreeSurfers Euler number, which summarizes the topological complexity of the reconstructed cortical surface. Results revealed that the Euler number was consistently correlated with manual ratings across samples. Furthermore, the Euler number could be used to identify images scored \\\"unusable\\\" by human raters with a high degree of accuracy (AUC: 0.98-0.99), and outperformed proxy measures from functional timeseries acquired in the same scanning session. The Euler number also was significantly related to cortical thickness in a regionally heterogeneous pattern that was consistent across datasets and replicated prior results. Finally, data quality both inflated and obscured associations with age during adolescence. Taken together, these results indicate that reliable measures of data quality can be automatically derived from T1-weighted volumes, and that failing to control for data quality can systematically bias the results of studies of brain maturation.",

    "abstract": "Concerns regarding reproducibility of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) findings have been raised. Little is known about how to operationally define R-fMRI reproducibility and to what extent it is affected by multiple comparison correction strategies and sample size. We comprehensively assessed two aspects of reproducibility, test-retest reliability and replicability, on widely used R-fMRI metrics in both between-subject contrasts of sex differences and within-subject comparisons of eyes-open and eyes-closed (EOEC) conditions. We noted permutation test with Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE), a strict multiple comparison correction strategy, reached the best balance between family-wise error rate (under 5%) and test-retest reliability / replicability (e.g., 0.68 for test-retest reliability and 0.25 for replicability of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) for between-subject sex differences, 0.49 for replicability of ALFF for within-subject EOEC differences). Although R-fMRI indices attained moderate reliabilities, they replicated poorly in distinct datasets (replicability < 0.3 for between-subject sex differences, < 0.5 for within-subject EOEC differences). By randomly drawing different sample sizes from a single site, we found reliability, sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) rose as sample size increased. Small sample sizes (e.g., < 80 (40 per group)) not only minimized power (sensitivity < 2%), but also decreased the likelihood that significant results reflect \\\"true\\\" effects (PPV < 0.26) in sex differences. Our findings have implications for how to select multiple comparison correction strategies and highlight the importance of sufficiently large sample sizes in R-fMRI studies to enhance reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "The differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chondrocytes (native cartilage cells), or chondrogenesis, is a key step in the tissue engineering of articular cartilage, where the motility and high proliferation rate of MSCs used as seed cells are exploited. Chondrogenesis is regulated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-{beta}), a short-lived cytokine whose effect is prolonged by storage in the extracellular matrix. Tissue engineering applications require the complete differentiation of an initial population of MSCs, and two common strategies used to achieve this in vitro are (1) co-culture the MSCs with chondrocytes, which constitutively produce TGF-{beta}; or (2) add exogenous TGF-{beta}. To investigate these strategies we develop an ordinary differential equation model of the interactions between TGF-{beta}, MSCs and chondrocyte. Here the dynamics of TGF-{beta} are much faster than those of the cell processes; this difference in time-scales is exploited to simplify subsequent model analysis. Using our model we demonstrate that under strategy 1 complete chondrogenesis will be induced if the initial proportion of chondrocytes exceeds a critical value. Similarly, under strategy 2 we find that there is a critical concentration of exogenous TGF-{beta} above which all MSCs will ultimately differentiate. Finally, we use the model to demonstrate the potential advantages of adopting a hybrid strategy where exogenous TGF-{beta} is added to a co-culture of MSCs and chondrocytes, as compared to using either strategy 1 or 2 in isolation.",

We present a method, iSAFE, that uses a statistic derived solely from population genetics signals to pinpoint the favored mutation even when the signature of selection extends to 5Mbp. iSAFE was tested extensively on simulated data and in human populations from the 1000 Genomes Project, at 22 loci with previously characterized selective sweeps. For 14 of the 22 loci, iSAFE ranked the previously characterized candidate mutation among the 13 highest scoring (out of [~] 21, 000 variants). Three loci did not show a strong signal. For the remaining loci, iSAFE identified previously unreported mutations as being favored. In these regions, all of which involve pigmentation related genes, iSAFE identified identical selected mutations in multiple non-African populations suggesting an out-of-Africa onset of selection.

    "abstract": "Despite considerable efforts, no physical mechanism has been shown to explain N-terminal codon bias in prokaryotic genomes. Using a systematic study of synonymous substitutions in two endogenous E. coli genes, we show that interactions between the coding region and the upstream Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence modulate the efficiency of translation initiation, affecting both intracellular mRNA and protein levels due to the inherent coupling of transcription and translation in E. coli. We further demonstrate that far-downstream mutations can also modulate mRNA levels by occluding the SD sequence through the formation of non-equilibrium secondary structures. By contrast, a non-endogenous RNA polymerase that decouples transcription and translation largely alleviates the effects of synonymous substitutions on mRNA levels. Finally, a complementary statistical analysis of the E. coli genome specifically implicates avoidance of intra-molecular base-pairing with the SD sequence. Our results provide general physical insights into the coding-level features that optimize protein expression in prokaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Disrupting signaling axes that are essential for tumor metastasis may provide therapeutic opportunity to cure cancer. We previously identified adenylate kinase 4 (AK4) as a biomarker of metastasis in lung cancer. Here we analyze AK4-associated metabolic gene signature and reveal HIF-1 is transcriptionally activated and associated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Overexpression of AK4 shifts metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis and elevates intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which stabilizes and exaggerates HIF1- protein expression and concurrently drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hypoxia. Furthermore, overexpression of AK4 reduces hypoxic necrosis in tumors and promotes liver metastasis in vivo. Connectivity map analysis of AK4 gene signature identifies Withaferin-A as a potential compound to inhibit AK4-HIF-1 signaling axis, which then shows promising anti-metastatic potency in an orthotopic xenograft model of lung cancer. Our findings offer an alternative strategy to impair lung cancer metastasis via targeting AK4-HIF-1 axis.",

    "abstract": "RationaleTo maintain vascular patency, endothelial cells (ECs) actively regulate hemostasis. Among the myriad of pathways by which they control both fibrin formation and fibrinolysis is EC expression of annexin A2 (ANXA2) in a heterotetrameric complex with S100A10 [(ANXA2-S100A10)2]. This complex is a well-recognized endothelial surface platform for the activation of plasminogen by tissue plasminogen activator. A noteworthy advance in this field came about when it was shown that the cAMP pathway is linked to the regulation of (ANXA2-S100A10)2 in ECs.\\n\\nObjectiveThese findings prompted us to determine whether a druggable target, namely the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) pathway, plays a role in vascular luminal fibrinolysis.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsTaking advantage of our Epac1-null mouse model, we found that depletion of Epac1 results in fibrin deposition, fibrinolytic dysfunction, and decreased endothelial surface ANXA2 in mice, which are similar to phenomena discovered in ANXA2-null and S100A10-null mice. We observed upregulation of EPAC1 and downregulation of fibrin in endocardial tissues beneath atrial mural thrombi in humans. Of note, our thrombosis model revealed that dysfunction of fibrinolysis in EPAC1-null mice can be ameliorated by recombinant ANXA2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that suppression of EPAC1 using a small-molecule inhibitor (ESI09) reduces the expression of ANXA2 in lipid rafts and impedes ANXA2 association with S100A10. Endothelial apical surface expression of both ANXA2 and S100A10 were markedly decreased in ESI09-treated ECs, which was corroborated by results from a nanoforce spectroscopy study. Moreover, inactivation of EPAC1 decreases tyrosine 23 phosphorylation of ANXA2 in the cell membrane compartment.\\n\\nConclusionsOur data reveal a novel role for EPAC1 in vascular fibrinolysis, by showing that EPAC1 is responsible for the translocation of ANXA2 to the EC surface. This process promotes conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, thereby enhancing local fibrinolytic activity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Florida Everglades has undergone significant ecological change spanning the continuum of disturbance to restoration. While the restoration effort is not complete and the ecosystem continues to experience short duration perturbations, a better understanding of long-term C dynamics of the Everglades is needed to facilitate new restoration efforts. This study evaluated temporal trends of different aquatic carbon (C) pools of the northern Everglades Protection Area over a 20-year period to gauge historic C cycling patterns. Dissolved inorganic C (DIC), dissolved organic C (DOC), particulate organic C (POC), and surface water carbon dioxide (pCO2(aq)) were investigated between May 1, 1994 and April 30, 2015.\\n\\nResultsAnnual mean concentrations of DIC, DOC, POC, and pCO2(aq) significantly decreased through time or remained constant across the Water Conservation Areas (WCAs). Overall, the magnitude of the different C pools in the water column significantly differed between regions. Outgassing of CO2 was dynamic across the Everglades ranging from 420 to 2001 kg CO2 yr-1. Overall the historic trend in CO2 flux from the marsh declined across our study area while pCO2(aq) largely remained somewhat constant with the exception of Water Conservation Area 2 which experienced significant declines in pCO2(aq). Particulate OC concentrations were consistent between WCAs, but a significantly decreasing trend in annual POC concentrations were observed.\\n\\nConclusionsHydrologic condition and nutrient inputs significantly influenced the balance, speciation, and flux of C pools across WCAs suggesting a subsidy-stress response in C dynamics relative to landscape scale responses in nutrient availability. The interplay between nutrient inputs and hydrologic condition exert a driving force on the balance between DIC and DOC production via the metabolism of organic matter which forms the base of the aquatic foodweb. Along the restoration trajectory as water quality and hydrology continues to improve it is expected that C pools will respond accordingly.",

Furthermore, estimation of causality between these loci and other psychiatric disorders was similarly non-significant.\\n\\nIn conclusion, by applying a range of statistical models we demonstrate that the strongest plasma CRP-influencing genetic loci are not associated with post-ICU PTSD and depressive symptoms.

    "abstract": "Nitrospirae spp. distantly related to thermophilic, sulfate-reducing Thermodesulfovibrio species are regularly observed in environmental surveys of anoxic marine and freshwater habitats. However, little is known about their genetic make-up and physiology. Here, we present the draft genome of Nitrospirae bacterium Nbg-4 as a representative of this clade and analyzed its in situ protein expression under sulfate-enriched and sulfate-depleted conditions in rice paddy soil. The genome of Nbg-4 was assembled from replicated metagenomes of rice paddy soil that was used to grow rice plants in the presence and absence of gypsum (CaSO4x2H2O). Nbg-4 encoded the full pathway of dissimilatory sulfate reduction and showed expression thereof in gypsum-amended anoxic bulk soil as revealed by parallel metaproteomics. In addition, Nbg-4 encoded the full pathway of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia, which was expressed in bulk soil without gypsum amendment. The relative abundance of Nbg-4-related metagenome reads was similar under both treatments indicating that it maintained stable populations while shifting its energy metabolism. Further genome reconstruction revealed the potential to utilize butyrate, formate, H2, or acetate as electron donor, with the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway being expressed under both conditions. Comparison to publicly available Nitrospirae genome bins confirmed that the pathway for dissimilatory sulfate reduction is also present in related Nitrospirae recovered from groundwater. Subsequent phylogenomics showed that such microorganisms form a novel genus within the phylum Nitrospirae, with Nbg-4 as a representative species. Based on the widespread occurrence of this novel genus, we propose for Nbg-4 the name Candidatus Sulfobium mesophilum, gen. nov., spec. nov.\\n\\nImportanceRice paddies are indispensable for food supply but are a major source of the greenhouse gas methane. If not counterbalanced by cryptic sulfur cycling, methane emission from rice paddy fields would be even higher. However, the microorganisms involved in this sulfur cycling are little understood. By using an environmental systems biology approach of Italian rice paddy soil, we could retrieve the population genome of a novel member of the phylum Nitrospirae. This microorganism encoded the full pathway of dissimilatory sulfate reduction and expressed it in situ under sulfate-enriched and anoxic conditions. Phylogenomics and comparison to environmental surveys showed that such microorganisms are actually widespread in freshwater and marine environments. At the same time, they represent a yet undiscovered genus within the little explored Nitrospirae. Our results will be important to design enrichment strategies and postgenomic studies to fully understand the contribution of these novel Nitrospirae to the global sulfur cycle.",

For example, images acquired with retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used to accurately classify patients with adult macular degeneration (AMD), and distinguish them from healthy control patients. However, previous research has suggested that large amounts of data are required in order to train deep learning algorithms, because of the large number of parameters that need to be fit. Here, we show that a moderate amount of data (data from approximately 1,800 patients) may be enough to reach close-to-maximal performance in the classification of AMD patients from OCT images. These results suggest that deep learning algorithms can be trained on moderate amounts of data, provided that images are relatively homogenous, and the effective number of parameters is sufficiently small. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in this application, cross-validation with a separate test set that is not used in any part of the training does not differ substantially from cross-validation with a validation data-set used to determine the optimal stopping point for training.",

For example, images acquired with retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used to accurately classify patients with adult macular degeneration (AMD), and distinguish them from healthy control patients. However, previous research has suggested that large amounts of data are required in order to train deep learning algorithms, because of the large number of parameters that need to be fit. Here, we show that a moderate amount of data (data from approximately 1,800 patients) may be enough to reach close-to-maximal performance in the classification of AMD patients from OCT images. These results suggest that deep learning algorithms can be trained on moderate amounts of data, provided that images are relatively homogenous, and the effective number of parameters is sufficiently small. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in this application, cross-validation with a separate test set that is not used in any part of the training does not differ substantially from cross-validation with a validation data-set used to determine the optimal stopping point for training.",

    "abstract": "The posterior medial network is at the apex of a temporal integration hierarchy in the brain, integrating information over many seconds of viewing intact, but not scrambled, movies. This has been interpreted as an effect of temporal structure. Such structure in movies depends on pre-existing event schemas, but temporal structure can also arise de novo from learning. Here we examined the relative role of schema-consistent temporal structure and arbitrary but consistent temporal structure on the human posterior medial network. We tested whether, with repeated viewing, the network becomes engaged by scrambled movies with temporal structure. Replicating prior studies, posterior medial regions were immediately locked to stimulus structure upon exposure to intact but not scrambled movies. However, for temporally structured scrambled movies, functional coupling within the network increased across stimulus repetitions, rising to the level of intact movies. Thus, temporal structure is a key determinant of network dynamics and function.",

    "abstract": "Conservation and covariation measures, as other evolutionary analysis, require a high number of distant homologous sequences, therefore a lot of structural divergence can be expected in such divergent alignments. However, most works linking evolutionary and structural information use a single structure ignoring the structural variability inside a protein family. That common practice seems unrealistic to the light of this work.\\n\\nIn this work we studied how structural divergence affects conservation and covariation estimations. We uncover that, within a protein family, ~51% of multiple sequence alignment columns change their exposed/buried status between structures. Also, ~53% of residue pairs that are in contact in one structure are not in contact in another structure from the same family. We found out that residue conservation is not directly related to the relative solvent accessible surface area of a single protein structure. Using information from all the available structures rather than from a single representative structure gives more confidence in the structural interpretation of the evolutionary signals. That is particularly important for diverse multiple sequence alignments, where structures can drastically differ. High covariation scores tend to indicate residue contacts that are conserved in the family, therefore, are not suitable to find protein/conformer specific contacts.\\n\\nOur results suggest that structural divergence should be considered for a better understanding of protein function, to transfer annotation by homology and to model protein evolution.",

    "abstract": "Clustering is a central approach for unsupervised learning. After clustering is applied, the most fundamental analysis is to quantitatively compare clusterings. Such comparisons are crucial for the evaluation of clustering methods as well as other tasks such as consensus clustering. It is often argued that, in order to establish a baseline, clustering similarity should be assessed in the context of a random ensemble of clusterings. The prevailing assumption for the random clustering ensemble is the permutation model in which the number and sizes of clusters are fixed. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in practice; for example, multiple runs of K-means clustering returns clusterings with a fixed number of clusters, while the cluster size distribution varies greatly. Here, we derive corrected variants of two clustering similarity measures (the Rand index and Mutual Information) in the context of two random clustering ensembles in which the number and sizes of clusters vary. In addition, we study the impact of one-sided comparisons in the scenario with a reference clustering. The consequences of different random models are illustrated using synthetic examples, handwriting recognition, and gene expression data. We demonstrate that the choice of random model can have a drastic impact on the ranking of similar clustering pairs, and the evaluation of a clustering method with respect to a random baseline; thus, the choice of random clustering model should be carefully justified.",

    "abstract": "Hemispheric asymmetry is a cardinal feature of human brain organization. Altered brain asymmetry has also been linked to some cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here the ENIGMA consortium presents the largest ever analysis of cerebral cortical asymmetry and its variability across individuals. Cortical thickness and surface area were assessed in MRI scans of 17,141 healthy individuals from 99 datasets worldwide. Results revealed widespread asymmetries at both hemispheric and regional levels, with a generally thicker cortex but smaller surface area in the left hemisphere relative to the right. Regionally, asymmetries of cortical thickness and/or surface area were found in the inferior frontal gyrus, transverse temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex. These regions are involved in lateralized functions, including language and visuospatial processing. In addition to population-level asymmetries, variability in brain asymmetry was related to sex, age, and brain size (indexed by intracranial volume). Interestingly, we did not find significant associations between asymmetries and handedness. Finally, with two independent pedigree datasets (N = 1,443 and 1,113, respectively), we found several asymmetries showing modest but highly reliable heritability. The structural asymmetries identified, and their variabilities and heritability provide a reference resource for future studies on the genetic basis of brain asymmetry and altered laterality in cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric disorders.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLeft-right asymmetry is a key feature of the human brain's structure and function. It remains unclear which cortical regions are asymmetrical on average in the population, and how biological factors such as age, sex and genetic variation affect these asymmetries. Here we describe by far the largest ever study of cerebral cortical brain asymmetry, based on data from 17,141 participants. We found a global anterior-posterior 'torque' pattern in cortical thickness, together with various regional asymmetries at the population level, which have not been previously described, as well as effects of age, sex, and heritability estimates. From these data, we have created an on-line resource that will serve future studies of human brain anatomy in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "The leghemoglobin protein (LegH) from soy (Glycine max) expressed in Pichia pastoris (LegH Prep) imparts a meat-like flavor profile onto plant-based food products. The safety of LegH Prep was evaluated through a series of in vitro and in vivo tests. The genotoxic potential of LegH Prep was assessed using the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) and the in vitro chromosome aberration test. LegH Prep was non-mutagenic and non-clastogenic in each test, respectively. Systemic and female reproductive toxicity were assessed in two separate 28-day dietary studies in Sprague Dawley rats. There were no mortalities associated with the administration of LegH Prep. There were no clinical observations, body weight, ophthalmological, clinical pathology, or histopathological changes attributable to LegH Prep administration. Female reproductive parameters were comparable between rats treated with LegH Prep and concurrent control rats. These studies establish an NOAEL of 750 mg/kg/day LegH, which is over 100 times greater than the 90th percentile estimated daily intake (EDI). Collectively, this work demonstrates that LegH Prep is safe for its intended use in ground beef analogue products at concentrations up to 0.8% LegH.\\n\\nAbbreviations",
