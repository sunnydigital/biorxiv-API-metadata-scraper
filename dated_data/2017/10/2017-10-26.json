    "abstract": "Base substitution catalogs represent historical records of mutational processes that have been active in a system. Such processes can be distinguished by typical characteristics, like mutation type, sequence context, transcriptional and replicative strand bias, and distribution throughout the genome. MutationalPatterns is an R/Bioconductor package that characterizes this broad range of mutational patterns and potential relations with (epi-)genomic features. Furthermore, it offers an efficient method to quantify the contribution of known mutational signatures. Such analyses can be used to determine whether certain DNA repair mechanisms are perturbed and to further characterize the processes underlying known mutational signatures.",

    "abstract": "Within-host adaptation of pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often occurs at more than two loci. Multiple beneficial mutations may arise simultaneously on different genetic backgrounds and interfere, affecting each other's fixation trajectories. Here, we explore how these adaptive dynamics are mirrored in multilocus linkage disequilibrium (MLD), a measure of multi-way associations between alleles. In the parameter regime corresponding to HIV, we show that deterministic early infection models induce MLD to oscillate over time in a wavelet-like fashion. We find that the frequency of these oscillations is proportional to the rate of adaptation. This signature is robust to drift, but can be eroded by high variation in fitness effects of beneficial mutations. Our findings suggest that MLD oscillations could be used as a signature of interference among multiple equally advantageous mutations and may aid the interpretation of MLD in data.",

In this study, we use BioNano data to anchor and extend chromosome ends from two European trios as well as two unrelated Asian genomes. BioNano assembled chromosome ends are structurally divergent from the reference genome, including both missing sequence (10%) and extensions(22%). These extensions are heritable and in some cases divergent between Asian and European samples. Six ninths of the extension sequence in NA12878 can be confirmed and filled by nanopore data. We identify two sequence families in these sequences which have undergone substantial duplication in multiple primate lineages. We show that these sequence families have arisen from progenitor interstitial sequence on the ancestral primate chromosome 7.

We calibrated the model to data from multiple Ebola outbreaks. We quantified the impact of ahead-of-time HCW-targeted strategies, and reactive HCW and community vaccination.\\n\\nResultsWe found that for some outbreaks (we call \\\"type 1\\\") HCW amplified transmission both to other HCW and the community, and in these outbreaks prophylactic vaccination of HCW decreased outbreak size. Reactive vaccination strategies had little effect because type 1 outbreaks ended quickly. However, in outbreaks with longer time courses (\\\"type 2 outbreaks\\\"), reactive community vaccination decreased the number of cases, with or without prophylactic HCW-targeted vaccination. For both outbreak types, we found that ahead-of-time HCW-targeted strategies had an impact at coverage of 30%.\\n\\nConclusionsThe optimal vaccine strategy depends on the dynamics of the outbreak and the impact of other interventions on transmission.

    "abstract": "Migration is a ubiquitous life history trait with profound evolutionary and ecological consequences. Recent developments in telemetry and genomics, when combined, can bring significant insights on the migratory ecology of non-model organisms in the wild. Here, we used this integrative approach to document dispersal, gene flow and potential for local adaptation in anadromous Arctic Char from six rivers in the Canadian Arctic. Acoustic telemetry data from 124 tracked individuals indicated asymmetric dispersal, with a large proportion of fish (72%) tagged in three different rivers migrating up the same short river in the fall. Population genomics data from 6,136 SNP markers revealed weak, albeit significant, population differentiation (average pairwise FST = 0.011) and asymmetric dispersal was also revealed by population assignments. Approximate Bayesian Computation simulations suggested the presence of asymmetric gene flow, although in the opposite direction to that observed from the telemetry data, suggesting that dispersal does not necessarily lead to gene flow. These observations suggested that Arctic Char home to their natal river to spawn, but may overwinter in rivers with the shortest migratory route to minimize the costs of migration in non-breeding years. Genome scans and genetic-environment associations identified 90 outlier markers putatively under selection, 23 of which were in or near a gene. Of these, at least four were involved in muscle and cardiac function, consistent with the hypothesis that migratory harshness could drive local adaptation. Our study illustrates the power of integrating genomics and telemetry to study migrations in non-model organisms in logistically challenging environments such as the Arctic.",

    "abstract": "Microbes form complex and dynamic ecosystems that play key roles in the health of the animals and plants with which they are associated. Such ecosystems are often represented by a directed, signed and weighted ecological network, where nodes represent microbial taxa and edges represent ecological interactions. Inferring the underlying ecological networks of microbial communities is a necessary step towards understanding their assembly rules and predicting their dynamical response to external stimuli. However, current methods for inferring such networks require assuming a particular population dynamics model, which is typically not known a priori. Moreover, those methods require fitting longitudinal abundance data, which is not readily available, and often does not contain the variation that is necessary for reliable inference. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a new method to map the ecological networks of microbial communities using steady-state data. Our method can qualitatively infer the inter-taxa interaction types or signs (positive, negative or neutral) without assuming any particular population dynamics model. Additionally, when the population dynamics is assumed to follow the classic Generalized Lotka-Volterra model, our method can quantitatively infer the inter-taxa interaction strengths and intrinsic growth rates. We systematically validate our method using simulated data, and then apply it to four experimental datasets of microbial communities. Our method offers a novel framework to infer microbial interactions and reconstruct ecological networks, and represents a key step towards reliable modeling of complex, real-world microbial communities, such as the human gut microbiota.",

Despite this, cancer microbiome studies have almost exclusively focused on bacteria instead of viruses. We began evaluating the cancer virome by focusing on colorectal cancer, a primary cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, and a cancer linked to altered colonic bacterial community compositions but with an unknown association with the gut virome. We used 16S rRNA gene, whole shotgun metagenomic, and purified virus metagenomic sequencing of stool to evaluate the differences in human colorectal cancer virus and bacterial community composition. Through random forest modeling we identified differences in the healthy and colorectal cancer virome. The cancer-associated virome consisted primarily of temperate bacteriophages that were also predicted to be bacteria-virus community network hubs. These results provide foundational evidence that bacteriophage communities are associated with colorectal cancer and potentially impact cancer progression by altering the bacterial host communities.",

When employing dual (or multi) laser exci-tation, smFRET allows resolving the number of fluorescent labels on each molecule, greatly enhancing the ability to study heterogeneous samples. A major drawback to solution-based smFRET is the low throughput, which renders repetitive measurements expensive and hin-ders the ability to study kinetic phenomena in real-time.\\n\\nHere we demonstrate a high-throughput smFRET system which multiplexes acquisition by using 48 excitation spots and two 48-pixel SPAD array detectors. The system employs two excitation lasers allowing separation of species with one or two active fluorophores. The performance of the system is demonstrated on a set of doubly-labeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides with different distances between donor and acceptor dyes along the DNA duplex. We show that the acquisition time for accurate subpopulation identification is reduced from several minutes to seconds, opening the way to high-throughput screening applications and real-time kinetics studies of enzymatic reactions such as DNA transcription by bacterial RNA polymerase.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomes are replete with repeated sequences, in the form of transposable elements (TEs) dispersed across the genome or as satellite arrays, large stretches of tandemly repeated sequence. Many satellites clearly originated as TEs, but it is unclear how mobile genetic parasites can transform into megabase-sized tandem arrays. Comprehensive population genomic sampling is needed to determine the frequency and generative mechanisms of tandem TEs, at all stages from their initial formation to their subsequent expansion and maintenance as satellites. The best available population resources, short-read DNA sequences, are often considered to be of limited utility for analyzing repetitive DNA due to the challenge of mapping individual repeats to unique genomic locations. Here we develop a new pipeline called ConTExt which demonstrates that paired-end Illumina data can be successfully leveraged to identify a wide range of structural variation within repetitive sequence, including tandem elements. Analyzing 85 genomes from five populations of Drosophila melanogaster we discover that TEs commonly form tandem dimers. Our results further suggest that insertion site preference is the major mechanism by which dimers arise and that, consequently, dimers form rapidly during periods of active transposition. This abundance of TE dimers has the potential to provide source material for future expansion into satellite arrays, and we discover one such copy number expansion of the DNA transposon Hobo to ~16 tandem copies in a single line. The very process that defines TEs --transposition-- thus regularly generates sequences from which new satellites can arise.",

Parentage and relatedness assays based on large numbers of SNP loci hold substantial advantages over the microsatellite markers traditionally used for these purposes. We present a double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) analysis pipeline that, as such, simultaneously achieves the SNP discovery and genotyping steps and which is optimized to return a statistically powerful set of SNP markers (typically 150-600 after stringent filtering) from large numbers of individuals (up to 240 per run). We explore the tradeoffs inherent in this approach through a set of experiments in a species with a complex social system, the variegated fairy-wren (Malurus lamberti), and further validate it in a phylogenetically broad set of other bird species. Through direct comparisons with a parallel dataset from a robust panel of highly variable microsatellite markers, we show that this ddRAD-seq approach results in substantially improved power to discriminate among potential relatives and considerably more precise estimates of relatedness coefficients. The pipeline is designed to be universally applicable to all bird species (and with minor modifications to many other taxa), to be cost- and time-efficient, and to be replicable across independent runs such that genotype data from different study periods can be combined and analyzed as field samples are accumulated.",

    "abstract": "The dominant social-evolutionary paradigm implicitly equates social actions and behaviors causing associations by extrapolating from models of social actions to explain behaviors affecting association. This extrapolation occurs when models of helping behavior are applied to explain aggregation or fusion, and when models of discriminatory helping behavior are applied to explain discriminatory segregation or discriminatory rejection. Here, I outline an alternative theoretical approach that explicitly distinguishes a social action as a helping or harming behavior, and an association as the context for a social action. Based on this distinction, I define a list of terms that allows a classification of association phenomena and the conceptual framework necessary to explain their evolution. I apply the resulting theory, which I call \\\"association theory,\\\" to identify a series of steps common to major and minor transitions in social evolution. These steps include the evolution of association, the evolution of differential treatment, the evolution of association preference, and the evolution of genetic kin recognition. I explain how to measure the parameters of association theory and I apply the theory to test Hamiltons rule. I evaluate the evidence for association theory, including how it resolves anomalies of a former paradigm. Finally, I discuss association theorys assumptions, and I explain why it may become the dominant framework for analyzing social evolution.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that motile cells can adapt their mode of propulsion to the mechanical properties of the environment in which they find themselves - crawling in some environments while swimming in others. The latter can involve movement by blebbing or other cyclic shape changes, and both highly-simplified and more realistic models of these modes have been studied previously. Herein we study swimming that is driven by membrane tension gradients that arise from flows in the actin cortex underlying the membrane, and does not involve imposed cyclic shape changes. Such gradients can lead to a number of different characteristic cell shapes, and our first objective is to understand how different distributions of membrane tension influence the shape of cells in a quiescent fluid. We then analyze the effects of spatial variation in other membrane properties, and how they interact with tension gradients to determine the shape. We also study the effect of fluid-cell interactions and show how tension leads to cell movement, how the balance between tension gradients and a variable bending modulus determine the shape and direction of movement, and how the efficiency of movement depends on the properties of the fluid and the distribution of tension and bending modulus in the membrane.\\n\\nDedicated to the memory of Karl P.

TM-JM dimerization plays a crucial role in regulation of EGFR kinase activity at the cytoplasmic side. Although the interaction of JM with membrane lipids is thought to be important to turn on EGF signaling and phosphorylation of Thr654 on JM leads to desensitization, the underlying kinetic mechanisms remain unclear. Especially, how Thr654 phosphorylation regulates EGFR activity is largely unknown. Here, combining single-pair FRET imaging and nanodisc techniques, we showed that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bis phosphate (PIP2) facilitated JM dimerization effectively. We also found that Thr654 phosphorylation dissociated JM dimers in the membranes containing acidic lipids, suggesting that Thr654 phosphorylation electrostatically prevented the interaction with basic residues in JM and acidic lipids. Based on the single-molecule experiment, we clarified the kinetic pathways of monomer (inactive state) - dimer (active state) transition of JM domains and alteration in the pathways depending on the membrane lipid species and Thr654 phosphorylation.",

In this Perspective, we explore properties of TWAS as a potential approach to prioritize causal genes, using simulations and case studies of literature-curated candidate causal genes for schizophrenia, LDL cholesterol and Crohns disease. We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene, as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some of which are unlikely to be causal, because they share the same variants as eQTLs. We illustrate that TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization when using expression data from tissues or cell types that are less related to the trait, due to substantial variation in both expression levels and eQTL strengths across cell types. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes at GWAS loci more accurately than simple baselines based on proximity to lead GWAS variant and expression in trait-related tissue. We discuss current strategies and future opportunities for improving the performance of TWAS for causal gene prioritization. Our results showcase the strengths and limitations of using expression variation across individuals to determine causal genes at GWAS loci and provide guidelines and best practices when using TWAS to prioritize candidate causal genes.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria and archaea destroy foreign nucleic acids by mounting an RNA-based CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune response1-3. In type I CRISPR-Cas systems, the most frequently found type of CRISPR in bacteria and archaea3,4, foreign DNAs that trigger efficient immunity can also provoke primed acquisition of protospacers into the CRISPR locus5-12. Both interference and primed acquisition require Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense) and the Cas3 helicase/nuclease. Primed acquisition also requires the Cas1-Cas2 integrase; however, the biophysical mechanisms of how interference and primed acquisition are coordinated have remained elusive. Here, we present single-molecule characterization of the type I-E Thermobifida fusca (Tfu) primed acquisition complex (PAC). TfuCascade rapidly samples non-specific DNA for its target via facilitated one-dimensional (1D) diffusion. An evolutionary-conserved positive patch on the Cse1 subunit increases the target recognition efficiency by promoting this 1D diffusion. Cas3 loads at target-bound Cascade and the Cascade/Cas3 complex initiates processive translocation via a looped DNA intermediate. Moving Cascade/Cas3 complexes stall and release the DNA loop at protein roadblocks. Cas1-Cas2 samples DNA transiently via 3D collisions, but stably associates with target-bound Cascade. Cas1-Cas2 also remains associated with translocating Cascade/Cas3, forming the PAC. By directly imaging all key subcomplexes involved in target recognition, interference, and primed acquisition, this work provides a molecular basis for the coordinated steps in CRISPR-based adaptive immunity.",

It remains elusive how kinesin-2 motors are regulated in vivo. Here we perform forward genetic screen to isolate suppressors that rescue the ciliary defects in the constitutive active mutation of OSM-3-kinesin (G444E) in C. elegans sensory neurons. We identify the C. elegans DYF-5 and DYF-18, which encode the homologs of mammalian male germ cell-associated kinase (MAK) and cell cycle-related kinase (CCRK). Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, we show that DYF-5 and DYF-18 are IFT cargo molecules and are enriched at the distal segments of sensory cilia. Mutations of dyf-5 and dyf-18 generate the elongated cilia and ectopic localization of kinesin-II at the ciliary distal segments. Genetic analyses reveal that dyf-5 and dyf-18 are also important for stabilizing the interaction between IFT particle and OSM-3-kinesin. Our data suggest that DYF-5 and DYF-18 act in the same pathway to promote handover between kinesin-II and OSM-3 in sensory cilia.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-specific differentiation and inflammatory programmes are thought to independently contribute to disease. The orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 is a key regulator of pancreas differentiation and SNPs in or near the human gene are associated with risk of pancreatic cancer. In mice, Nr5a2 heterozygosity sensitizes the pancreas to damage, impairs regeneration, and cooperates with mutant KRas in tumor progression. Through global transcriptomic analysis, we uncover a basal pre-inflammatory state in the pancreas of Nr5a2 heterozygous mice that is reminiscent of pancreatitis-induced inflammation and is conserved in histologically normal human pancreata with reduced NR5A2 mRNA expression. In Nr5a2+/- mice, Nr5a2 undergoes a dramatic transcriptional switch relocating from tissue-specific to inflammatory loci thereby promoting AP-1-dependent gene transcription. Importantly, deletion of c-Jun in the pancreas of these mice rescues the pre-inflammatory phenotype and the defective regenerative response to damage. These findings provide compelling evidence that the same transcriptional networks supporting homeostasis in normal tissue can be subverted to foster inflammation upon genetic or environmental constraints.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a high-risk malignancy due to its high capacity for invasion and lack of targeted therapy. Immunotherapy continues to demonstrate efficacy in a variety of cancers, and thus may be a promising strategy for TNBC given the limited therapeutic options currently available for TNBC. In this study, we performed a comprehensive portrait of immunologic landscape of TNBC based on 2 large-scale breast cancer genomic data.\\n\\nMethodsWe compared expression levels of immune-related genes and gene-sets among TNBC, non-TNBC, and normal tissue, and within TNBCs of different genotypic or phenotypic features. Moreover, we explored the association of immune-related genes or gene-sets expression and survival prognosis in TNBC patients.\\n\\nResultsWe found that almost all analyzed immune-related gene-sets had significantly higher expression levels in TNBC than non-TNBC. These highly expressed gene-sets in TNBC included 15 immune cell type and function, human leukocyte antigen (HLA), cancer testis (CT), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), immune cell infiltrate, regulatory T (Treg) cells, immune checkpoint, cytokine and cytokine receptor, metastasis-promoting, pro-inflammatory and parainflammation (PI) gene-sets. Moreover, TP53-mutated, TNBC had significantly higher expression levels of the immune checkpoint, Treg, PI, and CT gene-sets, and lower expression levels of the immune cell infiltrate gene-set than TP53-wildtype TNBC. Furthermore, we found that elevated expression of most of the immune-related genes in TNBC was associated with the ER-status, while some were associated with both ER-and HER2-status. Elevated expression of the immune-related genes in TNBC was also associated with the high tumor mutation burden (TMB) in TNBC. Finally, elevated expression of the immune-related gene-sets was likely to be associated with better survival prognosis in TNBC.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that TNBC is a breast cancer subtype with particularly strong immunogenicity, and therefore could be propitious to immunotherapeutic options.",

In the present study, we have investigated the effect of preovulatory aging on preimplantation embryos. Delaying ovulation with the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist Cetrorelix led to a decline in 2-cell rate from 76 to 46%. From control mice, an average of 17 embryos per mouse was retrieved. This number decreased to a mean of 5 embryos per mouse after preovulatory aging, suggesting that fertilization is impaired by aging. For analysis of zygotic genome activation, 2-cell embryos were incubated with BrUTP, which was incorporated into nascent RNA and detected by immunohistochemistry. A 2.85-fold increase in fluorescence intensity was detected after aging, pointing to a precocious activation of the genome. A possible effect of preovulatory aging on genomic imprint maintenance was investigated at the 8-cell stage. Deep amplicon bisulfite sequencing of Igf2r, Snrpn, H19 and Pou5f1 showed no significant changes between embryos derived from preovulatory-aged oocytes and control embryos, indicating stable imprint maintenance throughout epigenetic reprogramming.

    "abstract": "To compensate for accumulating damages and cell death, adult homeostasis (e.g., body fluids and secretion) requires organ regeneration, operated by long-lived stem cells. How stem cells can survive throughout the animal life yet remains poorly understood. Here we show that the transcription factor Shavenbaby (Svb, OvoL in vertebrates) is expressed in renal/nephric stem cells (RNSCs) of Drosophila and required for their maintenance during adulthood. As recently shown in embryos, Svb function in adult RNSCs further needs a post-translational processing mediated by Polished rice (Pri) smORF peptides and impairing Svb function leads to RNSC apoptosis. We show that Svb interacts both genetically and physically with Yorkie (YAP/TAZ in vertebrates), a nuclear effector of the Hippo pathway, to activate the expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis DIAP1. These data therefore identify Svb as a novel nuclear effector in the Hippo pathway, critical for the survival of adult somatic stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Integrin transmembrane heterodimeric receptors control a wide range of biological interactions by triggering the assembly of large multiprotein complexes at their cytoplasmic interface. A diverse set of methods have been used to investigate cytoplasmic interactions between integrins and intracellular proteins. These predominantly consist of peptide-based pull-downs and biochemical immuno-isolations from detergent-solubilized cell lysates. However, quantitative methods to probe integrin-protein interactions in a more biologically relevant context where the integrin is embedded within a lipid bilayer have been lacking. Here we describe a technique called ProLIF (Protein-Liposome Iinenteractions by Flow cytometry) to reconstitute recombinant integrin transmembrane domain (TMD) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) fragments on liposomes as individual  or {beta} subunits or as {beta} heterodimers and, using flow cytometry, to rapidly and quantitatively measure protein interactions with these membrane-embedded integrins. Importantly, the assay can analyse binding of fluorescent proteins directly from cell lysates without further purification steps. By combining integrins with membrane lipids to generate proteoliposomes, the effects of membrane composition such as PI(4,5)P2 presence on protein recruitment to the integrin CTs can be analyzed. ProLIF requires no specific instrumentation, apart from a standard flow cytometer and can be applied to measure a broad range of membrane-dependent protein-protein interactions with the potential for high-throughput/multiplex analyses.",

    "abstract": "N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (AAF) is a procarcinogen used widely in physiological investigations of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. Its metabolic pathways have been described extensively, yet little is known about its biochemical processing, growth cycle expression and pharmacological properties inside living hepatocytes - the principal cellular targets of this hepatocarcinogen. In this report, primary monolayer adult rat hepatocyte cultures and high specific-activity [ring G-3H]-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene were used to extend previous observations of metabolic activation of AAF by highly differentiated, proliferation-competent hepatocytes in long-term cultures. AAF metabolism proceeded by zero-order kinetics. Hepatocytes processed significant amounts of procarcinogen ({approx}12 g AAF/106 cells/day). Five ring-hydroxylated and one deacylated species of AAF were secreted into the culture media. Extracellular metabolite levels varied during the growth cycle (days 0-13), but their rank quantitative order was time invariant: 5-OH-AAF > 7-OH-AAF > 3-OH-AAF > N-OH-AAF > aminofluorene (AF) > 1-OH-AAF. Lineweaver-Burk analyses revealed two principal classes of metabolism: System I (high-affinity and low-velocity), Km[APPARENT] = 1.64 x 10-7 M and VMAX[APPARENT] = 0.1 nmols/106 cells/day; and, System II (low-affinity and high-velocity), Km[APPARENT] = 3.25 x 10-5 M and VMAX[APPARENT] = 1000 nmols/106 cells/day. A third system of metabolism of AAF to AF, with Km[APPARENT] and VMAX[APPARENT] constants of 9.6 x 10-5 M and 4.7 nmols/106 cells/day, was also observed. Evidence provided in this report and its companion paper suggests selective roles and intracellular locations for System I- and System II-mediated AAF metabolite formation during hepatocarcinogenesis, although some of the molecules and mechanisms responsible for multi-system processing remain to be fully defined.",

Two classes of growth cycle-dependent AAF metabolite binding sites - a high-affinity low-capacity site (designated Site I) and a low-affinity high-capacity site (designated Site II) - associated with two spatially distinct classes of macromolecular targets, were revealed. Based upon radiolabeled AAF metabolite binding to purified hepatocyte genomic DNA or to DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids from isolated nuclei, Site IDAY 4 targets (KD[APPARENT] {approx} 2-4 x 10-6 M and BMAX[APPARENT] {approx} 6 pmols/106 cells/24 h) were consistent with genomic DNA; and with AAF metabolized by a nuclear cytochrome P450. Based upon radiolabeled AAF binding to total cellular lysates, Site IIDAY 4 targets (KD[APPARENT] {approx} 1.5 x 10-3 M and BMAX[APPARENT] {approx} 350 pmols/106 cells/24 h) were consistent with cytoplasmic proteins; and with AAF metabolized by cytoplasmic cytochrome P450s. DNA synthesis was not inhibited by concentrations of AAF that saturated DNA binding in the neighborhood of the Site I KD. Instead, hepatocyte DNA synthesis inhibition required higher concentrations of AAF approaching the Site II KD. These observations raise the possibility that carcinogenic DNA adducts derived from AAF metabolites form below concentrations of AAF that inhibit replicative and repair DNA synthesis.",

Current tools such as XHMM for WES and CNVnator for WGS identify CNVs based on changes in read depth.

Here, we introduce a new method to identify deletion CNVs from WES and WGS trio data based on the clustering of Mendelian errors (MEs). Using our Mendelian Error Method (MEM), we identified 127 deletions (inherited and de novo) in 2,601 WES trios from the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium, with a validation rate of 88% by digital droplet PCR. MEM identified additional de novo deletions compared to XHMM, and also identified sample switches, DNA contamination, a significant enrichment of 15q11.2 deletions compared to controls and eight cases of uniparental disomy. We applied MEM to WGS data from the Genome In A Bottle Ashkenazi trio and identified deletions with 97% specificity. MEM provides a robust, computationally inexpensive method for identifying deletions, and an orthogonal approach for verifying deletions called by other tools.",

It is hypothesized that these risk variants alter gene expression. Thus, studying alterations in gene expression in schizophrenia may provide a direct approach to understanding the etiology of the disease. In this study we use Cultured Neural progenitor cells derived from Olfactory Neuroepithelium (CNON) as a genetically unaltered cellular model to elucidate the neurodevelopmental aspects of schizophrenia.\\n\\nMETHODSWe performed a gene expression study using RNA-Seq of CNON from 111 controls and 144 individuals with schizophrenia. Differentially expressed (DEX) genes were identified with DESeq2, using covariates to correct for sex, age, library batches and one surrogate variable component.\\n\\nRESULTS80 genes were DEX (FDR<10%), showing enrichment in cell migration, cell adhesion, developmental process, synapse assembly, cell proliferation and related gene ontology categories. Cadherin and Wnt signaling pathways were positive in overrepresentation test, and, in addition, many genes are specifically involved in Wnt5A signaling. The DEX genes were significantly, enriched in the genes overlapping SNPs with genome-wide significant association from the PGC GWAS of schizophrenia (PGC SCZ2). We also found substantial overlap with genes associated with other psychiatric disorders or brain development, enrichment in the same GO categories as genes with mutations de novo in schizophrenia, and studies of iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSCNON cells are a good model of the neurodevelopmental aspects of schizophrenia and can be used to elucidate the etiology of the disorder.",

Mutations in LMNA cause >12 diseases, termed laminopathies. Lamins A and C are identical for their first 566 residues. However, they form distinct filaments in vivo with apparently distinct roles. We report that lamin A is O-GlcNAc modified in human hepatoma (Huh7) cells and in mouse liver. In vitro assays with purified OGT enzyme showed robust O-GlcNAcylation of recombinant mature lamin A tails (residues 385-646), with no detectable modification of lamin B1, lamin C, or  progerin ({Delta}50) tails. Using mass spectrometry, we identified 11 O-GlcNAc sites in a  sweet spot unique to lamin A, with up to seven sugars per peptide. Most sites were unpredicted by current algorithms. Double-mutant (S612A/T643A) lamin A tails were still robustly O-GlcNAc-modified at seven sites. By contrast, O-GlcNAcylation was undetectable on tails bearing deletion {Delta}50, which causes Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, and greatly reduced by deletion {Delta}35, suggesting this region is required for substrate recognition or modification by OGT in vitro. These results suggest OGT, an essential protein and master regulator, regulates partners or function(s) unique to lamin A that are lost in progeria.",

FtsH, a bacterial membrane-anchored AAA+ protease, plays a vital role in membrane protein quality control. Although cytoplasmic structures are described, the full-length structure of bacterial FtsH is unknown, and the route by which substrates reach the central pore remains unclear. We use electron microscopy to determine the 3D map of the full-length Aquifex aeolicus FtsH hexamer. Moreover, detergent solubilisation induces the formation of fully active FtsH dodecamers, which consist of two FtsH hexamers in a single detergent micelle. FtsH structures reveal that the cytosolic domain can tilt with respect to the membrane. A flexible linker of ~20 residues between the second transmembrane helix and the cytosolic domain permits the observed large tilting movements, thereby facilitating the entry of substrate proteins towards the central pore for translocation.",

How cells tune the biophysical properties of septin filaments to control filament flexibility and length, and in turn the size, shape, and position of higher-order septin structures is not well understood. We examined how rod composition and nucleotide availability influence physical properties of septins such as annealing, fragmentation, bundling and bending. We found that septin complexes have symmetric termini, even when both Shs1 and Cdc11 are coexpressed. The relative proportion of Cdc11/Shs1 septin complexes controls the biophysical properties of filaments and influences the rate of annealing, fragmentation, and filament flexibility. Additionally, the presence and exchange of guanine nucleotide also alters filament length and bundling. An Shs1 mutant that is predicted to alter nucleotide hydrolysis has altered filament length and dynamics in cells and impacts cell morphogenesis. These data show that modulating filament properties through rod composition and nucleotide binding can control formation of septin assemblies that have distinct physical properties and functions.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation significantly impacts a species population dynamics as individuals choose others to associate with based upon fitness opportunities. Models of these dynamics typically assume that individuals can freely move between groups. Such an assumption works well for facultative co-operators (e.g. flocking birds, schooling fish, and swarming locusts) but less so for obligate co-operators (e.g. canids, cetaceans, and primates). With obligate co-operators, the fitness consequences from associations are stronger compared to facultative co-operators. Consequently, individuals within a group should be more discerning and selective over their associations, rejecting new members and even removing current members. Incorporating such aspects into population models may better reflect obligately cooperative species. In this paper, we create and analyze a model of the population dynamics of obligate co-operators. In our model, a behavioral game determines within-group population dynamics that then spill over into between-group dynamics. Our analysis shows that group number increases when population dynamics are stable, but additional groups lead to unstable population dynamics and an eventual collapse of group numbers. Using a more general analysis, we identify a fundamental mismatch between the stability of the behavioral dynamics and the stability of the population dynamics. When one is stable, the other is not. Our results suggest that group turnover may be inherent to the population dynamics of obligate co-operators. The instability arises from a non-chaotic deterministic process, and such dynamics should be predictable and testable.",

Inland terrestrial cyanolichens from Austria were also analysed as for the marine lichens to examine further the impact of habitat/lichen species on the associated bacterial communities. The L. confinis and L. pygmaea communities were significantly different from those of the maritime Xanthoria aureola lichen found higher up on the littoral zone and these latter communities were more similar to those of the inland terrestrial lichens. The strictly marine lichens were dominated by the Bacteroidetes phylum accounting for 50% of the sequences, whereas Alphaproteobacteria, notably Sphingomonas, dominated the maritime and the inland terrestrial lichens. Bacterial communities associated with the two Lichina species were significantly different sharing only 33 core OTUs, half of which were affiliated to the Bacteroidetes genera Rubricoccus, Tunicatimonas and Lewinella, suggesting an important role of these species in the marine Lichina lichen symbiosis. Marine cyanolichens showed a higher abundance of OTUs likely affiliated to moderately thermophilic and/or radiation resistant bacteria belonging to the Phyla Chloroflexi, Thermi, and the families Rhodothermaceae and Rubrobacteraceae when compared to those of inland terrestrial lichens.

    "abstract": "1. Estimating biodiversity and its changes in space and time poses serious methodological challenges. First, there has been a long debate on how to quantify biodiversity, and second, measurements of biodiversity change are scale-dependent. Therefore comparisons of biodiversity metrics between communities are ideally carried out across scales. Simulation can be used to study the utility of biodiversity metrics across scales, but most approaches are system specific and plagued by large parameter spaces and therefore cumbersome to use and interpret. However, realistic spatial biodiversity patterns can be generated without reference to ecological processes, which suggests a simple simulation framework could provide an important tool for ecologists.\\n\\n2. Here, we present the R package mobsim that allows users to simulate the abundances and the spatial distribution of individuals of different species. Users can define key properties of communities, including the total numbers of individuals and species, the relative abundance distribution, and the degree of spatial aggregation. Furthermore, the package provides functions that derive biodiversity patterns from simulated communities, or from observed data, as well as functions that simulate different sampling designs.\\n\\n3. We show several example applications of the package. First, we illustrate how species rarefaction and accumulation curves can be used to disentangle changes in the fundamental biodiversity components: (i) total abundance, (ii) relative abundance distribution, (iii) and species aggregation. Second, we demonstrate how mobsim can be used to assess the performance of species-richness estimators. The latter indicates how spatial aggregation challenges classical non-spatial species-richness estimators.\\n\\n4. mobsim allows the simulation and analysis of a large range of biodiversity scenarios and sampling designs in an efficient and comprehensive way. The simplicity and control provided by the package can also make it a useful didactic tool. The combination of controlled simulations and their analysis will facilitate a more rigorous interpretation of real world data that exhibit sampling effects and scale-dependence.",

The diets of herbivorous insects such as these are often enriched by obligate bacterial endosymbionts through nitrogen recycling and even gaseous di-nitrogen fixation. We, therefore, examine the bacterial communities associated with mutualistic acacia-ants, comparing them with related non-mutualists in order to determine whether they host bacterial partners likely to contribute to the enrichment of their diets. However, despite their low trophic position, we find no evidence for bacteria-assisted nutrition in either adults or larvae. These acacia-ants do not host any species- or clade-specific bacteria, though several lineages of acetic acid bacteria present across social insects do differ in abundance between mutualists and non-mutualists, likely in response to the sugar-rich diets of their hosts. In addition, two novel lineages of Actinomycetales inhabit both mutualistic and non-mutualistic Pseudomyrmex and differ in abundance between the juveniles of these groups, potentially serving as defensive symbionts. Metagenomic sequencing of these taxa reveal substantial capacity for the production of defensive chemicals. Overall, we find little evidence for nutrition-associated bacteria in these strictly herbivorous ants, showing that bacteria are not as essential to animal nutrition as is often hypothesized.",

There is much evidence that the probability of host-shifts decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance between donor and recipient hosts, but the consequences of such preferential host switching remain little explored. We develop a mathematical model to investigate the dynamics of parasite host-shifts in the presence of this phylogenetic distance effect. Host trees evolve under a stochastic birth-death process and parasites co-evolve concurrently on those trees, undergoing host-shifts, co-speciation and extinction. Our model indicates that host trees have a major influence on these dynamics. This applies both to individual trees that evolved under the same stochastic process and to sets of trees that evolved with different macroevolutionary parameters. We predict that trees consisting of a few large clades of host species and those with fast species turnover should harbour more parasites than trees with many small clades and those that diversify more slowly. Within trees, large clades should exhibit a higher infection frequency than small clades. We discuss our results in the light of recent cophylogenetic studies in a wide range of host-parasite systems, including the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia.",

    "abstract": "Genetic effects are often context dependent, with the same genotype differentially affecting phenotypes across environments, life stages, and sexes. We used an environmental manipulation designed to increase energy demand during development to investigate energy demand as a general physiological explanation for context-dependent effects of mutations, particularly for those mutations that affect metabolism. We found that increasing the photoperiod during which Drosophila larvae are active during development phenocopies a temperature-dependent developmental delay in a mitochondrial-nuclear genotype with disrupted metabolism. This result indicates that the context-dependent fitness effects of this genotype are not specific to the effects of temperature and may generally result from variation in energy demand. The effects of this genotype also differ across life stages and between the sexes. The mitochondrial-nuclear genetic interaction disrupts metabolic rate in growing larvae, but not in adults, and compromises female, but not male, reproductive fitness. These patterns are consistent with a model where context-dependent genotype-phenotype relationships may generally arise from differences in energy demand experienced by individuals across environments, life stages, and sexes.\\n\\nIMPACT SUMMARYGenetic effects on traits are often context dependent, such that a genotype that improves fitness under one context may have no effect or even a deleterious effect in another context. The external environment is a common context that affects the degree to which a genotype determines a phenotype, but the internal environment of an organism (e.g., its genetic background, sex or life stage) also provides an important context that may modify the phenotypic expression of a genotype. Here we combine new data on the phenotypic effects of a well-characterized genetic interaction between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of the fruit fly Drosophila with prior observations to support a model of energy demand as a general explanation for context-dependent genetic effects, particularly for mutations that affect metabolism. We show that the magnitude of fitness effects of this genetic interaction correlates positively with the degree of energy demand among developmental treatments that accelerate growth rate, across developmental stages that differ in the cost of growth, and between sexes with potentially different costs of reproduction. These internal and external contexts create variable demands on energy metabolism that will impact the efficacy of natural selection acting on metabolic mutations in populations.",

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid discovery of genes for rare genetic disorders, we continue to encounter individuals presenting with hitherto unknown syndromic manifestations. Here, we have studied four affected people in three families presenting with cholestasis, congenital diarrhea, impaired hearing and bone fragility, a clinical entity we have termed O2HE (Osteo-Oto-Hepato-enteric) syndrome. Whole exome sequencing of all affected individuals and their parents identified biallelic mutations in Unc-45 Myosin Chaperone A (UNC45A), as a likely driver for this disorder. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo functional studies of the candidate gene indicated a loss of function paradigm, wherein mutations attenuated or abolished protein activity with concomitant defects in gut development and function.",

    "abstract": "The fungal pathogen Phellinus noxius is the underlying cause of brown root rot, a disease with causing tree mortality globally, causing extensive damage in urban areas and crop plants. This disease currently has no cure, and despite the global epidemic, little is known about the pathogenesis and virulence of this pathogen.\\n\\nUsing Ion Torrent PGM, Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RSII sequencing platforms with various genome assembly methods, we produced the draft genome sequences of four P. noxius strains isolated from infected trees in Hong Kong to further understand the pathogen and identify the mechanisms behind the aggressive nature and virulence of this fungus. The resulting genomes ranged from 30.8Mb to 31.8Mb in size, and of the four sequences, the YTM97 strain was chosen to produce a high-quality Hong Kong strain genome sequence, resulting in a 31Mb final assembly with 457 scaffolds, an N50 length of 275,889 bp and 96.2% genome completeness. RNA-seq of YTM97 using Illumina HiSeq400 was performed for improved gene prediction. AUGUSTUS and Genemark-ES prediction programs predicted 9,887 protein-coding genes which were annotated using GO and Pfam databases. The encoded carbohydrate active enzymes revealed large numbers of lignolytic enzymes present, comparable to those of other white-rot plant pathogens. In addition, P. noxius also possessed larger numbers of cellulose, xylan and hemicellulose degrading enzymes than other plant pathogens. Searches for virulence genes was also performed using PHI-Base and DFVF databases revealing a host of virulence-related genes and effectors. The combination of non-specific host range, unique carbohydrate active enzyme profile and large amount of putative virulence genes could explain the reasons behind the aggressive nature and increased virulence of this plant pathogen.\\n\\nThe draft genome sequences presented here will provide references for strains found in Hong Kong. Together with emerging research, this information could be used for genetic diversity and epidemiology research on a global scale as well as expediting our efforts towards discovering the mechanisms of pathogenicity of this devastating pathogen.",

    "abstract": "To transmit information efficiently in a changing environment, the retina adapts to visual contrast by adjusting its gain, latency and mean response. Additionally, the temporal frequency selectivity, or bandwidth changes to encode the absolute intensity when the stimulus environment is noisy, and intensity differences when noise is low. We show that the On pathway of On-Off retinal amacrine and ganglion cells is required to change temporal bandwidth but not other adaptive properties. This remarkably specific adaptive mechanism arises from differential effects of contrast on the On and Off pathways. We analyzed a biophysical model fit only to a cell's membrane potential, and verified pharmacologically that it accurately revealed the two pathways. We conclude that changes in bandwidth arise mostly from differences in synaptic threshold in the two pathways, rather than differences in synaptic release dynamics. Different efficient codes are selected by different thresholds in two independently adapting neural pathways.",

    "abstract": "A new class of regulatory elements called super-enhancers, comprised of multiple neighboring enhancers, have recently been reported to be the key transcriptional drivers of cellular, developmental, and disease states. Here, we propose to define super-enhancer RNA as highly expressed enhancer RNAs that are transcribed from a cluster of localized genomic regions. Using the cap analysis of gene expression sequencing data from FANTOM5, we systematically explored the enhancer and messenger RNA landscapes in hundreds of different cell types in response to various environments. Applying non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to super-enhancer RNA profiles, we found that different cell types were well classified. In addition, through the NMF of individual time-course profiles from a single cell-type, super-enhancer RNAs were clustered into several states with progressive patterns. We further investigated the enriched biological functions of the proximal genes involved in each pattern, and found that they were associated with the corresponding developmental process. The proposed super-enhancer RNAs can act as a good alternative, without the complicated measurement of histone modifications, for identifying important regulatory elements of cell type specification and identifying dynamic cell states.",

The objective of this research is to enhance the growth and reproductive performance in the test fish, red eyed orange molly (Poecilia sphenops) exposed to standardized manipulated photoperiod. In present study, growth and gonadal development of the test fish with an average initial weight (0.52g) and an average total length (3.2cm) exposed to two photoperiods (18L:6D and 10L:14D) at constant light intensity (1500 lx) for a period of 60 days was investigated. The fish were fed with formulated feed twice a day as per 10% of body weight. During a long day photoperiod (18L:6D) significant increase in growth parameters such as, weight gain (2.2 {+/-} 0.04), feed conversion ratio (8.9 {+/-} 0.004) and specific growth rate (1.2 {+/-} 0% day-1) was observed. Mean gonadosomatic index (GSI) in female (30.4{+/-} 0.11) and male fish (2.0 {+/-} 0.17) was also significantly higher in long-day photoperiod followed by short day photoperiod (10L:14D). The results confirm that manipulated long-day photoperiod induced somatic growth and enhanced gonadal development in P. sphenops without causing any stress.\\n\\nSummaryThis work is novel to research field since photoperiodic effect on Poecilia sphenops, a live-bearer fish under artificial environmental conditions resulted in enhanced growth and reproductive performance with fry production.",

    "abstract": "The phylogeny, biogeography and taxonomy of the alopiine clausiliids of the Sicilian Channel, belonging to the genera Lampedusa and Muticaria, were investigated using morphological (shell characters and anatomy of the reproductive system) and genetic (sequencing of a fragment of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit 16S rRNA, and the nuclear internal transcriber spacer 1, ITS-1 rRNA) data. Classically, the genus Lampedusa includes three species: L. imitatrix and L. melitensis occurring in circumscribed localities in western Malta and on the islet of Filfla, and L. lopadusae on Lampedusa and Lampione. The genus Muticaria includes two species in southeastern Sicily (M. siracusana and M. neuteboomi) and one in the Maltese islands (M. macrostoma), which is usually subdivided into four entities based on shell characters (macrostoma on Gozo, Comino, Cominotto and central-eastern Malta; mamotica in southeastern Gozo; oscitans on Gozo and central-western Malta; scalaris in northwestern Malta). These have sometimes been considered as subspecies and sometimes as mere morphs.\\n\\nThe Lampedusa of Lampedusa and Lampione form a well distinct clade from those of the Maltese Islands. The population of Lampione islet is a genetically distinct geographic form that deserves formal taxonomic recognition (as L. nodulosa or L. l. nodulosa). The Lampedusa of Malta are morphologically distinct evolutionary lineages with high levels of genetic divergence and are confirmed as distinct species (L. imitatrix and L. melitensis).\\n\\nThe Muticaria constitute a clearly different monophyletic clade divided into three geographical lineages corresponding to the Sicilian, Maltese and Gozitan populations. The Sicilian Muticaria form two morphologically and genetically distinguishable subclades that may either be considered subspecies of a polytypic species, or two distinct species. The relationships of Maltese and Gozitan Muticaria are complex. Two of the three Maltese morphotypes resulted monophyletic (oscitans and scalaris) while the other was separated in two lineages (macrostoma); however this picture may be biased as only few samples of macrostoma were available to study. The Gozitan morphotypes (macrostoma, mamotica and oscitans) where resolved as polyphyletic but with clear molecular evidence of mixing in some cases, indicating possible relatively recent differentiation of the Gozitan Muticaria or repetitive secondary contacts between different morphotypes. Definitive taxonomic conclusions from these results are premature. Maltese Muticaria could be subdivided into three taxa according to morphological and molecular data (M. macrostoma or M. m. macrostoma, M. oscitans or M. m. oscitans and M. scalaris or M. m scalaris). Gozitan Muticaria could be considered a distinct polytypic species (for which the oldest available name is Muticaria mamotica) subdivided into subspecies showing a morphological range from macrostoma-like to mamotica-like and oscitans like.\\n\\nOnly the two Maltese species of Lampedusa are legally protected (by the European Unions  Habitats Directive and Maltese national legislation). The present study has shown that the alopiine clausiliids of the Sicilian Channel constitute a number of genetically and/or morphologically distinct populations that represent important pools of genetic diversity, with, in some cases, a very circumscribed distribution. As such, these populations deserve legal protection and management. It is argued that without formal taxonomic designation, it would be difficult to extend international legal protection to some of the more threatened of these populations.",

How cells tune the biophysical properties of septin filaments to control filament flexibility and length, and in turn the size, shape, and position of higher-order septin structures is not well understood. We examined how rod composition and nucleotide availability influence physical properties of septins such as annealing, fragmentation, bundling and bending. We found that septin complexes have symmetric termini, even when both Shs1 and Cdc11 are coexpressed. The relative proportion of Cdc11/Shs1 septin complexes controls the biophysical properties of filaments and influences the rate of annealing, fragmentation, and filament flexibility. Additionally, the presence and exchange of guanine nucleotide also alters filament length and bundling. An Shs1 mutant that is predicted to alter nucleotide hydrolysis has altered filament length and dynamics in cells and impacts cell morphogenesis. These data show that modulating filament properties through rod composition and nucleotide binding can control formation of septin assemblies that have distinct physical properties and functions.",

In a zebrafish mutagenesis screen to identify genes essential for heart development we identified a zebrafish mutant, which disrupts the gene encoding the RNA helicase DEAD-box 39a (ddx39a).Homozygous ddx39a mutant embryos exhibit profound cardiac and trunk muscle dystrophy, along with lens abnormalities caused by abrupt terminal differentiation of cardiomyocyte, myoblast and lens fiber cells. Further investigation indicated that loss of ddx39a hindered mRNA splicing of members of the kmt2 gene family, leading to mis-regulation of structural gene expression in cardiomyocyte, myoblast and lens fiber cells. Taken together, these results show that Ddx39a plays an essential role in establishment of proper epigenetic status during cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The cell division rate, size, and gene expression programmes change in response to external conditions. These global changes impact on average concentrations of biomolecule and their variability or noise. Gene expression is inherently stochastic, and noise levels of individual proteins depend on synthesis and degradation rates as well as on cell-cycle dynamics. We have modelled stochastic gene expression inside growing and dividing cells to study the effect of division rates on noise in mRNA and protein expression. We use assumptions and parameters relevant to Escherichia coli, for which abundant quantitative data are available. We find that coupling of transcription, but not translation rates to the rate of cell division can result in protein concentration and noise homeostasis across conditions. Interestingly, we find that the increased cell size at fast division rates, observed in E. coli d other unicellular organisms, buffers noise levels even for proteins with decreased expression at faster growth. We then investigate the functional importance of these regulations using gene regulatory networks that exhibit bi-stability and oscillations. We find that network topology affects robustness to changes in division rate in complex and unexpected ways. In particular, a simple model of persistence, based on global physiological feedback, predicts increased proportion of persistors cells at slow division rates. Altogether, our study reveals how cell size regulation in response to cell division rate could help controlling gene expression noise. It also highlights that understanding of circuits robustness across growth conditions is key for the effective design of synthetic biological systems.",

We demonstrate their superior performance in Western Blotting, both in peroxidase- and fluorophore-linked form. Their site-specific labeling with multiple fluorophores creates bright imaging reagents for confocal and super-resolution microscopy with much smaller label displacement than traditional secondary antibodies.

How DDR pathways in irradiated cells stimulate BE in non-targeted cells is mostly unknown. We show here that extracellular vesicles from irradiated cells (EV-IR) induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage when internalized by un-irradiated cells. We found that EV-IR from Abl-NLS-mutated cells could not induce ROS or DNA damage, and restoration of nuclear Abl rescued those defects. Expanding a previous finding that Abl stimulates miR-34c expression, we show here that nuclear Abl also drives the vesicular secretion of miR-34c. Ectopic miR-34c expression, without irradiation, generated EV-miR-34c capable of inducing ROS and DNA damage. Furthermore, EV-IR from miR34-knockout cells could not induce ROS and raised {gamma}H2AX to lesser extent than EV-IR from miR34-wild type cells. These results establish a novel role for the Abl-miR-34c DDR pathway in stimulating radiation-induced bystander effects.",

In morphological datasets, the problem results in characters that cannot be applied to certain terminal taxa, with this inapplicability treated as \\\"missing data\\\" in a popular method of character coding. However, this treatment is known to create spurious tree length estimates on certain topologies, potentially leading to erroneous results in phylogenetic searches. Here we present a single-character algorithm for ancestral states reconstruction in datasets that have been coded using reductive coding. The algorithm uses up to four traversals on a tree to resolve final ancestral states - which are required in full before a tree can be scored. The algorithm employs explicit criteria for the resolution of ambiguity in applicable/inapplicable dichotomies and the optimization of missing data. We score trees following a previously published procedure that minimizes homoplasy over all characters. Our analysis of published datasets shows that, compared to traditional methods, our new method identifies different trees as \\\"optimal\\\"; as such, correcting for inapplicable data may significantly alter the outcome of tree searches.",

Genome-wide significant associations were found between TA and DUSP10 rs6687758 (P=1.25 x 10-9) and ATF1 rs11169552 (P=4.36 x 10-10), with strong association found with CASC8 rs10505477 (P=8.2 x 10-5). Additional CRC marker haplotypes were also significantly associated with TA (P<0.0002). Genotyping an independent dataset consisting of 52 cases with TA and 427 controls confirmed the association with CASC8.\\n\\nAtf1 and Dusp10 expression was detected in the mouse developing teeth from early bud stages to the formation of the complete tooth, suggesting a potential role for these genes and their encoded proteins in tooth development. Our findings suggest Atf1 and Dusp10 as new tooth development genes, while having a role in colorectal cancer. While their individual contributions in tooth development remain to be elucidated, these genes may be considered additional candidates to be tested in future human genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBread wheat has a large complex genome that makes whole genome resequencing costly. Therefore, genome complexity reduction techniques such as sequence capture make re-sequencing cost effective. With a high-quality draft wheat genome now available it is possible to design capture probe sets and to use them to accurately genotype and anchor SNPs to the genome. Furthermore, in addition to genetic variation, epigenetic variation provides a source of natural variation contributing to changes in gene expression and phenotype that can be profiled at the base pair level using sequence capture coupled with bisulphite treatment. Here, we present a new 12 Mbp wheat capture probe set, that allows both the profiling of genotype and methylation from the same DNA sample. Furthermore, we present a method, based on Agilent SureSelect Methyl-Seq, that will use a single capture assay as a starting point to allow both DNA sequencing and methyl-seq.\\n\\nResultsOur method uses a single capture assay that is sequentially split and used for both DNA sequencing and methyl-seq. The resultant genotype and epi-type data is highly comparable in terms of coverage and SNP/methylation site identification to that generated from separate captures for DNA sequencing and methyl-seq. Furthermore, by defining SNP frequencies in a diverse landrace from the Watkins collection we highlight the importance of having genotype data to prevent false positive methylation calls. Finally, we present the design of a new 12 Mbp wheat capture and demonstrate its successful application to re-sequence wheat.\\n\\nConclusionWe present a cost-effective method for performing both DNA sequencing and methyl-seq from a single capture reaction thus reducing reagent costs, sample preparation time and DNA requirements for these complementary analyses.",

    "abstract": "Advances in proteomics reveal that pathway databases fail to capture the majority of cellular signaling activity. Our mass spectrometry study of the dynamic epidermal growth factor (EGF) response demonstrates that over 89% of significantly (de)phosphorylated proteins are excluded from individual EGF signaling maps, and 63% are absent from all annotated pathways. We present a computational method, the Temporal Pathway Synthesizer (TPS), to discover missing pathway elements by modeling temporal phosphoproteomic data. TPS uses constraint solving to exhaustively explore all possible structures for a signaling pathway, eliminating structures that are inconsistent with protein-protein interactions or the observed phosphorylation event timing. Applied to our EGF response data, TPS connects 83% of the responding proteins to receptors and signaling proteins in EGF pathway maps. Inhibiting predicted active kinases supports the TPS pathway model. The TPS algorithm is broadly applicable and also recovers an accurate model of the yeast osmotic stress response.",

    "abstract": "Long read sequencing technologies are the ultimate solution for genome repeats, allowing near reference level reconstructions of large genomes. However, long read de novo assembly pipelines are computationally intense and require a considerable amount of coverage, thereby hindering their broad application to the assembly of large genomes. Alternatively, hybrid assembly methods which combine short and long read sequencing technologies can reduce the time and cost required to produce de novo assemblies of large genomes. In this paper, we propose a new method, called FAST-SG, which uses a new ultra-fast alignment-free algorithm specifically designed for constructing a scaffolding graph using light-weight data structures. FAST-SG can construct the graph from either short or long reads. This allows the reuse of efficient algorithms designed for short read data and permits the definition of novel modular hybrid assembly pipelines. Using comprehensive standard datasets and benchmarks, we show how FAST-SG outperforms the state-of-the-art short read aligners when building the scaffolding graph, and can be used to extract linking information from either raw or error-corrected long reads. We also show how a hybrid assembly approach using FAST-SG with shallow long read coverage (5X) and moderate computational resources can produce long-range and accurate reconstructions of the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana (Ler-0) and human (NA12878).",

    "abstract": "The complex cardiovascular disorder Cantu Syndrome arises from gain-of-function mutations in either KCNJ8 or ABCC9, the genes encoding the Kir6.1 and SUR2 subunits of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. Recent reports indicate that such mutations can increase channel activity by multiple molecular mechanisms. In this study, we determine the mechanism by which KATP function is altered by several mutations in distinct structural domains of SUR2: D207E in the intracellular L0-linker and Y985S, G989E, M1060I, and R1154Q/W in TMD2. Mutations were engineered at their equivalent position in rat SUR2A (D207E, Y981S, G985E, M1056I and R1150Q/W) and functional effects were investigated using macroscopic rubidium (86Rb+) efflux assays and patch clamp electrophysiology. The results show that D207E increases KATP activity by increasing intrinsic stability of the open state, whilst the cluster of Y981S/G985E/M1056I mutations, as well as R1150Q/W, augment Mg-nucleotide activation. The response of mutant channels to inhibition by the sulfonylurea drug glibenclamide, a potential pharmacotherapy for CS, was also tested. There was no major effect on glibenclamide sensitivity for the D207E, Y981S, G985E or M1056I mutations, but glutamine and tryptophan substitution at R1150 resulted in significant decreases in potency.",

    "abstract": "The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) has made major advances in the molecular etiology of MDD, confirming that MDD is highly polygenic, with any top risk loci conferring a very small proportion of variance in case-control status (1). Pathway enrichment results from PGC meta-analyses can also be used to help inform molecular drug targets. Prior to any knowledge of molecular biomarkers for MDD, drugs targeting molecular pathways have proved successful in treating MDD. However, it is possible that with information from PGC analyses, examining specific molecular pathway(s) implicated in MDD can further inform our study of molecular drug targets. Using a large case-control GWAS based on low-coverage whole genome sequencing (N = 10,640), we derived polygenic risk scores for MDD and for MDD specific to each of over 300 molecular pathways. We then used these data to identify sets of scores significantly predictive of case status, accounting for critical covariates. Over and above global polygenic risk for MDD, polygenic risk within the GO: 17144 drug metabolism pathway significantly predicted recurrent depression. In transcriptomic analyses, two pathway genes yielded suggestive signals at FDR q-values = .054: CYP2C19 (family of Cytochrome P450) and CBR1 (Carbonyl Reductase 1). Because the neuroleptic carbamazepine is a known inducer of CYP2C19, future research might examine whether drug metabolism PRS has any influence on clinical presentation and treatment response. Overall, results indicate that pathway-based risk might inform treatment of severe depression. We discuss limitations to the generalizability of these preliminary findings, and urge replication in future research.",

Here, we exploit the long-read sequencing capability of the nanopore platform using our customized pipeline, Picky, to reveal SVs of diverse architecture in a breast cancer model. From modest sequencing coverage, we identified the full spectrum of SVs with superior specificity and sensitivity relative to short-read analyses and uncovered repetitive DNA as the major source of variation. Examination of the genome-wide breakpoints at nucleotide-resolution uncovered micro-insertions as the common structural features associated with SVs. Breakpoint density across the genome is associated with propensity for inter-chromosomal connectivity and transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, an over-representation of reciprocal translocations from chromosomal double-crossovers was observed through phased SVs. The comprehensive characterization of SVs using the robust long-read sequencing approach in cancer cohorts will facilitate strategies to monitor genome stability during tumor evolution and improve therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "The limited supply of fossil fuels and the establishment of new environmental policies shifted research in industry and academia towards sustainable production of the 2nd generation of biofuels, with Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK) being one promising fuel candidate. MEK is a commercially valuable petrochemical with an extensive application as a solvent. However, as of today, a sustainable and economically viable production of MEK has not yet been achieved despite several attempts of introducing biosynthetic pathways in industrial microorganisms. We used BNICE.ch as a retrobiosynthesis tool to discover all novel pathways around MEK. Out of 1325 identified compounds connecting to MEK with one reaction step, we selected 3-oxopentanoate, but-3-en-2-one, but-1-en-2-olate, butylamine, and 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-butanenitrile for further study. We reconstructed 3679610 novel biosynthetic pathways towards these 5 compounds. We then embedded these pathways into the genome-scale model of E. coli, and a set of 18622 were found to be most biologically feasible ones based on thermodynamics and their yields. For each novel reaction in the viable pathways, we proposed the most similar KEGG reactions, with their gene and protein sequences, as candidates for either a direct experimental implementation or as a basis for enzyme engineering. Through pathway similarity analysis we classified the pathways and identified the enzymes and precursors that were indispensable for the production of the target molecules. These retrobiosynthesis studies demonstrate the potential of BNICE.ch for discovery, systematic evaluation, and analysis of novel pathways in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering studies.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=76 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/209569_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (27K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15bb5corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bfc12borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1230500org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d74d2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Network biology aims to understand cell behavior through the analysis of underlying complex biomolecular networks. Inference of condition-specific interaction networks from epigenomic data enables the characterization of the structural plasticity that regulatory networks can acquire in different tissues of the same organism. From this perspective, uncovering specific patterns of variation by comparing network structure among tissues could provide insights into systems-level mechanisms underlying cell behavior. Following this idea, here we propose an empirical framework to analyze mammalian tissue-specific networks, focusing on characterizing and contrasting their structure and behavior in response to perturbations. We structurally represent the state of the cell/tissue by condition specific transcription factor networks generated using chromatin accessibility data, and we profile their systems behavior in terms of the structural robustness against random and directed perturbations. Using this framework, we unveil the structural heterogeneity existing among tissues at different levels of differentiation. We uncover a novel and conserved systems property of regulatory networks underlying embryonic stem cells (ESCs): in contrast to terminally differentiated tissues, the promiscuous regulatory connectivity of ESCs produces a globally homogeneous network resulting in increased structural robustness. Possible biological consequences of this property are discussed.",
