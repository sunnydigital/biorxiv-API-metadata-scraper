    "abstract": "Human-pathogenic bacteria are found in a variety of niches, including free-living, zoonotic, and microbiome environments. Identifying bacterial adaptions that enable invasive disease is an important means of gaining insight into the molecular basis of pathogenesis and understanding pathogen emergence. Staphylococcus saprophyticus, a leading cause of urinary tract infections, can be found in the environment, food, animals, and the human microbiome. We identified a selective sweep in the gene encoding the Aas adhesin, a key virulence factor that binds host fibronectin. We hypothesize that the mutation under selection (aas_2206A>C) facilitates colonization of the urinary tract, an environment where bacteria are subject to strong shearing forces. The mutation appears to have enabled emergence and expansion of a human pathogenic lineage of S. saprophyticus. These results demonstrate the power of evolutionary genomic approaches in discovering the genetic basis of virulence and emphasize the pleiotropy and adaptability of bacteria occupying diverse niches.\\n\\nImportanceStaphylococcus saprophyticus is an important cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) in women, which are common, can be severe, and are associated with significant impacts to public health. In addition to being a cause of human UTI, S. saprophyticus can be found in the environment, in food, and associated with animals. After discovering that UTI strains of S. saprophyticus are for the most part closely related to each other, we sought to determine whether these strains are specially adapted to cause disease in humans. We found evidence suggesting that a mutation in the gene aas is advantageous in the context of human infection. We hypothesize that the mutation allows S. saprophyticus to survive better in the human urinary tract. These results show how bacteria found in the environment can evolve to cause disease.",

    "abstract": "Although widely cited as strong evidence that sexual selection has shaped human facial attractiveness judgments, evidence that preferences for masculine characteristics in mens faces are related to womens hormonal status is equivocal and controversial. Consequently, we conducted the largest ever longitudinal study of the hormonal correlates of womens preferences for facial masculinity (N=584). Analyses showed no compelling evidence that preferences for facial masculinity were related to changes in womens salivary steroid hormone levels. Furthermore, both within-subject and between-subject comparisons showed no evidence that oral contraceptive use decreased masculinity preferences. However, women generally preferred masculinized over feminized versions of mens faces, particularly when assessing mens attractiveness for short-term, rather than long-term, relationships. Our results do not support the hypothesized link between womens preferences for facial masculinity and their hormonal status.",

    "abstract": "The placement of angiosperms and Gnetales in seed plant phylogeny remains one of the most enigmatic problems in plant evolution, with morphological analyses (which have usually included fossils) and molecular analyses pointing to very distinct topologies. Almost all morphology-based phylogenies group angiosperms with Gnetales and certain extinct seed plant lineages, while most molecular phylogenies link Gnetales with conifers. In this study, we investigate the phylogenetic signal present in published seed plant morphological datasets. We use parsimony, Bayesian inference, and maximum likelihood approaches, combined with a number of experiments with the data, to address the morphological-molecular conflict. First, we ask whether the lack of association of Gnetales with conifers in morphological analyses is due to an absence of signal or to the presence of competing signals, and second, we compare the performance of parsimony and model based approaches with morphological datasets. Our results imply that the grouping of Gnetales and angiosperms is largely the result of long branch attraction, consistent across a range of methodological approaches. Thus, there is a signal for the grouping of Gnetales with conifers in morphological matrices, but it was swamped by convergence between angiosperms and Gnetales, both situated on long branches. However, this effect becomes weaker in more recent analyses, as a result of addition and critical reassessment of characters. Even when a clade including angiosperms and Gnetales is still weakly supported by parsimony, model-based approaches favor a clade of Gnetales and conifers, presumably because they are more resistant to long branch attraction. Inclusion of fossil taxa weakens rather than strengthens support for a relationship of angiosperms and Gnetales. Our analyses finally reconcile morphology with molecules in favoring a relationship of Gnetales to conifers, and show that morphology may therefore be useful in reconstructing other aspects of the phylogenetic history of the seed plants.",

    "abstract": "The FrzCD chemoreceptor from the gliding bacterium Myxococcus xanthus forms cytoplasmic clusters that occupy a large central region of the cell body also occupied by the nucleoid. In this work, we show that FrzCD directly binds to the nucleoid with its N-terminal positively charged tail and recruits active signaling complexes at this location. The FrzCD binding to the nucleoid occur in a DNA-sequence independent manner and leads to the formation of multiple distributed clusters that explore constrained areas. This organization might be required for cooperative interactions between clustered receptors as observed in membrane-bound chemosensory arrays.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn this work, we show that the cytoplasmic chemoreceptor of the Frz chemosensory system, FrzCD, does not bind the cytoplasmic membrane like most MCPs but bind the bacterial nucleoid directly, thus forming distributed protein clusters also containing the Frz kinase. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that DNA-binding is not sequence-specific and is mediated by a basic aminoacid sequence of the FrzCD N-terminal domain. The deletion of this motif abolishes FrzCD DNA-binding and cooperativity in the response to signals. This work shows the importance of the nucleoid in the organization and functioning of cytoplasmic signaling systems in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Convolutionary neural network (CNN) is a popular choice for supervised DNA motif prediction due to its excellent performances. To employ CNN, the input DNA sequences are required to be encoded as numerical values and represented as either vectors or multi-dimensional matrices. This paper evaluates a simple and more compact ordinal encoding method versus the popular one-hot encoding for DNA sequences. We compare the performances of both encoding methods using three sets of datasets enriched with DNA motifs. We found that the ordinal encoding performs comparable to the one-hot method but with significant reduction in training time. In addition, the one-hot encoding performances are rather consistent across various datasets but would require suitable CNN configuration to perform well. The ordinal encoding with matrix representation performs best in some of the evaluated datasets. This study implies that the performances of CNN for DNA motif discovery depends on the suitable design of the sequence encoding and representation. The good performances of the ordinal encoding method demonstrates that there are still rooms for improvement for the one-hot encoding method.",

    "abstract": "Associative learning requires mapping between complex stimuli and behavioural responses. When multiple stimuli are involved, conditional associative learning is a gradual process with learning based on trial and error. It is established that a distributed network of regions track associative learning, however the role of neural oscillations in human learning remains less clear. Here we used scalp EEG to test how neural oscillations change during learning of arbitrary visuo-motor associations. Participants learned to associative 48 different abstract shapes to one of four button responses through trial and error over repetitions of the shapes. To quantify how well the associations were learned for each trial, we used a state-space computational model of learning that provided a probability of each trial being correct given past performance for that stimulus, that we take as a measure of the strength of the association. We used linear modelling to relate single-trial neural oscillations to single-trial measures of association strength. We found frontal midline theta oscillations during the delay period tracked learning, where theta activity was strongest during the early stages of learning and declined as the associations were formed. Further, posterior alpha and low-beta oscillations in the cue period showed strong desynchronised activity early in learning, while stronger alpha activity during the delay period were seen as associations became well learned. Moreover, the magnitude of these effects during early learning, before the associations were learned, related to improvements in memory seen on the next presentation of the stimulus. The current study provides clear evidence that frontal theta and posterior alpha/beta oscillations play a key role during associative memory formation.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac myocytes (CMs) obtained by differentiating embryonic stem cells (ES-CMs) have an immature phenotype and promoting the maturation of such PSC-derived cardiomyocytes remains a major limitation in the development of stem cell models of human cardiovascular disease. We cultured murine ES-CMs in a collagen gel (3D) at a low density, or on collagen-coated polystyrene (2D) and found that 3D culture results in dramatic improvement of the maturation rate and end-state gene expression of ES-CMs. There are two main differences between CMs cultured in 3D versus 2D; in 3D the mechanical stiffness of the environment is lower, enabling auxotonic instead of isometric contraction; and, in 3D the amount of cell-cell interaction is higher. To isolate the contributions, we first cultured ES-CMs on gels (2D substrates) that are softer than tissue culture plastic, enabling auxotonic contraction, while controlling for dimensionality and cell interaction. This indeed promoted a mature gene expression profile, while also enabling the maintenance of sarcomeres. Next, we determined that increased cell-cell interaction inhibits the mature gene expression of ES-CMs. Thus, auxotonic contraction is the likely mechanism for improved gene expression in sub-confluent 3D culture. However, 2D auxotonic contraction may offer a suitable compromise between obtaining enhanced gene expression and morphology. After 6 weeks of culture on gels, via Di-8-ANEPPs and WGA staining we also detected CMs forming a t-tubule network. Collectively these results demonstrate that 3D and 2D cultures that enable auxotonic contraction enhance aspects of the maturation of ES-CMs.",

    "abstract": "Cell deformation is regulated by complex underlying biological mechanisms associated with spatial and temporal morphological changes in the nucleus that are related to cell differentiation, development, proliferation, and disease. Thus, quantitative analysis of changes in size and shape of nuclear structures in 3D microscopic images is important not only for investigating nuclear organization, but also for detecting and treating pathological conditions such as cancer. While many efforts have been made to develop cell and nuclear shape characteristics in 2D or pseudo-3D, several studies have suggested that 3D morphometric measures provide better results for nuclear shape description and discrimination. A few methods have been proposed to classify cell and nuclear morphological phenotypes in 3D, however, there is a lack of publicly available 3D data for the evaluation and comparison of such algorithms. This limitation becomes of great importance when the ability to evaluate different approaches on benchmark data is needed for better dissemination of the current state of the art methods for bioimage analysis. To address this problem, we present a dataset containing two different cell collections, including original 3D microscopic images of cell nuclei and nucleoli.

    "abstract": "Brain genetics is an active research area. The degree to which genetic variants impact variations in brain structure and function remains largely unknown. We examined the heritability of regional brain volumes (p ~ 100) captured by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in UK Biobank (n ~ 9000). We found that regional brain volumes are highly heritable in this study population. We observed omni-genic impact across the genome as well as enrichment of SNPs in active chromatin regions. Principal components derived from regional volume data are also highly heritable, but the amount of variance in brain volume explained by the component did not seem to be related to its heritability. Heritability estimates vary substantially across large-scale functional networks and brain regions. The variation in heritability across regions was not related to measurement reliability. Heritability estimates exhibit a symmetric pattern across left and right hemispheres and are consistent in females and males. Our main findings in UK Biobank are consistent with those in Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n ~ 1100), Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n ~ 600), and Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (n ~ 500) datasets, with more stable estimates in UK Biobank.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLow birthweight (BW) has been associated with a higher risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in epidemiological studies. The Barker hypothesis posits that intrauterine growth restriction resulting in lower BW is causal for these diseases, but causality and mechanisms are difficult to infer from observational studies. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a new tool to address this important question.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed regression analyses to assess associations of self-reported BW with CVD and T2D in 237,631 individuals from the UK Biobank, a large population-based cohort study aged 40-69 years recruited across UK in 2006-2010. Further, we assessed the causal relationship of such associations using the two- sample MR approach, estimating the causal effect by contrasting the SNP effects on the exposure with the SNP effects on the outcome using independent publicly available genome-wide association datasets.\\n\\nResultsIn the observational analyses, BW showed strong inverse associations with systolic and diastolic blood pressure ({beta}, -0.83 and -0.26; per raw unit in outcomes and SD change in BW; 95% CI, -0.90, -0.75 and -0.31, -0.22, respectively), T2D (odds ratio [OR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.79, 0.87), lipid-lowering treatment (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81, 0.86) and CAD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78, 0.94); while the associations with adult body mass index (BMI) and body fat ({beta}, 0.04 and 0.02; per SD change in outcomes and BW; 95% CI, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.01, 0.02, respectively) were positive. The MR analyses indicated inverse causal associations of BW with low density lipoprotein cholesterol, 2-hour glucose, CAD and T2D, and positive causal association with BMI; but no associations with blood pressure. Sensitivity analyses and robust MR methods provided consistent results and indicated no horizontal pleiotropy.\\n\\nConclusionOur study indicates that lower BW is causally and directly related with increased susceptibility to CAD and T2D in adulthood. This causal relationship is not mediated by adult obesity or hypertension.",

However, evidence of significant cell-to-cell variability suggests that the activity of this network varies within individual stem cells, leading to differential processing of environmental signals and variability in cell fates. Here, we adapt a method originally designed for face recognition to infer regulatory network patterns within individual cells from single-cell expression data. Using this method we identify three distinct network configurations in cultured mouse embryonic stem cells - corresponding to naive and formative pluripotent states and an early primitive endoderm state - and associate these configurations with particular combinations of regulatory network activity archetypes that govern different aspects of the cells response to environmental stimuli, cell cycle status and core information processing circuitry. These results show how variability in cell identities arise naturally from alterations in underlying regulatory network dynamics and demonstrate how methods from machine learning may be used to better understand single cell biology, and the collective dynamics of cell communities.",

    "abstract": "Apathy is one of the most prevalent and progressive psychiatric symptom in Huntingtons disease (HD) patients. However, preclinical work in HD mouse models tend to focus on molecular and motor, rather than affective, phenotypes. Measuring behavior in mice often produces noisy data and requires large cohorts to detect phenotypic rescue with appropriate power. The operant equipment necessary for measuring affective phenotypes is typically expensive, proprietary to commercial entities, and bulky which can render adequately sized mouse cohorts as cost-prohibitive. Thus, we describe here a home-built open-source alternative to commercial hardware that is reliable, scalable, and reproducible. Using off-the-shelf hardware, we adapted and built several of the rodent operant buckets (ROBucket) designed to test HttQ111/+ mice for attention deficits in fixed ratio (FR) and progressive ratio (PR) tasks. We find that, despite normal performance in reward attainment in the FR task, HttQ111/+ mice exhibit reduced PR performance at 9-11 months of age, suggesting motivational deficits. We replicated this in two independent cohorts, which demonstrates the reliability and utility of both the apathetic phenotype, and these ROBuckets, for preclinical HD studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe model species Arabidopsis thaliana has extensive resources to investigate intraspecific trait variability and the genetic bases of ecologically relevant traits. However, the cost of equipment and software required for high-throughput phenotyping is often a bottleneck for large-scale studies, such as mutant screening or quantitative genetics analyses. Simple tools are needed for the measurement of fitness-related traits, like relative growth rate and fruit production, without investment in expensive infrastructures. Here, we describe methods that enable the estimation of biomass accumulation and fruit number from the analysis of rosette and inflorescence images taken with a regular camera.\\n\\nResultsWe developed two models to predict plant dry mass and fruit number from the parameters extracted with the analysis of rosette and inflorescence images. Predictive models were trained by sacrificing growing individuals for dry mass estimation, and manually measuring a fraction of individuals for fruit number at maturity. Using a cross-validation approach, we showed that quantitative parameters extracted from image analysis predicts more 90% of both plant dry mass and fruit number. When used on 451 natural accessions, the method allowed modelling growth dynamics, including relative growth rate, throughout the life cycle of various ecotypes. Estimated growth-related traits had high heritability (0.65 < H2 < 0.93), as well as estimated fruit number (H2 = 0.68). In addition, we validated the method for estimating fruit number with rev5, a mutant with increased flower abortion.\\n\\nConclusionsThe method we propose here is based on the automated computerization of plant images with ImageJ, and subsequent statistical modelling in R. It allows plant biologists to measure growth dynamics and fruit number in hundreds of individuals with simple computing steps that can be repeated and adjusted to a wide range of laboratory conditions. It is thus a flexible toolkit for the measurement of fitness-related traits in large plant populations.",

    "abstract": "Widespread antibiotic resistance, especially of Gram-negative bacteria, has become a severe concern for human health. Tripartite efflux pumps are one of the major contributors to resistance in Gram-negative pathogens, by efficiently expelling a broad spectrum of antibiotics from the organism. In Neisseria gonorrhoeae, one of the first bacteria for which pan-resistance has been reported, the most expressed efflux complex is MtrCDE. Here we present the electrophysiological characterisation of the outer membrane component MtrE and the membrane fusion protein MtrC, obtained by a combination of planar lipid bilayer recordings and in silico techniques. Our in vitro results show that MtrE can be regulated by periplasmic binding events and that the interaction between MtrE and MtrC is sufficient to stabilize this complex in an open state. In contrast to other efflux conduits, the open complex only displays a slight preference for cations. The maximum conductance we obtain in the in vitro recordings is comparable to that seen in our computational electrophysiology simulations conducted on the MtrE crystal structure, indicating that this state may reflect a physiologically relevant open conformation of MtrE. Our results suggest that the MtrC/E binding interface is an important modulator of MtrE function, which could potentially be targeted by new efflux inhibitors.",

Caribbean anole species have diversified mainly along a precipitation rather than a temperature gradient. Only a few lineages have colonized both cold and hot conditions. Furthermore, most of the single-island endemic species are climatically restricted to its native islands and a small set of species might the potential to colonize other islands given its climatic niche requirements.

Differential genomic targeting by paralogous TFs is generally assumed to be due to interactions with protein cofactors or the chromatin environment. Contrary to previous assumptions, we find that paralogous TFs have different intrinsic preferences for DNA, not captured by current motif models, and these differences partly explain differential genomic binding and functional specificity. Our finding was possible due to a unique combination of carefully designed high-throughput assays and rigorous computation modeling, integrated into a unified framework called iMADS. We used iMADS to quantify, model, and analyze specificity differences between 11 paralogous TFs from 4 distinct human TF families. Our finding of differential specificity between closely related TFs has important implications for the interpretation of the regulatory effects of non-coding genetic variants.",

However, it remains to be determined whether Id proteins regulate lineage specification in developing T cells that give rise to these distinct cell fates. Here we report that in the absence of Id2 and Id3 proteins, E2A prematurely activates genes critical for the iNKT cell lineage prior to TCR expression. Enhanced iNKT development in Id3-deficient mice lacking {gamma}{delta} NKT cells suggests that Id3 regulates the lineage competition between these populations. RNA-Seq analysis establishes E2A as the transcriptional regulator of both iNKT and {gamma}{delta}NKT development. In the absence of pre-TCR signaling, Id2/Id3 deletion gives rise to a large population of iNKT cells and a unique innate-like DP population, despite the block in conventional {beta} T cell development. The transcriptional profile of these unique DP cells reflects enrichment of innate-like signature genes, including PLZF (Zbtb16) and Granzyme A (Gzma). Results from these genetic models and genome-wide analyses suggest that Id proteins suppress E2A-driven innate-like T cell programs prior to TCR selection to enforce predominance of conventional T cells.",

    "abstract": "Arthropod vectors have multiple physical and immunological barriers that impede the development and transmission of parasites to new vertebrate hosts. These barriers include the peritrophic matrix (PM), a chitinous barrier that separates the blood bolus from the midgut epithelia and inturn, modulates vector-microbiota interactions. In tsetse flies, a sleeve-like PM is continuously produced by the cardia organ located at the fore- and midgut junction. African trypanosomes, Trypanosoma brucei, must bypass the PM twice; first to colonize the midgut and secondly to reach the salivary glands (SG), to complete their transmission cycle in tsetse. However, not all flies with midgut infections develop mammalian transmissible SG infections - the reasons for which are unclear. Here, we used transcriptomics, microscopy and functional genomics analyses to understand the factors that regulate parasite migration from midgut to SG. In flies with midgut infections only, parasites fail to cross the PM as they are eliminated from the cardia by reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) - albeit at the expense of collateral cytotoxic damage to the cardia. In flies with midgut and SG infections, expression of genes encoding components of the PM is reduced in the cardia, and structural integrity of the PM barrier is compromised. Under these circumstances trypanosomes traverse through the newly secreted and compromised PM. The process of PM attrition that enables the parasites to re-enter into the midgut lumen is apparently mediated by components of the parasites residing in the cardia. Thus, a fine-tuned dialogue between tsetse and trypanosomes at the cardia determines the outcome of PM integrity and trypanosome transmission success.\\n\\nAuthor summaryInsects are responsible for transmission of parasites that cause deadly diseases in humans and animals. Understanding the key factors that enhance or interfere with parasite transmission processes can result in new control strategies. Here, we report that a proportion of tsetse flies with African trypanosome infections in their midgut can prevent parasites from migrating to the salivary glands, albeit at the expense of collateral damage. In a subset of flies with gut infections, the parasites manipulate the integrity of a midgut barrier, called the peritrophic matrix, and reach the salivary glands for transmission to the next mammal. Either targeting parasite manipulative processes or enhancing peritrophic matrix integrity could reduce parasite transmission.",

    "abstract": "Primary infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) results in a lifelong infection due to its ability to establish latent infection, one characterized viral reservoir being hematopoietic cells. Although reactivation from latency causes serious disease in immunocompromised individuals, our molecular understanding of latency is limited. Here, we delineate viral gene expression during natural HCMV persistent infection by analyzing the massive RNA-seq atlas generated by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. This systematic analysis reveals that HCMV persistence in-vivo is prevalent in diverse tissues. Unexpectedly, we find only viral transcripts that resemble gene expression during stages of lytic infection with no evidence of any highly restricted latency-associated viral gene expression program. To further define the transcriptional landscape during HCMV latent infection, we also used single cell RNA-seq and a tractable experimental latency model. In contrast to current views on latency, we also find no evidence for a specific restricted latency-associated viral gene expression program. Instead, we reveal that latency-associated gene expression largely mirrors a late lytic viral program albeit at much lower levels of expression. Overall, our work has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of HCMV persistence and suggests that latency is governed mainly by quantitative changes, with a limited number of qualitative changes, in viral gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Within multi-species microbial communities, individual species are known to occupy distinct metabolic niches. By contrast, it has remained largely unclear whether and how metabolic specialization occurs within clonal bacterial populations. The possibility of such metabolic specialization in clonal populations raises several questions: Does specialization occur, and if it does, which metabolic processes are involved? How is specialization coordinated? How rapidly do cells switch between states? And finally, what functions might metabolic specialization provide? One potential function of metabolic specialization could be to manage overflow metabolites such as acetate, which presents a toxic challenge due to low pH, and protective pH-neutral overflow metabolites. Here we show that exponentially dividing Bacillus subtilis cultures divide into distinct interacting metabolic subpopulations including one population that produces acetate, and another population that differentially expresses metabolic genes for the production of acetoin, a pH-neutral storage molecule. These subpopulations grew at distinct rates, and cells switched dynamically between states, with acetate influencing the relative sizes of the different subpopulations. These results show that clonal populations can use metabolic specialization to control the environment through a process of dynamic, environmentally-sensitive state-switching.",

    "abstract": "Animals can identify an odorant type across a wide range of concentrations, as well as detect changes in concentration for individual odorant type. How olfactory representations are structured to support these functions remains poorly understood. Here, we studied how a full complement of ORNs in the Drosophila larva encodes a broad input space of odorant types and concentrations. We find that dose-response relationships across odorants and ORN types follow the Hill function with shared cooperativity but different activation thresholds. These activation thresholds are drawn from a power law statistical distribution. A fixed activation function and power law distribution of activation thresholds underlie invariances in the encoding of odorant identity and intensity. Moreover, we find similar temporal response filters of ORNs across odorant types and concentrations. Such uniformity in the temporal filter may allow identity invariant coding in fluctuating or turbulent odor environments. Common patterns in ligand-receptor binding and sensory transduction across olfactory receptors may give rise to these observed invariances in the olfactory combinatorial code. Invariant patterns in the activity responses of individual ORNs and the ORN ensemble may simplify decoding by downstream circuits.",

    "abstract": "It is known that the longer an information has been memorized, the stronger is its memory trace. At the same time it is known that the emotionally-valenced information has a stronger memory trace than neutral one. Interactive effects between these factors are largely unknown. In this study electrical neuroimaging signals were recorded in healthy controls to explore the neural mechanism of memory for faces of different emotional valence, sex, learning context and temporal recency. In a study phase participants familiarized with the fictional police dossier of 10 victims of dramatic deaths including homicide or earthquake (depicted as attractive and nice persons of about 45 years), twice a day for seven days before EEG recordings. Hundreds of famous movie stars (overlearned), victims (recent) and new faces were presented in an old/new recognition task. ERP responses showed a modulation of anterior N2 and FN400 as a function of face familiarity (with no differences between overlearned and recent faces), while parietal late positivity was sensitive to engram temporal recency (it was much larger to overlearned than recent faces, paralleling behavioral data). However, LP amplitude did not differ to overlearned vs. recent same-sex faces, showing how emotional memory can enhance faces remembering. A late frontal negativity revealed sensitive to source memory.",

    "abstract": "Metacognition refers to our capacity to reflect upon our experiences, thoughts and actions. Metacognition processes are linked to cognitive control functions that allow keeping our actions on-task. But it is unclear how the human brain builds an internal model of ones cognition and behaviour. We conducted 2 fMRI experiments in which brain activity was recorded  online as participants engaged in a memory-guided search task and then later  offline when participants introspected about their prior experience and cognitive states during performance. In Experiment 1 the memory cues were task-relevant while in Experiment 2 they were irrelevant. Across Experiments, the patterns of brain activity, including frontoparietal regions, were similar during on-task and introspection states. However the connectivity profile amongst frontoparietal areas was distint during introspection and modulated by the relevance of the memory cues. Introspection was also characterized by increased temporal correlation between the default-mode network (DMN), frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks and visual cortex. We suggest that memories of ones own experience during task performance are encoded in large-scale patterns of brain activity and that coupling between DMN and frontoparietal control networks may be crucial to build an internal model of ones behavioural performance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundViral encephalitis is a dangerous compromise between the need to robustly clear pathogen from the brain and the need to protect neurons from bystander injury. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection of C57Bl/6 mice is a model of viral encephalitis in which the compromise results in hippocampal damage and permanent neurological sequelae. We previously identified brain infiltrating inflammatory monocytes as the primary driver of this hippocampal pathology, but the mechanisms involved in recruiting these cells to the brain were unclear.\\n\\nMethodsChemokine expression levels in the hippocampus were assessed by microarray, ELISA, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. Monocyte infiltration during acute TMEV infection was measured by flow cytometry. CCL2 levels were manipulated by immunodepletion and by specific removal from neurons in mice generated by crossing a line expressing the Cre recombinase behind the synapsin promoter to animals with floxed CCL2.\\n\\nResultsInoculation of the brain with TMEV induced hippocampal production of the proinflammatory chemokine CCL2 that peaked at 6 hours postinfection, whereas inoculation with UV-inactivated TMEV did not elicit this response. Immunofluorescence revealed that hippocampal neurons expressed high levels of CCL2 at this timepoint. Genetic deletion of CCR2 and systemic immunodepletion of CCL2 abrogated or blunted the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the brain during acute infection. Specific genetic deletion of CCL2 from neurons reduced serum and hippocampal CCL2 levels and inhibited inflammatory monocyte infiltration into the brain.\\n\\nConclusionsWe conclude that intracranial inoculation with infectious TMEV rapidly induces the expression of CCL2 in neurons, and this cellular source is necessary for CCR2-dependent infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the brain during the most acute stage of encephalitis. These findings highlight a unique role for neuronal production of chemokines in the initiation of leukocytic infiltration into the infected central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "The white matter is highly vascularised by the cerebral venous system. The neuroinflammatory disease multiple sclerosis is associated with infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain via these vessels. Understanding venous pathophysiology in multiple sclerosis is thus critical for understanding early disease aetiology. In this paper, we describe a unique blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal within the white matter using functional MRI and spatial independent components analysis, a blind signal source separation method. The signal was characterised by a narrow peak frequency band between 0.05 and 0.1 Hz. Hypercapnia (transient breath holds), known to alter venous calibre in cortex, induced transient increases in white matter BOLD that disrupted the oscillation indicative of a vasodilatory/contractile mechanism. Comparison of the white matter BOLD oscillations between age and sex matched groups of 18 multiple sclerosis and 14 healthy participants revealed a loss of power in the white matter BOLD signal in the peak frequency band (patients = 6.70{+/-}0.94 dB/Hz vs controls = 7.64{+/-}0.71 dB/Hz; p=0.006). In multiple sclerosis patients, lower power was associated with greater levels of neuroinflammatory activity (R=-0.64, p=0.006) but not neurodegenerative disease markers. Using a signal modelling technique, we assessed the anatomical distribution of white matter BOLD signal abnormalities and detected reduced power in the periventricular white matter, a region of known venous damage in multiple sclerosis patients. These results demonstrate a novel link between neuroinflammation and vascular physiological dysfunction in the cerebral white matter, and could indicate enduring loss of vascular compliance associated with imperfect repair of blood-brain barrier damage after resolution of acute neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is known to be important for a range of cognitive functions including episodic memory, spatial navigation and future-thinking. Wide agreement on the exact nature of its contribution has proved elusive, with some theories emphasising associative processes and another proposing that scene construction is its primary role. To directly compare these accounts of hippocampal function, we devised a novel mental imagery paradigm where different tasks were closely matched for associative processing and mental construction, but either did or did not evoke scene representations, and we combined this with high resolution functional MRI. The results were striking in showing that differentiable parts of the hippocampus, along with distinct cortical regions, were recruited for scene construction or non-scene-evoking associative processing. The contrasting patterns of neural engagement could not be accounted for by differences in eye movements, mnemonic processing or the phenomenology of mental imagery. These results inform conceptual debates in the field by showing that the hippocampus does not seem to favour one type of process over another; it is not a story of exclusivity. Rather, there may be different circuits within the hippocampus, each associated with different cortical inputs, which become engaged depending on the nature of the stimuli and the task at hand. Overall, our findings emphasise the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure, and that a focus on characterising how specific portions of the hippocampus interact with other brain regions may promote a better understanding of its role in cognition.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe hippocampus is known to be important for a range of cognitive functions including episodic memory, spatial navigation and future-thinking.

    "abstract": "Coordination between structural and physiological traits is key to plants responses to environmental fluctuations. In heterobaric leaves, bundle sheath extensions (BSEs) increase photosynthetic performance (light-saturated rates of photosynthesis, Amax) and water transport capacity (leaf hydraulic conductance, Kleaf). However, it is not clear how BSEs affect these and other leaf developmental and physiological parameters in response to environmental conditions. The obscuravenosa (obv) mutation, found in many commercial tomato varieties, leads to absence of BSEs. We examined structural and physiological traits of tomato heterobaric and homobaric (obv) near-isogenic lines (NILs) grown at two different irradiance levels. Kleaf, minor vein density and stomatal pore area index decreased with shading in heterobaric but not in homobaric leaves, which show similarly lower values in both conditions. Homobaric plants, on the other hand, showed increased Amax, leaf intercellular air spaces and mesophyll surface area exposed to intercellular airspace (Smes) in comparison with heterobaric plants when both were grown in the shade. BSEs further affected carbon isotope discrimination, a proxy for long-term water-use efficiency. BSEs confer plasticity in traits related to leaf structure and function in response to irradiance levels and might act as a hub integrating leaf structure, photosynthetic function and water supply and demand.\\n\\nSummary statementThe presence of bundle sheath extension (BSEs) defines leaves as heterobaric, as opposed to homobaric leaves that lack them. Multiple functions have been proposed for BSEs, but their impact on different environmental conditions is still unclear. Here, we compared a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) homobaric mutant lacking BSEs with its corresponding heterobaric wild-type, grown under two irradiance conditions. We show that the presence of BSEs differentially alters various physiological and anatomical parameters in response to growth irradiance. We propose that BSEs could act as hubs coordinating leaf plasticity in response to environmental factors.\\n\\nArticle typeResearch article",

Here, we precisely design 5 E. coli genomes worth of synthetic DNA to untangle the relative contributions of 8 interlaced sequence properties described independently as major determinants of translation in Escherichia coli. To expose hierarchical effects, we engineer an inducible translational coupling device enabling epigenetic disruption of mRNA secondary structures. We find that properties commonly believed to modulate translation generally explain less than a third of the variation in protein production. We describe dominant effects of mRNA structures over codon composition on both initiation and elongation, and previously uncharacterized relationships among factors controlling translation.

For example, during face-to-face communication we know that the brain integrates the auditory and visual inputs but we do not yet understand where and how such integration mechanisms support speech comprehension. Here we show that two independent mechanisms forge audiovisual representations for speech comprehension in different brain regions. With a novel information theoretic measure, we found that theta (3-7 Hz) oscillations in the posterior superior temporal gyrus/sulcus (pSTG/S) code speech information that is common (i.e. redundant) to the auditory and visual inputs whereas the same oscillations in left motor and inferior temporal cortex code synergistic information between the same inputs. Importantly, redundant coding in the left pSTG/S and synergistic coding in the left motor cortex predict behavior - i.e. speech comprehension performance. Our findings therefore demonstrate that processes classically described as integration effectively reflect independent mechanisms that occur in different brain regions to support audiovisual speech comprehension.",

We then examine the theoretical consequences that ensue from this assumption. This framework naturally explains why some tasks - for example, unfamiliar or dual tasks - are costly and permits to quantify these costs using information-theoretic measures. Finally, we discuss brain implementation of this principle and show that subjective cognitive costs can originate either from local or global capacity limitations on information processing or from increased rate of metabolic alterations.

Parietal cortex is a candidate region involved in retrieval-induced memory changes as it reflects retrieval success and represents retrieved content. Here, we conducted an fMRI experiment to test whether different forms of parietal reactivation predict distinct consequences of retrieval. Subjects studied associations between words and pictures of faces, scenes, or objects, and then repeatedly retrieved half of the pictures, reporting the vividness of the retrieved pictures ( retrieval practice). On the following day, subjects completed a recognition memory test for individual pictures. Critically, the test included lures highly similar to studied pictures. Behaviorally, retrieval practice increased both hit and false alarm rates to similar lures, confirming a causal influence of retrieval on subsequent memory. Using pattern similarity analyses, we measured two different levels of reactivation during retrieval practice: generic  category-level reactivation and idiosyncratic  item-level reactivation. Vivid remembering during retrieval practice was associated with stronger category- and item-level reactivation in parietal cortex. However, these measures differentially predicted subsequent recognition memory performance: whereas higher category-level reactivation tended to predict false alarms to lures, item-level reactivation predicted correct rejections. These findings indicate that parietal reactivation can be decomposed to tease apart distinct consequences of memory retrieval.",

Here, we conducted an fMRI experiment to test whether different forms of parietal reactivation predict distinct consequences of retrieval. Subjects studied associations between words and pictures of faces, scenes, or objects, and then repeatedly retrieved half of the pictures, reporting the vividness of the retrieved pictures ( retrieval practice). On the following day, subjects completed a recognition memory test for individual pictures. Critically, the test included lures highly similar to studied pictures. Behaviorally, retrieval practice increased both hit and false alarm rates to similar lures, confirming a causal influence of retrieval on subsequent memory. Using pattern similarity analyses, we measured two different levels of reactivation during retrieval practice: generic  category-level reactivation and idiosyncratic  item-level reactivation. Vivid remembering during retrieval practice was associated with stronger category- and item-level reactivation in parietal cortex. However, these measures differentially predicted subsequent recognition memory performance: whereas higher category-level reactivation tended to predict false alarms to lures, item-level reactivation predicted correct rejections. These findings indicate that parietal reactivation can be decomposed to tease apart distinct consequences of memory retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Most animals fight by repeating complex stereotypic behaviors, yet the internal structure of these behaviors has rarely been dissected in detail. We characterized the internal structure of fighting behaviors by developing a machine learning pipeline that measures and classifies the behavior of individual unmarked animals on a sub-second timescale. This allowed us to quantify several previously hidden features of zebrafish fighting strategies. We found strong correlations between the velocity of the attacker and the defender indicating a dynamic matching of approach and avoidance efforts consistent with the cumulative assessment model of aggression. While velocity matching was ubiquitous, the spatial dynamics of attacks showed phase-specific differences. Contest phase attacks were characterized by a paradoxical side-ways attraction of the retreating animal towards the attacker suggesting that the defender combines avoidance maneuvers with display maneuvers. Post-resolution attacks lacked display-like features and the the defender was avoidance-focused. From the perspective of the winner, game theory modeling further suggested that highly energetically costly post resolution attacks occurred because the winner was trying to increase its relative dominance over the loser. Overall, the rich structure of zebrafish motor coordination during fighting indicates a greater complexity and layering of strategies than has previously been recognized.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundShotgun DNA sequencing provides sensitive detection of all 182 HPV types in tissue and body fluid. However, existing computational methods either produce false positives misidentifying HPV types due to shared sequences among HPV, human, and prokaryotes, or produce false negative since they identify HPV by assembled contigs requiring large abundant of HPV reads.\\n\\nResultsWe show that HPV shares extensive simple repeats with human and prokaryotes and homologous sequences among different HPV types. The shared sequences caused errors in HPV genotyping and the repeats of human origin caused false positives in HPVDetector. Programs, such as VirusTAP and Vipie, which require de novo assembly of shotgun reads into contigs, eliminated false positives at a cost of substantial reduction in sensitivity. Here, we designed HPViewer with two custom HPV reference databases masking simple repeats and homology sequences respectively and one homology distance matrix to hybridize these two databases. It directly identified HPV from short DNA reads rather than assembled contigs. Using 100,100 simulated samples, we revealed that HPViewer was robust for samples containing either high or low number of HPV reads. Using 12 shotgun sequencing samples from respiratory papillomatosis, HPViewer was equal to VirusTAP, and Vipie and better than HPVDetector with the respect to specificity and was the most sensitive method in the detection of HPV types 6 and 11. We demonstrated that contigs-based approaches had disadvantages of detection of HPV. In 1,573 sets of metagenomic data from 18 human body sites, HPViewer identified 104 types of HPV in a body-site associated pattern and 89 types of HPV co-occurring in one sample with other types of HPV at least once.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrated HPViewer was sensitive and specific for HPV detection in metagenomic data. It was also suggested that masking shared sequences is an effective approach to avoid false positive detection and identifying HPV from short metagenomic reads is more sensitive than assembled contigs. The innovative homology distance matrix connecting two HPV databases, repeat-mask and homology-mask, optimized the balance of sensitivity and specificity.

    "abstract": "MotivationLong non-coding RNAs(lncRNAs) can indirectly regulate mRNAs expression levels by sequestering microRNAs (miRNAs), and act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) or as sponges. Previous studies identified lncRNA-mediated sponge interactions in various cancers including the breast cancer. However, breast cancer subtypes are quite distinct in terms of their molecular profiles; therefore, ceRNAs are expected to be subtype-specific as well.\\n\\nResultsTo find lncRNA-mediated ceRNA interactions in breast cancer subtypes, we develop an integrative approach. We conduct partial correlation analysis and kernel independence tests on patient gene expression profiles and further refine the candidate interactions with miRNA target information. We find that although there are sponges common to multiple subtypes, there are also distinct subtype-specific interactions. Functional enrichment of mRNAs that participate in these interactions highlights distinct biological processes for different subtypes. Interestingly, some of the ceRNAs also reside in close proximity in the genome; for example, those involving HOX genes, HOTAIR, miR-196a-1 and miR-196a-2. We also discover subtype-specific sponge interactions with high prognostic potential. For instance, when grouping is based on the expression patterns of specific sponge interactions, patients differ significantly in their survival distributions. If on the other hand, patients are grouped based on the individual RNA expression profiles of the sponge participants, they do not exhibit a significant difference in survival. These results can help shed light on subtype-specific mechanisms of breast cancer, and the methodology developed herein can help uncover sponges in other diseases.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, with an average 5-year survival rate of only 8%. Within PDAC patients, however, there is a small subset of patients who survive >10 years. Deciphering underlying reasons behind prolonged survival could potentially provide new opportunities to treat PDAC; however, no genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, or clinical signatures have been found to robustly separate this subset of patients. Digital pathology, in combination with machine learning, provides an opportunity to computationally search for tissue morphology patterns associated with disease outcomes. Here, we developed a computational framework to analyze whole-slide images (WSI) of PDAC patient tissue and identify tissue-morphology signatures for very long term surviving patients. Our results indicate that less tissue morphology heterogeneity is significantly linked to better patient survival and that the extra-tumoral space encodes prognostic information for survival. Based on information from morphological heterogeneity in the tumor and its adjacent area, we established a machine learning model with an AUC of 0.94. Our analysis workflow highlighted a quantitative visual-based tissue phenotype analysis that also allows direct interaction with pathology. This study demonstrates a pathway to accelerate the discovery of undetermined tissue morphology associated with pathogenesis states and prognosis and diagnosis of patients by utilizing new computational approaches.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion in cellular membranes is regulated by processes which occur over a range of spatial and temporal scales. These processes include membrane fluidity, inter-protein and inter-lipid interactions, interactions with membrane microdomains, interactions with the underlying cytoskeleton, and cellular processes which result in net membrane movement. The complex, non-Brownian diffusion that results from these processes has been difficult to characterize, and moreover, the impact of factors such as membrane recycling on membrane diffusion remains largely unexplored. We have used a careful statistical analysis of single-particle tracking data of the single-pass plasma membrane protein CD93 to show that the diffusion of this protein is well-described by a continuous-time random walk in parallel with an aging process mediated by membrane corrals. The overall result is an evolution in the diffusion of CD93: proteins initially diffuse freely on the cell surface, but over time, become increasingly trapped within diffusion-limiting membrane corrals. Stable populations of freely diffusing and corralled CD93 are maintained by an endocytic/exocytic process in which corralled CD93 is selectively endocytosed, while freely diffusing CD93 is replenished by exocytosis of newly synthesized and recycled CD93. This trafficking not only maintained CD93 diffusivity, but also maintained the heterogeneous distribution of CD93 in the plasma membrane. These results provide insight into the nature of the biological and biophysical processes that can lead to significantly non-Brownian diffusion of membrane proteins, and demonstrate that ongoing membrane recycling is critical to maintaining steady-state diffusion and distribution of proteins in the plasma membrane.",

    "abstract": "Plasma membrane tension is an important factor that regulates many key cellular processes. Membrane trafficking is tightly coupled to membrane tension and can modulate the latter by addition or removal of the membrane. However, the cellular pathway(s) involved in these processes are poorly understood. Here we find that, among a number of endocytic processes operating simultaneously at the cell surface, a dynamin and clathrin-independent pathway, the CLIC/GEEC (CG) pathway, is rapidly and specifically upregulated upon reduction of tension. On the other hand, inhibition of the CG pathway results in lower membrane tension, while up regulation significantly enhances membrane tension. We find that vinculin, a well-studied mechanotransducer, mediates the tension-dependent regulation of the CG pathway. Vinculin negatively regulates a key CG pathway regulator, GBF1, at the plasma membrane in a tension dependent manner. Thus, the CG pathway operates in a negative feedback loop with membrane tension which leads to a homeostatic regulation of membrane tension.",

    "abstract": "Cancer-initiating gatekeeper mutations that arise in stem cells would be especially potent if they stabilize and expand an affected stem lineage (1, 2). It is therefore important to understand how different stem cell organization strategies promote or prevent variant stem cell amplification in response to different types of mutation, including those that activate stem cell proliferation. Stem cell numbers can be maintained constant while producing differentiated products through individually asymmetric division outcomes or by population asymmetry strategies, in which individual stem cell lineages necessarily compete for niche space. We considered alternative mechanisms underlying population asymmetry and used quantitative modeling to predict starkly different consequences of altering proliferation rate: a variant, faster-proliferating mutant stem cell should compete better only when stem cell division and differentiation are independent processes. For most types of stem cell it has not been possible to ascertain experimentally whether division and differentiation are coupled. However, Drosophila Follicle Stem Cells (FSCs) provided a favorable model system to investigate population asymmetry mechanisms and also for measuring the impact of altered proliferation on competition. We found from detailed cell lineage studies that FSC division and FSC differentiation are not coupled. We also found that FSC representation, reflecting maintenance and amplification, was highly responsive to genetic changes that altered only the rate of FSC proliferation. The FSC paradigm therefore provides definitive experimental evidence for the general principle that relative proliferation rate will always be a major determinant of competition among stem cells specifically when stem cell division and differentiation are independent.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEAdult stem cells support tissue maintenance throughout life but they also can be cells of origin for cancer, allowing clonal expansion and long-term maintenance of the first oncogenic mutations. We considered how a mutation that increases the proliferation rate of a stem cell would affect the probability of its competitive survival and amplification for different potential organizations of stem cells. Quantitative modeling showed that the key characteristic predicting the impact of relative proliferation rate on competition is whether differentiation of a stem cell is coupled to its division. We then used Drosophila Follicle Stem Cells to provide definitive experimental evidence for the general prediction that relative proliferation rates dictate stem cell competition specifically for stem cells that exhibit division-independent differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances uncovered therapeutic interventions that might reduce the risk of progression of premalignant diagnoses, such as from Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) to multiple myeloma (MM). It remains unclear how to best screen populations at risk and how to evaluate the ability of these interventions to reduce disease prevalence and mortality at the population level. To address these questions, we developed a computational modeling framework. We used individual-based computational modeling of MGUS incidence and progression across a population of diverse individuals, to determine best screening strategies in terms of screening start, intervals, and risk-group specificity. Inputs were life tables, MGUS incidence and baseline MM survival. We measured MM-specific mortality and MM prevalence following MGUS detection from simulations and mathematical precition modeling. We showed that our framework is applicable to a wide spectrum of screening and intervention scenarios, including variation of the baseline MGUS to MM progression rate and evolving MGUS, in which progression increases over time. Given the currently available progression risk-point estimate of 61% risk, starting screening at age 55 and follow-up screening every 6yrs reduced total MM prevalence by 19%. The same reduction could be achieved with starting age 65 and follow-up every 2yrs. A 40% progression risk reduction per MGUS patient per year would reduce MM-specific mortality by 40%. Generally, age of screening onset and frequency impact disease prevalence, progression risk reduction impacts both prevalence and disease-specific mortality, and screeenign would generally be favorable in high-risk individuals. Screening efforts should focus on specifically identified groups of high lifetime risk of MGUS, for which screening benefits can be significant. Screening low-risk MGUS individuals would require improved preventions.",

Here, building on existing research on learning, we analytically and computationally model the predictions of two closely related hypotheses: The Cultural Brain Hypothesis and the Cumulative Cultural Brain Hypothesis. The Cultural Brain Hypothesis posits that brains have been selected for their ability to store and manage information, acquired through asocial or social learning. The model of the Cultural Brain Hypothesis reveals relationships between brain size, group size, innovation, social learning, mating structures, and the length of the juvenile period that are supported by the existing empirical literature. From this model, we derive a set of predictions--the Cumulative Cultural Brain Hypothesis--for the conditions that favor an autocatalytic take-off characteristic of human evolution. This narrow evolutionary pathway, created by cumulative cultural evolution, may help explain the rapid expansion of human brains and other aspects of our species life history and psychology.",

    "abstract": "Multi-objective optimization is an emerging field in mathematical optimization which involves optimization a set of objective functions simultaneously. The purpose of most plant and animal breeding programs is to make decisions that will lead to sustainable genetic gains in more than one traits while controlling the amount of co-ancestry in the breeding population. The decisions at each cycle in a breeding program involve multiple, usually competing, objectives; these complex decisions can be supported by the insights that are gained by using the multi-objective optimization principles in breeding. The discussion here includes the definition of several multi-objective optimized breeding approaches and the comparison of these approaches with the standard multi-trait breeding schemes such as tandem selection, culling and index selection. We have illustrated the newly proposed methods with two empirical data sets and with simulations.",

Here we performed a large-scale screen using C. elegans and its natural pathogen, the Orsay virus (OrV), and identified cde-1 as important for antiviral defense. CDE-1 is a homologue of the mammalian TUT4/7 terminal uridylyltransferases; its catalytic activity is required for its antiviral function. CDE-1 uridylates the 3' end of the OrV RNA genome and promotes its degradation, independently of the RNAi pathway. Likewise, TUT4/7 uridylate influenza A virus (IAV) mRNAs in mammalian cells. Deletion of TUT4/7 leads to increased IAV mRNA and protein levels. We have defined 3' terminal uridylation of viral RNAs as a conserved antiviral defense mechanism.",

However, little is known about the role of PDGFR signaling during tendon growth and remodeling in adult animals. Using the hindlimb synergist ablation model of tendon growth, our objectives were to determine the role of PDGFR signaling in the adaptation of tendons subjected to a mechanical growth stimulus, as well as to investigate the biological mechanisms behind this response. We demonstrate that both PDGFRs, PDGFR and PDGFR{beta}, are expressed in tendon fibroblasts, and that the inhibition of PDGFR signaling suppresses the normal growth of tendon tissue in response to mechanical growth cues due to defects in fibroblast proliferation and migration. We also identify that membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) as an essential proteinase for the migration of tendon fibroblasts through their extracellular matrix. Furthermore, we report that MT1-MMP translation is regulated by PI3K/Akt signaling, while ERK1/2 controls post-translational trafficking of MT1-MMP to the plasma membrane of tendon fibroblasts. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PDGFR signaling is necessary for postnatal tendon growth and remodeling, and that MT1-MMP is a critical mediator of tendon fibroblast migration and a potential target for the treatment of tendon injuries and diseases.",

One genes translation often occurs at the expense of anothers, resulting in global energetic and fitness trade-offs during differential expression of various functions. Patterns of ribosome utilization--as controlled by initiation, elongation and release rates--are central to this balance. To disentangle their respective determinants and physiological impacts, we complemented measurements of protein production with highly parallelized quantifications of transcripts abundance and decay, ribosome loading and cellular growth rate for 244,000 precisely designed sequence variants of an otherwise standard reporter. We find highly constrained, non-monotonic relationships between measured phenotypes. We show that fitness defects derive either from protein overproduction, with efficient translation initiation and heavy ribosome flows; or from unproductive ribosome sequestration by highly structured, slowly initiated and overly stabilized transcripts. These observations demonstrate physiological impacts of key sequence features in natural and designed transcripts.",

Although a multiple feedback loop circuit has been shown to generate the 24h rhythm, it remains unclear how robust the clock is in individual cells, or how clock timing is coordinated across the plant. Here we examine clock activity at the single cell level across Arabidopsis seedlings over several days. Our data reveal robust single cell oscillations, albeit desynchronised. In particular, we observe two waves of clock activity; one going down, and one up the root. We also find evidence of cell-to-cell coupling of the clock, especially in the root tip. A simple model shows that cell-to-cell coupling and our measured period differences between cells can generate the observed waves. Our results reveal the spatial structure of the plant circadian clock and suggest that unlike the centralised mammalian clock, the clock has multiple points of coordination in Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "S100 proteins bind linear peptide regions of target proteins and modulate their activity. The peptide binding interface, however, has remarkably low specificity and can interact with many target peptides. It is not clear if the interface discriminates targets in a biological context, or whether biological specificity is achieved exclusively through external factors such as subcellular localization. To discriminate these possibilities, we used an evolutionary biochemical approach to trace the evolution of paralogs S100A5 and S100A6. We first used isothermal titration calorimetry to study the binding of a collection of peptides with diverse sequence, hydrophobicity, and charge to human S100A5 and S100A6. These proteins bound distinct, but overlapping, sets of peptide targets. We then studied the peptide binding properties of S100A5 and S100A6 orthologs sampled from across five representative amniote species. We found that the pattern of binding specificity was conserved along all lineages, for the last 320 million years, despite the low specificity of each protein. We next used Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction to determine the binding specificity of the last common ancestor of the paralogs. We found the ancestor bound the whole set of peptides bound by modern S100A5 and S100A6 proteins, suggesting that paralog specificity evolved by subfunctionalization. To rule out the possibility that specificity is conserved because it is difficult to modify, we identified a single historical mutation that, when reverted in human S100A5, gave it the ability to bind an S100A6-specific peptide. These results indicate that there are strong evolutionary constraints on peptide binding specificity, and that, despite being able to bind a large number of targets, the specificity of S100 peptide interfaces is indeed important for the biology of these proteins.",

Recent studies report that TF-LCDs can undergo hydrogel formation or liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro. Here, live-cell single-molecule imaging reveals that TF-LCDs form local high concentration interaction hubs at synthetic and endogenous genomic loci. TF-LCD hubs stabilize DNA binding, recruit RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and activate transcription. LCD-LCD interactions within hubs are highly dynamic, display selectivity with binding partners, and are differentially sensitive to disruption by hexanediols. These findings suggest that under physiological conditions, rapid reversible and multivalent LCD-LCD interactions occur between TFs and the Pol II machinery, which underpins a central mechanism for transactivation and plays a key role in gene expression and disease.",

We show that these two molecules help to stabilize the activity and prevent aggregation of model proteins both in vivo and in vitro.

We used extensive, empirically-driven simulations to explore eQTL study design and the performance of various analysis strategies. Across multiple testing correction methods, false discoveries of genes with eQTLs (eGenes) were substantially inflated when false discovery rate (FDR) control was applied to all tests, and only appropriately controlled using hierarchical procedures. All multiple testing correction procedures had low power and inflated FDR for eGenes whose causal SNPs had small allele frequencies using small sample sizes (e.g. frequency <10% in 100 samples), indicating that even moderately low frequency eQTL SNPs (eSNPs) in these studies are enriched for false discoveries. In scenarios with [&ge;]80% power, the top eSNP was the true simulated eSNP 90% of the time, but substantially less frequently for very common eSNPs (minor allele frequencies >25%). Overestimation of eQTL effect sizes, so-called \\\"Winners Curse\\\", was common in low and moderate power settings. To address this, we developed a bootstrap method (BootstrapQTL) which led to more accurate effect size estimation.

    "abstract": "ObjectivesImitation is a highly conserved component of animal behavior with multifaceted connections to sociality across taxa. One intriguing consequence of imitation in primates is that it promotes positive social feedback from the imitated toward the imitator. This suggests that imitation in primates may facilitate positive social interactions, but few studies have tracked imitation in socially housed primates. Here, we designed a novel ethogram to characterize imitation between conspecifics, to better understand whether imitation is associated with affiliation between primates in a semi-natural setting.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsIn this study, 15 juvenile rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were observed at the California National Primate Research Center. Using focal sampling, frequencies of imitative events (e.g. following, postural mimicry, etc.) by the focal were observed over a course of 12 weeks. In separate observations, focal social behavior (e.g. aggression, play, etc.) was also observed.\\n\\nResultsSubjects that exhibited higher degrees of imitation were not necessarily more prosocial, but, consistent with our hypothesis, they received significantly more play overtures from social partners (p<.01). In addition, imitation rates generally decrease with age.\\n\\nConclusionsTogether, these results suggest that imitation is associated with receiving positive social behavior in a complex, semi-natural setting in primates, and that imitation may be more common in adolescence as opposed to adulthood. These preliminary results in a small sample set represent an important step in characterizing imitation in context of social interactions during development. Tracking these behaviors over time will elucidate whether imitation is directly recruiting these positive social interactions, as has been demonstrated in captivity.",

    "abstract": "With growing interest in monitoring mutational processes in normal tissues, tumor heterogeneity, and cancer evolution under therapy, the ability to accurately and economically detect ultra-rare mutations is becoming increasingly important. However, this capability has often been compromised by significant sequencing, PCR and DNA preparation error rates. Here, we describe FERMI (Fast Extremely Rare Mutation Identification) - a novel method designed to eliminate majority of these sequencing and library preparation errors in order to significantly improve rare somatic mutation detection. This method leverages barcoded targeting probes to capture and sequence DNA of interest with single copy resolution. The variant calls from the barcoded sequencing data then further filtered in a position-dependent fashion against an adaptive, context-aware null model in order to distinguish true variants. As a proof of principle, we employ FERMI to probe bone marrow biopsies from leukemia patients, and show that rare mutations and clonal evolution can be tracked throughout cancer treatment, including during historically intractable periods like minimum residual disease. Importantly, FERMI is able to accurately detect nascent clonal expansions within leukemias in a manner that may facilitate the early detection and characterization of cancer relapse.",
