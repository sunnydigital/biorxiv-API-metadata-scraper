To address this, we evolve genetically diverse populations of budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, consisting of diploid cells with unique haplotype combinations. We study the asexual evolution of these populations under selective inhibition with chemotherapeutic drugs by time-resolved whole-genome sequencing and phenotyping. All populations undergo clonal expansions driven by de novo mutations, but remain genetically and phenotypically diverse. The clones exhibit widespread genomic instability, rendering recessive de novo mutations homozygous and refining pre-existing variation. Finally, we decompose the fitness contributions of pre-existing and de novo mutations by creating a large recombinant library of adaptive mutations in an ensemble of genetic backgrounds. Both pre-existing and de novo mutations substantially contribute to fitness, and the relative fitness of pre-existing variants sets a selective threshold for new adaptive mutations.",

    "abstract": "In light of increasing terrestrial carbon (C) transport across aquatic boundaries, the mechanisms governing organic carbon (OC) oxidation along terrestrial-aquatic interfaces are crucial to future climate predictions. Here, we investigate the biochemistry, metabolic pathways, and thermodynamics corresponding to OC oxidation in the Columbia River corridor using ultra-high resolution C characterization. We leverage natural vegetative differences to encompass variation in terrestrial C inputs. Our results suggest that decreases in terrestrial C deposition associated with diminished riparian vegetation induce oxidation of physically -bound OC. We also find that contrasting metabolic pathways oxidize OC in the presence and absence of vegetation and--in direct conflict with the  priming concept--that inputs of water-soluble and thermodynamically favorable terrestrial OC protects bound-OC from oxidation. In both environments, the most thermodynamically favorable compounds appear to be preferentially oxidized regardless of which OC pool microbiomes metabolize. In turn, we suggest that the extent of riparian vegetation causes sediment microbiomes to locally adapt to oxidize a particular pool of OC, but that common thermodynamic principles govern the oxidation of each pool (i.e., water-soluble or physically-bound). Finally, we propose a mechanistic conceptualization of OC oxidation along terrestrial-aquatic interfaces that can be used to model heterogeneous patterns of OC loss under changing land cover distributions.\\n\\nKey pointsO_LIRiparian vegetation protects bound-OC stocks\\nC_LIO_LIBiochemical processes associated with OC oxidation vary with vegetation conditions\\nC_LIO_LICommon thermodynamic principles underlie OC oxidation regardless of vegetation conditions\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The unique architecture of the human connectome is defined initially by genetics and subsequently sculpted over time with experience. Thus, similarities in predisposition and experience that lead to similarities in social, biological, and cognitive attributes should also be reflected in the local architecture of white matter fascicles. Here we employ a method known as local connectome fingerprinting that uses diffusion MRI to measure the fiber-wise characteristics of macroscopic white matter pathways throughout the brain. This fingerprinting approach was applied to a large sample (N=841) of subjects from the Human Connectome Project, revealing a reliable degree of between-subject correlation in the local connectome fingerprints, with a relatively complex, low-dimensional substructure. Using a cross-validated, high-dimensional regression analysis approach, we derived local connectome phenotype (LCP) maps that could reliably predict a subset of subject attributes measured, including demographic, health and cognitive measures. These LCP maps were highly specific to the attribute being predicted but also sensitive to correlations between attributes. Collectively, these results indicate that the local architecture of white matter fascicles reflects a meaningful portion of the variability shared between subjects along several dimensions.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe local connectome is the pattern of fiber systems (i.e., number of fibers, orientation, and size) within a voxel and reflects the proximal characteristics of white matter fascicles distributed throughout the brain. Here we show how variability in the local connectome is correlated in a principled way across individuals. This inter-subject correlation is reliable enough that unique phenotype maps can be learned to predict between-subject variability in a range of social, health, and cognitive attributes. This work shows, for the first time, how shared variability across individuals is reflected in the local connectome.",

We aimed to develop diagnostic scoring systems to better predict the presence of 3GC-R EB as a cause of bacteraemia.\\n\\nMethodsA retrospective nested case-control study was performed that included patients [&ge;]18 years in whom blood cultures were obtained and intravenous antibiotics were initiated. Each patient with 3GC-R EB bacteraemia was matched to four control infection episodes within the same hospital, based on blood culture date and onset location (community or hospital). Starting from 32 described clinical risk factors at infection onset, selection strategies were used to derive scoring systems for the probability of community- and hospital-onset 3GC-R EB bacteraemia.\\n\\nResults3GC-R EB bacteraemia occurred in 90 of 22,506 (0.4%) community-onset and in 82 of 8,110 (1.0%) hospital-onset infections, and these cases were matched to 360 community-onset and 328 hospital-onset control episodes, respectively. The derived community-onset and hospital-onset scoring system consisted of 6 and 9 predictors, respectively, with c-statistics of 0.807 (95% confidence interval 0.756-0.855) and 0.842 (0.794-0.887). With selected score cutoffs, the models identified 3GC-R EB bacteraemia with equal sensitivity as existing guidelines, but reduced the proportion of patients classified as at risk for 3GC-R EB bacteraemia (i.e. eligible for empiric carbapenem therapy) with 40% in patients with community-onset and 49% in patients with hospital-onset infection.\\n\\nConclusionsThese prediction rules for 3GC-R EB bacteraemia may reduce unnecessary empiric carbapenem use.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous activity measured in human subject under the absence of any task exhibits complex patterns of correlation that largely correspond to large-scale functional topographies obtained with a wide variety of cognitive and perceptual tasks. These \\\"resting state networks\\\" (RSNs) fluctuate over time, forming and dissolving on the scale of seconds to minutes. While these fluctuations, most prominently those of the default mode network, have been linked to cognitive function, it remains unclear whether they result from random noise or whether they index a non-stationary process which could be described as state switching.\\n\\nIn this study, we use a sliding windows-approach to relate temporal dynamics of RSNs to global modulations in correlation and BOLD variance. We compare empirical data, phase-randomized surrogate data, and data simulated with a stationary model. We find that RSN time courses exhibit a large amount of coactivation in all three cases, and that the modulations in their activity are closely linked to global dynamics of the underlying BOLD signal.\\n\\nWe find that many properties of the observed fluctuations in FC and BOLD, including their ranges and their correlations amongst each other, are explained by fluctuations around the average FC structure. However, we also encounter interesting characteristics that are not explained in this way. In particular, we find that the brain spends more time in the troughs of modulations than can be expected from stationary dynamics.",

To protect against this threat of infection, bacteria and archaea have evolved a wide array of defense mechanisms, singly and in combination. While immune diversity in a single organism likely reduces the chance of pathogen evolutionary escape, it remains puzzling why many prokaryotes also have multiple, seemingly redundant, copies of the same type of immune system. Here, we focus on the highly flexible CRISPR adaptive immune system, which is present in multiple copies in a surprising 28% of the prokaryotic genomes in RefSeq. We use a comparative genomics approach looking across all prokaryotes to demonstrate that, on average, organisms are under selection to maintain more than one CRISPR array. We hypothesize that a tradeoff between memory span and learning speed could select for both \\\"long-term memory\\\" and \\\"short-term memory\\\" CRISPR arrays, and we go on to develop a mathematical model to show that such a tradeoff could, in theory, lead to selection for multiple arrays.",

    "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are one of the main causes of death and a major financial burden on the worlds economy. Due to the limitations of the animal model, computational prediction of serious, rare ADRs is invaluable. However, current state-of-the-art computational methods do not yield significantly better predictions of rare ADRs than random guessing. We present a novel method, based on the theory of \\\"compressed sensing\\\", which can accurately predict serious side-effects of candidate and market drugs. Not only is our method able to infer new chemical-ADR associations using existing noisy, biased, and incomplete databases, but our data also demonstrates that the accuracy of our approach in predicting a serious adverse reaction (ADR) for a candidate drug increases with increasing knowledge of other ADRs associated with the drug. In practice, this means that as the candidate drug moves up the different stages of clinical trials, the prediction accuracy of our method will increase accordingly. Thus, the compressed sensing based computational method reported here represents a major advance in predicting severe rare ADRs, and may facilitate reducing the time and cost of drug discovery and development.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms initiating a branching process that can lead to new species are broadly classified as chromosomal and genic. Chromosomal mechanisms are supported by breeding studies involving exchanges of individual chromosomes or their segments between mouse subspecies. There are also studies of the rapidly mutating mouse PR/SET-domain 9 (prdm9) gene, which encodes PRDM9, a protein targeting DNA recombination hotspots. When PRDM9 is bound symmetrically with equal strength, the meiotic repair of mutations in one parental strand, based on information on the allelic strand (conversion), would seem to be unbiased in discriminating between strands. So mismatches detected between pairing paternal and maternal DNA strands (heteroduplexes) undergo unbiased conversions (to homoduplexes). This leaves uncertainty on whether a mutation has been corrected or compounded. However, it has been hypothesized that tagging of mismatch regions, so that both strands are epigenetically marked as uncertain, would make it possible over numerous generations for mutations to be corrected (biased conversions) whenever asymmetry is detected. Thus, variation would decrease and members of a species would remain within its bounds. Intriguingly, new experimental studies show that, when chromosomally interpreted, PRDM9 also works through asymmetrical epigenetic labelling to confine members to species bounds. To the extent that the experimentally observed and hypothetical anti-speciation asymmetries can be related, chromosomal mechanisms are further supported.",

    "abstract": "It is an integral function of the human brain to sample novel information from the environment and to update the internal representation of the external world. The formation of new memories is assumed to be orchestrated by neuronal oscillations, the rhythmic synchronization of neuronal activity within and across cell assemblies. Specifically, successful encoding of novel information is associated with increased theta oscillations (3-8Hz) and theta coupled gamma activity (40-120Hz), and a decrease in alpha oscillations (8-12Hz). However, given the correlative nature of neurophysiological recordings, the causal role of neuronal rhythms in human memory encoding is still unclear. Here, we experimentally enhance the formation of novel memories by a visual brain stimulation at an individually adjusted theta frequency, in contrast to the stimulation at an individual alpha frequency. Critically, the memory entrainment effect by the theta stimulation was not explained by theta power per se, but was driven by visually evoked theta-gamma coupling in wide spread cortical networks. These findings provide first evidence for a functional role of the theta rhythm and the theta-gamma neuronal code in human episodic memory. Yet more strikingly, the entrainment of mnemonic network mechanisms by a simplistic visual stimulation technique provides a proof of concept that internal rhythms align with visual pacemakers, which can entrain complex cognitive functions in the wake human brain.",

In addition to the two deacetylase domains, HDAC6 has a C-terminal zinc-finger ubiquitin (Ub)-binding domain (ZnF-UBP) able to recognize free Ub. HDAC6-Ub interaction is thought to function in regulating the elimination of misfolded proteins during stress response through the aggresome pathway. Small molecules inhibiting deacetylation by HDAC6 were shown to reduce aggresomes, but the interplay between HDAC6 catalytic activity and Ub-binding function is not fully understood. Here we describe two methods to measure the HDAC6-Ub interaction in vitro using full-length HDAC6. Both methods were effective for screening inhibitors of the HDAC6-Ub protein-protein interaction independently of the catalytic activity. Our results suggest a potential role for the HDAC6 deacetylase domains in modulating HDAC6-Ub interaction. This new aspect of HDAC6 regulation can be targeted to address the roles of HDAC6-Ub interaction in normal and disease conditions.",

We show that these annotations are very strongly enriched for disease heritability across 41 independent diseases and complex traits (average N = 320K): 5.84x for GTEx eQTL, and 5.44x for eQTL, 4.27-4.28x for hQTL (H3K27ac and H3K4me1), 3.61x for sQTL and 2.81x for meQTL in BLUEPRINT (all P [&le;] 1.39e-10), far higher than enrichments obtained using stan-dard functional annotations that include all significant molecular cis-QTL (1.17-1.80x). eQTL annotations that were obtained by meta-analyzing all 44 GTEx tissues generally performed best, but tissue-specific blood eQTL annotations produced stronger enrichments for autoimmune dis-eases and blood cell traits and tissue-specific brain eQTL annotations produced stronger enrich-ments for brain-related diseases and traits, despite high cis-genetic correlations of eQTL effect sizes across tissues. Notably, eQTL annotations restricted to loss-of-function intolerant genes from ExAC were even more strongly enriched for disease heritability (17.09x; vs. 5.84x for all genes; P = 4.90e-17 for difference). All molecular QTL except sQTL remained significantly enriched for disease heritability in a joint analysis conditioned on each other and on a broad set of functional annotations from previous studies, implying that each of these annotations is uniquely informative for disease and complex trait architectures.",

Conversely, however, various technical limitations of conventional recording methods have limited its applicability to freely moving subjects, especially when they are in a group and socially interacting with each other. Here, we propose a new method to overcome these technical limitations by introducing a bioluminescent voltage indicator called LOTUS-V. Using our simple and fiber-free recording method, named \\\"SNIPA,\\\" we succeeded in capturing brain activity in freely-locomotive mice, without the need for complicated instruments. This novel method further allowed us to simultaneously record from multiple independently-locomotive animals that were interacting with one another. Further, we successfully demonstrated that the primary visual cortex was activated during the interaction. This methodology will further facilitate a wide range of studies in neurobiology and psychiatry.",

    "abstract": "More than sixty prediction methods for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) have been developed over the years, many of which are accessible on the world-wide web. Nearly, all of these predictors give balanced accuracies in the ~65% to ~80% range. Since predictors are not perfect, further studies are required to uncover the role of amino acid residues in native IDP as compared to predicted IDP regions. In the present work, we make use of sequences of 100% predicted IDP regions, false positive disorder predictions, and experimentally determined IDP regions to distinguish the characteristics of native versus predicted IDP regions. A higher occurrence of asparagine is observed in sequences of native IDP regions but not in sequences of false positive predictions of IDP regions. The occurrences of certain combinations of amino acids at the pentapeptide level provide a distinguishing feature in the IDPs with respect to globular proteins. The distinguishing features presented in this paper provide insights into the sequence fingerprints of amino acid residues in experimentally-determined as compared to predicted IDP regions. These observations and additional work along these lines should enable the development of improvements in the accuracy of disorder prediction algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In many basal metazoans both somatic and reproductive functions are performed by cellular derivatives of a single multipotent stem cell population. Reproduction can drain these stem cell pools, imposing a physiological cost with subsequent negative effects on somatic maintenance functions. In the freshwater cnidarian Hydra oligactis both asexual (budding) and sexual reproductive modes (production of resting eggs) are present, and both of these are dependent on a common pool of interstitial stem cells. Resting eggs tolerate abiotic conditions which neither the parental animals, nor asexual offspring can survive (e.g. freezing). Therefore, when facing unfavorable conditions and increased mortality risk, hydra polyps are expected to show higher differentiation of interstitial stem cells into germ cells (i.e. sexual reproduction), compared to other cell types needed for selfmaintenance or asexual reproduction. Here, by comparing sexually and asexually reproducing individuals to non-reproductives, we studied the physiological costs of reproduction (size of interstitial stem cell pools, their somatic derivatives and regeneration rate, which is dependent on these cell types) in H. oligactis polyps from a free-living Hungarian population prior to the onset of winter. Sexual individuals (but not asexuals) were characterized by significantly smaller interstitial stem cell pools, fewer somatic derivatives (nematoblasts involved in food capture) and lower regeneration ability compared to non-reproductives. We also found a negative correlation between germ cell counts and stem cell numbers in males (but not in females). These results show that the physiological costs of reproduction are higher for sexual individuals. They also suggest that increased differentiation of stem cells into gametes might limit investment into somatic functions in hydra polyps. Exhaustion of cellular resources (stem cells) could be a major mechanism behind the extreme post-reproductive senescence observed in this species.",

The dataset included a number of subjects with a substantial Finnish contribution to ancestry. We have reanalysed the same dataset after removal of these subjects and we have also included non-singleton variants of all types using a weighted burden test which assigns higher weights to variants predicted to have a greater effect on protein function. We investigated the same 31 gene sets as previously and also 1454 GO gene sets. The reduced dataset consisted of 4225 cases and 5834 controls. No individual variants or genes were significantly enriched in cases but 13 out of the 31 gene sets were significant after Bonferroni correction and the \\\"FMRP targets\\\" set produced a signed log p value (SLP) of 7.1. The gene within this set with the highest SLP, equal to 3.4, was FYN, which codes for a tyrosine kinase which phosphorylates glutamate metabotropic receptors and ionotropic NMDA receptors, thus modulating their trafficking, subcellular distribution and function. In the most recent GWAS of schizophrenia it was identified as a \\\"prioritized candidate gene\\\". Two of the subunits of the NMDA receptor which are substrates of FYN are coded for by GRIN1 (SLP=1.7) and GRIN2B (SLP=2.1). Of note, for some sets there was a substantial enrichment of non-singleton variants. Of 1454 GO gene sets, 3 were significant after Bonferroni correction. Identifying specific genes and variants will depend on genotyping them in larger samples and/or demonstrating that they cosegregate with illness within pedigrees.",

Competition among bacterial members of the nasopharynx is believed to be mediated by bacteriocins: antimicrobial toxins produced by bacteria to inhibit growth of other bacteria. Bacteriocins are also promising candidates for novel antimicrobials. Here, 14 newly-discovered bacteriocin gene clusters were identified among >6,200 pneumococcal genomes. The molecular epidemiology of the bacteriocin clusters was investigated using a large global and historical pneumococcal dataset. The analyses revealed extraordinary bacteriocin diversity among pneumococci and the majority of bacteriocin clusters were also found in other streptococcal species. Genomic hotspots for the integration of bacteriocin genes were discovered. Experimentally, bacteriocin genes were transcriptionally active when the pneumococcus was under stress and when two strains were competing in broth co-culture. These findings fundamentally expand our understanding of bacteriocins relative to intraspecies and interspecies nasopharyngeal competition.",

In the severe congenital anemia Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA), however, Csde1 expression is impaired. Reduced expression of Csde1 in healthy erythroblasts impaired their proliferation and differentiation, which suggests an important role for Csde1 in erythropoiesis. To investigate the cellular pathways controlled by Csde1 in erythropoiesis, we identified the transcripts that physically associate with Csde1 in erythroid cells. These mainly encoded proteins involved in ribogenesis, mRNA translation and protein degradation, but also proteins associated with the mitochondrial respiratory chain and mitosis. Crispr/Cas9-mediated deletion of the first cold shock domain of Csde1 affected RNA expression and/or protein expression of Csde1-bound transcripts. For instance, protein expression of Pabpc1 was enhanced while Pabpc1 mRNA expression was reduced indicating more efficient translation of Pabpc1 followed by negative feedback on mRNA stability. Overall, the effect of reduced Csde1 function on mRNA stability and translation of Csde1-bound transcripts was modest. Clones with complete loss of Csde1, however, could not be generated. We suggest that Csde1 is involved in feed-back control in protein homeostasis and that it dampens stochastic changes in mRNA expression.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the link between structure, function and development in the brain is a key topic in neuroimaging that benefits from the tremendous progress of multi-modal MRI and its computational analysis. It implies, inter alia, to be able to parcellate the brain volume or cortical surface into biologically relevant regions. These parcellations may be inferred from existing atlases (e.g. Desikan) or sets of rules, as would do a neuroanatomist for lobes, but also directly driven from the data (e.g. functional or structural connectivity) with minimum a priori. In the present work, we aimed at using the intrinsic geometric information contained in the eigenfunctions of Laplace-Beltrami Operator to obtain parcellations of the cortical surface based only on its description by triangular meshes. We proposed a framework adapted from spectral clustering, general in scope and suitable for the co-parcellation of a group of subjects. We applied it to a dataset of 62 adults, optimized it and revealed a striking agreement between parcels produced by this unsupervised clustering and Freesurfer lobes (Desikan atlas), which cannot be explained by chance. Already suitable by itself, this spectral analysis of lobes (Spanol) could conveniently be fitted into a multimodal pipeline for optimized and fast lobar segmentation. Eventually, we showed promising results of Spanol on smoother brains and notably on a dataset of 15 fetuses, with an interest for both the understanding of cortical ontogeny and the applicative field of perinatal computational neuroanatomy.",

    "abstract": "We investigated how artificial tactile feedback in the form of a skin-stretch affects perception of stiffness and grip force adjustment. During interactions with objects, information from kinesthetic and tactile sensors is used to estimate the forces acting on the limbs. These enable the perception of the mechanical properties of objects to form, and the creation of internal models to predict the consequences of interactions with these objects, such as feedforward grip-force adjustments to prevent slippage. Previous studies showed that an artificial stretch of the skin of the fingertips can produce a linear additive effect on stiffness perception, but it remains unclear how such stretch affects the control of grip force. Here, we used a robotic device and a custom-built skin-stretch device to manipulate kinesthetic and tactile information. Using a stiffness discrimination task, we found that adding artificial tactile feedback to a kinesthetic force can create the illusion of touching a harder spring which affects both perception and action. The magnitude of the illusion is linearly related to the amplitude of the applied stretch. We also isolated the contribution of tactile stimulation to the predictive and reactive components of grip force adjustment, and found that unlike in other cases of perceptual illusions, the predictive grip force is modulated consistently with the perceptual tactile-induced illusion. These results have major implications for the design of tactile interfaces across a variety of touch applications such as wearable haptic devices, teleoperations, robot-assisted surgery, and prosthetics.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSensing forces, using kinesthetic and tactile modalities, is important for assessing the mechanical properties of objects, and for acting the objects while stabilizing grasp against slippage. A major challenge in understanding the internal representations that allow for a predictive grip force control during contact with objects is to dissociate the contribution of tactile and kinesthetic stimuli. To date, this contribution was investigated only in impaired cases either through local anesthesia or in patients with sensory impairment. Our study demonstrates using a programmable mechatronic device that artificially applied skin-stretch creates an illusion of a greater load force that affects grip force control and stiffness perception. These results are applicable in tactile technologies for wearable haptic devices, teleoperation, robot-assisted surgery, and prosthetics.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of parental genome dosage is of fundamental importance in animals and plants, exemplified by X chromosome inactivation and dosage compensation. The \\\"triploid block\\\" is a classical example of dosage regulation in plants that establishes a reproductive barrier between species differing in chromosome number 1,2. This barrier acts in the endosperm, an ephemeral tissue that nurtures the developing embryo and induces the abortion of hybrid seeds through a yet unknown mechanism. Interploidy hybridizations involving diploid (2x) maternal parents and tetraploid (4x) pollen donors cause failure in endosperm cellularization, leading to embryo arrest 3. Here we show that paternal epigenetically activated small interfering RNAs (easiRNAs) are responsible for the establishment of the triploid block-associated seed abortion in Arabidopsis thaliana. Paternal loss of the plant-specific RNA polymerase IV suppressed easiRNA formation and rescued triploid seeds by restoring small RNA-directed DNA methylation at transposable elements (TEs), correlating with reduced expression of paternally expressed imprinted genes (PEGs). We propose that excess of paternally derived easiRNAs in diploid pollen prevents establishment of DNA methylation, leading to triploid seed abortion. Our data further suggest that easiRNAs form a quantitative signal for chromosome number and their balanced dosage is required for post-fertilization genome stability and seed viability.",

Transposable elements can promote hybridity through maternal small RNA2, and have been postulated to regulate dosage response via neighboring imprinted genes3,4.

    "abstract": "Ras proteins play vital roles in numerous biological processes and Ras mutations are found in many human tumors. Understanding how Ras proteins are regulated is important for elucidating cell signaling pathways and identifying new targets for treating human diseases. Here we report that one of the K-Ras splice variants, K-Ras4a, is subject to lysine fatty acylation, a previously under-studied protein post-translational modification. Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), one of the mammalian nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent lysine deacylases, catalyzes the removal of fatty acylation from K-Ras4a. We further demonstrate that SIRT2-mediated lysine defatty-acylation promotes endomembrane localization of K-Ras4a, enhances its interaction with A-Raf, and thus promotes cellular transformation. Our study identifies lysine fatty acylation as a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for the Ras family of GTPases that is distinct from cysteine fatty acylation. These findings highlight the biological significance of lysine fatty acylation and sirtuin-catalyzed protein lysine defatty-acylation.",

    "abstract": "In heterogametic organisms, expression of unequal number of X chromosomes in males and females is balanced by a process called dosage compensation. In Drosophila and mammals, dosage compensation involves nearly two-fold up-regulation of the X chromosome mediated by dosage compensation complex (DCC). Experimental studies on the role of DCC on RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription in mammals disclosed a non-linear relationship between Pol II densities at different transcription steps and mRNA expression. An ~20-30% increase in Pol II densities corresponds to a rough 200% increase in mRNA expression and two-fold up-regulation. Here, using a simple kinetic model of Pol II transcription calibrated by in vivo measured rate constants of different transcription steps in mammalian cells, we demonstrate how this non-linearity can be explained by multi-step transcriptional regulation. Moreover, we show how multi-step enhancement of Pol II transcription can increase mRNA production while leaving Pol II densities unaffected. Our theoretical analysis not only recapitulates experimentally observed Pol II densities upon two-fold up-regulation but also points to a limitation of inferences based on Pol II profiles from chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) or global run-on assays.",

    "abstract": "In many taxa, there is a conflict between the sexes over mating rate. The outcome of sexually antagonistic coevolution depends on the costs of mating and natural selection against sexually antagonistic traits. A sexually transmitted infection (STI) changes the relative strength of these costs. We study the three-way evolutionary interaction between male persistence, female resistance, and STI virulence for two types of STIs: a viability-reducing STI and a reproduction-reducing STI. A viability-reducing STI escalates conflict between the sexes. This leads to increased STI virulence (i.e., full coevolution) if the costs of sexually antagonistic traits occur through viability but not if the costs occur through reproduction. In contrast, a reproduction-reducing STI de-escalates the sexual conflict but STI virulence does not coevolve in response. We also investigated the establishment probability of STIs under different combinations of evolvability. Successful invasion by a viability-reducing STI becomes less likely if hosts (but not parasite) are evolvable, especially if only the female trait can evolve. A reproduction-reducing STI can almost always invade because it does not kill its host. We discuss how the evolution of host and parasite traits in a system with sexual conflict differ from a system with female mate choice.",

    "abstract": "The infertility of hybrids between closely related species is one of the reproductive isolation mechanisms leading to speciation. Prdm9, the only known vertebrate hybrid sterility gene causes failure of meiotic chromosome synapsis and infertility in male hybrids between mouse strains derived from two mouse subspecies. Within species Prdm9 determines the sites of programmed DNA double-strand breaks and meiotic recombination hotspots. To investigate the relation between Prdm9-controlled meiotic arrest and asynapsis, we inserted random stretches of consubspecific homology on several autosomal pairs in sterile hybrids and analyzed their ability to form synaptonemal complexes and rescue male fertility. Twenty-seven or more Mb of consubspecific homology fully restored synapsis in a given autosomal pair and we predicted that two symmetric DSBs or more per chromosome are necessary for successful meiosis. We hypothesize that impaired recombination between evolutionary diverged homologous chromosomes could function as one of the mechanisms of hybrid sterility occurring in various sexually reproducing species.",

    "abstract": "Erythropoiesis is regulated at many levels, including control of mRNA translation. Changing environmental conditions, such as hypoxia, or the availability of nutrients and growth factors, require a rapid response enacted by the enhanced or repressed translation of existing transcripts. Csde1 is an RNA-binding protein required for erythropoiesis and strongly upregulated in erythroblasts relative to other hematopoietic progenitors. The aim of this study is to identify the Csde1-containing protein complexes, and investigate their role in regulating the translation of Csde1-bound transcripts. We show that Strap, also called Unrip, was the protein most strongly associated with Csde1 in erythroblasts. Strap is a WD40 protein involved in signaling and RNA splicing, but its role is unknown when associated with Csde1. Reduced expression of Strap did not alter the pool of transcripts bound by Csde1. Instead, it reduced the mRNA and/or protein expression of several Csde1-bound transcript, that encode for proteins essential for translational regulation during hypoxia, such as Hmbs, eIF4g3 and Pabpc4. Also affected by Strap knockdown were Vim, a Gata-1 target crucial for erythrocyte enucleation, and Elavl1, which stabilizes Gata-1 mRNA. Thus, we found that the Csde1/Strap complex is at the crossroad of multiple pathways governing translation in erythroblasts.",

    "abstract": "Neural circuit-based guidance for optimizing patient screening, target selection and parameter tuning for deep brain stimulation (DBS) remains limited. To this end, we propose a functional brain connectome-based modeling approach that simulates network-spreading effects of stimulating different brain regions and quantifies rectification of abnormal network topology in silico. We validate these analyses by predicting nuclei in basal-ganglia circuits as top-ranked targets for 43 local patients with Parkinsons disease and 90 patients from public database. However, individual connectome-based predictions demonstrate that globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus (STN) constituted as the best choice for 21.1% and 19.5% of patients, respectively. Notably, the priority rank of STN significantly correlated with motor symptom severity in the local cohort. By introducing whole-brain network diffusion dynamics, these findings unfold a new dimension of brain connectomics and underscore the importance of neural network modeling for personalized DBS therapy, which warrants experimental investigation to validate its clinical utility.",
