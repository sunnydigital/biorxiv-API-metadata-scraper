    "abstract": "Important neurochemical variations between strains or linages which correlate with behavioral differences have been identified in different species. Here, we report neurochemical and behavioral differences in four common zebrafish wild-type phenotypes (blue shortfin, longfin stripped, leopard and albino). Leopad zebrafish have been shown to display increased scototaxis in relation to the other strains, while both albino and leopard zebrafish show increased geotaxis. Moreover, leopard displayed increased nocifensive behavior, while albino zebrafish showed increased neophobia in the novel object task. Longfin zebrafish showed decreased turn frequency in both the novel tank and light/dark tests, and habituated faster in the novel tank, as well as displaying increased 5-HT levels. Leopard zebrafish showed decreased brain 5-HT levels and increased 5-HT turnover than other strains, and albino had increased brain DA levels. Finally, specific behavioral endpoints co-varied in terms of the behavioral and neurochemical differences between strains, identifying cross-test domains which included response to novelty, exploration-avoidance, general arousal, and activity.",

    "abstract": "Sexual selection is well recognized as a driver of reproductive isolation between lineages. However, selection for increased reproductive isolation could reciprocally change the outcomes of sexual selection, when these processes share a genetic basis. Direct selection for reproductive isolation occurs in the context of  reinforcement, where selection acts to increase prezygotic barriers to reduce the cost of heterospecific matings. Many studies of reinforcement focus on premating reproductive barriers, however postmating traits-such as conspecific sperm precedence (CSP)-can also respond to reinforcing selection. We tested whether i) CSP responded to reinforcing selection, and ii) this response in sympatric populations altered intraspecific sperm competition (ISC) and the strength of sexual selection, with the sister species Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. We used sperm competition experiments to evaluate differences in CSP and ISC between two sympatric and two allopatric populations of D. pseudoobscura. Using multiple genotypes for each population allowed us to estimate not only patterns of phenotype divergence, but also the opportunity for sexual selection within each population. Consistent with a pattern of reinforcement, the sympatric populations had higher mean CSP. Moreover, ISC was altered in sympatric populations, where we observed decreased average offensive sperm competitive ability against conspecific males, allowing less opportunity for sexual selection to operate within these populations. These data demonstrate that strong reinforcing selection for reproductive isolation can have consequences for sexual selection and sexual interactions within species, in these important postmating sperm competition traits.",

We will introduce Gaussian processes which generate distributions over functions used for Bayesian non-parametric regression, and demonstrate their use in applications and didactic examples including simple regression problems, a demonstration of kernel-encoded prior assumptions and compositions, a pure exploration scenario within an optimal design framework, and a bandit-like exploration-exploitation scenario where the goal is to recommend movies.

The current study aimed to understand the developmental signaling cues that regulate bud tip progenitor cells in the human fetal lung, which are present during branching morphogenesis, and to use this information to induce a bud tip progenitor-like population from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in vitro. We identified that FGF7, CHIR-99021 and RA maintained isolated human fetal lung epithelial bud tip progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state in vitro, and led to the induction of a 3-dimensional lung-like epithelium from hPSCs. 3-dimensional hPSC-derived lung tissue was initially patterned, with airway-like interior domains and bud tip-like progenitor domains at the periphery. Epithelial bud tip-like domains could be isolated, expanded and maintained as a nearly homogeneous population by serial passaging. Comparisons between human fetal lung epithelial bud tip cells and hPSC-derived bud tip-like cells were carried out using immunostaining, in situ hybridization and transcriptome-wide analysis, and revealed that in vitro derived tissue was highly similar to native lung. hPSC-derived epithelial bud tip-like structures survived in vitro for over 16 weeks, could be easily frozen and thawed and maintained multi-lineage potential. Furthermore, hPSC-derived epithelial bud tip progenitors successfully engrafted in the proximal airways of injured immunocompromised NSG mouse lungs, where they persisted for up to 6 weeks and gave rise to several lung epithelial lineages.",

    "abstract": "Somatic copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in development of many human cancers. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined haplotype-phased allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). To improve runtime performance, Bamgineer introduces the desired CNVs in parallel using queuing and parallel processing on a local machine or on a high-performance computing cluster. As proof-of-principle, we applied Bamgineer to a single high-coverage (mean: 220X) exome sequence file from a blood sample to simulate copy number profiles of 3 exemplar tumours from each of 10 tumour types at 5 tumour cellularity levels (20-100%, 150 BAM files in total). In addition to these reference sets, we expect Bamgineer to be of use for systematic benchmarking of CNV calling algorithms using their own data and expected tumour content for a variety of applications.

    "abstract": "Animals are able to reach a desired state in an environment by controlling various behavioral patterns. Identification of the behavioral strategy used for this control is important for understanding animals decision-making and is fundamental to dissect information processing done by the nervous system. However, methods for quantifying such behavioral strategies have not been fully established. In this study, we developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify an animals behavioral strategy from behavioral time-series data. As a particular target, we applied this framework to C. elegans thermotactic behavior; after cultivation at a constant temperature with or without food, the fed and starved worms prefer and avoid from the cultivation temperature on a thermal gradient, respectively. Our IRL approach revealed that the fed worms used both absolute and temporal derivative of temperature and that their strategy comprised mixture of two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). The DM is a strategy that the worms efficiently reach to specific temperature, which explained thermotactic behaviors of the fed worms. The IM is a strategy that the worms track along a constant temperature, which reflects isothermal tracking well observed in previous studies. We also showed the neural basis underlying the strategies, by applying our method to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. In contrast to fed animals, the strategy of starved animals indicated that they escaped the cultivation temperature using only absolute, but not temporal derivative of temperature. Thus, our IRL-based approach is capable of identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and will be applicable to wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making of other organisms.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding animal decision-making has been a fundamental problem in neuroscience and behavioral ecology. Many studies analyze actions that represent decision-making in behavioral tasks, in which rewards are artificially designed with specific objectives. However, it is impossible to extend this artificially designed experiment to a natural environment, because in a natural environment, the rewards for freely-behaving animals cannot be clearly defined. To this end, we must reverse the current paradigm so that rewards are identified from behavioral data. Here, we propose a new reverse-engineering approach (inverse reinforcement learning) that can estimate a behavioral strategy from time-series data of freely-behaving animals. By applying this technique with thermotaxis in C. elegans, we successfully identified the reward-based behavioral strategy.",

    "abstract": "Extensively drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (XDR-KP) infections cause high mortality and are disseminating globally. Identifying the genetic basis underpinning resistance allows for rapid diagnosis and treatment. XDR isolates sourced from Greece and Brazil, including nineteen polymyxin-resistant and five polymyxin-susceptible strains, underwent whole genome sequencing. Approximately 90% of polymyxin resistance was enabled by alterations upstream or within mgrB. The most common mutation identified was an insertion at nucleotide position 75 in mgrB via an ISKpn26-like element in the ST258 lineage and ISKpn13 in one ST11 isolate. Three strains acquired an IS1 element upstream of mgrB and another strain had an ISKpn25 insertion at 133 bp. Other isolates had truncations (C28STOP, Q30STOP) or a missense mutation (D31E) affecting mgrB. Complementation assays revealed all mgrB perturbations contributed to resistance. Missense mutations in phoQ (T281M, G385C) were also found to facilitate resistance. Several variants in phoPQ co-segregating with the ISKpn26-like insertion were identified as potential partial suppressor mutations. Three ST258 samples were found to contain subpopulations with different resistance conferring mutations, including the ISKpn26-like insertion colonising with a novel mutation in pmrB (P158R), both confirmed via complementation assays. We also characterized a new multi-drug resistant Klebsiella quasipneumoniae strain ST2401 which was susceptible to polymyxins. These findings highlight the broad spectrum of chromosomal modifications which can facilitate and regulate resistance against polymyxins in K. pneumoniae.\\n\\nDATA SUMMARYO_LIWhole genome sequencing of the 24 clinical isolates has been deposited under BioProject PRJNA307517 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA307517).\\nC_LI\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTKlebsiella pneumoniae contributes to a high abundance of nosocomial infections and the rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance hinders treatment. Polymyxins are predominantly utilized to treat multidrug-resistant infections, however, resistance to the polymyxins is arising. This increasing prevalence in polymyxin resistance is evident especially in Greece and Brazil. Identifying the genomic variations conferring resistance in clinical isolates from these regions assists with potentially detecting novel alterations and tracing the spread of particular strains. This study commonly found mutations in the gene mgrB, the negative regulator of PhoPQ, known to cause resistance in KP. In the remaining isolates, missense mutations in phoQ were accountable for resistance. Multiple novel mutations were detected to be segregating with mgrB perturbations. This was either due to a mixed heterogeneous sample of two polymyxin-resistant strains, or because of multiple mutations within the same strain. Of interest was the validation of novel mutations inphoPQ segregating with a previously known ISKpn26-like element in disrupted mgrB isolates. Complementation of these phoPQ mutations revealed a reduction in minimum inhibitory concentrations and suggests the first evidence of partial suppressor mutations in KP. This research builds upon our current understanding of heteroresistance, lineage specific mutations and regulatory variations relating to polymyxin resistance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSeveral non-chlamydial microbial pathogens are associated with clinical signs of active trachoma in trachoma-endemic communities with a low prevalence of ocular Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infection. In the Solomon Islands, the prevalence of Ct among children is low despite the prevalence of active trachoma being moderate. We therefore set out to investigate whether active trachoma was associated with a common non-chlamydial infection or with a dominant polymicrobial community dysbiosis in the Solomon Islands.\\n\\nMethodsWe studied DNA from conjunctival swabs collected from 257 Solomon Islanders with active trachoma and matched controls. Droplet digital PCR was used to test for pathogens suspected to be able to induce follicular conjunctivitis. Polymicrobial community diversity and composition were studied by sequencing of hypervariable regions of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene in a subset of 54 cases and 53 controls.\\n\\nResultsAlthough Ct was associated with active trachoma, the number of infections was low (cases: 3.9%, controls: 0.4%). Estimated prevalence (cases, controls) of each non-chlamydial infection was as follows: S. aureus (1.9%, 1.9%), Adenoviridae (1.2%, 1.2%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (5.8%, 4.3%), H. influenzae (7.4%, 11.7%), M. catarrhalis (2.3%, 4.7%) and S. pneumoniae (7.0%, 6.2%). There was no statistically significant association between clinical signs of trachoma and presence or load of any of the non-Ct infections that were assayed. Inter-individual variations in the conjunctival microbiome were characterised by differences in the levels of Corynebacterium, Proprionibacterium, Helicobacter and Paracoccus, but diversity and relative abundance of these specific genera did not differ significantly between cases and controls.\\n\\nDiscussionIt is unlikely that the prevalent trachoma-like follicular conjunctivitis in the Solomon Islands has a dominant bacterial aetiology. Before implementing community-wide azithromycin distribution for trachoma, policy makers should consider that clinical signs of trachoma can be observed in the absence of any detectable azithromycin-susceptible organism.",

However, the integration of various sources of information remains a challenge for systems biology since produced datasets are often of heterogeneous types, with the need of developing generic methods to take their different specificities into account.\\n\\nWe propose a multiple kernel framework that allows to integrate multiple datasets of various types into a single exploratory analysis. Several solutions are provided to learn either a consensus meta-kernel or a meta-kernel that preserves the original topology of the datasets. We applied our framework to analyse two public multi-omics datasets. First, the multiple metagenomic datasets, collected during the TARA Oceans expedition, was explored to demonstrate that our method is able to retrieve previous findings in a single KPCA as well as to provide a new image of the sample structures when a larger number of datasets are included in the analysis. To perform this analysis, a generic procedure is also proposed to improve the interpretability of the kernel PCA in regards with the original data. Second, the multi-omics breast cancer datasets, provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas, is analysed using a kernel Self-Organizing Maps with both single and multi-omics strategies. The comparison of this two approaches demonstrates the benefit of our integration method to improve the representation of the studied biological system.\\n\\nProposed methods are available in the R package mixKernel, released on CRAN.

    "abstract": "Spike-timing patterns - crucial for synaptic plasticity and neural computation - are often modeled as Poisson-like random processes, log-normal distribution or gamma-distribution patterns, each with different underlying assumptions that may or may not be biologically true. However, it is not entirely clear whether (and how well) these different models would or would not capture spike-timing statistical patterns across different neurons, regions, animal species and cognitive states. Here, we examine statistical patterns of spike-timing irregularity in 13 different cortical and subcortical regions from mouse, hamster, cat and monkey brains. In contrast to the widely-assumed Poisson or log-normal distribution patterns, we show that spike-timing patterns of various projection neurons-including cortical excitatory principal cells, hippocampal pyramidal cells, inhibitory striatal medium spiny neurons and dopaminergic neurons, as well as fast-spiking interneurons - all invariantly conform to the gamma-distribution model. While higher regularity in spike-timing patterns are observed in a few cases, such as mouse DA neurons and monkey motor cortical neurons, there is no clear tendency in increased firing regularity from the sensory and subcortical neurons to prefrontal or motor cortices, as previously entertained. Moreover, gamma shapes of spike-timing patterns remain robust over various natural cognitive states, such as sleep, awake periods, or during fearful episodic experiences. Interestingly, ketamine-induced general anesthesia or unconsciousness is associated with the breakdown of forebrain spike patterns from a singular gamma distribution into two distinct subtypes of gamma distributions, suggesting the importance of this spike-timing pattern in supporting natural cognitive states. These results suggest that gamma-distribution patterns of spike timing reflect not only a fundamental property conserved across different neurons, regions and animal species, but also an operation crucial for supporting natural cognitive states. Such gamma-distribution-based spike-timing patterns can also have important implications for real-time neural coding and realistic neuromorphic computing.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is caused by the collapse of substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the midbrain (MB), while other DA populations remain relatively intact. Common variation influencing susceptibility to sporadic PD has been primarily identified through genome wide association studies (GWAS). However, like many other common genetic diseases, the genes impacted by common PD-associated variation remain to be elucidated. Here, we used single-cell RNA-seq to characterize DA neuron populations in the mouse brain at embryonic and early postnatal timepoints. These data allow for the unbiased identification of DA neuron subpopulations, including a novel postnatal neuroblast population and SN DA neurons. Comparison of SN DA neurons with other DA neurons populations in the brain reveals a unique transcriptional profile, novel marker genes, and specific gene regulatory networks. By integrating these cell population specific data with published GWAS, we develop a scoring system for prioritizing candidate genes in PD-associated loci. With this, we prioritize candidate genes in all 32 GWAS intervals implicated in sporadic PD risk, the first such systematically generated list. From this we confirm that the prioritized candidate gene CPLX1 disrupts the nigrostriatal pathway when knocked out in mice. Ultimately, this systematic rationale leads to the identification of biologically pertinent candidates and testable hypotheses for sporadic PD that will inform a new era of PD genetic research.",

    "abstract": "We present the molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), characterizing nearly 1,000 participants in Childrens Oncology Group (COG) AML trials. The COG/NCI TARGET AML initiative assessed cases by whole-genome, targeted DNA, mRNA, miRNA sequencing and CpG methylation profiling. Validated DNA variants revealed diverse, infrequent mutations with fewer than 40 genes mutated in >2% of cases. In contrast, somatic structural variants, including novel gene fusions and focal MBNL1, ZEB2, and ELF1 deletions, were disproportionately prevalent in young as compared to adult patients. Conversely, DNMT3A and TP53 mutations, common in adults, are conspicuously absent from virtually all pediatric cases. Novel GATA2, FLT3, and CBL mutations, recurrent MYC-ITD, NRAS, KRAS, and WT1 mutations are frequent in pediatric AML. Deletions, mutations, and promoter DNA hypermethylation convergently impact Wnt signaling, Polycomb repression, innate immune cell interactions, and a cluster of zinc finger genes associated with KMT2A rearrangements. These results highlight the need for, and facilitate the development of age-tailored targeted therapies for the treatment of pediatric AML.",

    "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is common on Earth, forms the major commercial natural gas reservoirs, and is a key component of the global carbon cycle, but its natural sources are not well-characterized. We present a geochemical dataset acquired from a red wood-ant (RWA; Formica polyctena) nest in the Neuwied Basin, a part of the East Eifel Volcanic Field (EEVF), focusing on methane (CH4), stable carbon isotope of methane ({delta}13C-CH4), RWA activity patterns, earthquakes, and earth tides. Nest gas and ambient air were continuously sampled in-situ and analyzed to detect microbial, thermogenic, and abiotic fault-related micro-seepage. Methane degassing was not synchronized with earth tides. Elevated CH4 concentrations in nest gas appear to result from a combination of microbial activity and fault-related emissions moving via through fault networks through the RWA nest. Two {delta}13C-CH4 signatures were identified in nest gas: -69{per thousand} and -37{per thousand}. The -69{per thousand} signature of {delta}13C-CH4 within the RWA nest is attributed to microbial decomposition of organic matter. This finding supports previous findings that RWA nests are hot-spots of microbial CH4. Additionally, the -37% {delta}13C-CH4 signature is the first evidence that RWA nests also serve as traps for fault-related emissions of CH4. The -37{per thousand} {delta}13C-CH4 signature can be attributed either to thermogenic/fault-related or to abiotic/fault-related CH4 formation originating from e.g. low-temperature gas-water-rock reactions in a continental setting at shallow depths (microseepage). Sources of these micro-seeps could be Devonian schists (\\\"Sphaerosiderith Schiefer\\\") with iron concretions (\\\"Eisengallen\\\"), sandstones, or the iron-bearing \\\"Klerf Schichten\\\". We cannot exclude overlapping micro-seepage of magmatic CH4 from the Eifel plume. Given the abundance of RWA nests on the landscape, their role as sources of microbial CH4 and traps for abiotically-derived CH4 should be included in estimation of methane emissions that are contributing to climatic change.",

    "abstract": "The progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with marked alterations in circulating immune cell populations, but no studies have characterized alterations in these cell types across the full spectrum of lung function impairment in current and former smokers. In 6,299 subjects from the COPDGene and ECLIPSE studies, we related Coulter blood counts and proportions to cross-sectional FEV1 adjusting for current smoking status. We also related cell count measures to three-year change in FEV1 in ECLIPSE subjects. In a subset of subjects with blood gene expression data, we used cell type deconvolution methods to infer the proportions of immune cell subpopulations, and we related these to COPD clinical status. We observed that FEV1 levels are positively correlated with lymphocytes and negatively correlated with myeloid populations such as neutrophils and monocytes. In multivariate models, absolute cell counts and proportions were associated with cross-sectional FEV1, and lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophil counts were predictive of three-year change in lung function. Using cell type deconvolution to study immune cell subpopulations, we observed that subjects with COPD had a lower proportion of CD4+ resting memory cells and naive B cells compared to non-COPD smokers. Alterations in circulating immune cells in COPD support a mixed pattern of lymphocyte suppression and an enhanced myeloid cell immune response. Cell counts and proportions contribute independent information to models predicting lung function suggesting a critical role for immune response in long-term COPD outcomes. Cell type deconvolution is a promising method for immunophenotyping in large cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Here we have proposed the functional space hypothesis, positing that mutational target size scales with genome size, impacting the number, source, and genomic location of beneficial mutations that contribute to adaptation. Though motivated by preliminary evidence, mostly from Arabidopsis and maize, more data are needed before any rigorous assessment of the hypothesis can be made. If correct, the functional space hypothesis suggests that we should expect plants with large genomes to exhibit more functional mutations outside of genes, more regulatory variation, and likely less signal of strong selective sweeps reducing diversity. These differences have implications for how we study the evolution and development of plant genomes, from where we should look for signals of adaptation to what patterns we expect adaptation to leave in genetic diversity or gene expression data. While flowering plant genomes vary across more than three orders of magnitude in size, most studies of both functional and evolutionary genomics have focused on species at the extreme small edge of this scale. Our hypothesis predicts that methods and results from these small genomes may not replicate well as we begin to explore large plant genomes. Finally, while we have focused here on evidence from plant genomes, we see no a priori reason why similar arguments might not hold in other taxa as well.",

    "abstract": "Individual cells of the bacterium Proteus mirabilis can elongate up to 40-fold on surfaces before engaging in a cooperative surface-based motility termed swarming. How cells regulate this dramatic morphological remodeling remains an open question. In this paper, we move forward the understanding of this regulation by demonstrating that P. mirabilis requires the gene rffG for swarmer cell elongation and subsequent swarm motility. The rffG gene encodes a protein homologous to the dTDP-glucose 4,6 dehydratase protein of Escherichia coli, which contributes to Enterobacterial Common Antigen biosynthesis. Here we characterize the rffG gene in P. mirabilis, demonstrating that it is required for the production of large lipopolysaccharide-linked moieties necessary for wild-type cell envelope integrity. We show that absence of the rffG gene induces several stress-responsive pathways including those controlled by the transcriptional regulators RpoS, CaiF, and RcsB. We further show that in rffG-deficient cells, suppression of the Rcs phosphorelay, via loss of RcsB, is sufficient to induce cell elongation and swarm motility. However, loss of RcsB does not rescue cell envelope integrity defects and instead results in abnormally shaped cells, including cells producing more than two poles. We conclude that a RcsB-mediated response acts to suppress emergence of shape defects in cell envelope-compromised cells, suggesting an additional role for RcsB in maintaining cell morphology under stress conditions. We further propose that the composition of the cell envelope acts as a checkpoint before cells initiate swarmer cell elongation and motility.\\n\\nImportance statementP. mirabilis swarm motility has been implicated in pathogenesis. We have found that cells deploy multiple uncharacterized strategies to handle cell envelope stress beyond the Rcs phosphorelay when attempting to engage in swarm motility. While RcsB is known to directly inhibit the master transcriptional regulator for swarming, we have shown an additional role for RcsB in protecting cell morphology. These data support a growing appreciation that the Rcs phosphorelay is a multi-functional regulator of cell morphology in addition to its role in microbial stress responses. These data also strengthen the paradigm that outer membrane composition is a crucial checkpoint for modulating entry into swarm motility. Furthermore, the rffG-dependent moieties provide a novel, attractive target for potential antimicrobials.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneously occurring mutations are of great relevance in diverse fields including biochemistry, oncology, evolutionary biology, and human genetics. Studies in experimental systems have identified a multitude of mutational mechanisms including DNA replication infidelity as well as many forms of DNA damage followed by inefficient repair or replicative bypass. However, the relative contributions of these mechanisms to human germline mutations remain completely unknown. Here, based on the mutational asymmetry with respect to the direction of replication and transcription, we suggest that error-prone damage bypass on the lagging strand plays a major role in human mutagenesis. Asymmetry with respect to transcription is believed to be mediated by the action of transcription-coupled DNA repair (TC-NER). TC-NER selectively repairs DNA lesions on the transcribed strand; as a result, lesions on the non-transcribed strand are preferentially converted into mutations. In human polymorphism we detect a striking similarity between transcriptional asymmetry and asymmetry with respect to replication fork direction. This parallels the observation that damage-induced mutations in human cancers accumulate asymmetrically with respect to the direction of replication, suggesting that DNA lesions are asymmetrically resolved during replication. Re-analysis of XR-seq data, Damage-seq data and cancers with defective NER corroborate the preferential error-prone bypass of DNA lesions on the lagging strand. We experimentally demonstrate that replication delay greatly attenuates the mutagenic effect of UV-irradiation, in line with the key role of replication in conversion of DNA damage to mutations. We conservatively estimate that at least 10% of human germline mutations arise due to DNA damage rather than replication infidelity. The number of these damage-induced mutations is expected to scale with the number of replications and, consequently, paternal age.",

    "abstract": "The centrosome serves as the main microtubule-organizing center in metazoan cells, yet despite its functional importance, little is known mechanistically about the structure and organizational principles that dictate protein organization in the centrosome. In particular, the protein-protein interactions that allow for the massive structural transition between the tightly organized interphase centrosome and the highly expanded matrix-like arrangement of the mitotic centrosome have been largely uncharacterized. Among the proteins that undergo a major transition is the Drosophila melanogaster protein centrosomin that contains a conserved carboxyl terminus motif, CM2. Recent crystal structures have shown this motif to be dimeric and capable of forming an intramolecular interaction with a central region of centrosomin. Here we use a combination of in-cell microscopy and in vitro oligomer assessment to show that dimerization is not necessary for CM2 recruitment to the centrosome and that CM2 alone undergoes a significant cell cycle dependent rearrangement. We use NMR binding assays to confirm this intramolecular interaction and show that residues involved in solution interactions are consistent with the published crystal structure and identify L1137 as critical for binding. Additionally, we show for the first time an in vitro interaction of CM2 with the Drosophila pericentrin-like-protein that exploits the same set of residues as the intramolecular interaction. Furthermore, NMR experiments reveal a calcium sensitive interaction between CM2 and calmodulin. Although unexpected because of sequence divergence, this suggests that centrosomin-mediated assemblies, like the mammalian pericentrin, may be calcium regulated. From these results we suggest a model where during interphase CM2 interacts with pericentrin-like-protein to form a layer of centrosomin around the centriole wall and that at the onset of mitosis this population acts as a nucleation site of intramolecular centrosomin interactions that support the expansion into the metaphase matrix.",

    "abstract": "The photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle, or Calvin-Benson-Bassham Cycle, is now contained in every standard biochemistry textbook. Although the cycle was already proposed in 1954, it is still subject of intense research, and even the structure of the cycle, i.e. the exact series of reactions, is still under debate. The controversy about the cycles structure was fuelled by the findings of Gibbs and Kandler in 1956 and 1957, when they observed that radioactive 14CO2 was dynamically incorporated in hexoses in a very atypical and asymmetrical way, a phenomenon later termed the  photosynthetic Gibbs effect. Now, it is widely accepted that the photosynthetic Gibbs effect is not in contradiction to the reaction scheme proposed by Calvin, Benson and Bassham, but the arguments given have been largely qualitative and hand-waving. To fully appreciate the controversy and to understand the difficulties in interpreting the Gibbs effect, it is illustrative to illuminate the history of the discovery of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham Cycle. We here give an account of central scientific advances and discoveries, which were essential prerequisites for the elucidation of the cycle. Placing the historic discoveries in the context of the modern textbook pathway scheme illustrates the complexity of the cycle and demonstrates why especially dynamic labelling experiments are far from easy to interpret. We conclude by arguing that only mathematical models based on a sound theory are capable of resolving conflicting interpretations and providing a consistent quantitative explanation.",

    "abstract": "The 3D organization of chromosome is crucial for regulating gene expression and cell function. Many experimental and polymer modeling efforts are dedicated to deciphering the mechanistic principles behind chromosome folding. Chromosomes are long and densely packed - topologically constrained - polymers. The main challenge is therefore to develop adequate models and simulation methods to investigate properly the multi spatio-temporal scales of such macromolecules. Here, we discussed a generic strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice. Accounting accurately for the polymer entanglement length and the volumic density, we show that our simulation scheme not only captures the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system but also tracks the same dynamics at different coarse-graining. This strategy allows a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency and offers a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes and to go beyond the current limitations by studying long chromosomes during an extended time period with good statistics. We use our formalism to investigate in details the time evolution of the 3D organization of chromosome 3R (20 Mbp) in drosophila during one cell cycle (20 hours). We show that a combination of our coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduce experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predict that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle.",

Complete genome assemblies are available for fewer than ten strains of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the primary cause of Lyme disease in North America. MM1 is a sensu stricto strain originally isolated in the midwestern United States. Aside from a small number of genes, the complete genome sequence of this strain has not been reported. Here we present the complete genome sequence of MM1 in relation to other sensu stricto strains and in terms of its Multi Locus Sequence Typing. Our results indicate that MM1 is a new sequence type which contains a conserved main chromosome and 15 plasmids. Our results include the first contiguous 28.5 kb assembly of lp28-8, a linear plasmid carrying the vls antigenic variation system, from a Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto strain.",

    "abstract": "Many areas of research suffer from poor reproducibility. This problem is particularly acute in computationally intensive domains where results rely on a series of complex methodological decisions that are not well captured by traditional publication approaches. Various guidelines have emerged for achieving reproducibility, but practical implementation of these practices remains difficult. This is because reproducing published computational analyses requires installing many software tools plus associated libraries, connecting tools together into the complete pipeline, and specifying parameters. Here we present a suite of recently emerged technologies which make computational reproducibility not just possible, but, finally, practical in both time and effort. By combining a system for building highly portable packages of bioinformatics software, containerization and virtualization technologies for isolating reusable execution environments for these packages, and an integrated workflow system that automatically orchestrates the composition of these packages for entire pipelines, an unprecedented level of computational reproducibility can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "The African parasitoid wasp Cotesia sesamiae is structured in contrasted populations showing differences in host range and the recent discovery of a specialist related species, C. typhae, provide a good framework to study the mechanisms that link the parasitoid and their host range. To investigate the genomic bases of divergence between these populations, we used a targeted sequencing approach on 24 samples. We targeted a specific genomic region encoding the bracovirus, which is deeply involved in the interaction with the host. High sequencing coverage was obtained for all samples allowing the study of genetic variations between wasp populations and species. Combining population genetic estimations, the diversity ({pi}), the relative differentiation (FST) and the absolute differentiation (dxy), and branch-site dN/dS measures, we identified six divergent genes impacted by positive selection belonging to different gene families. These genes are potentially involved in host adaptation and in the specialization process. Fine scale analyses of the genetic variations also revealed deleterious mutations and large deletions on certain genes inducing pseudogenization and loss of function. These results highlight the crucial role of the bracovirus in the molecular interactions between the wasp and its hosts and in the evolutionary processes of specialization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTypical microorganism studies link genetic markers to physiological observations, like growth and survival. Experiments are carefully designed, comparing wildtype strains with knockout strains, and replications are conducted to capture biological variation. To maintain monoclonal strains, strain preservation systems are used to keep the number of generations between the primary stock and the experimental measurement low, to decrease the influence of spontaneous mutations on the experimental outcome. The impact of spontaneous mutations during the minimal number of growth cycles for the experimental design is, however, poorly studied.\\n\\nResultsWe set out to characterize the mutation landscape using a transcriptomic dataset of Schizophyllum commune, a laboratory model for mushroom formation. We designed a methodology to detect SNPs from the RNA-seq data, and found a mutation rate of 1.923 10-8 per haploid genome per base per generation, highly similar to the previously described mutation rate of S. commune in the wild. Our results imply that approximately 300 mutations are generated during growth of a colony on an agar plate, of which 5 would introduce stop codons. Knock-outs did not incur an increase of mutations and chromosomal recombination occurring at mating type loci was frequent. We found that missense and nonsense SNPs were selected against throughout the experiment. Also, most mutations show a low variant allele frequency and appear only in a small part of the population. Yet, we found 40 genes that gained a nonsense mutation affecting one of its annotated protein domains, and more than 400 genes having a missense mutation inside an annotated protein domain. Further, we found transcription factors, metabolic genes and cazymes having gained a mutation. Hence, the mutation landscape is wide-spread and has many functional annotations.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have shown that spontaneous mutations accumulate in typical microorganism experiments, where one usually assumes that these do not happen. As these mutations possibly confound experiments they should be minimized as much as possible, or, at least, be trackable. Therefore, we recommend labs to ensure that biological replicates originate from different parental plates, as much as possible.",

The performances of existing prediction methods are highly weak toward these proteins, leading to the annotation of \\\"hypothetical protein\\\" deposited in NCBI database. Elucidating the functions of these unannotated proteins is an urgent task in computational biology. We report a method about secondary structure element alignment called SSEalign based on an effective training dataset extracting from 20 well-studied bacterial genomes. The experimentally validated same genes in different species were selected as training positives, while different genes in different species were selected as training negatives. Moreover, SSEalign used a set of well-defined basic alignment elements with the backtracking line search algorithm to derive the best parameters for accurate prediction. Experimental results showed that SSEalign achieved 91.2% test accuracy, better than existing prediction methods. SSEalign was subsequently applied to identify the functions of those unannotated proteins in the latest published minimal bacteria genome JCVI-syn3.0. Results indicated that At least 99 proteins out of 149 unannotated proteins in the JCVI-syn3.0 genome could be annotated by SSEalign. In conclusion, our method is effective for the identification of protein homology and the annotation of uncharacterized proteins in the genome.",

Multicellularity opens up opportunities for innovations in intercellular communication, cooperation, and specialization, which can provide selective advantages under certain ecological conditions. The unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has never had a multicellular ancestor yet it is closely related to the volvocine algae, a clade containing taxa that range from simple unicells to large, specialized multicellular colonies. Simple multicellular structures have been observed to evolve in C. reinhardtii in response to predation or to settling rate-based selection. Structures formed in response to predation consist of individual cells grouped within a shared transparent extracellular matrix. Evolved isolates form such structures obligately under culture conditions in which their wild type ancestors do not, indicating that newly-evolved multicellularity is heritable. C. reinhardtii is capable of photosynthesis, and possesses an eyespot and two flagella with which it moves towards or away from light in order to optimize input of radiant energy. Motility contributes to C. reinhardtii fitness because it allows cells or colonies to achieve this optimum. Utilizing phototaxis to assay motility, we determined that newly evolved multicellular strains do not exhibit significant directional movement, even though the flagellae of their constituent unicells are present and active. In C. reinhardtii the first steps towards multicellularity in response to predation appear to result in a trade-off between motility and differential survivorship, a trade-off that must overcome by further genetic change to ensure the long-term success of the new multicellular organism.",

    "abstract": "Populations are constantly exposed to deleterious alleles, most of which are purged via natural selection. However, deleterious fitness effects of alleles can also be suppressed by compensatory adaptation. Compensatory mutations can act directly to reduce deleterious effects of an allele. Alternatively, compensation may also occur by altering other aspects of an organisms phenotype or performance, without suppressing the phenotypic effects of the deleterious allele. Moreover, the origin of allelic variation contributing to compensatory adaptation remains poorly understood. Compensatory evolution driven by mutations that arise during the selective process are well studied. However less is known about the role standing (cryptic) genetic variation plays in compensatory adaptation. To address these questions, we examined evolutionary trajectories of natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster fixed for mutations that disrupt wing morphology, resulting in deleterious effects on several components of fitness. Lineages subjected only to natural selection, evolved modifications to courtship behavior and several life history traits without compensation in wing morphology. Yet, we observed rapid phenotypic compensation of wing morphology under artificial selection, consistent with segregating variation for compensatory alleles. We show that alleles contributing to compensation of wing morphology have deleterious effects on other fitness components. These results demonstrate the potential for multiple independent avenues for rapid compensatory adaptation from standing genetic variation, which ultimately may reveal novel adaptive trajectories.",

Twin studies have suggested a high (50-60%) heritability, but genetic determinants are largely unknown.\\n\\nAimsIn this study, our aim was to study genetic variation associated with muscular strength in a large sample of 334,925 individuals of European descent from the UK Biobank, and to evaluate shared genetic aetiology with and causal effects of grip strength on physical and cognitive health.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsIn our discovery analysis of 223,315 individuals, we identified 101 loci associated with grip strength at genome-wide significance (P<5x10-8). Of these, 64 were associated (P<0.01 and consistent direction) also in the replication dataset (N=111,610). Many of the lead SNPs were located in or near genes known to have a function in developmental disorders (FTO, SLC39A8, TFAP2B, TGFA, CELF1, TCF4, BDNF, FOXP1, KIF1B, ANTXR2), and one of the most significant genes based on a gene-based analysis (ATP2A1) encodes SERCA1, the critical enzyme in calcium uptake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which plays a major role in muscle contraction and relaxation. Further, we demonstrated a significant enrichment of gene expression in brain-related transcripts among grip strength associations. Finally, we observed inverse genetic correlations of grip strength with cardiometabolic traits, and positive correlation with parents age of death and education; and showed that grip strength was causally related to fitness, physical activity and other indicators of frailty, including cognitive performance scores.\\n\\nConclusionsIn our study of over 330,000 individuals from the general population, the genetic findings for hand grip strength suggest an important role of the central nervous system in strength performance.

    "abstract": "Progress towards a safe and effective vaccine for the prevention of tularemia has been hindered by a lack of knowledge regarding the correlates of protective adaptive immunity and a lack of tools to generate this knowledge. CD8+ T cells are essential for protective immunity against virulent strains of Francisella tularensis, but to-date, it has not been possible to study these cells in a pathogen-specific manner. Here, we report the development of a tool for expression of the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) in F. tularensis, which allows for the study of CD8+ T cell responses to the bacterium. We demonstrate that in response to intranasal infection with the F. tularensis Live Vaccine Strain, pathogen-specific CD8+ T cells expand after the first week and produce IFN-{gamma} but not IL-17. Effector and central memory subsets develop with disparate kinetics in the lungs, draining lymph node and spleen. Notably, F. tularensis-specific cells are poorly retained in the lungs after clearance of infection. We also show that intranasal vaccination leads to more pathogen-specific CD8+ T cells in the lung-draining lymph node compared to scarification vaccination, but that an intranasal booster overcomes this difference. Together, our data show that this novel tool can be used to study multiple aspects of the CD8+ T cell response to F. tularensis. Use of this tool will enhance our understanding of immunity to this deadly pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging-based age predictions using machine learning have been shown to relate to cognitive performance, health outcomes and progression of neurodegenerative disease. However, even leading age-prediction algorithms contain measurement error, motivating efforts to improve experimental pipelines. T1-weighted MRI is commonly used for age prediction, and the pre-processing of these scans involves normalisation to a common template and resampling to a common voxel size, followed by spatial smoothing. Resampling parameters are often selected arbitrarily. Here, we sought to improve brain-age prediction accuracy by optimising resampling parameters using Bayesian optimisation.\\n\\nUsing data on N=2001 healthy individuals (aged 16-90 years) we trained support vector machines to i) distinguish between young (<50 years) and old (>50 years) brains and ii) predict chronological age, with accuracy assessed using cross-validation. We also evaluated model generalisability to the Cam-CAN dataset (N=648, aged 18-88 years). Bayesian optimisation was used to identify optimal voxel size and smoothing kernel size for each task. This procedure adaptively samples the parameter space to evaluate accuracy across a range of possible parameters, using independent sub-samples to iteratively assess different parameter combinations to arrive at optimal values.\\n\\nWhen distinguishing between young and old brains a classification accuracy of 96.25% was achieved, with voxel size = 11.5mm3 and smoothing kernel = 2.3mm. For predicting chronological age, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.08 years was achieved, with voxel size = 3.73mm3 and smoothing kernel = 3.68mm. This was compared to performance using default values of 1.5mm3 and 4mm respectively, which gave a MAE = 5.48 years, a 7.3% improvement. When assessing generalisability, best performance was achieved when applying the entire Bayesian optimisation framework to the new dataset, out-performing the parameters optimised for the initial training dataset.\\n\\nOur study demonstrates the proof-of-principle that neuroimaging models for brain age prediction can be improved by using Bayesian optimisation to select more appropriate pre-processing parameters. Our results suggest that different parameters are selected and performance improves when optimisation is conducted in specific contexts. This motivates use of optimisation techniques at many different points during the experimental process, which may result in improved statistical sensitivity and reduce opportunities for experimenter-led bias.",

We exemplify its utility by isolating single cortical columns and laminae from the mouse primary somatosensory (barrel) cortex. Tissues can be isolated from living slices in minutes, and the extracted RNA and protein are of sufficient quantity and quality to be used for RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry.

Chloroplasts possess a third membrane system, the thylakoids, which house the majority of proteins responsible for the light-dependent reactions. The mechanism that allows chloroplasts to sort out and separate the intricate thylakoid membrane structures during organelle division remain unknown. By characterizing the sizes of thylakoids found in a number of different chloroplast division mutants in Arabidopsis, we show that thylakoids do not divide independently of the chloroplast division cycle. More specifically, we show that thylakoid division requires the formation of both the inner and the outer contractile rings of the chloroplast.",

These types of responses have been attributed to cell-intrinsic stochastic processes and variable abundances of biochemical constituents, such as proteins, but the influence of organelles has yet to be determined. We use the response to TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and a new statistical framework for determining parameter influence on cell-to-cell variability through the inference of variance explained, DEPICTIVE, to demonstrate that variable mitochondria abundance correlates with cell survival and determines the fractional cell death response. By quantitative data analysis and modeling we attribute this effect to variable effective concentrations at the mitochondria surface of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Further, we demonstrate that inhibitors of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, used in cancer treatment, may increase the diversity of cellular responses, enhancing resistance to treatment.",

    "abstract": "Molecular motors play key roles in organizing the interior of cells. An efficient motor in cargo transport would travel with a high speed and a minimal error in transport time (or distance) while consuming minimal amount of energy. The travel distance and its variance of motor are, however, physically constrained by energy consumption, the principle of which has recently been formulated into the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Here, we reinterpret the uncertainty measure ([Q]) defined in the thermodynamic uncertainty relation such that a motor efficient in cargo transport is characterized with a small [Q]. Analyses on the motility data from several types of molecular motors show that [Q] is a nonmonotic function of ATP concentration and load (f). For kinesin-1, [Q] is locally minimized at [ATP] {approx} 200 M and f {approx} 4 pN. Remarkably, for the mutant with a longer neck-linker this local minimum vanishes, and the energetic cost to achieve the same precision as the wild-type increases significantly, which underscores the importance of molecular structure in transport properties. For the biological motors studied here, their value of [Q] is semi-optimized under the cellular condition ([ATP] {approx} 1 mM, f = 0 - 1 pN). We find that among the motors, kinesin-1 at single molecule level is the most efficient in cargo transport.",

In this study, the effects of tumor suppressor protein p53 and translesional synthesis protein REV3L are studied to relate DNA damage signaling and repair to cellular metabolism by using the fluorescence lifetime of the metabolic coenzyme NADH. It was found that simultaneously restoring function to p53 and silencing REV3L suppressed the cancerous metabolic phenotype and resulted in the greatest amount of cancer cell death.

However, WDR11s role in development is poorly understood. Here we report that WDR11 modulates the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway and is essential for ciliogenesis. Disruption of WDR11 expression in mouse and zebrafish results in phenotypic characteristics associated with defective Hh signalling, accompanied by dysgenesis of ciliated tissues. Wdr11 null mice also exhibit early onset obesity. We found that WDR11 shuttles from the cilium to the nucleus in response to Hh signalling. WDR11 was also observed to regulate the proteolytic processing of GLI3 and cooperate with EMX1 transcription factor to induce the expression of downstream Hh pathway genes and gonadotrophin releasing hormone production. The CHH/KS-associated human mutations result in loss-of-function of WDR11. Treatment with the Hh agonist purmorphamine partially rescued the WDR11-haploinsufficiency phenotypes. Our study reveals a novel class of ciliopathy caused by WDR11 mutations and suggests that CHH/KS may be a part of the human ciliopathy spectrum.",

Here we combined automated formal reasoning with experimentation to expose the logic of network activation during induction of naive pluripotency. We find that a Boolean network architecture defined for maintenance of naive state embryonic stem cells (ESC) also explains transcription factor behaviour and potency during resetting from primed pluripotency. Computationally identified gene activation trajectories were experimentally substantiated at single cell resolution. Contingency of factor availability explains the counterintuitive observation that Klf2, which is dispensable for ESC maintenance, is required during resetting. We tested 136 predictions formulated by the dynamic network, finding a predictive accuracy of 78.7%. Finally, we show that this network explains and predicts experimental observations of somatic cell reprogramming. We conclude that a common deterministic program of gene regulation is sufficient to govern maintenance and induction of naive pluripotency. The tools exemplified here could be broadly applied to delineate dynamic networks underlying cell fate transitions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHost-associated microbes, collectively known as the microbiota, play an important role in the biology of multicellular organisms. In mosquito vectors of human pathogens, the gut bacterial microbiota influences vectorial capacity and has become the subject of intense study. In laboratory studies of vector biology, genetic effects are often inferred from differences between geographically and genetically diverse colonies of mosquitoes that are reared in the same insectary. It is unclear, however, to what extent genetic effects can be confounded by uncontrolled differences in the microbiota composition among mosquito colonies. To address this question, we used 16S metagenomics to compare the midgut bacterial microbiome of six recent laboratory colonies of Aedes aegypti representing the geographical range and genetic diversity of the species.\\n\\nResultsWe found that the diversity, abundance, and community structure of the midgut bacterial microbiome was remarkably similar among the six different colonies of Ae. aegypti, regardless of their geographic origin. We also confirmed the relatively low complexity of bacterial communities inhabiting the mosquito midgut.\\n\\nConclusionsOur finding that geographically diverse colonies of Ae. aegypti reared in the same insectary harbor a similar gut bacterial microbiome supports the conclusion that the gut microbiota of adult mosquitoes is environmentally determined regardless of the host genotype. Thus, uncontrolled differences in microbiota composition are unlikely to represent a significant confounding factor in genetic studies of vector biology.",

    "abstract": "Granule cells at the input layer of the cerebellum comprise over half the neurons in the human brain and are thought to be critical for learning. However, little is known about granule neuron signaling at the population scale during behavior. We used calcium imaging in awake zebrafish during optokinetic behavior to record transgenically identified granule neurons throughout a cerebellar population. A significant fraction of the population was responsive at any given time. In contrast to core precerebellar populations, granule neuron responses were relatively heterogeneous, with variation in the degree of rectification and the balance of excitation versus inhibition. Functional correlations were strongest for nearby cells, with weak spatial gradients in the degree of rectification and excitation. These data open a new window upon cerebellar function and suggest granule layer signals represent elementary building blocks underrepresented in core sensorimotor pathways, thereby enabling the construction of novel patterns of activity for learning.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCerebellar processing is important for a variety of fine motor tasks and sensorimotor adaptations, and a growing body of evidence indicates a prominent role in cognitive control. However, it has been challenging to understand cerebellar function during behavior because of difficulties in recording from cerebellar granule neurons, the most populous neuron type in the brain. We use population-scale optical imaging in the larval zebrafish to compare precerebellar activity to granule cell signaling. Our results suggest a behaviorally relevant expansion of precerebellar signaling representations at the granule layer of the cerebellum.",

    "abstract": "Memory coding strengthens synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus via a long-term potentiation (LTP)-like mechanism. Given that animals are able to store memories of everyday experiences, hippocampal circuits should be able to avoid saturation of overall synaptic weight to preserve learning capacity. However, the underlying mechanism for this is still poorly understood. Here, we show that adult neurogenesis in rats plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the hippocampal learning capacity for learning. Artificial saturation with hippocampal LTP impaired learning capacity in contextual fear conditioning, which then completely recovered after 14 days, when LTP had decayed to the basal level. Ablation of neurogenesis by X-ray irradiation delayed the recovery of learning capacity, while enhancement of neurogenesis using running wheel sped up the recovery. Thus, one benefit of ongoing adult neurogenesis is the maintenance of hippocampal learning capacity through homeostatic renewing of hippocampal memory circuits. Decreased neurogenesis in aged animals may underlie declines in cognitive function with aging.",

However, cell experiments are frequently performed on homogenously coated substrates with only one integrin ligand present. Here, we employed binary-choice substrates of Fn and Vn to dissect V{beta}3 integrin-mediated binding to both ligands on the subcellular scale. Superresolution imaging revealed that V{beta}3 integrin preferred binding to Vn under various conditions. In contrast, binding to Fn required mechanical load on V{beta}3 integrin. Integrin mutations, structural analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations established a model where the extended-closed conformation of V{beta}3 integrin binds Vn but not Fn. Force-mediated hybrid domain swing-out characterizes the extended-open conformation needed for efficient Fn binding. Thus, force-dependent conformational changes in V{beta}3 integrin increase the number of available ligands and therefore the ligand promiscuity of this integrin. These findings for V{beta}3 integrin were shown to regulate cell migration and mechanotransduction differentially on Fn compared to Vn and therefore to regulate cell behavior.",

Here we give structural evidence into GH13 classification and evolution using structural information. Here we proposed a novel method that is sensitive enough to identify miss-classifications, or to provide evidence for further partition that can be of interests to bio-engineers and evolutionary biologists. We also introduced a method to explore the relative importance of residues with respect to the overall deformation that it causes to the overall structure in an evolutionary time scale. We found that the GH13 family can be classified into three main structural groups. There is a hierarchical structure within these clusters that can be use to inform other classification schemes. We also found that by using structural information, subtle structural shifts can be identified and that can be missed in sequence/phylogeny-only based classifications. When each structural group is explored, we found that identifying the most structurally variable sites can lead to identification of functionally (both catalytically and structurally) important residues.",

Such tool installation and workflow execution process is tedious and error-prone, and becomes very challenging when researchers need to compare multiple alternative tool chains.

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the absence of horizontal gene transfer it is possible to reconstruct the history of gene families from empirically determined orthology relations, which are equivalent to event-labeled gene trees. Knowledge of the event labels considerably simplifies the problem of reconciling a gene tree T with a species trees S, relative to the reconciliation problem without prior knowledge of the event types. It is well-known that optimal reconciliations in the unlabeled case may violate time-consistency and thus are not biologically feasible. Here we investigate the mathematical structure of the event labeled reconciliation problem with horizontal transfer.\\n\\nResultsWe investigate the issue of time-consistency for the event-labeled version of the reconciliation problem, provide a convenient axiomatic framework, and derive a complete characterization of time-consistent reconciliations. This characterization depends on certain weak conditions on the event-labeled gene trees that reflect conditions under which evolutionary events are observable at least in principle. We give an [O](|V(T)|log(|V(S)|))-time algorithm to decide whether a time-consistent reconciliation map exists. It does not require the construction of explicit timing maps, but relies entirely on the comparably easy task of checking whether a small auxiliary graph is acyclic. The algorithms are implemented in C++ using the boost graph library and are freely available at https://github.com/Nojgaard/tc-recon.\\n\\nSignificanceThe combinatorial characterization of time consistency and thus biologically feasible reconciliation is an important step towards the inference of gene family histories with horizontal transfer from orthology data, i.e., without presupposed gene and species trees. The fast algorithm to decide time consistency is useful in a broader context because it constitutes an attractive component for all tools that address tree reconciliation problems.",

    "abstract": "Many animals develop indirectly via a larval stage that is morphologically and ecologically distinct from its adult form. Hundreds of lineages across animal phylogeny have secondarily lost larval forms, instead producing offspring that directly develop into adult form without a distinct larval ecological niche1-7. Indirect development in the sea is typically planktotrophic: females produce large numbers of small offspring that require exogenous planktonic food to develop before metamorphosing into benthic juveniles. Direct development is typically lecithotrophic: females produce a smaller number of larger eggs, each developing into a juvenile without the need for larval feeding, provisioned by yolk. Evolutionary theory suggests that these alternative developmental strategies represent stable alternative fitness peaks, while intermediate states are disfavored4,8-11. Transitions from planktotrophy to lecithotrophy thus require crossing a fitness valley and represent radical and coordinated transformations of life-history, fecundity, ecology, dispersal, and development7,12-16. Here we dissect this transition in Streblospio benedicti, the sole genetically tractable species that harbors both states as heritable variation17-19. We identify large-effect loci that act maternally to influence larval size and independent, unlinked large-effect loci that act zygotically to affect discrete aspects of larval morphology. Because lecithotrophs and planktotrophs differ in both size and morphology, the genetic basis of larval form exhibits strong maternal-by-zygotic epistasis for fitness20. The fitness of zygotic alleles depends on their maternal background, creating a positive frequency-dependence that may homogenize local populations. Developmental and population genetics interact to shape larval evolution.",

How NPS mechanistically link to the development of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD) is not fully understood. Potential mechanisms include either shared risk factors that are related to both NPS and cognitive impairment, or AD pathology promoting NPS. This is the first study to examine whether AD genetic loci, individually and as a genetic risk score, are a shared risk factor with MBI. 1377 older adults (aged 72-79; 738 males; 763 normal cognition) from the PATH Through Life project. MBI was assessed in accordance with Criterion 1 of the ISTAART-AA diagnostic criteria using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. 25 LOAD risk loci were genotyped and a weighted genetic risk score (GRS) was constructed. Binomial logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, and education examined the association between LOAD GRS and MBI domains. An increase in the LOAD GRS and APOE*{varepsilon}4 were associated with higher likelihood of Affective Dysregulation; MS4A4A-rs4938933*C and MS4A6A-rs610932*G were associated with a reduced likelihood of Affective Dysregulation; ZCWPW1-rs1476679*C was associated with a reduced likelihood of Social Inappropriateness and Abnormal Perception; BIN1-rs744373*G and EPHA1-rs11767557*C were associated with higher likelihood of Abnormal Perception; NME8-rs2718058*G was associated with a reduced likelihood Decreased Motivation.

    "abstract": "Many sensory neural circuits exhibit response normalization, which occurs when the response of a neuron to a combination of multiple stimuli is less than the sum of the responses to the individual stimuli presented alone. In the visual cortex, normalization takes the forms of cross-orientation suppression and surround suppression. At the onset of visual experience, visual circuits are partially developed and exhibit some mature features such as orientation selectivity, but it is unknown whether cross-orientation suppression or surround suppression are present at the onset of visual experience or require visual experience for their emergence. We characterized the development of these properties and their dependence on visual experience in ferrets. Visual experience was varied across three conditions: typical rearing, dark rearing, and dark rearing with daily exposure to simple sinusoidal gratings (14-16 hours total). Cross-orientation suppression and surround suppression were noted in the earliest observations, and did not vary considerably with experience. We also observed evidence of continued maturation of receptive field properties in the second month of visual experience: substantial length summation was observed only in the oldest animals (postnatal day 90); evoked firing rates were greatly increased in older animals; and direction selectivity required experience, but declined slightly in older animals. These results constrain the space of possible circuit implementations of these features.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe development of the brain depends on both nature - factors that are independent of the experience of an individual animal - and nurture - factors that depend on experience. While orientation selectivity, one of the major response properties of neurons in visual cortex, is already present at the onset of visual experience, it is unknown if response properties that depend on interactions among multiple stimuli develop without experience. We find that the properties of crossorientation suppression and surround suppression are present at eye opening, and do not depend on visual experience. Our results are consistent with the idea that a majority of the basic properties of sensory neurons in primary visual cortex are derived independent of the experience of an individual animal.",

RL Laisk and RL 13C were measured successively on the same leaves and correlated positively (r2=0.38), but average RL Laisk was 28% lower than RL13C. Using A/Cc curves instead of A/Ci curves, a higher photocompensation point {Gamma}* (by 5 mol mol-1) was found but the correction had no influence on RL Laisk estimates.\\nC_LIO_LIThe results suggest that the Laisk method underestimated RL. The isotopic disequilibrium method is useful for assessing responses of RL to irradiance and CO2, improving our mechanistic understanding of RL.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The somatic marker hypothesis proposes that the cortical representation of visceral signals is a crucial component of emotion processing. No previous study has investigated the causal relationships among brain regions that process visceral information during emotional perception. In this magnetoencephalography study of 32 healthy subjects, heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs), which reflect the cortical processing of heartbeats, were modulated by the perception of a sad face. The modulation effect was localized to the prefrontal cortices, the globus pallidus, and an interoceptive network including the right anterior insula (RAI) and anterior cingulate cortex (RACC). Importantly, our Granger causality analysis provides the first evidence for increased causal flow of heartbeat information from the RAI to the RACC during sad face perception. Moreover, this HEP modulation effect was neither an artefact nor an effect of visual-evoked potentials. These findings provide important progress in the understanding of brain-body interactions during emotion processing.",
