    "abstract": "Lateral gene transfers between ancient species contain information about the relative timing of species diversification. Specifically, the ancestors of a donor species must have existed before the descendants of the recipient species. Hence, the detection of a transfer event can be translated into a time constraint between nodes of a phylogeny if the donor and recipient can be identified. When a set of transfers is detected by interpreting the phylogenetic discordance between gene trees and a species tree, the set of all deduced time constraints can be used to rank the species tree, i.e. order totally its internal nodes. Unfortunately lateral gene transfer detection is challenging and current methods produce a significant proportion of false positives. As a result, often, no ranking of the species tree is compatible with the full set of time constraints deduced from predicted transfers. Here we propose a method, implemented in a software called MaxTiC (Maximum Time Consistency), which takes as input a species tree and a series of (possibly inconsistent) time constraints between its internal nodes, weighted by confidence scores. MaxTiC outputs a ranked species tree compatible with a subset of constraints with maximum cumulated confidence score. We extensively test the method on simulated datasets, under a wide range of conditions that we compare to measures on biological datasets. In most conditions the obtained ranked tree is very close to the real one, confirming the potential of dating the history of life with transfers by maximizing time consistency. MaxTiC is freely available, distributed along with a documentation and several examples: https://github.com/ssolo/ALE/tree/master/maxtic.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetics has witnessed dramatic increases in the sizes of data matrices assembled to resolve branches of the tree of life, motivating the development of programs for fast, yet accurate, inference. For example, several different fast programs have been developed in the very popular maximum likelihood framework, including RAxML/ExaML, PhyML, IQ-TREE, and FastTree. Although these four programs are widely used, a systematic evaluation and comparison of their performance using empirical genome-scale data matrices has so far been lacking. To address this question, we evaluated these four programs on 19 empirical phylogenomic data sets from diverse animal, plant, and fungal lineages with respect to likelihood maximization, tree topology, and computational speed. For single-gene tree inference, we found that the more exhaustive and slower strategies (ten searches per alignment) outperformed faster strategies (one tree search per alignment) using RAxML, PhyML, or IQ-TREE. Interestingly, single-gene trees inferred by the three programs yielded comparable coalescent-based species tree estimations. For concatenation-based species tree inference, IQ-TREE consistently achieved the best-observed likelihoods for all data sets, and RAxML/ExaML was a close second. In contrast, PhyML often failed to complete concatenation-based analyses, whereas FastTree was the fastest but generated lower likelihood values and more dissimilar tree topologies in both types of analyses. Finally, data matrix properties, such as the number of taxa and the strength of phylogenetic signal, sometimes substantially influenced the relative performance of the programs. Our results provide real-world gene and species tree phylogenetic inference benchmarks to inform the design and execution of large-scale phylogenomic data analyses.",

In 2014, a population-based cross-sectional study was performed in two previously trachoma-endemic areas of The Gambia. Participants of all ages from Lower River Region (LRR) (N = 1028) and Upper River Region (URR) (N = 840) underwent examination for trachoma and had blood collected for detection of antibodies against the Ct antigen Pgp3, by ELISA. Overall, 30 (1.6%) individuals had active trachoma; the prevalence in children aged 1-9 years was 3.4% (25/742) with no statistically significant difference in prevalence between the regions. There was a significant difference in overall seroprevalence by region: 26.2% in LRR and 17.1% in URR (p<0.0001). In children 1-9 years old, seroprevalence was 4.4% in LRR and 3.9% in URR. Reversible catalytic models using information on age-specific seroprevalence demonstrated a decrease in the transmission of Ct infection in both regions, possibly reflecting the impact of improved access to water, health and sanitation as well as mass drug administration campaigns. Serological testing for antibodies to Ct antigens is potentially useful for trachoma programmes, but consideration should be given to the coendemicity of sexually transmitted Ct infections.",

    "abstract": "Targeted proteomic approaches like selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) are increasingly popular because they enable sensitive and rapid analysis of a preselected set of proteins1-3. However, developing targeted assays is tedious and requires the selection, synthesis and mass spectrometric analysis of candidate peptides before the actual samples can be analyzed. The SRMatlas and ProteomeTools projects recently published fragmentation spectra of synthetic peptides covering the entire human proteome4,5. These datasets provide very valuable resources. However, extracting the relevant data for selected proteins of interest is not straightforward. For example, developing scheduled acquisition methods (i.e. analyzing specific peptides in defined elution time windows) is complicated and requires adjustments to specific chromatographic conditions employed. Moreover, the number of peptide candidates to be targeted in parallel often exceeds the analytical abilities of the mass spectrometer. In this case, the key question is which peptides can be omitted without losing too much information. Ideally, a method design tool would automatically select the most informative peptides in each retention time window. Until now, none of the available tools automatically generates such optimized scheduled SRM and PRM methods (Figure S1).\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=79 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/163154_figS1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (13K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@828org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17a73aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e40740org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9816e7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFig. S1:C_FLOATNO Comparison between different available SRM or PRM method generators.\\n\\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Organelles, proteins, and mRNA are transported bidirectionally along microtubules by plus-end directed kinesin and minus-end directed dynein motors. Microtubules are decorated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that organize the cytoskeleton, regulate microtubule dynamics and modulate the interaction between motor proteins and microtubules to direct intracellular transport. Tau is a neuronal MAP that stabilizes axonal microtubules and crosslinks them into bundles. Dysregulation of tau leads to a range of neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies including Alzheimers disease (AD). Tau reduces the processivity of kinesin and dynein by acting as an obstacle on the microtubule. Single-molecule assays indicate that kinesin-1 is more strongly inhibited than kinesin-2 or dynein, suggesting tau might act to spatially modulate the activity of specific motors. To investigate the role of tau in regulating bidirectional transport, we isolated phagosomes driven by kinesin-1, kinesin-2, and dynein and reconstituted their motility along microtubules. We find that tau biases bidirectional motility towards the microtubule minus-end in a dose-dependent manner. Optical trapping measurements show that tau increases the magnitude and frequency of forces exerted by dynein through inhibiting opposing kinesin motors. Mathematical modeling indicates that tau controls the directional bias of intracellular cargoes through differentially tuning the processivity of kinesin-1, kinesin-2, and dynein. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tau modulates motility in a motor-specific manner to direct intracellular transport, and suggests that dysregulation of tau might contribute to neurodegeneration by disrupting the balance of plus- and minus-end directed transport.\\n\\nSynopsis and Graphical Table of ContentsWe isolated endogenous cargoes, along with a complement of kinesin-1, kinesin-2, and dynein motors, and reconstituted their bidirectional motility in vitro. We find that tau, a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules in neuronal axons, directs bidirectional cargoes towards the microtubule minus end by tuning the balance of forces exerted by kinesin and dynein teams. These results suggest a general mechanism for regulating the transport of intracellular cargoes through modulating the relative activity of opposing motor teams.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/173609_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (31K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8ba4e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f5945corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1df2f47org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@198f5d8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "In many Lactobacillales species (i.e. lactic acid bacteria), peptidoglycan is decorated by polyrhamnose polysaccharides that are critical for cell envelope integrity and cell shape and also represent key antigenic determinants. Despite the biological importance of these polysaccharides, their biosynthetic pathways have received limited attention. The important human pathogen, Streptococcus pyogenes, synthesizes a key antigenic surface polymer--the Lancefield group A carbohydrate (GAC). GAC is covalently attached to peptidoglycan and consists of a polyrhamnose polymer, with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) side chains, which is an essential virulence determinant. The molecular details of the mechanism of polyrhamnose modification with GlcNAc are currently unknown. In this report, using molecular genetics, analytical chemistry and mass spectrometry analysis, we demonstrated that GAC biosynthesis requires two distinct undecaprenol-linked GlcNAc-lipid intermediates: GlcNAc-pyrophosphorylundecaprenol (GlcNAc-P-P-Und) produced by the GlcNAc-phosphate transferase GacO and GlcNAc-phosphate-undecaprenol (GlcNAc-P-Und) produced by the glycosyltransferase GacI. Further investigations revealed that the GAC polyrhamnose backbone is assembled on GlcNAc-P-P-Und. Our results also suggested that a GT-C glycosyltranferase, GacL, transfers GlcNAc from GlcNAc-P-Und to polyrhamnose. Moreover, GacJ, a small membrane-associated protein, formed a complex with GacI and significantly stimulated its catalytic activity. Of note, we observed that GacI homologs perform a similar function in Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis. In conclusion, the elucidation of GAC biosynthesis in S. pyogenes reported here enhances our understanding of how other Gram-positive bacteria produce essential components of their cell wall.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBrain-mapping of the congenitally blind human reveals extensive plasticity(1). The visual cortex of the blind has been observed to support higher cognitive functions including language and numerical processing(2, 3). This functional shift is hypothesized to reflect a metamodal cortical function, where computations are defined by the local network. In the case of developmental deafferentation, local circuits are considered to implement higher cognitive functions by accommodating diverse long-distance inputs(4-7). However, the extent to which visual deprivation triggers a reorganization of the large-scale network in the cortex is still controversial(8). Here we show that early prenatal ablation of the retina, an experimental model of anophthalmia in macaque, leads to a major reduction of area V1 and the creation of a default extrastriate cortex (DEC)(9, 10). Anophthalmic and normal macaques received retrograde tracer injections in DEC, as well as areas V2 and V4 post-natally. This revealed a six-fold expansion of the spatial extent of local connectivity in the DEC and a surprisingly high location of the DEC derived from a computational model of the cortical hierarchy(11). In the anophthalmic the set of areas projecting to the DEC, area V2 and V4 does not differ from that of normal adult controls, but there is a highly significant increase in the relative cumulative weight of the ventral stream areas input to the early visual areas. These findings show that although occupying the territory that would have become primary visual cortex the DEC exhibits features of a higher order area, thus reflecting a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on cortical specification. Understanding the interaction of these contributing factors will shed light on cortical plasticity during primate development and the neurobiology of blindness.",

    "abstract": "Mendelian randomization (MR) is a popular instrumental variable (IV) approach, in which one or several genetic markers serve as IVs that can be leveraged to recover under certain conditions, valid inferences about a given exposure-outcome causal association subject to unmeasured confounding. A key IV identification condition known as the exclusion restriction states that the IV has no direct effect on the outcome that is not mediated by the exposure in view. In MR studies, such an assumption requires an unrealistic level of knowledge and understanding of the mechanism by which the genetic markers causally affect the outcome, particularly when a large number of genetic variants are considered as IVs. As a result, possible violation of the exclusion restriction can seldom be ruled out in such MR studies, and if present, such violation can invalidate IVbased inferences even if unbeknownst to the analyst, confounding is either negligible or absent. To address this concern, we introduce a new class of IV estimators which are robust to violation of the exclusion restriction under a large collection of data generating mechanisms consistent with parametric models commonly assumed in the MR literature. Our approach which we have named \\\"MR G-Estimation under No Interaction with Unmeasured Selection\\\" (MR GENIUS) may in fact be viewed as a modification to Robins G-estimation approach that is robust to both additive unmeasured confounding and violation of the exclusion restriction assumption. We also establish that estimation with MR GENIUS may also be viewed as a robust generalization of the well-known Lewbel estimator for a triangular system of structural equations with endogeneity. Specifically, we show that unlike Lewbel estimation, MR GENIUS is under fairly weak conditions also robust to unmeasured confounding of the effects of the genetic IVs on both the exposure and the outcome, another possible violation of a key IV Identification condition. Furthermore, while Lewbel estimation involves specification of linear models both for the outcome and the exposure, MR GENIUS generally does not require specification of a structural model for the direct effect of invalid IVs on the outcome, therefore allowing the latter model to be unrestricted. Finally, unlike Lewbel estimation, MR GENIUS is shown to equally apply for binary, discrete or continuous exposure and outcome variables and can be used under prospective sampling, or retrospective sampling such as in a case-control study, as well as for right censored time-to-event outcomes under an additive hazards model.",

    "abstract": "(Introduction) Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is characterized by an impairment of urine acidification and can be caused by variations in genes functioning in -intercalated cells such as anion exchanger 1 (AE1). AE1 encodes the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger in erythrocytes (eAE1) and -intercalated cells (kAE1). We previously reported that in human erythroid intron 3 containing the promoter region of human kAE1, a SNP (rs999716) 39 base pairs downstream of the TATA box showed a higher minor allele A frequency in incomplete dRTA patients and such a promoter region showed reduced activities, leading to the hypothesis that those with the A allele may express less kAE1, developing incomplete dRTA. Here, single nucleotide variations were introduced downstream of the TATA box in the murine erythroid intron 3 to investigate changes in the promoter activity for murine kAE1 mRNA. (Methods) The erythroid intron 3 of C57BL/6 was subcloned into the pGL4.17 reporter vector, leading to mu kAE1Pro-pGL4.17. Three types of G to A substitutions were introduced 33, 35, and 36 base pairs downstream of the TATA box in the murine kAE1 promoter region by inverse PCR (Var1, Var2, and Var3, respectively). The HEK 293 cells were transfected with vectors. After 24 hours, the firefly luciferase activity was determined. (Results and Discussion) The promoter activity of Var1, as well as that of Var2 to a lesser extent, was reduced compared with that of the wild-type. The introduction of variations such as Var1 and Var2 into the murine genome by genome editing may help to establish mouse models of incomplete dRTA.",

    "abstract": "Primary cilia are cylindrical organelles extending from the surface of most animal cells that have been implicated in a host of signaling and sensory functions. Genetic defects in their component molecules, known as \\\"ciliopathies\\\" give rise to devastating symptoms, ranging from defective development, to kidney disease, to progressive blindness. The detailed structures of these organelles and the true functions of proteins encoded by ciliopathy genes are poorly understood because of the small size of cilia and the limitations of conventional microscopic techniques. We describe the combination of cryo-electron tomography, enhanced by sub-tomogram averaging, with super-resolution stochastic reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to define substructures and subdomains within the light-sensing rod sensory cilium of the mammalian retina. Longitudinal and radial domains are demarcated by structural features such as the axoneme and its connections to the ciliary membrane, and are correlated with molecular markers of these compartments, including Ca2+-binding protein centrin-2 in the lumen of the axoneme, acetylated tubulin forming the axoneme, the glycocalyx extending outward from the surface of the plasma membrane, and molecular residents of the space between axoneme and ciliary membrane, including Arl13B, intraflagellar transport proteins, BBS5, and syntaxin-3. Within this framework we document that deficiencies in the ciliopathy proteins BBS2, BBS7 and BBS9 lead to inappropriate accumulation of proteins in rod outer segments while largely preserving their sub-domain localization within the connecting cilium region, but alter the distribution of syntaxin-3 clusters.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase is a unique cellular reverse transcriptase essential for maintaining telomere stability and required for the unlimited proliferation of cancer cells. The limiting determinant of telomerase activity is the catalytic component TERT, and TERT expression is closely correlated with telomerase activity and cancer initiation and disease progression. For this reason the regulation of TERT levels in the cell is of great importance. microRNAs (miRs) function as an additional regulatory level in cells, crucial for defining expression boundaries, proper cell fate decisions, cell cycle control, genome integrity, cell death and metastasis. We performed an anti-miR library screen to identity novel miRs, which participate in the control of telomerase. We identified the tumor suppressor miR (miR-128) as a novel endogenous telomerase inhibitor and determined that miR-128 significantly reduces the mRNA and protein levels of Tert in a panel of cancer cell lines. We further evaluated the mechanism by which miR-128 regulates TERT and demonstrated that miR-128 interacts directly with the coding sequence of TERT mRNA in both HeLa cells and teratoma cells. Interestingly, the functional miR-128 binding site in TERT mRNA, is conserved between TERT and the other cellular reverse transcriptase encoded by Long Interspaced Elements-1 (LINE-1 or L1), which can also contribute to the oncogenic phenotype of cancer. This finding supports the novel idea that miRs may function in parallel pathways to inhibit tumorigenesis, by regulating a group of enzymes (RT) by targeting conserved binding sites in the coding region of both enzymes.\\n\\nNOVELTY AND IMPACTTelomerase is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that synthesizes telomeric DNA sequences and almost universally provides the molecular basis for unlimited proliferative potential. Expression of human telomerase alone is sufficient for the immortalization of diverse cell types. We have identified the tumor suppressor microRNA (miR-128) as a novel regulator of telomerase, which directly targets the coding sequence (CDS) of TERT mRNA and significantly represses Tert protein expression in a panel of cancer cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Transcription in bacteria is controlled by multiple molecular mechanisms that precisely regulate gene expression. Recently, initial RNA synthesis by the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) has been shown to be interrupted by pauses; however, the pausing determinants and the relationship of pausing with productive and abortive RNA synthesis remain poorly understood. Here, we employed single-molecule FRET and biochemical analysis to disentangle the pausing-related pathways of bacterial initial transcription. We present further evidence that region {sigma}3.2 constitutes a barrier after the initial transcribing complex synthesizes a 6-nt RNA (ITC6), halting transcription. We also show that the paused ITC6 state acts as a checkpoint that directs RNAP, in an NTP-dependent manner, to one of three competing pathways: productive transcription, abortive RNA release, or a new unscrunching/scrunching pathway that blocks transcription initiation. Our results show that abortive RNA release and DNA unscrunching are not as tightly coupled as previously thought.",

    "abstract": "The nature of host organs and genes that underlie tumor-induced physiological disruption on host remains ill-defined. Here, we establish a novel zebrafish intestinal tumor model that is optimized for addressing this issue, and find that hepatic cyp7a1, the rate-limiting factor for synthesizing bile acids (BAs), is such a host gene. Inducing krasG12D by Gal4 specifically expressed in the posterior intestine resulted in formation of an intestinal tumor classified as dysplasia. The local intestinal tumor caused systemic detrimental effects on host including liver inflammation, hepatomegaly, growth defects, and organismal death. Whole-organismal level gene expression analysis and metabolite measurements revealed that the intestinal tumor reduced total BAs levels via down-regulation of hepatic cyp7a1. Genetically rescuing cyp7a1 expression in the liver restored the BAs synthesis and ameliorated tumor-induced liver inflammation, but not other tumor-dependent phenotypes. Thus, we found a previously unknown role of cyp7a1 as the host gene that links the intestinal tumor, hepatic cholesterol-BAs metabolism, and liver inflammation in tumor-bearing fish. Our model provides an important basis to discover host genes responsible for tumor-induced phenotypes and to uncover mechanisms underlying how tumors adversely affect host organisms.",

Fourteen formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded melanoma samples were analyzed using a high-throughput proteomics approach, coupled with probabilistic graphical models and Flux Balance Analysis, to characterize these differences. Proteomics analyses showed differences in expression of proteins related with fatty acid metabolism, melanogenesis and extracellular space between BRAF mutated and BRAF non-mutated melanoma tumors. Additionally, probabilistic graphical models showed differences between melanoma subgroups at biological processes such as melanogenesis or metabolism.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDevelopmental exposure to perfluorinated substances is associated with deficient IgG antibody responses to childhood vaccines as an indication of depressed immune system functions. As this outcome may represent a critical effect of these substances, calculation of benchmark dose (BMD) results would be useful for standards setting to protect exposed populations against adverse effects. However, in the mixed exposure setting of most epidemiological evidence, the two major and inter-related substances associated with this adverse effect have shown similar benchmark results that raise concerns about possible confounding.\\n\\nMethodsWith the aim of better characterizing the immunotoxicity impact of the two major perfluorinated substances in the mixed exposures, we carried out BMD calculations on prospective data from two prospective birth cohort studies from the Faroe Islands with a total of 1,146 children. Exposure data included serum concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoate at birth and at age 5 years and, as outcome parameters, the serum concentrations of specific IgG antibodies against tetanus and diphtheria at ages 5 and 7. We calculated the BMDs and their lower confidence bounds (BMDLs) and included mutual adjustment for the two compounds.\\n\\nResultsThe BMDLs for the two immunotoxicants were of similar magnitude before and after adjustment. Both substances showed lower results for a logarithmic dose-response model, which also provided a slightly better fit than a linear dose model for both antibodies. We also used a broken curve shape that allowed a different slope below the median exposure. Postnatal exposure as represented by the age 5 serum concentration, showed a stronger association with the antibody outcomes than the prenatal exposure. Due to the correlation between the two immunotoxicants, the mutual adjustment resulted in elevated BMD results and p values. However, the BMDL values were virtually unchanged.\\n\\nConclusionsAdjustment for co-exposure to another immunotoxicant increased the variance and the BMD values, but affected the BMDL values only to a negligible extent. These calculations are in accordance with an interpretation that, when two toxicants appear to affect an outcome to an almost equal degree and none of them is known to be solely responsible, the exposures should both be considered responsible and attract equal regulatory attention until further evidence shows otherwise.",

    "abstract": "Here we urge the adoption of a new paradigm for the design and interpretation of intervention trials in infectious diseases, particularly in emerging infectious disease, that more accurately reflects the dynamics of the transmission process. Interventions in infectious diseases can have indirect effects on those not receiving the intervention as well as direct effects on those receiving the intervention. Combinations of interventions can have complex interactions at the population level. These often cannot be adequately addressed with standard study designs and analytic methods. Simulations can help to accurately represent transmission dynamics in an increasingly complex world which is critical for proper trial design and interpretation. Some ethical aspects of a trial can also be quantified using simulations. After a trial has been conducted, simulations can be used to explore possible explanations for the observed effects. A great deal is to be gained through a multidisciplinary approach that builds collaborations among experts in infectious disease dynamics, epidemiology, statistical science, economics, simulation methods and the conduct of clinical trials.",

We evaluated its performance on female genital samples in four UK Genito-Urinary Medicine (GUM)/RSH clinics.\\n\\nMethodsProspective diagnostic accuracy study, using BD ProbeTec CT/GC assay as the routine clinic nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) as the initial comparator test, and the QIAgen Artus CT assay to resolve discrepancies. In these instances, the reference standard was defined as the resolved result when two out of three assay results concurred. Female participants aged [&ge;]16 provided additional-to-routine self-collected vulvovaginal swabs. Samples were tested fresh with the io(R) CT assay within 7 days of collection, or were frozen at -80{degrees}C for later testing. Participant clinical, demographic and behavioural characteristics were collected to assess risk factors associated with CT infection.\\n\\nResultsOf 785 participants recruited, final analyses were conducted on 709 (90.3%). CT prevalence was 7.2% (51/709) overall. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the io(R) CT assay were, respectively, 96.1% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 86.5-99.5), 97.7% (95%CI: 96.3-98.7), 76.6% (95%CI: 64.3-86.2) and 99.7% (95%CI: 98.9-100). There was no significant difference in performance measures between fresh and frozen samples, or between symptomatic and asymptomatic participants (p>0.05). The only risk factor associated with CT infection was being a sexual contact of an individual with CT.\\n\\nConclusionsThe io(R) CT-assay is the only 30-minute, fully automated, high-performing NAAT currently CE-marked for CT diagnosis in women, making it a highly promising diagnostic to enable specific treatment, initiation of partner notification and appropriately intensive health promotion at the point of care.

    "abstract": "Roses are important plants for human beings with important economical and biological traits like continuous flowering, flower architecture, color and scent, that current model plants do not feature, thus are becoming ideal models for studying these traits. Due to high heterozygosity of rose genomes likely caused by frequent inter-species hybridization, a high-quality and well-annotated genome for Rosa plants is not available yet. Developing genetic and genomic tools with high quality has become necessary for further roses breeding and for disentangling the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying roses domestication. We here generated the high quality and comprehensive reference transcriptomes for Rosa chinensis  Old Blush (OB) and R. wichuriana  Basyes Thornless (BT), two roses contrasting at several important traits. These reference transcriptomes showed transcripts N50 above 2000bp. The two species shared about 23310 transcripts (N50 = 2364bp), among which about 8975 orthologs were conserved within genera of Rosa. Rosa plants shared about 5049 transcripts (Rosaceae-common) with these from Malus, Prunus, Rubus, and Fragaria. Finally, a pool of 417 transcripts unique to Rosa plants (Rosa-specific) was identified. These Rosaceae-common and Rosa-specific transcripts should facilitate the phylogenetic analysis of Rosaceae plants and investigation of Rosa-specific traits. The data reported here should provide the fundamental genomic tools and knowledge critical for understanding the biology and domestication of roses.",

It is an important step for studying cell sub-populations and lineages based on scRNA-seq data by finding an effective low-dimensional representation and visualization of the original data. The scRNA-seq data are much noiser than traditional bulk RNA-Seq: in the single cell level, the transcriptional fluctuations are much larger than the average of a cell population and the low amount of RNA transcripts will increase the rate of technical dropout events. In this study, we proposed VASC (deep Variational Autoencoder for scRNA-seq data), a deep multi-layer generative model, for the unsupervised dimension reduction and visualization of scRNA-seq data. It can explicitly model the dropout events and find the nonlinear hierarchical feature representations of the original data. Tested on twenty datasets, VASC shows superior performances in most cases and broader dataset compatibility compared with four state-of-the-art dimension reduction methods. Then, for a case study of pre-implantation embryos, VASC successfully re-establishes the cell dynamics and identifies several candidate marker genes associated with the early embryo development.",

    "abstract": "Birds play unique functional roles in the maintenance of ecosystems, such as pollina-tion and seed dispersal, and thus monitoring bird communities (e.g., monitoring bird species diversity) is a first step towards avoiding undesirable consequences of anthro-pogenic impacts on bird communities. In the present study, we hypothesized that birds, regardless of their main habitats, must have frequent contact with water and that tissues that contain their DNA that persists in the environment (environmental DNA; eDNA) could be used to detect the presence of avian species. To this end, we applied a set of universal PCR primers (MiBird, a modified version of fish/mammal universal primers) for metabarcoding avian eDNA. We confirmed the versatility of MiBird primers by performing in silico analyses and by amplifying DNAs extracted from bird tissues. Analyses of water samples from zoo cages of birds with known species composition suggested that the use of MiBird primers combined with the Il-lumina MiSeq platform could successfully detect avian species from water samples. Additionally, analysis of water samples collected from a natural pond detected five avian species common to the sampling areas. The present findings suggest that avian eDNA metabarcoding would be a complementary detection/identification tool in cases where visual detection and identification of bird species is difficult.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy will affect nearly 3% of people at some point during their lifetime. Previous copy number variants (CNVs) studies of epilepsy have used array-based technology and were restricted to the detection of large or exonic events. In contrast, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to more comprehensively profile CNVs but existing analytic methods suffer from limited accuracy. We show that this is in part due to the non-uniformity of read coverage, even after intra-sample normalization. To improve on this, we developed PopSV, an algorithm that uses multiple samples to control for technical variation and enables the robust detection of CNVs. Using WGS and PopSV, we performed a comprehensive characterization of CNVs in 198 individuals affected with epilepsy and 301 controls. For both large and small variants, we found an enrichment of rare exonic events in epilepsy patients, especially in genes with predicted loss-of-function intolerance. Notably, this genome-wide survey also revealed an enrichment of rare non-coding CNVs near previously known epilepsy genes. This enrichment was strongest for non-coding CNVs located within 100 Kbp of an epilepsy gene and in regions associated with changes in the gene expression, such as expression QTLs or DNase I hypersensitive sites. Finally, we report on 21 potentially damaging events that could be associated with known or new candidate epilepsy genes. Our results suggest that comprehensive sequence-based profiling of CNVs could help explain a larger fraction of epilepsy cases.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEpilepsy is a common neurological disorder affecting around 3% of the population. In some cases, epilepsy is caused by brain trauma or other brain anomalies but there are often no clear causes. Genetic factors have been associated with epilepsy in the past such as rare genetic variations found by linkage studies as well as common genetic variations found by genome-wide association studies and large copy-number variants. We sequenced the genome of[~] 200 epilepsy patients and[~] 300 healthy controls and compared the distribution of deletion (loss of a copy) and duplication (additional copy) of genomic regions. Thanks to the sequencing technology and a new method that takes advantage of the large sample size, we could compare the distribution of small copy- number variants between epilepsy patients and controls. Overall, we found that small variants are also associated with epilepsy. Indeed, the genome of epilepsy patients had more exonic copy- number variants, especially when rare or affecting genes with predicted loss-of-function intolerance. Focusing on regions around genes that have been previously associated with epilepsy, we also found more non-coding variants in epilepsy patients, especially deletions or variants in regulatory regions. Finally, we provide a list of 21 regions in which we found likely pathogenic variants.",

    "abstract": "Multisensory integration is key for perception and animal survival yet how information from separate senses is integrated has been debated for decades. In the cortex, information from each sense is first processed in primary sensory areas and then combined in association areas. An alternative hypothesis to this hierarchical model is that primary sensory cortices partake in multisensory encoding. We probed tactile and visual responses in primary somatosensory and visual cortices in awake behaving animals using two-photon calcium imaging from layer 2/3 excitatory neurons. In support of an hierarchical model we found segregation of visual and tactile responses. Tactile stimuli evoked responses in S1 neurons. In striking contrast, V1 neurons failed to respond to tactile stimuli. This was true for passive whisker stimulation and for stimulation during active whisking. Furthermore, responses of V1 neurons to congruent visuo-tactile cues during active exploration, a condition where vision precedes touch, were completely abolished in darkness. The rostro-lateral area of the visual cortex responded to both visual and tactile aspects of the stimuli and may form a substrate for encoding multisensory signals during active exploration. Our results indicate that primary sensory areas mainly encode their primary sense and that the impact of other modalities may be restricted to modulatory effects.",

    "abstract": "When we buy our food, the information on the package informs us about the properties of the product, such as its taste and healthiness. These beliefs can influence the processing of food rewards and impact decision making beyond objective sensory properties. However, no studies, within or beyond the food domain, have assessed how written information, such as food labels, affect implicit motivation to obtain rewards, even though choices in daily life might be strongly driven by implicit motivational biases. We investigated how written information affects implicit motivation to obtain food rewards. We used food labels (high- and low-calorie), associated with an identical lemonade, to study motivation for food rewards during fMRI. In a joystick task, hungry participants (N=31) were instructed to make fast approach or avoid movements to earn the cued drinks. Behaviorally, we found a general approach bias, which was stronger for the drink that was most preferred during a subsequent choice test, i.e. the one labeled as low-calorie. This behavioral effect was accompanied by increased BOLD signal in the sensorimotor cortex during the response phase of the task for the preferred, low-calorie drink compared with the non-preferred, high-calorie drink. During the anticipation phase, the non-preferred, high-calorie drink label elicited stronger fMRI signal in the right ventral anterior insula, a region associated with aversion and taste intensity, than the preferred, low-calorie label. Together, these data suggest that high-calorie labeling can increase avoidance of drinks and reduce neural activity in brain regions associated with motor control. In conclusion, we show effects of food labeling on fMRI responses during anticipation and subsequent motivated action and on behavior, in the absence of objective taste differences, demonstrating the influence of written information on implicit biases. These findings contribute to our understanding of implicit biases in real-life eating behavior.",

Intrinsic features of the optical fiber (numerical aperture and core/cladding diameter) define the optically active segment of the taper (up to [~]3mm), along which a linear relation between the propagating set of kt values and the emission position exists. These site-selective light-delivery properties are preserved at multiple wavelengths, further extending the range of applications expected for tapered fibers for optical control of neural activity.",

    "abstract": "Sensory stimuli can be recognized more rapidly when they are expected. This phenomenon depends on expectation affecting the cortical processing of sensory information. However, virtually nothing is known on the mechanisms responsible for the effects of expectation on sensory networks. Here, we report a novel computational mechanism underlying the expectation-dependent acceleration of coding observed in the gustatory cortex (GC) of alert rats. We use a recurrent spiking network model with a clustered architecture capturing essential features of cortical activity, including the metastable activity observed in GC before and after gustatory stimulation. Relying both on network theory and computer simulations, we propose that expectation exerts its function by modulating the intrinsically generated dynamics preceding taste delivery. Our model, whose predictions are confirmed in the experimental data, demonstrates how the modulation of intrinsic metastable activity can shape sensory coding and mediate cognitive processes such as the expectation of relevant events. Altogether, these results provide a biologically plausible theory of expectation and ascribe a new functional role to intrinsically generated, metastable activity.",

    "abstract": "Neurobiological abnormalities associated with psychiatric disorders do not map well to existing diagnostic categories. High co-morbidity and overlapping symptom domains suggest dimensional circuit-level abnormalities that cut across clinical diagnoses. Here we sought to identify brain-based dimensions of psychopathology using multivariate sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA) in a sample of 663 youths imaged as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. This analysis revealed highly correlated patterns of functional connectivity and psychiatric symptoms. We found that four dimensions of psychopathology -- mood, psychosis, fear, and externalizing behavior -- were highly associated (r=0.68-0.71) with distinct patterns of functional dysconnectivity. Loss of network segregation between the default mode network and executive networks (e.g. fronto-parietal and salience) emerged as a common feature across all dimensions. Connectivity patterns linked to mood and psychosis became more prominent with development, and significant sex differences were present for connectivity patterns related to mood and fear. Critically, findings replicated in an independent dataset (n=336). These results delineate connectivity-guided dimensions of psychopathology that cut across traditional diagnostic categories, which could serve as a foundation for developing network-based biomarkers in psychiatry.",

    "abstract": "Why are we so slow in choosing the lesser of two evils? We considered whether such slowing relates to uncertainty about the value of these options, which arises from the tendency to avoid them during learning, and whether such slowing relates to fronto-subthalamic inhibitory control mechanisms. 49 participants performed a reinforcement-learning task and a stop-signal task while fMRI was recorded. A reinforcement-learning model was used to quantify learning strategies. Individual differences in lose-lose slowing related to information uncertainty due to sampling, and independently, to less efficient response inhibition in the stop-signal task. Neuroimaging analysis revealed an analogous dissociation: subthalamic nucleus (STN) BOLD activity related to variability in stopping latencies, whereas weaker fronto-subthalamic connectivity related to slowing and information sampling. Across tasks, fast inhibitors increased STN activity for successfully cancelled responses in the stop task, but decreased activity for lose-lose choices. These data support the notion that fronto-STN communication implements a rapid but transient brake on response execution, and that slowing due to decision uncertainty could result from an inefficient release of this \\\"hold your horses\\\" mechanism.",

Whether the molecular architecture of cortical brain regions oscillates daily and whether these oscillations are modified in brain disorders is less understood. We identified 1200 daily oscillating transcripts in the hippocampus of control mice. More transcripts (1600) were oscillating in experimental epilepsy, with only one fourth oscillating in both conditions. Proteomics confirmed these results. Metabolic activity and targets of antiepileptic drugs displayed different circadian regulation in control and epilepsy. Hence, the hippocampus, and perhaps other cortical regions, shows a daily remapping of its molecular landscape, which would enable different functioning modes during the night/day cycle. The impact of this remapping in brain pathologies needs to be taken into account not only to study their mechanisms, but also to design drug treatments and time their delivery.",

    "abstract": "Top-down attention prioritizes the processing of goal-relevant information throughout visual cortex, based on where that information is found in space and what it looks like. Whereas attentional goals often have both spatial and featural components, most research on the neural basis of attention has examined these components separately. This may reflect the fact that attention is typically studied in individual visual areas that preferentially code for either spatial locations or particular features. Here we investigated how these attentional components are integrated by examining the attentional modulation of functional connectivity between visual areas with different selectivity. Specifically, we used fMRI to measure temporal correlations between spatially-selective regions of early visual cortex and category-selective regions in ventral temporal cortex while participants performed a task that benefitted from both spatial and categorical attention. We found that categorical attention modulated the connectivity of category-selective areas, but only with retinotopic areas that coded for the spatially attended location. The reverse was not true, however, with spatial attention modulating the connectivity of retinotopic areas with category-selective areas coding for both attended and unattended features. This pattern of results suggests that attentional modulation of connectivity is dominated by spatial selection, which in turn gates featural biases. Combined with exploratory analyses of frontoparietal areas that track these changes in connectivity among visual areas, this study begins to shed light on how different components of attention are integrated in support of more complex behavioral goals.",

    "abstract": "In many studies of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), stimulus encoding and processing (per-ceptual function) and response selection (executive function) have been intertwined. To dissociate deficits in these functions, we introduced a task that parametrically varied low-level stimulus features (orientation and color) for fine-grained analysis of perceptual function. It also required participants to switch their attention between feature dimensions on a trial-by-trial basis, thus taxing executive processes. Furthermore, we used a response paradigm that captured task-irrelevant motor output (TIMO), reflecting failures to use the correct stimulus-response rule. ADHD participants had substantially higher perceptual variability than Controls, especially for orientation, as well as higher TIMO. In both ADHD and Controls, TIMO was strongly affected by the switch manipulation. Across participants, the perceptual variability parameter was correlated with TIMO, suggesting that perceptual deficits are associated with executive function deficits. Based on perceptual variability alone, we were able to classify participants into ADHD and Controls with a mean accuracy of about 77%. Participants self-reported General Executive Composite score correlated not only with TIMO but also with the perceptual variability parameter. Our results highlight the role of perceptual deficits in ADHD and the usefulness of computational modeling of behavior in dissociating perceptual from executive processes.",

In metaphase, Spindly recruits the Dynein/Dynactin complex, promoting the establishment of stable kinetochore-microtubule interactions and progression into anaphase. While details of Spindly function in mitosis have been worked out in cultured human cells and in the C. elegans zygote, the function of Spindly within the context of an organism has not yet been addressed. Here we present loss- and gain-of-function studies of Spindly in Drosophila. We investigated the requirements of distinct protein domains for the localisation and function of Spindly. We find that knock-down of Spindly results in a range of mitotic defects in the female germ line and during cleavage divisions in embryogenesis. Overexpression of Spindly in the female germ line is embryonic lethal and results in altered egg morphology. To determine whether Spindly plays a role in post-mitotic cells we altered Spindly protein levels in migrating cells and found that ovarian border cell migration is sensitive to the levels of Spindly protein. Our study uncovers novel functions of the mitotic checkpoint protein Spindly in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Cofilin is an essential actin filament severing protein necessary for fast actin turnover dynamics. Segments of actin bound to cofilin adapt an alternative twist. This configuration is stable, but boundaries between cofilin occupied and unoccupied polymer are weak and fragment. Coronin and Aip1 are two factors that promote cofilin mediated actin filament disassembly, but whether they simply accelerate the basic cofilin severing mechanism or alter the mode of filament disassembly is still being investigated. Using electron microscopy and spectroscopy, we show that coronin accelerates phosphate release from F-actin to stimulate highly cooperative cofilin binding on to the polymer creating long stretches with a hypertwisted morphology. We find that Aip1 attacks these hypertwisted regions along their length, not just the boundaries, causing sections to disintegrate into monomers. Therefore, coronin promotes cofilin binding to F-actin to generate longer segments of polymer that are themselves the substrates for Aip1 mediated disintegration, as opposed to simply creating more heterotypic junctions that would sever. The morphological characteristics of the disassembling filaments along with spectroscopic data showing the rapid liberation of actin monomers suggest that the combination of cofilin, coronin, and Aip1 might be triggering a more catastrophic mode of filament disassembly than severing.",

We test the study-wise annotation model for diseases annotated with classes from the HPO and for genes annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) classes. We incorporate this annotation model into similarity algorithms and show how this leads to improved performance.\\n\\nThis work adds weight to the need for enhancing simple list-based representations of disease or gene annotations.

We hypothesized that there would be increased abundance in multiple transcription factor domain families, as well as domains associated with protein-protein interactions, that would correlate with the increased phenotypic diversity found in birds; instead, this data shows a general loss/contraction of major domain families, with the largest losses in domain families associated with multiple developmental (feather, body-plan, immune) and metabolic processes. Ultimately, the results of this analyses represent a general characterization of domain family composition in birds, thus the specific domain composition of TF families should be probed further, especially those with the largest reductions seen in this study.",

To examine the origin of virulence of these fungal pathogens, we compared genomes of classic systemic, opportunistic, and non-pathogenic species, including Emmonsia and two basal branching, non-pathogenic species in the Ajellomycetaceae, Helicocarpus griseus and Polytolypa hystricis. We found that gene families related to plant degradation, secondary metabolites synthesis, and amino acid and lipid metabolism are retained in H. griseus and P. hystricis. While genes involved in the virulence of dimorphic pathogenic fungi are conserved in saprophytes, changes in the copy number of proteases, kinases and transcription factors in systemic dimorphic relative to non-dimorphic species may have aided the evolution of specialized gene regulatory programs to rapidly adapt to higher temperatures and new nutritional environments. Notably, both of the basal branching, non-pathogenic species appear homothallic, with both mating type locus idiomorphs fused at a single locus, whereas all related pathogenic species are heterothallic. These differences revealed that independent changes in nutrient acquisition capacity have occurred in the Onygenaceae and Ajellomycetaceae, and underlie how the dimorphic pathogens have adapted to the human host and decreased their capacity for growth in environmental niches.",

    "abstract": "The oncogene MYBL2 (encoding B-Myb) is a poor prognostic biomarker in many cancers. B-Myb interacts with the MuvB core of five proteins (LIN9, LIN37, LIN52, LIN53/RBBP4, and LIN54) to form the MMB (Myb-MuvB) complex and promotes expression of late cell cycle genes necessary for progression through mitosis. Both MYBL2 amplification and over-expression are associated with deregulation of the cell cycle and increased cell proliferation. Alternatively, by interacting with E2F4-DP1 and p130 or p107, the MuvB core becomes part of the DREAM complex (DP, RB-like, E2F, and MuvB). The DREAM complex opposes MMB by globally repressing cell cycle genes in G0/G1, maintaining the cell in a quiescent state. However, the specific mechanism by which B-Myb alters the cell cycle is not well understood. Our analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data revealed significant upregulation of DREAM and MMB target genes in breast and ovarian cancer with MYBL2 gain. Given that most of the DREAM target genes are not directly regulated by B-Myb, we investigated the effects of B-Myb on DREAM formation. We found that depletion of B-Myb results in increased DREAM formation in human cancer cells, while its overexpression inhibits DREAM formation in the non-transformed cells. Since the MuvB core subunit LIN52 is essential for assembly of both the DREAM and MMB complexes, we tested whether B-Myb disrupts DREAM by sequestering LIN52. Overexpression of LIN52 did not increase either DREAM or MMB formation, but instead increased the turnover rate of the endogenous LIN52 protein. Interestingly, co-expression of B-Myb increased the expression of both endogenous and overexpressed LIN52 while knockdown of B-Myb had an opposite effect. We found that regulation of LIN52 occurs at the protein level, and that activity of DYRK1A kinase, the enzyme that triggers DREAM complex formation by phosphorylating LIN52, is required for this regulation. These findings are the first to implicate B-Myb in the disassembly of the DREAM complex and offer insight into the underlying mechanisms of poor prognostic value of MYBL2 amplification in cancer. We conclude that B-Myb mediates its oncogenic effects not only by increasing mitotic gene expression by the MMB complex, but also by broad disruption of cell cycle gene regulatory programs through compromised DREAM formation.",

GR binding is significantly altered by estradiol with GR recruited to ER bound loci that become more accessible upon estradiol induction. Gene expression responses to co-treatment were more similar to estradiol, but with novel regulated genes. Our results suggest phenotypic and molecular interplay between ER and GR in endometrial cancer.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobial genome sequencing is now being routinely used in many clinical and public health laboratories. Understanding how to report complex genomic test results to stakeholders who may have varying familiarity with genomics - including clinicians, laboratorians, epidemiologists, and researchers - is critical to the successful and sustainable implementation of this new technology; however, there are no evidence-based guidelines for designing such a report in the pathogen genomics domain. Here, we describe an iterative, human-centered approach to creating a report template for communicating tuberculosis (TB) genomic test results.\\n\\nMethodsWe used Design Study Methodology - a human centered multi-stage approach drawn from the information visualization domain - to redesign an existing clinical report. We used expert consults and an online questionnaire to discover various stakeholders needs around the types of data and tasks related to TB that they encounter in their daily workflow. We also evaluated their perceptions of and familiarity with genomic data, as well as its utility at various clinical decision points. These data shaped the design of multiple prototype reports that were compared against the existing report through a second online survey, with the resulting qualitative and quantitative data informing the final, redesigned, report.\\n\\nResultsWe recruited 78 participants, 65 of whom were clinicians, nurses, laboratorians, researchers, and epidemiologists involved in TB diagnosis, treatment, and/or surveillance. Our first survey indicated that participants were largely enthusiastic about genomic data, with the majority agreeing on its utility for certain TB diagnosis and treatment tasks and many reporting some confidence in their ability to interpret this type of data (between 58.8% and 94.1%, depending on the specific data type). When we compared our four prototype reports against the existing design, we found that for the majority (86.7%) of design comparisons, participants preferred the alternative prototype designs over the existing version, and that both clinicians and non-clinicians expressed similar design preferences. Participants articulated clearer design preferences when asked to compare individual design elements versus entire reports. Both the quantitative and qualitative data informed the design of a revised report, which is available online as a LaTeX template.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show how a human-centered design approach integrating quantitative and qualitative feedback can be used to design an alternative report for representing complex microbial genomic data. We suggest experimental and design guidelines to inform future design studies in the bioinformatics and microbial genomics domains, and suggest that this type of mixed-methods study is important to facilitate the successful translation of pathogen genomics in the clinic, not only for clinical reports but also more complex bioinformatics data visualization software.",

    "abstract": "The attractor neural network scenario is a popular scenario for memory storage in association cortex, but there is still a large gap between models based on this scenario and experimental data. We study a recurrent network model in which both learning rules and distribution of stored patterns are inferred from distributions of visual responses for novel and familiar images in inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Unlike classical attractor neural network models, our model exhibits graded activity in retrieval states, with distributions of firing rates that are close to lognormal. Inferred learning rules are close to maximizing the number of stored patterns within a family of unsupervised Hebbian learning rules, suggesting learning rules in ITC are optimized to store a large number of attractor states. Finally, we show that there exists two types of retrieval states: one in which firing rates are constant in time, another in which firing rates fluctuate chaotically.",
