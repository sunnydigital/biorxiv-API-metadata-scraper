    "abstract": "Recent studies found three Neolithic super-grandfather Y haplotypes among Han Chinese, consistent with the legend of Yan and Huang Emperors. Individuals of royal and noble ancestry or high social economic status (SES) are known to practice assortative mating and consanguineous marriages, which can produce offspring of both higher and lower than average fitness. However, the roles of the super-grandfather Y haplotypes and their descendant lines in history, fitness, and the male biased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unknown. Here we show a link between the super-grandfathers and the legend of Yan-Huang Emperors and between their descendant haplotypes and ASD. We found that subjects carrying the O3a1c and O3a2c1a super-grandfather haplotypes were enriched with Yan and Huang related surnames, respectively, in two independent datasets of 1564 and 772 male Han subjects. We identified high and low SES descendant haplotypes of the super-grandfathers using the Han dataset of the 1000 genomes project based on two criteria: more descendant branches and fewer mutations before star-like expansions. By genotyping 505 fathers of ASD affected male children from the Autism Clinical and Genetic Resources in China with surnames either closely related to Huang (Ying group) or less related (Ji group), we found the high SES haplotypes within the O3a2c1a clade at [~]2 fold lower (odds ratio 2.05, 95% CI 1.28-3.26, P=0.0026) while the low SES haplotypes at [~]2 fold higher frequency (odds ratio 1.92, 95% CI 1.01-3.64, P = 0.046) in the fathers relative to 505 normal subjects. The fraction of low SES haplotypes was greater than that of high SES in ASD fathers of the Ying group, in contrast to Ying controls or the Ji fathers and Ji controls. Consistently, analysis of 2366 ASD affected children showed higher male to female ratio for Ying versus Ji group (6.52 +/-1.11 v 4.59 +/-0.41, P = 0.028, one tailed). These results provide evidence for the Yan-Huang legend and suggest a role for Y in ASD.",

    "abstract": "1.Combining endurance training with resistance training (RT) may attenuate skeletal muscle hypertrophic adaptation versus RT alone; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We investigated changes in markers of ribosome biogenesis, a process linked with skeletal muscle hypertrophy, following concurrent training versus RT alone. Twenty-three males underwent eight weeks of RT, either performed alone (RT group, n = 8), or combined with either high-intensity interval training (HIT+RT group, n = 8), or moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT+RT group, n = 7). Muscle samples (vastus lateralis) were obtained before training, and immediately before, 1 h and 3 h after the final training session. Training-induced changes in basal expression of the 45S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor (45S pre-rRNA), and 5.8S and 28S mature rRNAs, were greater with concurrent training versus RT. However, during the final training session, RT further increased both mTORC1 (p70S6K1 and rps6 phosphorylation) and 45S pre-rRNA transcription-related signalling (TIF-1A and UBF phosphorylation) versus concurrent training. These data suggest that when performed in a training-accustomed state, RT induces further increases mTORC1 and ribosome biogenesis related signalling in human skeletal muscle versus concurrent training; however, changes in ribosome biogenesis markers were more favourable following a period of short-term concurrent training versus RT performed alone.",

    "abstract": "Recent high-throughput sequencing advances have expanded the breadth of available omics datasets and the integrated analysis of multiple datasets obtained on the same samples has allowed to gain important insights in a wide range of applications. However, the integration of various sources of information remains a challenge for systems biology since produced datasets are often of heterogeneous types, with the need of developing generic methods to take their different specificities into account.\\n\\nWe propose a multiple kernel framework that allows to integrate multiple datasets of various types into a single exploratory analysis. Several solutions are provided to learn either a consensus meta-kernel or a meta-kernel that preserves the original topology of the datasets. We applied our framework to analyse two public multi-omics datasets. First, the multiple metagenomic datasets, collected during the TARA Oceans expedition, was explored to demonstrate that our method is able to retrieve previous findings in a single KPCA as well as to provide a new image of the sample structures when a larger number of datasets are included in the analysis. To perform this analysis, a generic procedure is also proposed to improve the interpretability of the kernel PCA in regards with the original data. Second, the multi-omics breast cancer datasets, provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas, is analysed using a kernel Self-Organizing Maps with both single and multi-omics strategies. The comparison of this two approaches demonstrates the benefit of our integration method to improve the representation of the studied biological system.\\n\\nProposed methods are available in the R package mixKernel, released on CRAN. It is fully compatible with the mixOmics package and a tutorial describing the approach can be found on mixOmics web site http://mixomics.org/mixkernel/.",

    "abstract": "Descending signals from the brain play critical roles in controlling and modulating locomotion kinematics. In the Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system, descending AVB premotor interneurons exclusively form gap junctions with B-type motor neurons that drive forward locomotion. We combined genetic analysis, optogenetic manipulation, and computational modeling to elucidate the function of AVB-B gap junctions during forward locomotion. First, we found that some B-type motor neurons generated intrinsic rhythmic activity, constituting distributed central pattern generators. Second, AVB premotor interneurons drove bifurcation of B-type motor neuron dynamics, triggering their transition from stationary to oscillatory activity. Third, proprioceptive couplings between neighboring B-type motor neurons entrained the frequency of body oscillators, forcing coherent propagation of bending waves. Despite substantial anatomical differences between the worm motor circuit and those in higher model organisms, we uncovered converging principles that govern coordinated locomotion.\\n\\nSignificance StatementA deep understanding of the neural basis of motor behavior must integrate neuromuscular dynamics, mechanosensory feedback, as well as global command signals, to predict behavioral dynamics. Here, we report on an integrative approach to defining the circuit logic underlying coordinated locomotion in C. elegans. Our combined experimental and computational analysis revealed that (1) motor neurons in C. elegans could function as intrinsic oscillators; (2) Descending inputs and proprioceptive couplings work synergistically to facilitate the sequential activation of motor neuron activities, allowing bending waves to propagate efficiently along the body. Our work thus represents a key step towards an integrative view of animal locomotion.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new conceptual framework and a model-based interventional calculus to steer, manipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics and generating mechanisms of non-linear dynamical systems from partial and disordered observations based on the contributions of each of the systems, by exploiting first principles from the theory of computability and algorithmic information. This calculus entails finding and applying controlled interventions to an evolving object to estimate how its algorithmic information content is affected in terms of positive or negative shifts towards and away from randomness in connection to causation. The approach is an alternative to statistical approaches for inferring causal relationships and formulating theoretical expectations from perturbation analysis. We find that the algorithmic information landscape of a system runs parallel to its dynamic attractor landscape, affording an avenue for moving systems on one plane so they can be controlled on the other plane. Based on these methods, we advance tools for reprogramming a system that do not require full knowledge or access to the systems actual kinetic equations or to probability distributions. This new approach yields a suite of universal parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability, ranging from the discovery of causality, dimension reduction, feature selection, model generation, a maximal algorithmic-randomness principle and a systems (re)programmability index. We apply these methods to static (e.coli Transcription Factor network) and to evolving genetic regulatory networks (differentiating naive from Th17 cells, and the CellNet database). We highlight their ability to pinpoint key elements (genes) related to cell function and cell development, conforming to biological knowledge from experimentally validated data and the literature, and demonstrate how the method can reshape a systems dynamics in a controlled manner through algorithmic causal mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMaternal care during early-life plays a crucial role in the sculpting of the mammalian brain. Augmented maternal care during the first postnatal week promotes life-long stress resilience and improved memory compared with the outcome of routine rearing conditions. Recent evidence suggests that this potent phenotypic change commences with altered synaptic connectivity of stress sensitive hypothalamic neurons. However, the epigenomic basis of the long-lived consequences is not well understood.\\n\\nMethodsHere, we employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), and a multiplex microRNA (miRNA) assay to examine the effects of augmented maternal care on DNA cytosine methylation, gene expression, and miRNA expression.\\n\\nResultsA significant decrease in global DNA methylation was observed in offspring hypothalamus following a week of augmented maternal care, corresponding to differential methylation and expression of thousands of genes. Differentially methylated and expressed genes were enriched for functions in neurotransmission, neurodevelopment, protein synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as known stress response genes. Twenty prioritized genes with three lines of evidence (methylation, expression, and altered miRNA target) were identified as highly relevant to the stress resiliency phenotype.\\n\\nConclusionsThis combined unbiased approach enabled the discovery of novel genes and gene pathways that advance our understanding of the central epigenomic mechanisms underlying the profound effects of maternal care on the developing brain.",

We obtained genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species and systematically scanned eleven lineages associated with the evolution of longevity and eusociality for positively selected genes (PSGs). The set of 319 PSGs contains regulators of mTOR and is enriched in functional terms associated with (i) processes that are regulated by the mTOR pathway, e.g. translation, autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis, (ii) the immune system and (iii) antioxidant defense.

Urine luteinizing hormone (LH) and salivary progesterone (P4) were used to confirm ovulation and cycle phase.

Post-hoc correlations with person-centered progesterone revealed negative correlations with most symptoms. Depressive symptoms showed an unexpected delayed pattern in which baseline levels of symptoms were observed in the ovulatory and midluteal phases, and exacerbations were observed during both the perimenstrual and follicular phases. The majority of participants met C-PASS criteria for clinically significant (>=30%) symptom exacerbation.

    "abstract": "Mendelian randomization (MR) is a popular instrumental variable (IV) approach, in which one or several genetic markers serve as IVs that can be leveraged to recover under certain conditions, valid inferences about a given exposure-outcome causal association subject to unmeasured confounding. A key IV identification condition known as the exclusion restriction states that the IV has no direct effect on the outcome that is not mediated by the exposure in view. In MR studies, such an assumption requires an unrealistic level of knowledge and understanding of the mechanism by which the genetic markers causally affect the outcome, particularly when a large number of genetic variants are considered as IVs. As a result, possible violation of the exclusion restriction can seldom be ruled out in such MR studies, and if present, such violation can invalidate IVbased inferences even if unbeknownst to the analyst, confounding is either negligible or absent. To address this concern, we introduce a new class of IV estimators which are robust to violation of the exclusion restriction under a large collection of data generating mechanisms consistent with parametric models commonly assumed in the MR literature. Our approach which we have named \\\"MR G-Estimation under No Interaction with Unmeasured Selection\\\" (MR GENIUS) may in fact be viewed as a modification to Robins G-estimation approach that is robust to both additive unmeasured confounding and violation of the exclusion restriction assumption. We also establish that estimation with MR GENIUS may also be viewed as a robust generalization of the well-known Lewbel estimator for a triangular system of structural equations with endogeneity. Specifically, we show that unlike Lewbel estimation, MR GENIUS is under fairly weak conditions also robust to unmeasured confounding of the effects of the genetic IVs on both the exposure and the outcome, another possible violation of a key IV Identification condition. Furthermore, while Lewbel estimation involves specification of linear models both for the outcome and the exposure, MR GENIUS generally does not require specification of a structural model for the direct effect of invalid IVs on the outcome, therefore allowing the latter model to be unrestricted. Finally, unlike Lewbel estimation, MR GENIUS is shown to equally apply for binary, discrete or continuous exposure and outcome variables and can be used under prospective sampling, or retrospective sampling such as in a case-control study, as well as for right censored time-to-event outcomes under an additive hazards model.",

    "abstract": "Ergosterol is an essential isoprenoid for cellular integrity and proper membrane fluidity of fungi. Proper level of ergosterol is crucial for resistance to various stressful conditions, such as hypoxia, hypothermia, and hyperosmolarity. The isoprenoid building blocks of ergosterol are synthesized via the mevalonate pathway, which relies on the availability of many central metabolites, such as acetyl-coA and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). The metabolic currencies are also the substrates for epigenetic modifications such as histone acetylation and methylation. To have a better understanding of how isoprenoid synthesis and these epigenetic mechanisms affect each other, we re-analyzed the results of our screen on Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion collection for isoprenoid production and found a group of chromatin regulators with significant effects on isoprenoid production. More specifically, the canonical histone Htz1 (H2A.z), the SWR1 complex that loads Htz1 onto chromatin, and the histone demethylase Jhd2 inhibited, whereas the Htz1 unloading INO80 complex and histone methylase Set1 enhanced isoprenoid production. Further analysis of genome-wide expression data revealed that Htz1 and Set1 differentially regulate stress-response genes which presumably affect isoprenoid synthesis. Conversely, changes in isoprenoid production alters the transcription of the same set of genes. Further analysis of ergosterol levels in these gene deletions showed that htz1, set1 double deletion leads to accumulation of ergosterol beyond homeostatic levels and renders cells vulnerable to environmental stress. Our re-analysis of multiple published data and follow-up experiments revealed an epigenetic crosstalk mechanism between ergosterol levels and stress response genes that is essential for maintaining optimum concentration of ergosterol under various conditions.",

    "abstract": "Diphyllatea is an ancient and enigmatic lineage of unicellular eukaryotes that possesses morphological features common to other deeply diverging eukaryotes, such as Amoebozoa and Excavata. In reconstruction of the evolutionary processes underlying diversification and morphological innovation among eukaryotes, Diphyllatea plays a key role together with other orphan lineages. Despite being of evolutionary significance, only three species of Diphyllatea have descripted morphology, with molecular data available from fewer. The lack of data means that the actual diversity of this key lineage of eukaryotes remains unresolved. We here present a first attempt to understand the species diversity and higher order structure of the Diphyllatea phylogeny. We have cultured several new strains, described these morphologically, and amplified their rRNA. We have sampled DNA from multiple globally distributed sites, using these as templates in a Diphyllatea-specific PCR. In contrast to recent diversity studies, which use short variable gene regions, we amplify nearly the whole 18S rRNA gene, and sequence using PacBio RS II technology, to provide enough information to resolve historically ancient speciation events. Phylogenetic inference of Diphyllatea rRNA reveals three deeply branching and distinct clades of Diphyllatea, here named Diphy I - III. Diphy I and II include the genera Diphylleia and Collodictyon. Notably, Diphy III is here shown as novel phylogenetic clade with all strains investigated having a congruent morphology to Collodictyon triciliatum (Diphy II). Altogether, Diphyllatea seems to constitute two morphotypes, a biflagellate (i.e. Diphy I) and a quadraflagellate (i.e. Diphy II and III) form, congruent with earlier descriptions of Diphylleia and Collodictyon. Further, our targeted environmental sequencing approach, which includes specific PCR primers, reveals a wider global distribution of Diphyllatea than earlier known. Altogether, the described protocol shows the usefulness of combining long amplicon high-throughput sequencing and lineage-specific PCR approach in surveys of enigmatic eukaryote lineages.",

However, how RFs develop in humans is unknown. Using fMRI and population receptive field (pRF) modeling in children and adults, we determined where and how pRFs develop across the ventral visual stream. We find that pRF properties in visual field maps, V1 through VO1, are adult-like by age 5. However, pRF properties in face- and word-selective regions develop into adulthood, increasing the foveal representation and the visual field coverage for faces in the right hemisphere and words in the left hemisphere. Eye-tracking indicates that pRF changes are related to changing fixation patterns on words and faces across development. These findings suggest a link between viewing behavior of faces and words and the differential development of pRFs across visual cortex, potentially due to competition on foveal coverage.",

    "abstract": "We studied the interactions between gum Arabic and select catecholic compounds like caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and catechol. We observed that GA is capable of promoting the auto-oxidation of the above-mentioned compounds into darkly colored pigments without the addition of redox-sensitive cations. Gum Arabic appeared to be unique among polysaccharide-based materials as many other types of polysaccharides promote the oxidation of the above-mentioned compounds only in the presence of redox cations like Fe2+ or Cu2+. RP-HPLC and SEC chromatographic techniques were employed to monitor the reactions and to observe the formation of high molecular mass, pigmented materials from gum Arabic and all three catecholic compounds. FT-IR spectroscopic analysis revealed that, despite their darkly colored appearances, the gum Arabic/pigment materials synthesized contain mostly gum Arabic and very little pigment. As chlorogenic acid is an ester of caffeic acid, we studied the capacity of gum Arabic to promote ester hydrolysis using acetylsalicylic acid as the model compound. We observed that gum Arabic did promote the hydrolysis of acetylsalicylic acid into salicylic acid. However, in all our experiments involving the pigment formation between gum Arabic and chlorogenic acid, we did not observe any evidence that chlorogenic acid was hydrolyzed leading to the release of caffeic acid during these reactions. In addition, we observed that heat treatment of gum Arabic did not affect its pro-oxidizing capability, but it did negatively affect its capability to hydrolyze salicylic acid. Thus, these two types of chemical reactivity present in the gum Arabic material may be associated with different components of the gum Arabic material.",

Therefore, it is necessary to integrate the physical 3D architecture of genome and features to comprehensive depict their connection to gene regulation.\\n\\nResultsHere, we present an integrative visualization and analysis platform, Delta, to facilitate visually annotating and exploring the 3D physical architecture of genomes. Delta takes Hi-C or ChIA-PET contact matrix as input and predicts the topology associated domains and chromatin loops in the genome, and generates a physical 3D model which represents the plausible consensus 3D structure of the genome. Delta features a highly interactive visualization tool, which enhanced the integration of genome topology/physical structure and extensive genome annotation, by juxtaposition of the 3D model with diverse genomic assay outputs. Finally, we showcased that Delta could be helpful to reveal potentially interesting findings by a case study on the {beta}-globin gene region.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationhttp://delta.big.ac.cn/.\\n\\nContacttangbx@big.ac.cn.\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Vipp1 is highly conserved and essential for photosynthesis, but its function is unclear as it does not participate directly in light-dependent reactions. We analyzed Vipp1 localization in live cyanobacterial cells and show that Vipp1 is highly dynamic, continuously exchanging between a diffuse fraction that is uniformly distributed throughout the cell and a punctate fraction that is concentrated at high curvature regions of the thylakoid located at the cell periphery. Experimentally perturbing the spatial distribution of Vipp1 by relocalizing it to the nucleoid causes a severe growth defect during the transition from non-photosynthetic (dark) to photosynthetic (light) growth. However, the same perturbation of Vipp1 in dark alone or light alone growth conditions causes no growth or thylakoid morphology defects. We propose that the punctuated dynamics of Vipp1 at the cell periphery in regions of high thylakoid curvature enable acquisition of photosynthetic competency, perhaps by facilitating biogenesis of photosynthetic complexes involved in light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Any individuals genome contains [~]4-5 million genetic variants that differ from reference, and understanding how these variants give rise to trait diversity and disease susceptibility is a central goal of human genetics1. A vast majority (96-99%) of an individuals variants are common, though at a population level the overwhelming majority of variants are rare2-5. Because of their scarcity in an individuals genome, rare variants that play important roles in complex traits are likely to have large functional effects6,7. Mutations that cause an exon to be skipped can have severe functional consequences on gene function, and many known disease-causing mutations reduce or eliminate exon recognition8. Here we explore the extent to which rare genetic variation in humans results in near complete loss of exon recognition. We developed a Multiplexed Functional Assay of Splicing using Sort-seq (MFASS) that allows us to measure exon inclusion in thousands of human exons and surrounding intronic sequence simultaneously. We assayed 27,733 extant variants in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)9 within or adjacent to 2,339 human exons, and found that 3.8% (1,050) of the variants, almost all of which were extremely rare, led to large-effect defects in exon recognition. Importantly, we find that 83% of these splice-disrupting variants (SDVs) are located outside of canonical splice sites, are distributed evenly across distinct exonic and intronic regions, and are difficult to predict a priori. Our results indicate that loss of exon recognition is an important and underappreciated means by which rare variants exert large functional effects, and that MFASS enables their empirical assessment for splicing defects at scale.",

    "abstract": "Metazoans are crucially dependent on multiple layers of gene regulatory mechanisms which allow them to control gene expression across developmental stages, tissues and cell types. Multiple recent research consortia have aimed to generate comprehensive datasets to profile the activity of these cell type- and condition-specific regulatory landscapes across many different cell lines and primary cells. However, extraction of genes or regulatory elements specific to certain entities from these datasets remains challenging. We here propose a novel method based on non-negative matrix factorization for disentangling and associating huge multi-assay datasets including chromatin accessibility and gene expression data. Taking advantage of implementations of NMF algorithms in the GPU CUDA environment full datasets composed of tens of thousands of genes as well as hundreds of samples can be processed without the need for prior feature selection to reduce the input size. Applying this framework to multiple layers of genomic data derived from human blood cells we unravel mechanisms of regulation of cell type-specific expression in T-cells and monocytes.",

ZIKV envelope (E) protein is the major viral protein involved in cell receptor binding and entry and therefore considered one of the major determinants in ZIKV pathogenesis. Here, we report a gene-wide mapping of functional residues of ZIKV E protein using a mutant library with changes covering every nucleotide position. By comparing the replication fitness of every viral mutant between mosquito and human cells, we identified that mutations affecting N-linked glycosylation at N154 position display the most divergence. Through characterizing individual mutants, we show that, while ablation of N-linked glycosylation selectively benefits ZIKV infection of mosquito cells by enhancing cell entry, it either had little impact on ZIKV infection on certain human cells or decreased infection through entry factor DC-SIGN. In conclusion, we define the roles of individual residues of ZIKV envelope protein, which contribute to ZIKV replication fitness in human and mosquito cells.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIGene-wide mapping of functional residues of E protein in human and mosquito cells.\\nC_LIO_LIMutations affecting N-linked glycosylation display the most dramatic difference.\\nC_LIO_LIN-linked glycosylation decreases ZIKV entry into mosquito cells.\\nC_LIO_LIN-linked glycosylation is important for DC-SIGN mediated infection of human cells.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In order to generate a functional proteome, gene expression pathways must assemble proteins accurately according to the rules of the genetic code. General gene expression accuracy is known to be high, but errors nevertheless occur with measurable frequencies. Here we develop a mass-spectrometry (MS) based assay for the detection of a particular type of gene expression error, amino acid misincorporation. This assay allows assessing a much broader range of misincorporation events compared to current, very sensitive but also very specific enzyme reporter assays. Our assay uncovers a remarkably rich pool of error products for a model protein expressed in E. coli, which depend quantitatively on codon usage in the expression construct. This codon usage dependence can be explained in part as a function of the composition of the tRNA pool in this organism. We further show that codon-dependent differences in error levels correlate with measurable changes in specific protein activity. In contrast to E. coli, error levels are lower, and appear not to be codon usage dependent, when the same model protein is expressed in S. cerevisiae.",

    "abstract": "Complex structural variants (cxSVs), e.g. inversions with flanking deletions or interspersed inverted duplications, are part of human genetic diversity but their characteristics are not well delineated. Because their structures are difficult to resolve, cxSVs have been largely excluded from genome analysis and population-scale association studies. To permit large-scale detection of cxSVs from paired-end whole-genome sequencing, we developed Automated Reconstruction of Complex Variants (ARC-SV) using a novel probabilistic algorithm and a machine learning approach that leverages the new Human Pangenome Reference Consortium diploid assemblies. Using ARC-SV, we resolved, across 4,262 human genomes spanning all continental super-populations, 8,493 cxSVs belonging to 12 subclasses. Some cxSVs with population-specific signatures are shared with Neanderthals. Overall cxSVs are significantly enriched in regions prone to recombination and germline de novo mutations. Many cxSVs mark phenotypic hotspots (each significantly associated with [&ge;] 20 traits) identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and 46.4% of all significant GWAS-SNPs catalogued to date reside within {+/-}125 kb of at least one cxSV locus. Common SNPs near cxSVs show significant trait heritability enrichment. Genomic regions affected by cxSVs are enriched for bivalent chromatin states. Rare cxSVs are enriched in neural genes and loci undergoing rapid or accelerated evolution and recently evolved cis-regulatory regions for human corticogenesis. We also identified 41 fixed loci where divergence from our most recent common ancestor is via localized cxSV. Our method and analysis framework allow for the accurate, efficient, and automatic identification of cxSVs for future population-scale studies of human disease and genome biology.",
