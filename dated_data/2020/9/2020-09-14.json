    "abstract": "Most of the biomedical datasets, including those of  omics, population studies and surveys, are rectangular in shape and have few missing data. Recently, their sample sizes have grown significantly. Rigorous analyses on these large datasets demand considerably more efficient and more accurate algorithms. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been used to classify outcomes in biomedical datasets, including random forests (RF), decision tree (DT), artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). However, their performance and efficiency in classifying multi-category outcomes in rectangular data are poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to compare these metrics among the 4 ML algorithms. As an example, we created a large rectangular dataset using the female breast cancers in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-18 (SEER-18) database which were diagnosed in 2004 and followed up until December 2016. The outcome was the 6-category cause of death, namely alive, non-breast cancer, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, infection and other cause. We included 58 dichotomized features from ~53,000 patients. All analyses were performed using MatLab (version 2018a) and the 10-fold cross validation approach. The accuracy in classifying 6-category cause of death with DT, RF, ANN and SVM was 72.68%, 72.66%, 70.01% and 71.85%, respectively. Based on the information entropy and information gain of feature values, we optimized dimension reduction (i.e. reduce the number of features in models). We found 22 or more features were required to maintain the similar accuracy, while the running time decreased from 440s for 58 features to 90s for 22 features in RF, from 70s to 40s in ANN and from 440s to 80s in SVM. In summary, we here show that RF, DT, ANN and SVM had similar accuracy for classifying multi-category outcomes in this large rectangular dataset. Dimension reduction based on information gain will significantly increase models efficiency while maintaining classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell omics represent the fastest-growing genomics data type in the literature and the public genomics repositories. Leveraging the growing repository of labeled datasets and transferring labels from existing datasets to newly generated datasets will empower the exploration of the single-cell omics. The current label transfer methods have limited performance, largely due to the intrinsic heterogeneity and extrinsic differences between datasets. Here, we present a robust graph-based artificial intelligence model, single-cell Graph Convolutional Network (scGCN), to achieve effective knowledge transfer across disparate datasets. Benchmarked with other label transfer methods on totally 30 single cell omics datasets, scGCN has consistently demonstrated superior accuracy on leveraging cells from different tissues, platforms, and species, as well as cells profiled at different molecular layers. scGCN is implemented as an integrated workflow as a python software, which is available at https://github.com/QSong-github/scGCN.",

    "abstract": "Phytophthora root and crown rot, caused by the soilborne oomycete pathogen Phytophthora capsici, leads to severe yield losses in squash (Cucurbita pepo). To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in resistance to this disease, we crossed a partially resistant squash breeding line with a susceptible zucchini cultivar and evaluated over 13,000 F2 seedlings in a greenhouse screen. Bulked segregant analysis with whole genome resequencing (BSA-Seq) resulted in the identification of five genomic regions - on chromosomes 4, 5, 8, 12, and 16 - featuring significant allele frequency differentiation between susceptible and resistant bulks in each of two independent replicates. In addition, we conducted linkage mapping using a population of 176 F3 families derived from individually genotyped F2 individuals. Variation in disease severity among these families was best explained by a four-QTL model, comprising the same loci identified via BSA-Seq on chromosomes 4, 5, and 8 as well as an additional locus on chromosome 19, for a combined total of six QTL identified between both methods. Loci, whether those identified by BSA-Seq or linkage mapping, were of small to moderate effect, collectively accounting for 28-35% and individually for 2-10% of the phenotypic variance explained. However, a multiple linear regression model using one marker in each BSA-Seq QTL could predict F2:3 disease severity with only a slight drop in cross-validation accuracy compared to genomic prediction models using genome-wide markers. These results suggest that marker-assisted selection could be a suitable approach for improving Phytophthora crown and root rot resistance in squash.",

    "abstract": "Blood flow regulation in the brain is dynamically regulated to meet the metabolic demands of active neuronal populations. Recent evidence has demonstrated that capillary endothelial cells are essential mediators of neurovascular coupling that sense neuronal activity and generate a retrograde, propagating, hyperpolarizing signal that dilates upstream arterioles. Here, we tested the hypothesis that transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels in capillary endothelial cells are significant contributors to functional hyperemic responses that underlie neurovascular coupling in the brain. Using an integrative ex vivo and in vivo approach, we demonstrate the functional presence of TRPA1 channels in brain capillary endothelial cells, and show that activation of these channels within the capillary bed, including the post-arteriole transitional region covered by ensheathing mural cells, initiates a retrograde signal that dilates upstream parenchymal arterioles. Notably, this signaling exhibits a unique biphasic mode of propagation that begins within the capillary network as a short-range, Ca2+ signal dependent on endothelial pannexin-1 channel/purinergic P2X receptor communication pathway and then is converted to a rapid, inward-rectifying K+ channel-mediated electrical signal in the post-arteriole transitional region that propagates upstream to parenchymal arterioles. Two-photon laser-scanning microscopy further demonstrated that conductive vasodilation occurs in vivo, and that TRPA1 is necessary for functional hyperemia within the somatosensory cortex of mice. Together, these data establish a role for endothelial TRPA1 channels as sensors of neuronal activity and show that they respond accordingly by initiating a vasodilatory response that redirects blood to regions of metabolic demand.",

    "abstract": "Emotional memory processing, such as fear memory, engages a large neuronal network of brain regions including the cerebellum. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the cerebellar cortex modulating the fear memory network is largely unknown. Here, we illustrate a novel mechanism by which synaptic signaling in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) via STAT3 regulates long-term fear memory. Firstly, we generated PC-specific STAT3 knockout (STAT3PKO) mice. Transcriptome analyses revealed that STAT3 deletion results in transcriptional changes that lead to an increase in the expression of glutamate receptors. The amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents at parallel fiber to PC synapses was larger in STAT3PKO mice than in wild-type littermates. Conditioning at the parallel fiber induced long-term depression of parallel fiber-PC synapses in STAT3PKO mice while the same manipulation induced long-term potentiation in wild-type littermates. Interestingly, STAT3PKO mice showed an aberrantly enhanced long-term fear memory. Neuronal activity in fear-related regions increased in fear-conditioned STAT3PKO mice. Our data suggest that STAT3-dependent molecular regulation in PCs is indispensable for proper expression of fear memory processing.",

Here we report that human skeletal muscle organoids can be differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cell lines to contain paraxial mesoderm and neuromesodermal progenitors and develop into organized structures reassembling neural plate border and dermomyotome. Culture conditions instigate neural lineage arrest and promote fetal hypaxial myogenesis towards limb axial anatomical identity, with generation of sustainable uncommitted PAX7 myogenic progenitors and fibroadipogenic (PDGFRa+) progenitor populations equivalent to those from the second trimester of human gestation. Single cell comparison to human fetal and adult myogenic progenitors reveals distinct molecular signatures for non-dividing myogenic progenitors in activated (CD44High/CD98+/MYOD1+) and dormant (PAX7High/FBN1High/SPRY1High) states.

The starch and lipid contents were also increased; however, starch content was decreased in pgr5. Further, the Nile Red fluorescence shows that a significant amount of lipid bodies were observed in pgr5 cells under high light. Similarly, the electron micrographs show that large vacuoles were formed in high light stress despite the change in stacks of grana structure. We also observed increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that could lead to autophagy. Inline, a significant increase of ATG8 protein was noticed in pgr5, which is a hallmark characteristic for autophagy formation. Consequently, the triacylglycerol (TAG) content was increased due to DGAT and PDAT enzymes expression, especially in pgr5. Here, the TAG synthesis would have been obtained from degraded membrane lipids in pgr5. Additionally, mono, polyunsaturated, and saturated fatty acids were identified more in the high light condition. Our study shows that the high light induces ROS, leads to autophagy and TAGs accumulation, which is stored as an energy source to acclimatize the algae.",

    "abstract": "Potent protection against malaria can be induced by attenuated live-immunization with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites (SPZ). However, a better understanding of the critical processes involved in the establishment of protective immunity is needed. We explored the safety and vaccine efficacy of early chemo-attenuation of PfSPZ under atovaquone-proguanil (AP). AP caused early arrest of P. berghei liver stages. Despite the absence of replication, robust protection in mice correlated with parasite-specific effector-memory CD8+ T-cell responses. In a phase I clinical trial a single dose of AP prevented Pf infections in the liver of adult, human subjects who received three doses of 5.12x104 or 1.5x105 PfSPZ by direct venous inoculation combined with oral AP. However, only 2 of 8 (25%) and 2 of 10 (20%), respectively, were protected against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) 10 weeks after the last vaccine dose, despite levels of IgG antibodies to the Pf circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) comparable to those achieved in fully protected volunteers after immunization with 5.12x104 PfSPZ with chloroquine chemoprophylaxis active only against subsequent blood stages. We identify lower IgG recognition of the secreted liver stage-specific antigens LISP2 and LSA1 and the multi-stage antigen MSP5 as immune signatures of inferior vaccine efficacy compared to PfSPZ with chloroquine chemoprophylaxis. In conclusion, we show that immune signatures of liver stage antigens, but neither an established rodent malaria model nor concentrations of antibodies against the major surface protein of sporozoites, permit prediction of vaccine efficacy. Thus, this study provides a clear rationale for the development of live sporozoite vaccination protocols that boost exposure to Pf liver stage antigens.\n\nSignificance StatementOur research demonstrates that attenuation of liver infection of high doses of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites by concomitant single-dose administration of atovaquone-proguanil is safe in humans. However, vaccine efficacy was modest when compared to an identical protocol using chloroquine that acts only on the subsequent blood infection. Immune signatures of secreted P. falciparum liver stage antigens, but neither an established rodent malaria model nor concentrations of sporozoite antibodies, permit prediction of vaccine efficacy.",

The usual approach consists of transforming the time series into user-defined features and then using these features as predictors in conventional statistical or machine learning models. Here we suggest the use of deep learning models as an alternative to this approach. Recent deep learning techniques can perform the classification directly from the time series, eliminating subjective and resource-consuming data transformation steps, and potentially improving classification results. We describe some of the deep learning architectures relevant for time series classification and show how these architectures and their hyper-parameters can be tested and used for the classification problems at hand. We illustrate the approach using three case studies from distinct ecological subdisciplines: i) insect species identification from wingbeat spectrograms; ii) species distribution modelling from climate time series and iii) the classification of phenological phases from continuous meteorological data. The deep learning approach delivered ecologically sensible and accurate classifications demonstrating its potential for wide applicability across subfields of ecology.",

    "abstract": "In bi-parental species, reproduction is not only a crucial life-history stage where individuals must take fitness-relevant decisions, but these decisions also need to be adjusted to the behavioural strategies of a partner. Hence, communication is required, which could be facilitated by condition-dependent signals of parental quality. Yet, these traits have (co-)evolved in multiple contexts within the family, as during reproduction different family members may coincide and interact at the site of breeding. In this study we explore whether a condition-dependent trait acts a quality signal and regulates intra-family interactions in a bird species, the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus). As a family is a complex network where signals could be perceived by multiple receivers, we expected that experimentally blocking the reflectance of an adults UV/yellow colouration of breast feathers may affect the behavioural strategies of all family members. We found an increase of parental investment in nests with an UV-blocked adult, as the partner compensated for the perceived lower rearing capacity. As the UV-blocked adult did not change its provisioning behaviour, as was to be expected, their partner must have responded to the (manipulated) signal but not to a behavioural change. However, offspring did not co-adjust their begging intensity to a signal of parental quality. Opposite to adults, we propose that offspring respond to the behaviour but not to the parental signal. Overall, our results show experimentally at the first time that UV/yellow colouration of blue tits acts as a quality signal revealing the rearing capacity to mates.",

Therefore, to understand how the neural system coordinates with behaviors, neuroscientists need a quantitative description of the hierarchical dynamics of different behaviors.

These approaches usually lose rich dynamic information on cross-scale behaviors. Inspired by the natural structure of animal behaviors, we addressed this challenge by proposing a novel parallel and multi-layered framework to learn the hierarchical dynamics and generate an objective metric to map the behavior into the feature space. In addition, we characterized the animal 3D kinematics with our low-cost and efficient multi-view 3D animal motion-capture system. Finally, we demonstrated that this framework could monitor spontaneous behavior and automatically identify the behavioral phenotypes of the transgenic animal disease model. The extensive experiment results suggest that our framework has a wide range of applications, including animal disease model phenotyping and the relationships modeling between the neural circuits and behavior.",

    "abstract": "The Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) mechanism removes a wide spectrum of structurally different lesions that critically depend on the binding of the DNA damage sensing NER factor XPC-RAD23B (XPC) to the lesions. The bulky mutagenic benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide metabolite-derived cis- and trans-B[a]P-dG lesions (G*) adopt base-displaced intercalative (cis) or minor groove (trans) conformations in fully paired DNA duplexes with the canonical C opposite G* (G*:C duplexes). While XPC has a high affinity for binding to these DNA lesions in fully complementary double-stranded DNA, we show here that deleting only the C in the complementary strand opposite the lesion G* embedded in 50-mer duplexes, fully abrogates XPC binding. Accurate values of XPC dissociation constants (KD) were determined by employing an excess of unmodified DNA as a competitor; this approach eliminated the binding and accumulation of multiple XPC molecules to the same DNA duplexes, a phenomenon that prevented the accurate estimation of XPC binding affinities in previous studies. Surprisingly, a detailed comparison of XPC dissociation constants KD of unmodified and lesion-containing G*:Del complexes, showed that the KD values were [~] 2.5 - 3.6 times greater in the case of G*:Del than in the unmodified G:Del and fully base-paired G:C duplexes. The origins of this unexpected XPC lesion avoidance effect is attributed to the intercalation of the bulky, planar B[a]P aromatic ring system between adjacent DNA bases that thermodynamically stabilize the G*:Del duplexes. The strong lesion-base stacking interactions associated with the absence of the partner base, prevent the DNA structural distortions needed for the binding of the BHD2 and BHD3 {beta}-hairpins of XPC to the deletion duplexes, thus accounting for the loss of XPC binding and the known NER-resistance of G*:Del duplexes.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the gene Additional Sex-Combs Like 1 (ASXL1) are recurrent in myeloid malignancies as well as the pre-malignant condition clonal hematopoiesis, where they are universally associated with poor prognosis. An epigenetic regulator, ASXL1 canonically directs the deposition of H3K27me3 via the polycomb repressive complex 2. However, its precise role in myeloid lineage maturation is incompletely described. We utilized single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on a murine model of hematopoietic-specific ASXL1 deletion and identified a specific role for ASXL1 in terminal granulocyte maturation. Terminal maturation is accompanied by down regulation of Myc expression and cell cycle exit. ASXL1 deletion leads to hyperactivation of Myc in granulocyte precursors and a quantitative decrease in neutrophil production. This failure of normal developmentallyassociated Myc suppression is not accompanied by significant changes in the landscape of covalent histone modifications including H3K27me3. Examining the genome-wide localization of ASXL1 in myeloid progenitors revealed strong co-localization with RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) at the promoters and spread across the gene bodies of transcriptionally active genes. ASXL1 deletion results in a decrease in RNAPII promoter-proximal pausing in granulocyte progenitors, indicative of a global increase in productive transcription, consistent with the known role of ASXL1 as a mediator of RNAPII pause release. These results suggest that ASXL1 inhibits productive transcription in granulocyte progenitors, identifying a new role for this epigenetic regulator and highlighting a novel potential oncogenic mechanism for ASXL1 mutations in myeloid malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Infection of the human stomach by Helicobacter pylori remains a worldwide problem and greatly contributes to peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. Without active intervention approximately 50% of the world population will continue to be infected with this gastric pathogen. Current eradication, called triple therapy, entails a proton-pump inhibitor and two broadband antibiotics, however resistance to either clarithromycin or metronidazole is greater than 25% and rising. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a targeted, high-specificity eradication drug. Gastric infection by H. pylori depends on the expression of a nickeldependent urease in the cytoplasm of the bacteria. Here, we report the 2.01 [A] resolution structure of the 1.1 MDa urease in complex with a novel inhibitor by cryo-electron microscopy and compare it to a {beta}-mercaptoethanol-inhibited structure at 2.45 [A] resolution.

The central dogma of the kallikrein-kinin system is that BK-(1-9) fragments are biologically inactive. In this manuscript, we proposed to test whether these fragments were indeed inactive.\n\nExperimental ApproachNitric oxide (NO) was quantified in human, mouse and rat cells loaded with DAF-FM after stimulation with BK-(1-9), BK-(1-7), BK-(1-5) and BK-(1-3). We used adult male rat aortic ring preparation to test vascular reactivity mediated by BK-(1-9) fragments. Changes in blood pressure and heart rate was measured in conscious adult male rats by intraarterial catheter method.\n\nKey resultsBK-(1-9) induced NO production in all cell types tested by B2 receptor activation. BK-(1-7), BK-(1-5) and BK-(1-3) also induced NO production in all tested cell types but this response was independent of the activation of B1 receptor and/or B2 receptor. BK-(1-7), BK-(1-5) or BK-(1-3) induced only vasorelaxant effect and in a concentration-dependent fashion. Vasorelaxant effects for BK-(1-7), BK-(1-5) or BK-(1-3) were independent of the kinin receptors. Different administration routes (i.e., intravenous or intra-arterial) did not affect the observed hypotension induced by BK-(1-7), BK-(1-5) or BK-(1-3). Importantly, these observations diverged from the BK-(1-9) results, highlighting that indeed the BK-(1-9) fragments do not seem to act via the classical kinin receptors.\n\nConclusions and implicationsIn conclusion, BK-(1-7), BK-(1-5) and BK-(1-3) are biologically active components of the kallikrein-kinin system.

Rather than acting directly on the translation machinery, we find that mutant FUS forms cytoplasmic condensates that promote the phase separation of FMRP, another RBP associated with neurodegeneration and robustly involved in translation regulation. FUS and FMRP co-partition and repress translation in vitro. In our in vivo model, FMRP RNA targets are depleted from ribosomes.

    "abstract": "The specificity with which past experiences can be remembered varies across the lifespan, possibly due to differences in how precisely information is encoded. Memory formation can be investigated through repetition effects, the common finding that neural activity is altered when stimuli are repeated. However, whether differences in this indirect measure of memory formation relate to lifespan differences in memory specificity has not yet been established. In the present study, we examined repetition effects in event-related potentials and their relation to recognition. During incidental encoding, children (aged 7-9 years), young adults (18-30 years), and older adults (65-76 years) viewed repeated object images from different categories. During subsequent recognition, we distinguished memory for the specific items versus the general categories. We identified repetition suppression in all age groups, and repetition enhancement for adults. Furthermore, individual item recognition performance comprising lure discrimination was positively associated with the magnitude of the neural repetition effects, which did not differ between groups, indicating common neural mechanisms of memory formation. Our findings demonstrate that neural repetition effects reflect the formation of highly specific memory representations and highlight their significance as a neural indicator of individual differences in episodic memory encoding across the lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the temperature dependence of carbon use efficiency (CUE) is critical for understanding microbial physiology, population dynamics, and community-level responses to changing environmental temperatures 1,2. Currently, microbial CUE is widely assumed to decrease with temperature 3,4. However, this assumption is based largely on community-level data, which are influenced by many confounding factors 5, with little empirical evidence at the level of individual strains. Here, we experimentally characterise the CUE thermal response for a diverse set of environmental bacterial isolates. We find that contrary to current thinking, bacterial CUE typically responds either positively to temperature, or has no discernible temperature response, within biologically meaningful temperature ranges. Using a global data-synthesis, we show that our empirical results are generalisable across a much wider diversity of bacteria than have previously been tested. This systematic variation in the thermal responses of bacterial CUE stems from the fact that relative to respiration rates, bacterial population growth rates typically respond more strongly to temperature, and are also subject to weaker evolutionary constraints. Our results provide fundamental new insights into microbial physiology, and a basis for more accurately modelling the effects of shorter-term thermal fluctuations as well as longer-term climatic warming on microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Many antibiotic resistance genes co-occur with resistance genes for transition metals, such as copper, zinc, or mercury. In some environments, a positive correlation between high metal concentration and high abundance of antibiotic resistance genes has been observed, suggesting co-selection due to metal presence. Of particular concern is the use of copper and zinc in animal husbandry, leading to potential co-selection for antibiotic resistance in animal gut microbiomes, slurry, manure, or amended soils. For antibiotics, predicted no effect concentrations have been derived from laboratory measured minimum inhibitory concentrations and some minimal selective concentrations have been investigated in environmental settings. However, minimal co-selection concentrations for metals are difficult to identify. Here, we use mathematical modelling to provide a general mechanistic framework to predict minimal co-selective concentrations for metals, given knowledge of their toxicity at different concentrations. We apply the method to copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and silver (Ag), predicting their minimum co-selective concentrations in mg/L (Cu: 5.5, Zn: 1.6, Hg: 0.0156, Pb: 21.5, Ag: 0.152). To exemplify use of these thresholds, we consider metal concentrations from slurry and slurry-amended soil from a UK dairy farm that uses copper and zinc as additives for feed and antimicrobial footbath: the slurry is predicted to be co-selective, but not the slurry-amended soil. This modelling framework could be used as the basis for defining standards to mitigate risks of antimicrobial resistance applicable to a wide range of environments, including manure, slurry and other waste streams.",

    "abstract": "Representation of electrostatic interactions by a Coulombic pair-wise potential between atom-centered partial charges is a fundamental and crucial part of empirical force fields used in classical molecular dynamics simulations. The broad success of the AMBER force field family originates mainly from the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) charge model, which derives partial charges to reproduce the electrostatic field around the molecules. However, description of the electrostatic potential around molecules by standard RESP may be biased for some types of molecules. In this study, we modified the RESP charge derivation model to improve its description of the electrostatic potential around molecules, and thus electrostatic interactions in the force field. In particular, we re-optimized the atomic radii for definition of the grid points around the molecule, redesigned the restraining scheme and included extra point charges. The RESP fitting was significantly improved for aromatic heterocyclic molecules. Thus, the suggested W-RESP(-EP) charge derivation model showed clear potential for improving the performance of the nucleic acid force fields, for which poor description of nonbonded interactions, such as underestimated base pairing, makes it difficult to describe the folding free energy landscape of small oligonucleotides.",

The model is based on the solution of the Langevin equation in the presence of noise and perturbation. A residue is perturbed periodically with a given frequency and the response of other residues is determined in terms of a storage and loss modulus of the protein. The amount of work lost upon periodic perturbation and the residues that contribute significantly to the lost work is determined. The model shows that perturbation introduces new dynamic correlations into the system with time delayed synchronous and asynchronous components. Residues whose perturbation induces large correlations in the protein and those that do not lead to correlations may be identified. The model is used to investigate the dynamic modulation of nanobodies. Despite its simplicity, the model explains several features of perturbation and response such as the role of loops and linkers in perturbation, dispersion of work of perturbation, and information transfer through preexisting pathways, all shown to be important factors in allostery.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy with limited treatment options. Although activating mutations of the KRAS GTPase are the predominant dependency present in >90% of PDAC patients, targeting KRAS mutants directly has been challenging in PDAC.\n\nSimilarly, strategies targeting known KRAS downstream effectors have had limited clinical success due to feedback mechanisms, alternate pathways and toxicity due to the targeting of normal tissues. Therefore, identifying additional functionally relevant KRAS interactions in PDAC may allow for a better understanding of feedback mechanisms and unveil new potential therapeutic targets. Here, we used proximity labelling to identify protein interactors of active KRAS in PDAC cells. Fusions of wildtype (BirA-KRAS4B), mutant (BirA-KRAS4BG12D) and non-transforming and cytosolic double mutant (BirA-KRAS4BG12D/C185S) KRAS with the BirA biotin ligase were expressed in murine PDAC cells. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that RSK1 was enriched among proteins that selectively interacted with membrane-bound KRASG12D. RSK1 required the NF1 and SPRED proteins to interact with KRAS-GTP at the membrane. In both murine and human PDAC lines, membrane-targeted RSK1 was tolerated but inhibited cell proliferation following oncogenic KRAS abrogation to reveal a negative feedback role for membrane-localized RSK1 on wild-type KRAS. Inhibition of the wild-type KRAS, which has been previously proposed to suppress KRAS oncogenesis, may partially explain how RSK1 has been identified as a dependency in some KRAS mutant cells and may provide an additional function for NF1 in tumorigenesis.\n\nSignificance StatementFor decades, KRAS interactors have been sought after as potential therapeutic targets in KRAS mutant cancers, especially pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our proximity labeling screen with KRAS in PDAC cells highlight RSK1 as a notable mutant-specific interactor. Functionally, we show that RSK1 mediates negative feedback on wild-type KRAS in PDAC cells.",

    "abstract": "Ageing, the decline of biological functions over time, is inherent to eukaryotes. Female honeybees attain a long-lived queen phenotype upon continuous consumption of royal jelly, whereas restricted supply of this nutritional substance promotes the development of worker bees, which are short-lived. An abundant protein found within royal jelly is major royal jelly protein 1 (MRJP1), also known as  Royalactin. Health- and lifespan promoting effects have been attributed to Royalactin in species from diverse animal taxa, suggesting it acts on phylogenetically conserved physiological processes. Here, we explore the effects of feeding the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans with Escherichia coli that express a recombinant form of Royalactin (RArec). We confirm that consumption of RArec increases body size, improves locomotion and extends lifespan. We discover a link between Royalactin and mitochondria, organelles which play a key part in the ageing process: both spare respiratory capacity and morphology indicate improved mitochondrial function in RArec fed C. elegans. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using recombinant Royalactin to gain further insight into processes of healthy ageing in many species.\n\nRArec production allows insight into potential beneficial effects across species.",

    "abstract": "In many endangered species, reproductive failure is a major barrier to recovery. The critically endangered k[a]k[a]p[o] (Strigops habroptilus) exemplifies this challenge: 61% of their eggs fail to hatch, and of these 73% show no sign of development. Undeveloped eggs have previously been attributed to male infertility, but recent studies of non-threatened bird species suggest fertilisation failure is rare in the wild. The underlying causes of fertilisation failure and embryo death differ, so distinguishing between them is essential for effective conservation management. Here we show that the majority (72%, n=124) of undeveloped k[a]k[a]p[o] eggs are fertilised, and combine this with conservation programme data on natural copulations, artificial inseminations, and paternity of developed eggs, to generate the most precise estimate to date of fertility in a wild population. We also demonstrate, for the first time in a wild bird, that artificial insemination results in greater numbers of sperm reaching the egg.",

    "abstract": "Continued mining of natural products from the strain Streptomyces sp. MA37 in our laboratory led to the discovery of a minor specialised metabolite (SM) called accramycin A. Owing to its low yield (0.2mg/L) in the wild type strain, we investigated the roles of regulatory genes in the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster (acc BGC) through gene inactivation with the aim of improving the titre of this compound. One of the resulting mutants ({Delta}accJ) dramatically upregulated the production of accramycin A 1 by 330-fold (66mg/L). Furthermore, ten new metabolites, accramycins B-K 2-11, were discovered, together with two known compounds, naphthacemycin B1 12 and fasamycin C 13 from the mutant extract. This suggested that accJ, annotated as Multiple Antibiotic Resistance Regulator (MarR), is a negative regulator gene in the accramycin biosynthesis. Compounds 1-13 inhibited the Gram-positive pathogens (S. aureus, E. faecalis) and clinical isolates, E. faecium (K59-68 and K60-39), and S. haemolyticus with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values in the range of 1.5-12.5{micro}g/mL. Remarkably, compounds 1-13 displayed superior activity against K60-39 (MIC = 3.1-6.3{micro}g/mL) than ampicillin (MIC = 25{micro}g/mL), and offer promising potential for the development of accramycin-based antibiotics that target multidrug-resistant Enterococcus clinical isolates.

Peptide location fingerprinting is a proteomic analysis technique capable of identifying structural modification-associated differences in mass spectrometry (MS) datasets of complex biological samples. A new webtool (Manchester Peptide Location Fingerprinter), applied to photoaged and intrinsically aged skin proteomes, can relatively quantify peptides (spectral counting) and map statistically significant differences to regions within protein structures. New photoageing biomarkers were identified in multiple proteins including matrix components (collagens and proteoglycans), oxidation and protease modulators (peroxiredoxins and SERPINs) and cytoskeletal proteins (keratins). Crucially, for many extracellular biomarkers, structural modification-associated differences were not correlated with relative abundance (by ion intensity). By applying peptide location fingerprinting to published MS datasets, (identifying biomarkers including collagen V and versican in ageing tendon) we demonstrate the potential of the MPLF webtool to discover novel biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are crucial factors of post-transcriptional gene regulation and their modes of action are intensely investigated. At the center of attention are RNA motifs that guide where RBPs bind. However, sequence motifs are often poor predictors of RBP-RNA interactions in vivo. It is hence believed that many RBPs recognize RNAs as complexes, to increase specificity and regulatory possibilities. To probe the potential for complex formation among RBPs, we assembled a library of 978 mammalian RBPs and used rec-Y2H screening to detect direct interactions between RBPs, sampling > 600 K interactions. We discovered 1994 new interactions and demonstrate that interacting RBPs bind RNAs adjacently in vivo. We further find that the mRNA binding region and motif preferences of RBPs can deviate, depending on their adjacently binding interaction partners. Finally, we reveal novel RBP interaction networks among major RNA processing steps and show that splicing impairing RBP mutations observed in cancer rewire spliceosomal interaction networks.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=132 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/296160v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7a2dc6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1533c0dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18bb4a1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ffe601_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The main aim of this work was to develop and validate a novel tool for determining methylation of mtDNA and to corroborate its existence across different biological contexts. Using long-read nanopore sequencing we found low levels of CpG methylation (with few exceptions) and little variation across biological processes: differentiation, oxidative stress, and cancer. 5mCpG was overall higher in tissues compared to cell lines, with small additional variation between cell lines of different origin. Although we do show several significant changes in all these conditions, 5mCpG is unlikely to play a major role in defining the transcriptional status of mitochondrial genes.",

    "abstract": "Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and the cytochromes P450 (P450s) are endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymes that rely on the same protein, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (POR), to provide the electrons necessary for substrate metabolism. Although the HO-1 and P450 systems are interconnected due to their common electron donor, they generally have been studied separately. As the expression of both HO-1 and P450s are affected by xenobiotic exposure, changes in HO-1 expression can potentially affect P450 function, and conversely, changes in P450 expression can influence HO-1. The goal of this study was to examine interactions between the P450 and HO-1 systems. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), HO-1 formed HO-1*P450 complexes with CYP1A2, CYP1A1, and CYP2D6, but not all P450s. Studies then focused on the HO-1/CYP1A2 interaction. CYP1A2 formed a physical complex with HO-1 that was stable in the presence of POR. As expected, both HO-1 and CYP1A2 formed BRET-detectable complexes with POR. Whereas the POR*CYP1A2 complex was readily disrupted by the addition of HO-1, the POR*HO-1 complex was not significantly affected by the addition of CYP1A2. Interestingly, enzyme activities did not follow this pattern. Whereas BRET data suggested substantial inhibition of CYP1A2-mediated 7-ethoxyresorufin deethylation in the presence of HO-1, its activity was actually stimulated at subsaturating POR. In contrast, HO-1-mediated heme metabolism was inhibited at subsaturating POR. These results indicate that HO-1 and CYP1A2 form a stable complex and have mutual effects on the catalytic behavior of both proteins that cannot be explained by simple competition for POR.",

    "abstract": "Many older adults are struggling with understanding spoken language, particularly when background noise interferes with comprehension. In the present study, we investigated a potential interaction between two well-known factors associated with greater speech-in-noise (SiN) reception thresholds in older adults, namely a) lower working memory capacity and b) age-related structural decline of frontal lobe regions.\n\nIn a sample of older adults (N=25) and younger controls (N=13) with normal pure-tone thresholds, SiN reception thresholds and working memory capacity were assessed. Furthermore, T1-weighted structural MR-images were recorded to analyze neuroanatomical traits (i.e., cortical thickness (CT) and cortical surface area (CSA)) of the cortex.\n\nAs expected, the older group showed greater SiN reception thresholds compared to the younger group. We also found consistent age-related atrophy (i.e., lower CT) in brain regions associated with SiN recognition namely the superior temporal lobe bilaterally, the right inferior frontal and precentral gyrus, as well as the left superior frontal gyrus. Those older participants with greater atrophy in these brain regions also showed greater SiN reception thresholds. Interestingly, the association between CT in the left superior frontal gyrus and SiN reception thresholds was moderated by individual working memory capacity. Older adults with greater working memory capacity benefitted more strongly from thicker frontal lobe regions when it comes to improve SiN recognition.\n\nOverall, our results fit well into the literature showing that age-related structural decline in auditory- and cognition-related brain areas is associated with greater SiN reception thresholds in older adults. However, we highlight that this association changes as a function of individual working memory capacity. We therefore believe that future interventions to improve SiN recognition in older adults should take into account the role of the frontal lobe as well as individual working memory capacity.\n\nHighlightsO_LISpeech-in-noise (SiN) reception thresholds are significantly increased with higher age, independently of pure-tone hearing loss\nC_LIO_LIGreater SiN reception thresholds are associated with cortical thinning in several auditory-, linguistic-, and cognitive-related brain areas, irrespective of pure-tone hearing loss\nC_LIO_LIGreater cortical thinning in the left superior frontal lobe is detrimental for SiN recognition in older, but not younger adults\nC_LIO_LIOlder adults with greater working memory capacity benefit more strongly from structural integrity of left superior frontal lobe for SiN recognition\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The contribution of bacteria in livestock to the global burden of antimicrobial resistance raises concerns worldwide. However, the dynamics of selection and diffusion of antimicrobial resistance in farm animals are not fully understood. Here, we used veal calf fattening farms as a model system, as they are a known reservoir of Extended Spectrum {beta}-Lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC). Longitudinal data of ESBL-EC carriage and antimicrobial use (AMU) were collected from three veal calf farms during the entire fattening process. We developed 18 agent-based mechanistic models to assess different hypotheses regarding the main drivers of ESBL-EC dynamics in calves. The models were independently fitted to the longitudinal data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and the best model was selected. Within-farm transmission between individuals and sporadic events of contamination were found to drive ESBL-EC dynamics on farms. In the absence of AMU, the median carriage duration of ESBL-EC was estimated to be 19.6 days (95% credible interval: [12.7; 33.3]). In the best model, AMU was found to influence ESBL-EC dynamics, by affecting ESBL-EC clearance rather than acquisition. This effect of AMU was estimated to decrease gradually after the end of exposure and to disappear after 62.5 days [50.0; 76.9]. Moreover, using a simulation study, we quantified the efficacy of ESBL-EC mitigation strategies. Decreasing ESBL-EC prevalence by 50% on arrival at the fattening farm reduced prevalence at slaughter age by 33.3%. Completely eliminating the use of selective antibiotics had a strong effect on average ESBL-EC prevalence (relative reduction of 79.6%), but the effect was mild if this use was only decreased by 50% compared to baseline (relative reduction of 3.7%).",

    "abstract": "Viruses rely on the host translation machinery to synthesize their own proteins. Consequently, they have evolved varied mechanisms to co-opt host translation for their survival. SARS-CoV-2 relies on a non-structural protein, Nsp1, for shutting down host translation. However, it is currently unknown how viral proteins and host factors critical for viral replication can escape a global shutdown of host translation. Here, using a novel FACS-based assay called MeTAFlow, we report a dose-dependent reduction in both nascent protein synthesis and mRNA abundance in cells expressing Nsp1. We perform RNA-Seq and matched ribosome profiling experiments to identify gene-specific changes both at the mRNA expression and translation level. We discover a functionally-coherent subset of human genes are preferentially translated in the context of Nsp1 expression. These genes include the translation machinery components, RNA binding proteins, and others important for viral pathogenicity. Importantly, we uncovered a remarkable enrichment of 5' terminal oligo-pyrimidine (TOP) tracts among preferentially translated genes. Using reporter assays, we validated that 5 UTRs from TOP transcripts can drive preferential expression in the presence of NSP1. Finally, we found that LARP1, a key effector protein in the mTOR pathway may contribute to preferential translation of TOP transcripts in response to Nsp1 expression. Collectively, our study suggests fine tuning of host gene expression and translation by Nsp1 despite its global repressive effect on host protein synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic signaling by fishes has been recognized for millennia, but is typically regarded as comparatively rare within ray-finned fishes; as such, it has yet to be integrated into broader concepts of vertebrate evolution. We map the most comprehensive data set of volitional sound production of ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) yet assembled onto a family level phylogeny of the group, a clade representing more than half of extant vertebrate species. Our choice of family-level rather than species-level analysis allows broad investigation of sonifery within actinopterygians and provides a conservative estimate of the distribution and ancestry of a character that is likely far more widespread than currently known. The results show that families with members exhibiting soniferous behavior contain nearly two-thirds of actinopterygian species, with potentially more than 20,000 species using acoustic communication. Sonic fish families also contain more extant species than those without sounds. Evolutionary analysis shows that sound production is an ancient behavior because it is present in a clade that originating circa 340 Ma, much earlier than any evidence for sound production within tetrapods. Ancestral state reconstruction indicates that sound production is not ancestral for actinopterygians; instead, it independently evolved at least 27 times, compared to six within tetrapods. This likely represents an underestimate for actinopterygians that will change as sonifery is recognized in ever more species of actinopterygians. Several important ecological factors are significantly correlated with sonifery - including physical attributes of the environment, predation by members of other vertebrate clades, and reproductive tactics - further demonstrating the broader importance of sound production in the life history evolution of fishes. These findings offer a new perspective on the role of sound production and acousticcommunication during the evolution of Actinopterygii, a clade containing more than 34,000 species of extant vertebrates.",

Fundamental biophysical principles governing LLPS during RNP granule assembly have been revealed by simple in vitro systems consisting of several components, but these systems have limitations when studying the biology of complex, multicomponent RNP granules. Visualization of RNP granules in live cells has validated key principles revealed by simple in vitro systems, but this approach presents difficulties for interrogating biophysical features of RNP granules and provides limited ability to manipulate protein, nucleic acid, or small molecule concentrations. Here we introduce a system that builds upon recent insights into the mechanisms underlying RNP granule assembly and permits high fidelity reconstitution of stress granules and the granular component of nucleoli in mammalian cellular lysate. This system fills the gap between simple in vitro systems and live cells, and allows for a wide variety of studies of membraneless organelles.",

Studying selectivity between WNTs and FZDs has been hampered by the paucity of purified WNT proteins and by their apparent non-selective interactions with the FZD receptors. Here we describe an engineered protein, called F7L6, comprised of antibody-derived single chain variable fragments that selectively binds to human FZD7 and the co-receptor LRP6. F7L6 potently activates WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling in a manner similar to Wnt3a. In contrast to Wnt3a, F7L6 engages only FZD7 and none of the other FZD proteins. Treatment of human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells with F7L6 initiates transcriptional programs similar to those observed during primitive streak formation and subsequent gastrulation in the mammalian embryo. This demonstrates that selective engagement and activation of FZD7 signaling is sufficient to promote mesendodermal differentiation of hPS cells.",

    "abstract": "The antiviral innate immunity in mammals has evolved very rapidly in response to pathogen selective pressure. Studying the evolutionary diversification of mammalian antiviral defenses is of main importance to better understand our innate immune repertoire. The small HERC proteins are part of a multigene family including interferon-inducible antiviral effectors. Notably, HERC5 inhibits divergent viruses through the conjugation of ISG15 to diverse proteins-termed as ISGylation. Though HERC6 is the most closely-related protein of HERC5, it lacks the ISGylation function in humans. Interestingly, HERC6 is the main E3-ligase of ISG15 in mice, suggesting adaptive changes in HERC6 with implications in the innate immunity. Therefore, HERC5 and HERC6 have probably diversified through complex evolutionary history in mammals, and such characterization would require an extensive survey of mammalian evolution. Here, we performed mammalian-wide and lineage-specific phylogenetic and genomic analyses of HERC5 and HERC6. We used 83 orthologous sequences from bats, rodents, primates, artiodactyls and carnivores - the top five representative groups of mammalian evolution and the main hosts of viral diversity. We found that mammalian HERC5 has been under weak and differential positive selection in mammals, with only primate HERC5 showing evidences of pathogen-driven selection. In contrast, HERC6 has been under strong and recurrent adaptive evolution in mammals, suggesting past genetic arms-races with viral pathogens. Importantly, we found accelerated evolution in the HERC6 spacer domain, suggesting that it might be a pathogen-mammal interface, targeting a viral protein and/or being the target of virus antagonists. Finally, we identified a HERC5/6 chimeric gene that arose from independent duplication in rodent and bat lineages and encodes for a conserved HERC5 N-terminal domain and divergent HERC6 spacer and HECT domains. This duplicated chimeric gene highlights adaptations that potentially contribute to rodent and bat antiviral innate immunity. Altogether, we found major genetic innovations in mammalian HERC5 and HERC6. Our findings open new research avenues on the functions of HERC6 and HERC5/6 in mammals, and on their implication in antiviral innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "Fungal mitochondrial genomes encode for genes involved in crucial cellular processes, such as oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial translation, and these genes have been used as molecular markers for population genetics studies. Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii are endemic fungal pathogens that cause coccidioidomycosis in arid regions across both American continents. To date, almost one hundred Coccidioides strains have been sequenced. The focus of these studies has been exclusively to infer patterns of variation of nuclear genomes (nucDNA). However, their mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) have not been studied. In this report, we describe the assembly and annotation of mitochondrial reference genomes for two representative strains of C. posadasii and C. immitis, as well as assess population variation among 77 published genomes. The circular-mapping mtDNA molecules are 68.2 Kb in C. immitis and 75.1 Kb in C. posadasii. We identified the fourteen mitochondrial protein-coding genes common to most fungal mitochondria, including genes encoding the small and large ribosomal RNAs (rns and rnl), the RNA subunit of RNAse P (rnpB), and 26 tRNAs organized in polycistronic transcription units, which are mostly syntenic across different populations and species of Coccidioides. Both Coccidioides species are characterized by a large number of group I and II introns, harboring twice the number of elements as compared to closely related Onygenales. The introns contain complete or truncated ORFs with high similarity to homing endonucleases of the LAGLIDADG and GIY-YIG families. Phylogenetic comparison of the mtDNA and nucDNA genomes shows discordance, possibly due to differences in patterns of inheritance. In summary, this work represents the first complete assessment of mitochondrial genomes among several isolates of both species of Coccidioides, and provides a foundation for future functional work.",

    "abstract": "Overexpression of tripartite efflux pump systems in gram-negative bacteria are a principal component of antibiotic resistance. High-yield purification of the outer membrane component of these systems will enable biochemical and structural interrogation of their mechanisms of action and allow testing of compounds that target them. However, preparation of these proteins is typically hampered by low yields requiring laborious large-scale efforts. If refolding conditions can be found, refolding these proteins from inclusion bodies can lead to increased yields as compared to membrane isolations. Here, we develop a concentration-dependent folding protocol for refolding TolC, the outer membrane component of the antibiotic efflux pump from Escherichia coli. We show that by our method of re-folding, homotrimeric TolC remains folded in SDS-PAGE, retains binding to an endogenous ligand, and recapitulates the known crystal structure by single particle cryoEM analysis. We find that a key factor in successful re-folding is a concentration dependence of TolC oligomerization. We extended the scheme to CmeC, a homologous protein from Campylobacter jejuni, and find that concentration-dependent oligomerization is a general feature of these systems. Because outer-membrane efflux pump components are ubiquitous across gram-negative species, we anticipate that incorporating a concentration step in re-folding protocols will promote correct refolding allowing for reliable, high-yield preparation of this family of proteins.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms and forces involved in the translocation of bacterial toxins into host cells have thus far remained elusive. The adenylate cyclase (CyaA) toxin from Bordetella pertussis displays a unique intoxication pathway in which its catalytic domain is directly translocated across target cell membranes. We have previously identified a translocation region in CyaA that contains a segment, P454 (residues 454-484), exhibiting membrane-active properties related to antimicrobial peptides. Herein, we show that this peptide is able to translocate across membranes and interact with calmodulin. Structural and biophysical analyses have revealed the key residues of P454 involved in membrane destabilization and calmodulin binding. Mutational analysis demonstrated that these residues play a crucial role in CyaA translocation into target cells. We have also shown that calmidazolium, a calmodulin inhibitor, efficiently blocks CyaA internalization. We propose that after CyaA binding to target cells, the P454 segment destabilizes the plasma membrane, translocates across the lipid bilayer and binds calmodulin. Trapping of the CyaA polypeptide chain by the CaM:P454 interaction in the cytosol may assist the entry of the N-terminal catalytic domain by converting the stochastic process of protein translocation into an efficient vectorial chain transfer into host cells.",

    "abstract": "Cells in their natural environment are embedded in a complex surrounding consisting of biochemical and biomechanical cues directing cell properties and cell behaviour. Nonetheless, in vitro cell studies are typically performed on flat surfaces, with clear differences from the more complex situation cells experience in vivo. To increase the physiological relevance of these studies, a number of advanced cellular substrates for in vitro studies have been applied. One of these approaches include flat surfaces decorated with vertically aligned nanostructures.\n\nIn this work, we explore how U2OS cells are affected by arrays of polymer nanopillars fabricated on flat glass surfaces. We focus on describing changes to the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton and in the location, number and shape of focal adhesions. From our findings we identify that the cells can be categorised into different regimes based on their spreading and adhesion behaviour on nanopillars. A quantitative analysis suggests that cells seeded on dense nanopillar arrays are suspended on top of the pillars with focal adhesions forming closer to the cell periphery compared to flat surfaces or sparse pillar arrays. This change is analogous to similar responses for cells seeded on soft substrates.\n\nOverall, we show that the combination of high throughput nanofabrication, advanced optical microscopy, molecular biology tools to visualise cellular processes and data analysis can be used to investigate how cells interact with nanostructured surfaces and will in the future help to create culture substrates that induce particular cell function.",

    "abstract": "Increased presence of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in tumor tissue has been extensively reported. These cells represent a major constituent of tumor infiltrate and exhibit a distinct phenotype with immunosuppressive and tolerogenic functions. However, their role in the regulation of hyaluronan (HA) metabolism in the tumor microenvironment has not been established. Here we describe a novel function of tumor-associated myeloid cells related to the enhanced breakdown of extracellular HA in human bladder cancer tissue leading to accumulation of small HA fragments with MW <20 kDa. Increased fragmentation of extracellular HA and accumulation of low molecular weight HA (LMW-HA) in tumor tissue was associated with elevated production of multiple inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and angiogenic factors. The fragmentation of HA by myeloid cells was mediated by the membrane-bound enzyme hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal2). The increased numbers of Hyal2+CD11b+ myeloid cells were detected in the tumor tissue as well as in the peripheral blood of bladder cancer patients. Co-expression of CD33 suggests that these cells belong to monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells. HA-degrading function of Hyal2-expressing MDSCs could be enhanced by exposure to tumor-conditioned medium, and IL-1{beta} was identified as one of factors involved in the stimulation of Hyal2 activity. CD44-mediated signaling plays an important role in the regulation of HA-degrading activity of Hyal2-expressing myeloid cells, since engagement of CD44 receptor with specific monoclonal antibody triggered translocation of Hyal2 enzyme to the cellular surface and also stimulated secretion of IL-1{beta}. Taken together, this work identifies the Hyal2-expressing tumor-associated myeloid cells, and links these cells to the accumulation of LMW-HA in the tumor microenvironment and cancer-related inflammation and angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Our recent study of a novel model of T-ALL pre-leukemic stem cells, the NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) mouse, showed that the abnormal self-renewal of these stem cells was dependent on Lyl1 yet, when Lyl1 was deleted, the T-ALL still developed. In the present study, we observe that the thymocytes in these mice also overexpress EphA3, and we characterise the thymocytes in NHD13-EphA3-/- mice. NHD13-EphA3-/- thymocytes retain their abnormal self-renewal activity demonstrated by their capacity to engraft following primary and secondary transplants. Strikingly, NHD13-EphA3-/- thymocytes fail to engraft upon the third serial transplant, whereas the NHD13 thymocytes engraft indefinitely. Seeking to explain this, we find that NHD13 DN2 thymocytes are capable of halting the normal differentiation process of incoming WT progenitor cells, and remarkably, this capacity is severely impaired in the absence of EphA3. Therefore EphA3 is not critical for engraftment, but is essential for enabling the halt in differentiation of neighbouring WT cells, which in turn allows the incumbent progenitors to remain longer in the thymus due to an absence of normal cell competition, a property that in itself has been demonstrated to be oncogenic. We suggest that pre-leukemic self-renewal in this model is a complex interplay of cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and that multiple redundant pathways to leukemogenesis are active in this model.",

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), enters the host cells through two main pathways, both involving key interactions between viral envelope-anchored spike glycoprotein of the novel coronavirus and the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). To date, SARS-CoV-2 has infected up to 26 million people worldwide; yet, there is no clinically approved drug or vaccine available. Therefore, a rapid and coordinated effort to re-purpose clinically approved drugs that prevent or disrupt these critical entry pathways of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interaction with human ACE2, could potentially accelerate the identification and clinical advancement of prophylactic and/or treatment options against COVID-19, thus providing possible countermeasures against viral entry, pathogenesis and survival. Herein, we discovered that Ambroxol hydrochloride (AMB), and its progenitor, Bromhexine hydrochloride (BHH), both clinically approved drugs are potent effective modulators of the key interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2. We also found that both compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytopathic effect at micromolar concentrations. Therefore, in addition to the known TMPRSS2 activity of BHH; we report for the first time that the BHH and AMB pharmacophore has the capacity to target and modulate yet another key protein-protein interaction essential for the two known SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways into host cells. Altogether, the potent efficacy, excellent safety and pharmacologic profile of both drugs along with their affordability and availability, makes them promising candidates for drug repurposing as possible prophylactic and/or treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially described as a viral infection of the respiratory tract. It is now known, however, that several other organs are affected, including the brain. Neurological manifestations such as stroke, encephalitis, and psychiatric conditions have been reported in COVID-19 patients, but the neurotropic potential of the virus is still debated. Herein, we sought to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in human neural cells. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection of neural tissue is non-permissive, however, it can elicit inflammatory response and cell damage. These findings add to the hypothesis that most of the neural damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is due to a systemic inflammation leading to indirect harmful effects on the central nervous system despite the absence of local viral replication.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of neural progenitor cells provides the cellular substrate from which the nervous system is sculpted during development. The {delta}-protocadherin family of homophilic cell adhesion molecules is essential for the normal development of the nervous system and has been linked to an array of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the biological functions of {delta}-protocadherins are not well-defined. Here, we show that the {delta}-protocadherins regulate proliferation in neural progenitor cells, as lesions in each of six, individual {delta}-protocadherin genes increase cell division in the developing hindbrain. Moreover, Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling is upregulated in {delta}-protocadherin mutants and inhibition of the canonical Wnt pathway occludes the observed proliferation increases. We show that the {delta}-protocadherins physically associate with the Wnt receptor Ryk, and that Ryk is required for the increased proliferation in protocadherin mutants. Thus, the {delta}-protocadherins act as novel regulators of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling during neural development and could provide lineage-restricted local regulation of canonical Wnt signaling and cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Female puberty is subject to Polycomb Group (PcG)-dependent transcriptional repression. Kiss1, a puberty-activating gene, is a key target of this silencing mechanism. Using a gain-of-function approach and a systems biology strategy we now show that EED, an essential PcG component, acts in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus to alter the functional organization of a gene network involved in the stimulatory control of puberty. A central node of this network is Kdm6b, which encodes an enzyme that erases the PcG-dependent histone modification H3K27me3. Kiss1 is a first neighbor in the network; genes encoding glutamatergic receptors and potassium channels are second neighbors. By repressing Kdm6b expression, EED increases H3K27me3 abundance at these gene promoters, reducing gene expression throughout a gene network controlling puberty activation. These results indicate that Kdm6b repression is a basic mechanism used by PcG to modulate the biological output of puberty-activating gene networks.",

    "abstract": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants, young children, and older adults. There is no licensed vaccine and prophylactic treatment options are limited and not widely available in developing countries with the greatest disease burden. The RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein is a primary target of host immunity and thus a major focus for vaccine development. The native F glycoprotein structure is flexible and undergoes significant rearrangements from the metastable prefusion to a stable postfusion structure with neutralizing epitopes on intermediate structures. We hypothesize trimeric vaccine strategies that recapitulate the breathable F quaternary structure, and provide accessibility of B-cells to epitopes on intermediate conformations, may collectively contribute to protective immunity, while ridge prefusion F structures restrict access to key protective epitopes. To test this hypothesis, we used the near full-length native prefusogenic F as a backbone to construct three prefusion F variants with substitutions in the hydrophobic head cavity: 1) disulfide bond double mutant (DS), 2) space filling hydrophobic amino acid substitutions (Cav1), and 3) DS plus Cav1 substitutions (DS-Cav1). In this study, we compared the immunogenicity of prefusogenic F to the immunogenicity of the prefusion F variants in two animal models. Native prefusogenic F was significantly more immunogenic producing high titer antibodies to prefusogenic, prefusion, and postfusion F structures compared to animals immunized with prefusion F DS or DS-Cav1. Importantly, native prefusogenic F elicited antibodies that targeted neutralizing epitopes including prefusion-specific site zero (O) and V as well as conformation-independent neutralizing sites II and IV. Immunization with prefusion F DS or DS-Cav1 elicited antibodies primarily targeting antigenic sites O and V with little or no detectable antibodies to other key neutralizing sites. Animals immunized with native prefusogenic F also had significantly higher neutralizing antibodies that cross-neutralized RSV A and B subtypes while immunization with DS or DS-Cav1 elicited neutralizing antibodies primarily to the A subtype. We conclude that breathable trimeric vaccines that closely mimic the native F-structure, and incorporate strategies for B-cell accessibility to protective epitopes, are important considerations for vaccine design. F structures locked in a single conformation restrict B-cell access to neutralizing epitopes that may collectively contribute to destabilizing F-trimers important for broad protection. These results also have implications for vaccine strategies targeting other type 1 integral membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a top-ten cause of death worldwide. Successful treatment is often limited by insufficient diagnostic capabilities, especially at the point of care in low-resource settings. The ideal diagnostic must be fast, cheap, and require minimal clinical resources while providing high sensitivity, selectivity, and the ability to differentiate live from dead bacteria. We describe here the development of a Fast, Luminescent, and Affordable Sensor of Hip1 (FLASH) for the diagnosis and monitoring of drug sensitivity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). FLASH is a selective chemiluminescent substrate for the Mtb protease Hip1 that when processed, produces visible light that can be measured with a high signal to noise ratio using inexpensive sensors. FLASH is sensitive to fmol of recombinant Hip1 enzyme in vitro and can detect as few as thousands of Mtb cells in culture or in human sputum samples within minutes. The probe is highly selective for Mtb compared to other non-tuberculous mycobacteria and can distinguish live from dead cells. Importantly, FLASH can be used to measure antibiotic killing of Mtb in culture with greatly accelerated timelines compared to traditional protocols. Overall, FLASH has the potential to enhance both TB diagnostics and drug resistance monitoring in resource-limited settings.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA luminescent probe enables sensitive detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis for diagnostics, treatment monitoring, and drug susceptibility testing.",

    "abstract": "Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 provides an effective tool to combat the COIVD-19 pandemic. Here, we combined antigen optimization and nanoparticle display to develop vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2. We first displayed the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on three self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SApNP) platforms using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. We then identified heptad repeat 2 (HR2) in S2 as the cause of spike metastability, designed an HR2-deleted glycine-capped spike (S2G{Delta}HR2), and displayed S2G{Delta}HR2 on SApNPs. An antibody column specific for the RBD enabled tag-free vaccine purification. In mice, the 24-meric RBD-ferritin SApNP elicited a more potent neutralizing antibody (NAb) response than the RBD alone and the spike with two stabilizing proline mutations in S2 (S2P). S2G{Delta}HR2 elicited two-fold-higher NAb titers than S2P, while S2G{Delta}HR2 SApNPs derived from multilayered E2p and I3-01v9 60-mers elicited up to 10-fold higher NAb titers. The S2G{Delta}HR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNP also induced critically needed T-cell immunity, thereby providing a promising vaccine candidate.\n\nONE-SENTENCE SUMMARYThe SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain and S2G{Delta}HR2 spike elicited potent immune responses when displayed on protein nanoparticles as vaccine candidates.",

However, roles of MLL3/4 enzymatic activities and MLL3/4-mediated enhancer H3K4me1 in these processes remain unclear. Here, we report that constitutive elimination of both MLL3 and MLL4 enzymatic activities leads to gastrulation failure and early embryonic lethality in mice. However, selective elimination of MLL3/4 enzymatic activities in embryonic, but not extraembryonic, lineages leaves gastrulation largely intact. Consistently, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) lacking MLL3/4 enzymatic activities can differentiate towards the three embryonic germ layers but show aberrant differentiation to extraembryonic endoderm and trophectoderm. The failure in extraembryonic endoderm differentiation can be attributed to markedly reduced enhancer-binding of the lineage-determining transcription factor GATA6. Furthermore, we show that MLL3/4-catalyzed H3K4me1 is largely dispensable for enhancer activation during ESC differentiation. Together, our findings suggest a lineage-selective, but enhancer activation-independent, role of MLL3/4 methyltransferase activities in early embryonic development and embryonic stem cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Recruitment of RNA polymerase and initiation factors to the promoter is the only known mechanisms for transcription activation and repression in archaea. Whether any of the subsequent steps towards productive transcription elongation is involved in regulation is not known. We characterised how the basal transcription machinery is distributed along genes in the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus. We discovered a distinct early elongation phase where RNA polymerases sequentially recruit the elongation factors Spt4/5 and Elf1 to form the transcription elongation complex (TEC) before the TEC escapes into productive transcription. TEC escape is rate-limiting for transcription output during exponential growth. Oxidative stress causes changes in TEC escape that correlate with changes in the transcriptome. Our results thus establish that TEC escape contributes to the basal promoter strength and facilitates transcription regulation. Impaired TEC escape coincides with the accumulation of initiation factors at the promoter and recruitment of termination factor aCPSF1 to the early TEC. This suggests two possible mechanisms for how TEC escape limits transcription, physically blocking upstream RNA polymerases during transcription initiation and premature termination of early TECs.",

    "abstract": "Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (INCL) is a pediatric neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive retinal and central nervous system deterioration during infancy. This lysosomal storage disorder results from a deficiency in the Palmitoyl Protein Thioesterase 1 (PPT1) enzyme - a lysosomal hydrolase which cleaves fatty acid chains such as palmitate from lipid-modified proteins. In the absence of PPT1 activity, these proteins fail to be degraded, leading to the accumulation of autofluorescence storage material in the lysosome. The underlying molecular mechanisms leading to INCL pathology remain poorly understood. A role for oxidative stress has been postulated, yet little evidence has been reported to support this possibility. Here we present a comprehensive cellular characterization of human PPT1-deficient fibroblast cells harboring Met1Ile and Tyr247His compound heterozygous mutations. We detected autofluorescence storage material and observed distinct organellar abnormalities of the lysosomal and mitochondrial structures, which supported previous postulations about the role of ER, mitochondria and oxidative stress in INCL. An increase in the number of lysosomal structures was found in INCL patient fibroblasts, which suggested an upregulation of lysosomal biogenesis, and an association with endoplasmic reticulum stress response. The mitochondrial network also displayed abnormal spherical punctate morphology instead of normal elongated tubules with extensive branching, supporting the involvement of mitochondrial and oxidative stress in INCL cell death. Autofluorescence accumulation and lysosomal pathologies can be mitigated in the presence of conditioned wild type media suggesting that a partial restoration via passive introduction of the enzyme into the cellular environment may be possible. We also demonstrated, for the first time, that human INCL fibroblasts have a heightened susceptibility to exogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cell death, which suggested an elevated basal level of endogenous ROS in the mutant cell. Collectively, these findings support the role of intracellular organellar networks in INCL pathology, possibly due to oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Environmental laws need sound data to protect species and ecosystems. In 1996, a proliferation of mountaintop removal coal mines in a region home to over 50 federally protected species was approved under the Endangered Species Act. Although this type of mining can degrade terrestrial and aquatic habitats, the available data and tools limited the ability to analyze spatially extensive, aggregate effects of such a program. We used two large, public datasets to quantify the relationship between mountaintop removal coal mining and water quality measures important to the survival of imperiled species at a landscape scale across Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. We combined an annual map of the extent of surface mines in this region from 1985 to 2015 generated from Landsat satellite imagery with public water quality data collected over the same time period from 4,260 monitoring stations within the same area. The water quality data show that chronic and acute thresholds for levels of aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, conductivity, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, pH, selenium, and zinc safe for aquatic life were exceeded thousands of times between 1985 and 2015 in streams that are important to the survival and recovery of species on the Endangered Species List. Linear mixed models showed that levels of manganese, sulfate, sulfur, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, and zinc increased by 6.73E+01 to 6.87E+05 {micro}g/L and conductivity by 3.30E+06 {micro}S /cm for one percent increase in the mined proportion of the area draining into a monitoring station. The proportion of a drainage area that was mined also increased the likelihood that chronic thresholds for copper, lead, and zinc required to sustain aquatic life were exceeded. Finally, the proportion of a watershed that was mined was positively related to the likelihood that a waterway would be designated as impaired under the Clean Water Act. Together these results demonstrate that the extent of mountaintop removal mining, which can be derived from public satellite data, is predictive of water quality measures important to imperiled species - effects that must be considered under environmental law. These findings and the public data used in our analyses are pertinent to ongoing re-evaluations of the effects of current mine permitting regulations to the recovery and survival of federally protected species.",

    "abstract": "We previously identified a deletion on chromosome 16p12.1 that is mostly inherited and associated with multiple neurodevelopmental outcomes, where severely affected probands carried an excess of rare pathogenic variants compared to mildly affected carrier parents. We hypothesized that the 16p12.1 deletion sensitizes the genome for disease, while \"second-hits\" in the genetic background modulate the phenotypic trajectory. To test this model, we examined how neurodevelopmental defects conferred by knockdown of individual 16p12.1 homologs are modulated by simultaneous knockdown of homologs of \"second-hit\" genes in Drosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis. We observed that knockdown of 16p12.1 homologs affect multiple phenotypic domains, leading to delayed developmental timing, seizure susceptibility, brain alterations, abnormal dendrite and axonal morphology, and cellular proliferation defects. Compared to genes within the 16p11.2 deletion, which has higher de novo occurrence, 16p12.1 homologs were less likely to interact with each other in Drosophila models or a human brain-specific interaction network, suggesting that interactions with \"second-hit\" genes may confer higher impact towards neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Assessment of 212 pairwise interactions in Drosophila between 16p12.1 homologs and 76 homologs of patient-specific \"second-hit\" genes (such as ARID1B and CACNA1A), genes within neurodevelopmental pathways (such as PTEN and UBE3A), and transcriptomic targets (such as DSCAM and TRRAP) identified genetic interactions in 63% of the tested pairs. In 11 out of 15 families, homologs of patient-specific \"second-hits\" enhanced or suppressed the phenotypic effects of one or many 16p12.1 homologs. In fact, homologs of SETD5 synergistically interacted with homologs of MOSMO in both Drosophila and X. laevis, leading to modified cellular and brain phenotypes, as well as axon outgrowth defects that were not observed with knockdown of either individual homolog. Our results suggest that several 16p12.1 genes sensitize the genome towards neurodevelopmental defects, and complex interactions with \"second-hit\" genes determine the ultimate phenotypic manifestation.\n\nAuthor SummaryCopy-number variants, or deletions and duplications in the genome, are associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. The developmental delay-associated 16p12.1 deletion is mostly inherited, and severely affected children carry an excess of \"second-hits\" variants compared to mildly affected carrier parents, suggesting that additional variants modulate the clinical manifestation. We studied this \"two-hit\" model using Drosophila and Xenopus laevis, and systematically tested how homologs of \"second-hit\" genes modulate neurodevelopmental defects observed for 16p12.1 homologs. We observed that 16p12.1 homologs independently led to multiple neurodevelopmental features and weakly interacted with each other, suggesting that interactions with \"second-hit\" homologs potentially have a higher impact towards neurodevelopmental defects than interactions between 16p12.1 homologs. We tested 212 pairwise interactions of 16p12.1 homologs with \"second-hit\" homologs and genes within conserved neurodevelopmental pathways, and observed modulation of neurodevelopmental defects caused by 16p12.1 homologs in 11 out of 15 families, and 16/32 of these changes could be attributed to genetic interactions. Interestingly, we observed that SETD5 homologs interacted with homologs of MOSMO, which conferred additional neuronal phenotypes not observed with knockdown of individual homologs. We propose that the 16p12.1 deletion sensitizes the genome to multiple neurodevelopmental defects, and complex interactions with \"second-hit\" genes determine the clinical trajectory of the disorder.",

    "abstract": "The dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) expressions has been implicated in cancer. Since most of the lncRNAs are not functionally characterized well, investigating the set of perturbed lncRNAs are is challenging. Existing methods that inspect lncRNAs functionally rely on the co-expressed coding genes, which are far better characterized functionally. LncRNAs can be known to act as transcriptional regulators; they may activate or repress the neighborhoods coding genes on the genome. Based on this, in this work, we aim to analyze the deregulated lncRNAs in cancer by taking into account their ability to regulate nearby loci on the genome. We perform functional analysis on differentially expressed lncRNAs for 28 different cancers considering their adjacent coding genes. We identify that some deregulated lncRNAs are cancer-specific, but a substantial number of lncRNAs are shared across cancers. Next, we assess the similarities of the cancer types based on the functional enrichment of the deregulated lncRNA sets. We find some cancers are very similar in the functions and biological processes related to the deregulated lncRNAs. We observe that some of the cancers for which we find similarity can be linked through primary, metastatic site relations. We investigate the similarity of enriched functional terms for the deregulated lncRNAs and the mRNAs. We further assess the enriched functions similarity to the functions and processes that the known cancer driver genes take place. We believe that our methodology help to understand the impact of the lncRNAs in cancer functionally.",

    "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is associated with cytokine release, pulmonary edema and in the longer term, fibrosis. A severe cytokine storm and pulmonary pathology can cause respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is one of the major causes of mortality associated with ALI. In this study, we aimed to determine a novel neural component through cardiopulmonary spinal afferents that mediates lung pathology during ALI/ARDS. We ablated cardiopulmonary spinal afferents through either epidural T1-T4 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) application or intra-stellate ganglia delivery of a selective afferent neurotoxin, resiniferatoxin (RTX) in rats 3 days post bleomycin-induced lung injury. Our data showed that both epidural and intra-stellate ganglia injection of RTX significantly reduced plasma extravasation and reduced the level of lung pro-inflammatory cytokines providing proof of principle that cardiopulmonary spinal afferents are involved in lung pathology post ALI. Considering the translational potential of stellate ganglia delivery of RTX, we further examined the effects of stellate RTX on blood gas exchange and lung edema in the ALI rat model. Our data suggest that intra-stellate ganglia injection of RTX improved pO2 and blood acidosis 7 days post ALI. It also reduced wet lung weight in bleomycin treated rats, indicating a reduction in lung edema. Taken together, this study suggests that cardiopulmonary spinal afferents play a critical role in lung inflammation and edema post ALI. This study shows the translational potential for ganglionic administration of RTX in ARDS.",

    "abstract": "Many intra-cellular processes rely on transport by endosomes. Recent experimental techniques have provided insights into organelle maturation and its specific role in, for instance, the ability of a virus to escape an endosome and release its genetic material in the cytoplasm. Endosome maturation and dynamics depend on GTPases called Rabs, found on their membrane. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework, combining coagulation and fragmentation of endosomes with two variables internal to each organelle, to model endosomes as intra-cellular compartments characterised by their levels of (active) Rab5 and Rab7. The key element in our framework is the \"per-cell endosomal distribution\" and its its dynamical equation or Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann equation, then, allows one to deduce simple equations for the total number of endosomes in a cell, and for the mean and standard deviation of the Rab5 and Rab7 levels. We compare our solutions with experimental data sets of Dengue viral escape from endosomes. The relationship between endosomal Rab levels and pH suggests a mechanism which can account for the observed variability in viral escape times, which in turn regulate the viability of a viral intra-cellular infection.\n\nAuthor summaryEndosomes are intra-cellular receptacle-like organelles, which transport endocytosed cargo upon internalisation from the plasma membrane. These early endosomes, also known as sorting endosomes, mature to late endosomes, with a lower pH than early ones, as a consequence of the intricate dynamics of a family of molecules called Rabs. Viruses exploit this endosomal pH drop to their advantage. Here we bring together experimental data on Dengue viral escape times from endosomes and a novel mathematical framework inspired by the theory of droplet coalescence, to improve our understanding of endosome maturation, and in turn to quantify the large variability of viral escape times. This mathematical framework can easily be generalised to model the dynamics of other intra-cellular organelles, such as mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum.",

    "abstract": "The recent leveraging of genome-resolved metagenomics has opened a treasure trove of genomes from novel uncultured microbial lineages, yet left many clades undescribed. We here present a global analysis of genomes belonging to the Binatota (UBP10), a globally distributed, yet-uncharacterized bacterial phylum. All orders in the Binatota encoded the capacity for aerobic methylotrophy using methanol, methylamine, sulfomethanes, chloromethanes, and potentially methane as substrates. Methylotrophy in the Binatota was characterized by order-specific substrate degradation preferences, as well as extensive metabolic versatility, i.e. the utilization of diverse sets of genes, pathways and combinations to achieve a specific metabolic goal. The genomes also encoded an arsenal of alkane hydroxylases and monooxygenases, potentially enabling growth on a wide range of alkanes and fatty acids. Pigmentation is inferred from a complete pathway for carotenoids (lycopene, {beta} and {gamma} carotenes, xanthins, chlorobactenes, and spheroidenes) production. Further, the majority of genes involved in bacteriochlorophyll a, c, and d biosynthesis were identified; although absence of key genes and failure to identify a photosynthetic reaction center precludes proposing phototrophic capacities. Analysis of 16S rRNA databases showed Binatotas preferences to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, hydrocarbon-rich habitats, and sponges supporting their suggested potential role in mitigating methanol and methane emissions, alkanes degradation, and nutritional symbiosis with sponges. Our results expand the lists of methylotrophic, aerobic alkane degrading, and pigment-producing lineages. We also highlight the consistent encountering of incomplete biosynthetic pathways and gene shrapnel in microbial genomes, a phenomenon necessitating careful assessment when assigning putative functions based on a set-threshold of pathway completion.",

    "abstract": "The Himalayan region is one of the global biodiversity hotspots. However, its biodiversity and ecosystems are threatened due to abiotic and biotic drivers. One of the major biotic threats to biodiversity in this region is the rapid spread of invasive alien species (IAS). Natural forests and grasslands are increasingly getting infested by IAS affecting regeneration of native species and decline in availability of bio-resources. Assessing the current status of IAS and prediction of their future spread would be vital for evolving specific species management interventions. Keeping this in view, we conducted an in-depth study on two IASs, viz., Ageratina adenophora and Lantana camara in the Indian part of Kailash Sacred Landscape (KSL), Western Himalaya. Intensive field surveys were conducted to collect the presence of A. adenophora (n = 567) and L. camara (n = 120) along an altitudinal gradient between 300 and 3000 m a.s.l. We performed Principle Component Analysis to nullify the multi-colinearity effects of the environmental predictors following MaxEnt species distribution model in the current and future climatic scenarios for both the species. All current and future model precision (i.e. Area Under the Curve; AUC) for both species was higher than 0.81. It is predicted that under the current rate of climate change and higher emission (i.e. RCP8.5 pathway), A. adenophora will spread 45.3% more than its current distribution and is likely to reach up to 3029 m a.s.l. Whereas, L. camara will spread 29.8% more than its current distribution range and likely to reach up to 3018 m a.s.l. Our results will help in future conservation planning and participatory management of forests and grasslands in the KSL- India.",
