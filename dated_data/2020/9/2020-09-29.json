    "abstract": "Like all herpesviruses, the roseoloviruses (HHV6A, -6B, and -7) establish lifelong infection within their host, requiring these viruses to evade host anti-viral responses. One common host-evasion strategy is the downregulation of host-encoded, surface-expressed glycoproteins. Roseoloviruses have been shown to evade host the host immune response by downregulating NK-activating ligands, MHC class I, and the TCR/CD3 complex. To more globally identify glycoproteins that are differentially expressed on the surface of HHV6A-infected cells, we performed cell surface capture of N-linked glycoproteins present on the surface of T cells infected with HHV6A, and compared these to proteins present on the surface of uninfected T cells. We found that the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 is downregulated in T cells infected with HHV6A. We also demonstrated that CD45 is similarly downregulated in cells infected with HHV-7. CD45 is essential for signaling through the T cell receptor and as such, is necessary for developing a fully functional immune response. Interestingly, the closely related {beta}-herpesviruses human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) have also separately evolved unique mechanisms to target CD45. While HCMV and MCMV target CD45 signaling and trafficking, HHV6A acts to downregulate CD45 transcripts.\n\nImportanceHuman herpesviruses-6 and -7 infect essentially 100% of the worlds population before the age of 5 and then remain latent or persistent in their host throughout life. As such, these viruses are among the most pervasive and stealthy of all viruses. Host immune cells rely on the presence of surface-expressed proteins to identify and target virus-infected cells. Here, we investigated the changes that occur to proteins expressed on the cell surface of T cells after infection with human herpesvirus-6A. We discovered that HHV-6A infection results in a reduction of CD45 on the surface of infected cells. Targeting of CD45 may prevent activation of these virus-infected T cells, possibly lengthening the life of the infected T cell so that it can harbor latent virus.",

    "abstract": "Communities of bacteria called biofilms are characterized by reduced diffusion, steep oxygen and redox gradients and specific properties compared to individualized planktonic bacteria. In this study, we investigated whether signaling via nitrosylation of protein cysteine thiols (S-nitrosylation), regulating a wide range of functions in eukaryotes, could also specifically occur in biofilms and contribute to bacterial adaptation to this widespread lifestyle. We used a redox proteomic approach to compare cysteine S-nitrosylation in aerobic and anaerobic biofilm and planktonic Escherichia coli cultures and we identified proteins with biofilm-specific S-nitrosylation status. Using bacterial genetics and various phenotypic screens, we showed that impairing S-nitrosylation in proteins involved in redox homeostasis and amino acid synthesis such as OxyR, KatG and GltD altered important biofilm properties, including motility, biofilm maturation or resistance to oxidative stress. Our study therefore revealed that S-nitrosylation constitutes a physiological basis underlying functions critical for E. coli adaptation to the biofilm environment.",

    "abstract": "lncRAP2 is a conserved cytoplasmic adipocyte-specific lncRNA required for adipogenesis. Using hybridization-based purification combined with in vivo interactome analyses, we show that lncRAP2 forms ribonucleoprotein complexes with several mRNA stability and translation modulators, among them Igf2bp2. Transcriptome-wide identification of Igf2bp2 client mRNAs in white adipocytes reveals selective binding to mRNAs encoding adipogenic effectors and regulators. Depleting either lncRAP2 or Igf2bp coordinately downregulates these same target proteins. Ribosome profiling and quantitative proteomics show that this occurs predominantly at the level of mRNA, as binding of the lncRAP2-Igf2bp complex does not affect mRNA translation. Suppressing lncRAP2 or Igf2bp2 selectively destabilizes many mRNAs encoding proteins essential for energy expenditure, including Adiponectin, reducing adipocyte lipolytic capacity. Genome-wide association studies reveal specific association of genetic variants within both lncRAP2 and Igf2bp2 with body mass and type 2 diabetes, and we find that adipose lncRAP2 and Igf2bp2 are suppressed during obesity and diabetes progression. Thus, the lncRAP2-Igf2bp complex potentiates adipose development and energy expenditure and is associated with susceptibility to obesity-linked diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Transmission of the malaria parasite Plasmodium to mosquitoes necessitates gamete egress from red blood cells to allow zygote formation and ookinete motility to enable penetration of the midgut epithelium. Both processes are dependent on the secretion of proteins from distinct sets of specialized vesicles. Inhibiting some of these proteins has shown potential for blocking parasite transmission to the mosquito. To identify new transmission blocking vaccine candidates, we defined the microneme content from ookinetes of the rodent model organism Plasmodium berghei using APEX2-mediated rapid proximity-dependent biotinylation. Besides known proteins of ookinete micronemes, this identified over 50 novel candidates and sharpened the list of a previous survey based on subcellular fractionation. Functional analysis of a first candidate uncovered a dual role for this membrane protein in male gametogenesis and ookinete midgut traversal. Mutation of a putative trafficking motif in the C-terminus led to its mis-localization in ookinetes and affected ookinete to oocyst transition but not gamete formation. This suggests the existence of distinct functional and transport requirements for Plasmodium proteins in different parasite stages.\n\nSignificanceThe genome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium contains over 5500 genes, of which over 30% have no assigned function. Transmission of Plasmodium spp. to the mosquito contains several essential steps that can be inhibited by antibodies or chemical compounds. Yet few proteins involved in these processes are characterized, thus limiting our capacity to generate transmission interfering tools. Here, we establish a method to rapidly identify proteins in a specific compartment within the parasite that is essential for establishment of an infection within the mosquito, and identify over 50 novel candidate proteins. Functional analysis of the top candidate identifies a protein with two independent essential functions in subsequent steps along the Plasmodium life cycle within the mosquito.\n\nHighlightsO_LIfirst use of APEX based proximity ligation in Apicomplexa\nC_LIO_LIidentification of >50 putative ookinete surface proteins\nC_LIO_LInovel membrane protein essential for microgamete egress and ookinete migration\nC_LIO_LIputative trafficking motif essential in ookinetes but not gametes\nC_LI",

SLiM has gained many users in recent years, due to its speed and power, and has extensive documentation showcasing various scenarios that it can simulate. This paper focuses on a simple demographic scenario, to explore unique aspects of modeling bacteria in SLiMs scripting language. In addition, we illustrate the flexibility of SLiM by simulating the growth of bacteria on a Petri dish with antibiotic. To foster the development of bacterial simulations based upon this recipe, we explain the inner workings of its code. We also validate the simulator, by extensively testing the results of simulations against existing simulators, and against theoretical expectations for some summary statistics. This protocol, with the flexibility and power of SLiM, will enable the community to simulate bacterial populations efficiently under a wide range of evolutionary scenarios.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDPlasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine (CQ), the most widely used antimalarial drug, has historically posed a major threat to malaria control in Angola and throughout the world. Although Angola replaced CQ with artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) as a frontline treatment in 2006, malaria cases and deaths have recently been rising. CQ-resistance mutations may still be a contributing factor, given that (1) some also modulate resistance to ACT partner drugs and (2) ACT is not yet consistently implemented across Angola. It is important to continue monitoring all known resistance alleles in P. falciparum, but no studies have done so in Angola since 2012.\n\nMETHODSWe sampled P. falciparum DNA from the blood of 50 hospital patients in Cabinda, Angola in 2018. Each infection was genotyped for 13 alleles in the genes crt, mdr1, dhps, dhfr, and kelch13, which collectively confer resistance to six common drugs. To analyze frequency trajectories over time, we also collated P. falciparum genotype data published from across Angola in the last two decades.\n\nRESULTSThe two most important alleles for CQ resistance, crt 72-76CVIET and mdr1 86Y, have both declined in frequency from respective highs of 98% in 1999 and 73% in 2003. However, the former remains at 71% frequency in this sample while the latter has dropped to just 7%. Of seven possible alleles for sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance in dhps and dhfr, the average total number per isolate increased from 2.9 in 2004 to 4.4 in 2018. Finally, we detected no non-synonymous polymorphisms in kelch13, which is involved in artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia.\n\nCONCLUSIONSChanges in drug policy in Angola since 2006 appear to have exerted strong selection on P. falciparum drug resistance alleles. Resistance to CQ is declining, but due to functional tradeoffs and novel selection at mdr1 loci, resistance to ACT partner drugs appears to be rising. More haplotype-based studies at mdr1 will be needed to understand the changing efficacy of multiple drugs. Finally, SP resistance has jumped rapidly since 2014, consistent with widespread use of intermittent SP treatment during pregnancy. These data can be used to support effective drug policy decisions in Angola.",

    "abstract": "The mutation risk of a DNA locus depends on its oligonucleotide context. In turn, mutability of oligonucleotides varies across individuals, due to exposure to mutagenic agents or due to variable efficiency and/or accuracy of DNA repair. Such variability is captured by mutational signatures, a mathematical construct obtained by a deconvolution of mutation frequency spectra across individuals. There is a need to enhance methods for inferring mutational signatures to make better use of sparse mutation data (e.g., resulting from exome sequencing of cancers), to facilitate insight into underlying biological mechanisms, and to provide more accurate mutation rate baselines for inferring positive and negative selection. We propose a conceptualization of mutational signatures that represents oligonucleotides via descriptors of DNA conformation: base pair, base pair step, and minor groove width parameters. We demonstrate how such DNA structural parameters can accurately predict mutation occurrence due to DNA repair failures or due to exposure to diverse mutagens such as radiation, chemical exposure, and the APOBEC cytosine deaminase enzymes. Furthermore, the mutation frequency of DNA oligomers classed by structural features can accurately capture systematic variability in mutagenesis of >1,000 tumors originating from diverse human tissues. A nonnegative matrix factorization was applied to mutation spectra stratified by DNA structural features, thereby extracting novel mutational signatures. Moreover, many of the known trinucleotide signatures were associated with an additional spectrum in the DNA structural descriptor space, which may aid interpretation and provide mechanistic insight. Overall, we suggest that the power of DNA sequence motif-based mutational signature analysis can be enhanced by drawing on DNA shape features.",

Within 3-weeks, young ECM promoted proliferation and drug responsiveness in young cells, and induced cell cycle re-entry, and protection against stress in the aged cells. Adult ECM improved cardiac function, while aged ECM accelerated the aging phenotype, and impaired cardiac function and stress defense machinery of the cells. In summary, we have gained a comprehensive understanding of cardiac aging and highlighted the importance of cell-ECM interactions. This study is the first to investigate the individual effects of cellular and environmental aging and identify the biochemical changes that occur upon cardiac aging.",

    "abstract": "Experimental studies have shown that aortic wall tensile strengths in circumferential and longitudinal directions are different (i.e., anisotropic), and vary significantly among patients with aortic aneurysm. To assess aneurysm rupture and dissection risk, material failure metric of the aortic wall needs to be accurately defined and determined. Previously such risk assessment methods have largely relied on deterministic or isotropic failure metric. In this study, we develop a novel probabilistic and anisotropic failure metric for risk stratification of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA). To this end, uniaxial tensile tests were performed using aortic tissue samples of 84 ATAA patients, from which a joint probability distribution of the anisotropic wall strengths was obtained. Next, the anisotropic failure probability (FP) based on the Tsai-Hill (TH) failure criterion was derived. The novel FP metric, which incorporates uncertainty in the anisotropic failure properties, can be evaluated after the aortic wall stresses are computed from patient-specific biomechanical analysis. For method validation, \"ground-truth\" risks of additional 41 ATAA patients were numerically-reconstructed using corresponding CT images and tissue testing data. Performance of different risk stratification methods (e.g., with and without patient-specific hyperelastic properties) was compared using p-value and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The results show that: (1) the probabilistic FP metric outperforms the deterministic TH metric; and (2) patient-specific hyperelastic properties can help to improve the performance of probabilistic FP metric in ATAA risk stratification.",

    "abstract": "Low soil zinc (Zn) availability is a limiting factor for crop yield, and increasing Zn content is a major target for the biofortification of major crops. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi associate with the roots of most terrestrial plant species and improve the host plants growth and nutrition through the mycorrhizal pathway of nutrient uptake. Although the physiology of Zn uptake through the mycorrhizal pathway is well established, the identity of the molecular components responsible for Zn transport in the mycorrhizal pathway are unknown.\n\nRNA-seq analysis identified the putative Zn transporter gene MtZIP14 by its marked up-regulation in Medicago truncatula roots when colonised by the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis under varying soil Zn supply. Expression of GFP-tagged MtZIP14 in roots revealed that it is exclusively localised to the site of plant-fungal nutrient exchange in cortical cells, the peri-arbuscular membrane. Expression of MtZIP14 in a yeast mutant lacking Zn transport function restored growth under low Zn availability. M. truncatula MtZIP14 loss-of-function mutants had reduced shoot biomass compared to the wild-type when colonised by AM fungi and grown under low Zn. Vesicular and arbuscular colonisation, but not hyphal colonisation, were also lower in mtzip14 mutant plants.\n\nBased on these results we propose that MtZIP14 plays a key role in the transport of Zn from AM fungus to plant across the peri-arbuscular membrane, and MtZIP14 function is crucial to plant competitiveness in a low Zn soil.\n\nSignificance statementMajority of crop plant species associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which can increase plant nutrient uptake. Improving our knowledge of how Zn is taken up in mycorrhizal plants will lead to improved plant and human Zn nutrition outcomes. Here, we report a novel plant transporter with a major role in Zn nutrition of mycorrhizal plants. MtZIP14 is involved in Zn transport, is exclusively localised to the specialised plant-fungal interface in roots, and impairment of MtZIP14 gene function results in negative impacts on both plant growth and Zn nutrition.",

    "abstract": "The development of perinatal brain connectivity underpins motor, cognitive and behavioural abilities in later life. Diffusion MRI allows the characterisation of subtle inter-individual differences in structural brain connectivity. Individual brain connectivity maps (connectomes) are by nature high in dimensionality and are complex to interpret. Machine learning methods are a powerful tool to uncover properties of the connectome which are not readily visible, and can give us clues as to how and why individual developmental trajectories differ.\n\nIn this manuscript we used Deep Neural Networks and Random Forests to predict demographic and neurodevelopmental characteristics from neonatal structural connectomes in a large sample of babies (n = 524) from the developing Human Connectome Project. We achieved an accurate prediction of post menstrual age (PMA) at scan in term-born infants (Mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.72 weeks, r = 0.83 and p<0.001). We also achieved good accuracy when predicting gestational age at birth in a cohort of term and preterm babies scanned at term equivalent age (MAE = 2.21 weeks, r = 0.82, p<0.001). We subsequently used sensitivity analysis to obtain feature relevance from our prediction models, with the most important connections for prediction of PMA and GA found to be predominantly thalamocortical. From our models of PMA at scan for infants born at term, we computed a brain maturation index (predicted age minus actual age) of individual preterm neonates and found a significant correlation between this index and motor outcome at 18 months corrected age. Our results demonstrate the applicability of machine learning techniques in analyses of the neonatal connectome, and suggest that a neural substrate for later developmental outcome is detectable at term equivalent age.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the molecular principles that govern the composition of the mammalian MHC-I immunopeptidome (MHC-Ii) across different primary tissues is fundamentally important to predict how T cell respond in different contexts in vivo. Here, we performed a global analysis of the mammalian MHC-Ii from 29 and 19 primary human and mouse tissues, respectively. First, we observed that different HLA-A, -B and -C allotypes do not contribute evenly to the global composition of the MHC-Ii across multiple human tissues. Second, we found that peptides that are presented in a tissue-dependent and -independent manner share very distinct properties. Third, we discovered that proteins that are evolutionarily hyperconserved represent the primary source of the MHC-Ii at the organism-wide scale. Finally, we uncovered new components of the antigen processing and presentation network that may drive the high level of heterogeneity of the MHC-Ii across different tissues in mammals. This study opens up new avenues toward a system-wide understanding of antigen presentation in vivo and may serve as ground work to understand tissue-dependent T cell responses in autoimmunity, infectious diseases and cancer.",

Pathogenic bacteria can form biofilms on surfaces and in tissues leading to nosocomial and chronic infections.

In this study, we explore the effect of the newly described AMP TAT-RasGAP317-326 on Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. We observe that TAT-RasGAP317-326 inhibits the formation of biofilms at concentrations equivalent or two times superior to the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the corresponding planktonic bacteria. Moreover, TAT-RasGAP317-326 limits the expansion of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa established biofilms at concentrations 2-4 times superior to the MIC. These results further confirm the potential of AMPs against biofilms, expand the antimicrobial potential of TAT-RasGAP317-326 and support further development of this peptide as an alternative antimicrobial treatment.",

We investigated samples of placenta, fetal intestine and brain from germ-free (GF) and specific pathogen free (SPF) mouse dams by non-targeted metabolic profiling. One hundred one annotated metabolites and altogether 3680 molecular features were present in significantly different amounts in the placenta and/or fetal organs of GF and SPF mice. The concentrations of more than half of the annotated and differentially expressed metabolites were lower in the GF organs, suggesting their microbial origin or a metabolic response of the host to the presence of gut microbiota. The clearest separation was observed in the placenta. Metabolites that were detected in lower amounts in the fetal organs in the GF mice included 5-aminovaleric acid betaine, trimethylamine N-oxide, catechol-O-sulphate, hippuric and pipecolic acid. Derivatives of the amino acid tryptophan, such as kynurenine, 3-indolepropionic acid and hydroxyindoleacetic acid, were also decreased in the absence of microbiota. Several metabolites had higher levels in the GF mice. These could be precursors of microbial metabolites or indicators of host metabolic response to the absence of gut microbiota.

    "abstract": "Decades of insufficient control resulted in unprecedented spread of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) around the globe and millions already suffered from the highly debilitating disease. Nevertheless, the current understanding of CHIKV-host interactions and adaptability of the virus to replication in mosquitoes and mammalian hosts is still elusive. Our new study shows that four-and-a-half LIM domain protein (FHL1) is one of the host factors that interact with hypervariable domain (HVD) of CHIKV nsP3. Unlike G3BPs, FHL1 is not a pre-requisite of CHIKV replication, and many commonly used cell lines do not express FHL1. However, its expression has detectable stimulatory effect(s) on CHIKV replication, and the Fhl1 KO cell lines demonstrate slower infection spread. The NMR-based studies revealed that the binding site of FHL1 in CHIKV nsP3 HVD overlaps with that of another pro-viral host factor, CD2AP. The structural data also demonstrated that FHL1-HVD interaction is mostly determined by LIM1 domain of FHL1. However, it does not mirror binding of the entire protein, suggesting that other LIM domains are involved. In agreement with previously published data, our biological experiments showed that interactions of CHIKV HVD with CD2AP and FHL1 have additive positive effects on the efficiency of CHIKV replication. This study shows that CHIKV mutants with extensive modifications of FHL1- or both FHL1- and CD2AP- binding sites remain viable and develop spreading infection in multiple cell types. Thus, such modifications of HVD may improve live CHIKV vaccine candidates in terms of their safety and stability of the attenuated phenotype.\n\nIMPORTANCEReplication of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is determined by a wide range of host factors. Previously, we have demonstrated that the hypervariable domain (HVD) of CHIKV nsP3 protein contains linear motifs that recruit defined families of host proteins into formation of functional viral replication complexes. Now, using NMR-based structural and biological approaches, we have characterized the binding site of cellular FHL1 protein in CHIKV HVD and defined the biological significance of this interaction. In contrast to previously described binding of G3BP to CHIKV HVD, the FHL1-HVD interaction was found to not be a prerequisite of viral replication. However, the presence of FHL1 has a stimulatory effect on CHIKV infectivity and subsequently, the infection spread. FHL1 and CD2AP proteins were found to have overlapping binding sites in CHIKV HVD and additive pro-viral functions. Elimination of FHL1-binding site in nsP3 HVD can be used for the development of stable, live attenuated vaccine candidates.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) causes significant morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. HSV-1 enters epithelial cells via an endocytosis mechanism that is low pH-dependent. However, the precise intracellular pathway has not been identified, including the compartment where fusion occurs. In this study, we utilized a combination of molecular and pharmacological approaches to better characterize HSV entry by endocytosis. HSV-1 entry was unaltered in both cells treated with siRNA to Rab5 or Rab7 and cells expressing dominant-negative forms of these GTPases, suggesting entry is independent of the conventional endo-lysosomal network. The fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) and the quinoline compound Golgicide A (GCA) inhibited HSV-1 entry via beta-galactosidase reporter assay and impaired incoming virus transport to the nuclear periphery, suggesting a role for trans Golgi network (TGN) functions and retrograde transport in HSV entry. Silencing of Rab9 or Rab11 GTPases, which are involved in the retrograde transport pathway, resulted in only a slight reduction in HSV infection. Together these results suggest that HSV enters host cells by an intracellular route independent of the lysosome-terminal endocytic pathway.\n\nIMPORTANCEHSV-1, the prototype alphaherpesvirus, is ubiquitous in the human population and causes lifelong infection that can be fatal in neonatal and immunocompromised individuals. HSV enters many cell types by endocytosis, including epithelial cells, the site of primary infection in the host. The intracellular itinerary for HSV entry remains unclear. We probed the potential involvement of several Rab GTPases in HSV-1 entry, and suggest that endocytic entry of HSV-1 is independent of the canonical lysosome-terminal pathway. A non-traditional endocytic route may be employed, such as one that intersects with the TGN. These results may lead to novel targets for intervention.",

    "abstract": "Artemisinin and its semi-synthetic derivatives (ART) are fast acting, potent antimalarials; however, their use in malaria treatment is frequently confounded by recrudescences from bloodstream Plasmodium parasites that enter into and later reactivate from a dormant persister state. Here we provide evidence that the mitochondria of dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-exposed persisters are dramatically altered and enlarged relative to the mitochondria of young, actively replicating ring forms. Restructured mitochondrial-nuclear associations and an altered metabolic state are consistent with stress from reactive oxygen species. New contacts between the mitochondria and nuclei may support communication pathways of mitochondrial retrograde signaling, resulting in transcriptional changes in the nucleus as a survival response. Further characterization of the organelle communication and metabolic dependencies of persisters may suggest strategies to combat recrudescences of malaria after treatment.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe major first-line treatment for malaria, especially the deadliest form caused by Plasmodium falciparum, is combination therapy with an artemisinin-based drug (ART) plus a partner drug to assure complete cure. Without an effective partner drug, ART administration alone can fail because of the ability of small populations of blood-stage malaria parasites to enter into a dormant state and survive repeated treatments for a week or more. Understanding the nature of parasites in dormancy (persisters), and their ability to wake and reestablish actively-propagating parasitemias (recrudesce) after ART exposure, may suggest strategies to improve treatment outcomes and counter the threats posed by parasites that develop resistance to partner drugs. Here we show that persisters have dramatically altered mitochondria and mitochondrial-nuclear interactions associated with features of metabolic quiescence. Restructured associations between the mitochondria and nuclei may support signaling pathways that enable the ART survival responses of dormancy.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic networks provide a powerful framework for modeling and analyzing reticulate evolutionary histories. While polyploidy has been shown to be prevalent not only in plants but also in other groups of eukaryotic species, most work done thus far on phylogenetic network inference assumes diploid hybridization. These inference methods have been applied, with varying degrees of success, to data sets with polyploid species, even though polyploidy violates the mathematical assumptions underlying these methods. Statistical methods were developed recently for handling specific types of polyploids and so were parsimony methods that could handle polyploidy more generally yet while excluding processes such as incomplete lineage sorting. In this paper, we introduce a new method for inferring most parsimonious phylogenetic networks on data that include polyploid species. Taking gene trees as input, the method seeks a phylogenetic network that minimizes deep coalescences while accounting for polyploidy. The method could also infer trees, thus potentially distinguishing between auto- and allo-polyploidy. We demonstrate the performance of the method on both simulated and biological data. The inference method as well as a method for evaluating given phylogenetic networks are implemented and publicly available in the PhyloNet software package.",

Infected fish can develop Proliferative Kidney Disease (PKD), characterised by a gross lymphoid-driven kidney pathology in wild and farmed salmonids. To facilitate an in-depth understanding of T. bryosalmonae-host interactions, we have adopted a two-host parasite transcriptome sequencing approach to minimize host contamination in the absence of a complete T. bryosalmonae genome. Parasite contigs common to both infected hosts (the intersect transcriptome; 7,362 contigs) were typically AT-rich (60-75% AT). 5,432 contigs within the intersect were annotated with 1,930 unannotatde contigs encoding for unknown transcripts. We have focused on transcripts encoding proteins involved in; nutrient acquisition, host-parasite interactions, development, and cell-to-cell communication or proteins of unknown function, establishing their potential importance in each host by RT-qPCR.

We obtained 273.4 Mbp and 256.8 Mbp of the total assemblies for An. coluzzii and An. arabiensis, respectively. Each assembly consists of three chromosome-scale scaffolds (X, 2, 3), complete mitochondrion, and unordered contigs identified as autosomal pericentromeric DNA, X pericentromeric DNA, and Y sequences. Comparison of these assemblies with the existing assemblies for these species demonstrated that we obtained improved reference-quality genomes. The new assemblies allowed us to identify genomiccoordinates for the breakpoint regions of fixed and polymorphic chromosomal inversions in An. coluzzii and An. arabiensis.\n\nConclusionThe new chromosome-level assemblies will facilitate functional and population genomic studies in An. coluzzii and An. arabiensis.

To expand the currently limited portfolio of small molecule drug leads, we screened for chemical modulators of the U2AF complex, which nucleates spliceosome assembly and is mutated in myelodysplasias. A hit compound specifically enhances RNA binding by a U2AF2 subunit. Remarkably, the compound inhibits splicing of representative substrates in cells and stalls spliceosome assembly at the stage of U2AF function. Computational docking, together with structure-guided mutagenesis, indicates that the compound bridges an active conformation of the U2AF2 RNA recognition motifs via hydrophobic and electrostatic moieties. Altogether, our results highlight the potential of trapping early spliceosome assembly as an effective pharmacological means to manipulate pre-mRNA splicing. By extension, we suggest that stabilizing inactive checkpoints may offer a breakthrough approach for small molecule inhibition of multi-stage macromolecular assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Abscesses are walled-off collections of infected fluids that often develop as complications in the setting of surgery and trauma. Abscess care depends on size, location, composition and complexity, among other patient factors. The goal of this work is to describe, using the latest ultrasound imaging technologies, the progression of abscess development in a porcine animal model. Intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of bacteria plus dextran particles as an irritant led to identifiable abscesses over a 2- to 3-week period. The abscesses were imaged at least weekly with B-mode, 3D B-mode, shear-wave elastography (SWE) and color flow imaging. Mature abscesses were characterized by a well-defined core of varying echogenicity surrounded by a hypoechoic capsule that was highly vascularized on Doppler imaging. Size and shape changes during development were quantified with 3D imaging. With SWE, the lesion stiffness varied interiorly and generally decreased over time. These ultrasound features potentially provide biomarkers to facilitate improved selection of treatment strategies for abscesses.",

    "abstract": "Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by impaired social skills and accompanied by motor and perceptual atypicalities. Its etiology is an open question, partly due to the diverse range of associated difficulties. Based on recent observations that individuals with autism are slow in updating perceptual priors, we now hypothesized that motor updating is also slow. Slow motor updating is expected to hamper the ability to synchronize to external events, since asynchronies are corrected sluggishly. Since sensorimotor synchronization is important for social bonding and cooperation, its impairment is expected to impair social skills. To test this hypothesis, we measured paced finger tapping to a metronome in neurotypical, ASD, and dyslexia groups. Dyslexia was assessed as a control group with a non-social neurodevelopmental atypicality. Only the ASD group showed reduced sensorimotor synchronization. Trial-by-trial computational modelling revealed that their ability to form controlled motor responses and to maintain reliable temporal representations was adequate. Only their rate of error-correction was slow and was correlated with the severity of their social difficulties. Taken together, these findings suggest that slow updating in autism contributes to both sloppy sensorimotor performance and difficulties in forming social bonds.\n\nSignificanceThe prevalence of autism diagnosis has increased immensely is the last decades. Yet its etiology remains a challenge, partly since the functional relations between characteristic social difficulties, perceptual and motor atypicalities are not understood. Using trial-by-trial computational modelling, we show that a single deficit underlies the poor synchronization of individuals with autism in both static and changing environments. Slow updating, leading to slow online error correction of motor plans, has an immense explanatory power explaining both difficulties in sensorimotor synchronization, and social impairments.",

    "abstract": "The temporal frequency of sensory stimulation is a decisive factor in the bidirectional plasticity of perceptual detection thresholds. However, surprisingly little is known about how distinct temporal parameters of sensory input differentially impact neuronal, circuit, and perceptual function. Here we demonstrate that brief repetitive visual stimulation is sufficient to induce long-term plasticity of visual responses, with the temporal frequency of the visual stimulus determining the location and generalization of visual response plasticity. Brief repetitive low frequency stimulation (LFS, 2 Hz) is sufficient to induce a visual response potentiation that is exclusively expressed in layer 4 in response to the familiar stimulus. In contrast, brief, repetitive high frequency stimulation (HFS, 20 Hz) suppresses the activity of fast-spiking interneurons and primes ongoing gamma oscillatory rhythms for visually-evoked phase reset. Accordingly, visual stimulation subsequent to HFS induces non-stimulus specific visual response plasticity that is expressed in all cortical layers. The generalized visual response enhancement induced by HFS is paralleled by an increase in visual acuity measured by improved performance in a visual detection task.",

However, linguistic theories are insufficient to account for all brain responses that reflect linguistic composition. In contrast, we adopt a data-driven computational approach to study the combined meaning of words beyond their individual meaning. We term this product \"supra-word meaning\" and investigate its neural bases by devising a computational representation for it and using it to predict brain recordings from two imaging modalities with complementary spatial and temporal resolutions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we reveal that hubs that are thought to process lexical-level meaning also maintain supra-word meaning, suggesting a common substrate for lexical and combinatorial semantics. Surprisingly, we cannot detect supra-word meaning in magnetoencephalography, which suggests the hypothesis that composed meaning might be maintained through a different neural mechanism than the synchronized firing of pyramidal cells. This sensitivity difference has implications for past neuroimaging results and future wearable neurotechnology.",

Still, there is currently no reliable biomarker to detect individuals at risk to develop MDD. Recently, the retina emerged as an effective way to approach the brain and investigate psychiatric disorders with the use of the electroretinogram (ERG). In this study, cones and rods ERGs were performed in male and female mice before and after chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). Mice were then divided as susceptible or resilient to stress. Significant results were only observed in rods ERGs. In males, susceptible mice showed prolonged a-wave implicit times at baseline that were shortened after CSDS. The a-wave was also decreased in both susceptible and resilient male mice after CSDS. In females, rod a-waves were shorter in susceptible than in control mice after CSDS resulting from the latter demonstrating delayed a-waves. Baseline ERGs were able to predict - to some extent - the expression of susceptibility and resilience before stress exposition in male and female mice. Overall, our findings suggest that retinal activity is a presumptive biomarker of stress response and that the ERG could potentially serve as a predicting tool of the stress response in mice.",

As humans too have luminance-encoding ipRGCs, we asked whether a similar pathway exist in humans. Here, fMRI was used to identify PFC regions and other areas exhibiting luminance-dependent signals. We report 29 human brain regions where activation either monotonically decreased or increased with luminance. Luxotonic activity was identified across the cerebral cortex, in diverse subcortical structures, and in the cerebellum, regions that have functions related to visual image formation, motor control, cognition, emotion, and reward processing. Light suppressed PFC activation level, the activation monotonically decreasing with increasing luminance. The sustained time course of light-evoked PFC responses, and their susceptibility to prior light exposure, most closely resembled those of ipRGCs. These findings offer a functional link between light exposure and PFC-mediated cognitive and affective phenomena.",

However, the natural, evolutionarily-selected functions of A{beta} are incompletely understood. Here, we report that nanomolar concentrations of A{beta} act synergistically with known cytokines to promote pro-inflammatory activation in primary human astrocytes (a cell type increasingly implicated in brain aging and AD). Using transcriptomics (RNA-seq), we show that A{beta} can directly substitute for the complement component C1q in a cytokine cocktail previously shown to induce astrocyte immune activation. Furthermore, we show that astrocytes synergistically activated by A{beta} have a transcriptional signature similar to neurotoxic \"A1\" astrocytes known to accumulate with age and in AD. Interestingly, we find that this biological action of A{beta} at low concentrations is distinct from the transcriptome changes induced by the high/supraphysiological doses of A{beta} often used in in vitro studies. Collectively, our results suggest an important, cytokine-like function for A{beta} and a novel mechanism by which it may directly contribute to the neuroinflammation associated with brain aging and AD.",

In this study, we investigated the biochemical effects of genetic mutations causing human diseases, focusing on the eA22 interaction. The mutant proteins exhibited either weakened or augmented interactions between coil 1a and coil 2. The ensuing biochemical results indicated that the interaction requires the separation of the coiled-coils in N-terminal of coil 1a and C-terminal of coil 2, coupled with the structural transition in the central -helical rod domain.

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HO gene is highly complex, requiring a balance of multiple activating and repressing factors to ensure that only a few transcripts are produced in mother cells within a narrow window of the cell cycle. Here, we show that the Ash1 repressor associates with two DNA sequences that are usually concealed within nucleosomes in the HO promoter and recruits the Tup1 corepressor and the Rpd3 histone deacetylase, both of which are required for full repression in daughters. Genome-wide ChIP identified greater than 200 additional sites of co-localization of these factors, primarily within large, intergenic regions from which they could regulate adjacent genes. Most Ash1 binding sites are in nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs), while a small number overlap nucleosomes, similar to HO. We demonstrate that Ash1 binding to the HO promoter does not occur in the absence of the Swi5 transcription factor, which recruits coactivators that evict nucleosomes, including the nucleosomes obscuring the Ash1 binding sites. In the absence of Swi5, artificial nucleosome depletion allowed Ash1 to bind, demonstrating that nucleosomes are inhibitory to Ash1 binding. The location of binding sites within nucleosomes may therefore be a mechanism for limiting repressive activity to periods of nucleosome eviction that are otherwise associated with activation of the promoter. Our results illustrate that activation and repression can be intricately connected, and events set in motion by an activator may also ensure the appropriate level of repression and reset the promoter for the next activation cycle.",

    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disease characterized by increased risk for bone marrow failure and cancer. The FA proteins function together to repair damaged DNA. A central step in the activation of the FA pathway is the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 and FANCI proteins under conditions of cellular stress and during S-phase of the cell cycle. The regulatory mechanisms governing S-phase monoubiquitination, in particular, are poorly understood. In this study, we have identified a CDK regulatory phospho-site (S592) proximal to the site of FANCD2 monoubiquitination. FANCD2 S592 phosphorylation was detected by LC-MS/MS and by immunoblotting with a S592 phospho-specific antibody. Mutation of S592 leads to abrogated monoubiquitination of FANCD2 during S-phase. Furthermore, FA-D2 (FANCD2-/-) patient cells expressing S592 mutants display reduced proliferation under conditions of replication stress and increased mitotic aberrations, including micronuclei and multinucleated cells. Our findings describe a novel cell cycle-specific regulatory mechanism for the FANCD2 protein that promotes mitotic fidelity.\n\nAuthor SummaryFanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disease characterized by high risk for bone marrow failure and cancer. FA has strong genetic and biochemical links to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. The FA proteins function to repair DNA damage and to maintain genome stability. The FANCD2 protein functions at a critical stage of the FA pathway and its posttranslational modification is defective in >90% of FA patients. However, the function, and regulation of FANCD2, particularly under unperturbed cellular conditions, remains remarkably poorly characterized. In this study, we describe a novel mechanism of regulation of the FANCD2 protein during S-phase of the cell cycle. CDK-mediated phosphorylation of FANCD2 on S592 promotes the ubiquitination of FANCD2 during S-phase. Disruption of this phospho-regulatory mechanism results in compromised mitotic fidelity and an increase in mitotic chromosome instability.",

    "abstract": "RationaleThe rupture of the fibrous cap in atherosclerotic lesions is the underlying cause of most thrombi leading to heart attack and a frequent cause of stroke. Caps are produced by smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that are recruited to the subendothelial space. We hypothesized that the recruitment mechanisms are likely common to embryonic artery development, which relies prominently on Notch signaling to form the subendothelial layers of medial SMCs.\n\nObjectiveTo analyze the causal roles of the Notch signaling pathway in SMCs for atherogenesis and cap formation.\n\nMethods and ResultsNotch elements involved in arterial media development were found expressed in regions of fibrous cap in mouse plaques. To assess the causal role of Notch signaling in cap formation, we studied atherosclerosis in mice in which the Notch pathway was inactivated specifically in SMCs by conditional knockout of the essential effector transcription factor RBPJ. No major effects were observed on plaque size, but the presence of cap SMCs was significantly reduced. Lineage tracing revealed that the accumulation of SMC-derived plaque cells in the cap region was unaltered but that Notch-defective cells failed to re-acquire the SMC phenotype in the cap. To analyze whether the accumulation of SMC-derived cells in atherogenesis requires down-regulation of Notch signaling, we studied atherosclerosis in mice with constitutive Notch signaling in SMCs achieved by conditional expression of the Notch intracellular domain. Forced Notch signaling inhibited the ability of medial SMCs to contribute to plaque cells, including both cap SMCs and osteochondrogenic cells, and significantly reduced atherosclerosis development.\n\nConclusionsSequential loss and gain of Notch signaling is needed to build the cap SMC population. The shared mechanisms with embryonic arterial media assembly suggest that the fibrous cap forms as a neo-media that restores the connection between endothelium and stabilizing SMCs, which is transiently disrupted by atherogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Oceanic archipelagos are known to host a variety of endemic plant species. The genetic diversity and structure of these species is an important indicator of their evolutionary history and can inform appropriate conservation strategies that mitigate the risks to which theyre exposed, including invasive species and environmental disturbances. A comprehensive consideration of the role of their natural history, as well as the landscape features and the geological history of the islands themselves is required to adequately understand any emerging patterns. Such is the case for the guayabillo (Psidium galapageium), an understudied endemic plant from the Galapagos Islands with important ecological and economic roles. In this study we designed and evaluated 13 informative SSR markers and used them to investigate the genetic diversity, population structure and connectivity of the guayabillo populations from San Cristobal, Isabela and Santa Cruz islands. A total of 208 guayabillo individuals were analyzed, revealing a strong population structure between islands and two distinct genetic lineages for the Santa Cruz population. Overall, the guayabillo genetic diversity is relatively high, an unusual pattern for an insular endemic species which is possibly explained by its polyploidy and the geographical features of the islands. These include their broad altitudinal ranges and habitat heterogeneity. For populations displaying a lower genetic diversity such as San Cristobal, the history of human disturbance could be an important factor explaining these observations. Some similarities between individuals in Santa Cruz and the San Cristobal population could be explained by population differentiation or distinct natural histories of separate lineages. Our findings highlight the complex population dynamics that shape the genetic diversity of species like the guayabillo and emphasize the need to explore the currently unresolved questions about this Galapagos endemic plant.",

    "abstract": "The control of arboviruses carried by Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) can be performed with tools that monitor and reduce the circulation of these vectors. Therefore, the efficiency of four types of traps in capturing A. aegypti and A. albopictus eggs and adults, with the biological product Vectobac WG(R), was evaluated in the field. For this, 20 traps were installed in two locations, which were in the South (Londrina, Parana) and North (Manaus, Amazonas) Regions of Brazil, from March to April 2017 and January to February 2018, respectively. The UELtrap-E and UELtrap-EA traps captured A. aegypti and A. albopictus eggs: 1703/1866 eggs in Londrina, and 10268/2149 eggs in Manaus, respectively, and presented high ovitraps positivity index (OPI) values (averages: 100%/100% in Londrina, and 100%/96% in Manaus, respectively); and high egg density index (EDI) values (averages: 68/75 in Londrina, and 411/89 in Manaus, respectively), so they had statistically superior efficiency to that of the CRtrap-E and CRtrap-EA traps in both regions, that captured less eggs and adults: 96/69 eggs in Londrina, and 1091/510 eggs in Manaus, respectively. Also presented lower OPI values (averages: 28%/4% in Londrina, and 88%/60% in Manaus, respectively); and lower EDI values (averages: 10.5/9 in Londrina, and 47/30 in Manaus, respectively). The capture ratios of Aedes adults in the UELtrap-EA and CRtrap-EA traps in Londrina and Manaus were 53.3%/29.5% and 0%/9.8%, respectively. UELtrap-E and UELtrap-EA can be adopted as efficient tools for Aedes monitoring due to their high sensitivity, low cost and ease of use.\n\nAuthor summaryAedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are species of mosquitoes responsible for the transmission of several arboviruses that cause infections worldwide. However, there are still no effective and safe vaccines or medications to prevent or treat arboviruses transmitted by these vectors, except for yellow fever. Moreover, current methodologies for monitoring and controlling A. aegypti and A. albopictus are not fully effective, as evidenced by the increasing cases of the arbovirus transmitted by these mosquitoes or have incompatible costs with the socioeconomic conditions of a large number of people. Thus, the traps tested in this study can be used as more effective and economical tools for monitoring and controlling A. aegypti and A. albopictus, since they are made with low cost material and they showed high efficiency in the capture of eggs, evidenced by the high values of ovitraps positive index and eggs density index, besides that one of the models captured Aedes spp. adults in both regions where they were tested. Therefore, the traps have potential for reducing Aedes spp. eggs and adults in the environment and sensibility for determining the local infestation index, which can be reconciled with official government strategies for more accurate vector monitoring and control actions.",

    "abstract": "Alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone (-MSH) is an autocrine factor released by activated microglia during neuroinflammation and is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of Parkinsons disease (PD) patients. -MSH impaired cellular autophagy and induced the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in a melanized human dopaminergic cell model. Increased -MSH in the brain of mice resulted in the gradual worsening of abnormal gait. Dopamine replacement with L-dopa/Benserazide or treatment with a dopamine receptor agonist, Pramipexole, temporarily restored normal gait, suggesting dopamine deficiency as the cause of motor deficits in these mice. Notably, end-stage disease pathology such as neuronal cell loss, reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ fiber density in the striatum and pSer129+ alpha-synuclein inclusions were absent. Rather, autophagic dysfunction was observed in the dopaminergic neuronal (DN) cell population within the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. Moreover, increased expression of TH was observed in the striatum, suggesting a compensatory response to diminished dopamine levels. Our findings provide new insights into the early events that underlie neurodegeneration in PD and suggest that exposure of DNs to elevated levels of microglial -MSH leads to impairment of autophagy resulting in abnormal accumulation of proteins, dopaminergic dysfunction and motor deficits.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=88 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/313957v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@78c4a2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b59f50org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ee74f2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3fbfef_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Significance statementWe now show that a naturally occurring compound increased in the brain of Parkinsons disease (PD) patients, called -MSH, can trigger abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein in a dopaminergic cell model. Increasing -MSH in the brain of mice resulted in motor symptoms and abnormal gait. Increasing dopamine activity in these mice using Levodopa or Pramipexole restored normal gait, suggesting that the mice were deficient in dopamine, as seen in PD. We now describe a cell and an animal model that can reproduce the early stages of dopaminergic dysfunction in PD.

    "abstract": "Infections by schistosomes result in granulomatous lesions around parasite eggs entrapped within the host tissues. The host and parasite determinants of the Schistosoma mansoni egg-induced granulomatous response are areas of active investigation. Some studies in mice implicate Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) produced in response to the infection whereas others fail to find a role for it. In addition, in the mouse model, the S. mansoni secreted egg antigen omega-1 is found to induce granulomas but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. We have recently developed the zebrafish larva as a model to study macrophage recruitment and granuloma formation in response to Schistosoma mansoni eggs. Here we use this model to investigate the mechanisms by which TNF and omega-1 shape the early granulomatous response. We find that TNF, specifically signaling through TNF receptor 1, is not required for macrophage recruitment to the egg and granuloma initiation but does mediate granuloma enlargement. In contrast, omega-1 mediates initial macrophage recruitment, with this chemotactic activity being dependent on its RNase activity. Our findings further the understanding of the role of these host- and parasite-derived factors and show that they impact distinct facets of the granulomatous response to the schistosome egg.",

    "abstract": "Corynebacteriales are Actinobacteria that possess an atypical didermic cell envelope. One of the principal features of this cell envelope is the presence of a large complex made up of peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan and mycolic acids. This covalent complex constitutes the backbone of the cell wall and supports an outer membrane, called mycomembrane in reference to the mycolic acids that are its major component. The biosynthesis of the cell envelope of Corynebacteriales has been extensively studied, in particular because it is crucial for the survival of important pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is therefore a key target for anti-tuberculosis drugs. In this study, we explore the biogenesis of the cell envelope of Corynebacterium glutamicum, a non-pathogenic Corynebacteriales, which can tolerate dramatic modifications of its cell envelope as important as the loss of its mycomembrane. For this purpose, we used a genetic approach based on genome-wide transposon mutagenesis. We developed a highly effective immunological test based on the use of anti-arabinogalactan antibodies that allowed us to rapidly identify bacteria exhibiting an altered cell envelope. A very large number (10,073) of insertional mutants were screened by means of this test, and 80 were finally selected, representing 55 different loci. Bioinformatics analyses of these loci showed that approximately 60% corresponded to genes already characterized, 63% of which are known to be directly involved in cell wall processes, and more specifically in the biosynthesis of the mycoloyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex. We identified 22 new loci potentially involved in cell envelope biogenesis, 76% of which encode putative cell envelope proteins. A mutant of particular interest was further characterized and revealed a new player in mycolic acid metabolism. Because a large proportion of the genes identified by our study is conserved in Corynebacteriales, the library described here provides a new resource of genes whose characterization could lead to a better understanding of the biosynthesis of the envelope components of these bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The core of HIV-1 viruses bearing the capsid change N74D (HIV-1-N74D) do not bind the human protein cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 6 (CPSF6). In addition, HIV-1-N74D viruses have altered patterns of integration site preference in human cell lines. In primary human CD4+ T cells, HIV-1-N74D viruses exhibit infectivity defects when compared to wild type. The reason for this loss of infectivity in primary cells is unknown. We first investigated whether loss of CPSF6 binding accounts for the loss of infectivity. Depletion of CPSF6 in human CD4+ T cells did not affect the early stages of wild-type HIV-1 replication, suggesting that defective infectivity in the case of HIV-1-N74D is not due to the loss of CPSF6 binding. Based on our previous result that cyclophilin A (Cyp A) protected HIV-1 from human tripartite motif-containing protein 5 (TRIM5hu) restriction in CD4+ T cells, we tested whether TRIM5hu was involved in the decreased infectivity observed for HIV-1-N74D. Depletion of TRIM5hu in CD4+ T cells rescued the infectivity of HIV-1-N74D, suggesting that HIV-1-N74D cores interacted with TRIM5hu. Accordingly, TRIM5hu binding to HIV-1-N74D cores was increased compared with that of wild-type cores, and consistently, HIV-1-N74D cores lost their ability to bind Cyp A. In conclusion, we showed that the decreased infectivity of HIV-1-N74D in CD4+ T cells is due to a loss of Cyp A protection from TRIM5hu restriction activity.",

    "abstract": "In the study of genetic diversity in non-model species there is a notable lack of the low-cost, high resolution tools that are readily available for model organisms. Genotyping microarray technology for model organisms is well-developed, affordable, and potentially adaptable for cross-species hybridization. The Mouse Diversity Genotyping Array (MDGA), a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping tool designed for Mus musculus, was tested as a tool to survey genomic diversity of wild species for inter-order, inter-genus, and intra-genus comparisons. Application of the MDGA cross-species provides genetic distance information that reflects known taxonomic relationships reported previously between non-model species, but there is an underestimation of genetic diversity for non-Mus samples, indicated by a plateau in loci genotyped beginning 10-15 millions of years divergence from the house mouse. The number and types of samples included in datasets genotyped together must be considered in cross-species hybridization studies. The number of loci with heterozygous genotypes mapped to published genome sequences indicates potential for cross-species MDGA utility. A case study of seven deer mice yielded 159,797 loci (32% of loci queried by the MDGA) that were genotyped in these rodents. For one species, Peromyscus maniculatus, 6,075 potential polymorphic loci were identified. Cross-species utility of the MDGA provides needed genetic information for non-model species that are lacking genomic resources. Genotyping arrays are widely available, developed tools that are capable of capturing large amounts of genetic information in a single application, and represent a unique opportunity to identify genomic variation in closely related species that currently have a paucity of genomic information available. A candidate list of MDGA loci that can be utilized in cross-species hybridization studies was identified and may prove to be informative for rodent species that are known as environmental sentinels. Future studies may evaluate the utility of candidate SNP loci in populations of non-model rodents.\n\nAuthor SummaryThere is a need for a tool that can assay DNA sequence differences in species for which there is little or no DNA information available. One method of analyzing differences in DNA sequences in species with well-understood genomes is through a genotyping microarray, which has demonstrated utility cross-species. The Mouse Diversity Genotyping Array (MDGA) is a tool designed to examine known differences across the genome of the house mouse, Mus musculus. Given that related organisms share genetic similarity, the MDGA was tested for utility in identifying genome variation in other wild mice and rodents. Variation identified from distantly related species that were not of the same genus as the house mouse was an underestimate of the true amount of variation present in the genomes of wild species. Utility of the MDGA for wild species is best suited to mice from the same genus as the house mouse, and candidate variation identified can be tested in rodent populations in future studies. Identifying changes in genetic variation within populations of wild rodents can help researchers understand the links between specific genome changes and the ability to adapt to pressures in the environment, as well as better understand the evolution of rodents.",
