    "abstract": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique widely used in research and clinical applications. However, its mechanism of action and the neural response to TMS are still poorly understood. Multi-scale modeling can complement experimental research and provide a framework between the physical input parameters and the subcellular neural effects of TMS. At the macroscopic level, sophisticated numerical models exist to estimate the induced electric fields in whole-brain volume conductor models. However, multi-scale computational modeling approaches to predict TMS cellular and subcellular responses, crucial to understanding TMS plasticity inducing protocols, are not available so far. Here, we develop a multi-scale Neuron Modeling for TMS toolbox (NeMo-TMS) that enables researchers to easily generate accurate neuron models from morphological reconstructions, couple them to the external electric fields induced by TMS, and to simulate the cellular and subcellular responses of the neurons. Both single-pulse and rTMS protocols can be simulated and results visualized in 3D. We openly share our toolbox and provide example scripts and datasets for the user to explore. NeMo-TMS toolbox (https://github.com/OpitzLab/NeMo-TMS) allows researchers a previously not available level of detail and precision in realistically modeling the physical and physiological effects of TMS.",

    "abstract": "Health disparity across layers of society involves reasons beyond the healthcare system. Socioeconomic status (SES) shapes peoples daily interaction with their social environment, and is known to impact various health outcomes. Using generative probabilistic modeling, we investigated health satisfaction and complementary indicators of socioeconomic lifestyle in the human social brain. In a population cohort of ~10,000 UK Biobank participants, our first analysis probed the relationship between health status and subjective social standing (i.e., financial satisfaction). We identified volume effects in participants unhappy with their health in regions of the higher associative cortex, especially the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). Specifically, participants in poor subjective health showed deviations in dmPFC and TPJ volume as a function of financial satisfaction. The second analysis on health status and objective social standing (i.e., household income) revealed volume deviations in regions of the limbic system for individuals feeling unhealthy. In particular, low-SES participants dissatisfied with their health showed deviations in volume distributions in the amygdala and hippocampus bilaterally. Thus, our population-level evidence speaks to the possibility that health status and socioeconomic position have characteristic imprints in social brain differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Cortical visual processing transforms features of the external world into increasingly complex and specialized neuronal representations. These transformations arise in part through target-specific routing of information; however, within-area computations may also contribute to area-specific function. Here, we sought to determine whether higher-order visual cortical areas LM, AL, PM, and AM have specialized anatomical and physiological properties by using a combination of whole-cell recordings and optogenetic stimulation of V1 axons in vitro. We discovered area-specific differences in the strength of recruitment of interneurons through feed-forward and recurrent pathways, as well as differences in cell-intrinsic properties and interneuron densities. These differences were most striking when comparing across medial and lateral areas, suggesting that these areas have distinct profiles for net excitability and integration of V1 inputs. Thus, cortical areas are not defined simply by the information they receive, but also by area-specific circuit properties that enable specialized filtering of these inputs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with white matter (WM) microstructure. Our objective was to investigate how WM microstructure is longitudinally related to symptom remission in adolescents and young adults with ADHD.\n\nMethodsWe obtained diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from 99 participants at two time points (mean age baseline: 16.91 years, mean age follow-up: 20.57 years). We used voxel-wise Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) with permutation-based inference to investigate associations of inattention (IA) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (HI) symptom change with fractional anisotropy (FA) at baseline, follow-up, and change between time points.\n\nResultsRemission of combined HI and IA symptoms was significantly associated with reduced FA at follow-up in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus and the left corticospinal tract (CST) (PFWE=0.038 and PFWE=0.044, respectively), mainly driven by an association between HI remission and follow-up CST FA (PFWE=0.049). There was no significant association of combined symptom decrease with FA at baseline or with changes in FA between the two assessments.\n\nConclusionsIn this longitudinal DWI study of ADHD using dimensional symptom scores, we show that greater symptom decrease is associated with lower follow-up FA in specific WM tracts. Altered FA thus may appear to follow, rather than precede, changes in symptom remission. Our findings indicate divergent WM developmental trajectories between individuals with persistent and remittent ADHD, and support the role of prefrontal and sensorimotor tracts in the remission of ADHD.",

    "abstract": "We lack viable explanations of how brain functions emerge from collective activities of neurons in networks. We recorded field potentials from many local networks in the human cerebral cortex during a wide variety of brain functions. The network dynamics showed that each local cortical network produced fluctuating attractor states. The state trajectories continuously stretched and contracted during all brain functions, leaving no stable patterns. Different local networks all produced this dynamic, despite different architectures. Single trial stimuli and tasks modified the stretching and contractions. These modified fluctuations cross-correlated among particular networks during specific brain functions. Spontaneous states, rest, sensory, motor and cognitive states all emerged from this dynamic. Its mathematical structure provides a general explanation of cortical dynamics that can be tested experimentally. This universal dynamic is a simple functional organizing principle for brain functions at the mm3 scale that is distinct from existing frameworks.",

Broadly neutralizing human antibodies (bNAbs) with exceptional activity against HIV-1 are currently being tested in HIV-1 prevention trials. The selection of anti-HIV-1 bNAbs for clinical development was primarily guided by their in vitro neutralizing activity against HIV-1 Env pseudotyped viruses. Here we report on the neutralizing activity of 9 anti-HIV-1 bNAbs now in clinical development against 126 Clade A, C, D PBMC-derived primary African isolates. The neutralizing potency and breadth of the bNAbs tested was significantly reduced compared to pseudotyped viruses panels. The difference in sensitivity between pseudotyped viruses and primary isolates varied from 3-to nearly 100-fold depending on the bNAb and the HIV-1 clade. Thus, the neutralizing activity of bNAbs against primary African isolates differs and cannot be predicted from their activity against pseudovirus panels.

    "abstract": "Aquatic environments of volcanic origin provide an exceptional opportunity to study the adaptations of microbial communities to early planet life conditions such as high temperatures, high metal concentrations, and low pH. Here, we characterized the prokaryotic communities and physicochemical properties of seepage sites at the bottom of the Poas Volcano crater and the Agrio River, two geologically related extremely acidic environments located in the Central Volcanic mountain range of Costa Rica. Both locations hold a very low pH (pH 1.79-2.20) and have high sulfate and iron concentrations (Fe = 47-206 mg/L, SO42- = 1170-2460 mg/L measured as S), but significant differences in their temperature (90.0-95.0{degrees}C in the seepages at Poas Volcano versus 19.1-26.6 {degrees}C in Agrio River) and in the abundance of elemental sulfur. Based on the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, we determined that Sulfobacillus spp., sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, represented more than half (58.4-78.4%) of the sequences in Poas Volcano seepage sites, while Agrio River was dominated by the iron- and sulfur-oxidizing Leptospirillum (7.4-55.5%) and members of the archeal order Thermoplasmatales (16.0-58.2%). Both environments share some chemical characteristics and part of their microbiota, however the temperature and the presence of reduced sulfur are likely the main distinguishing feature ultimately shaping their microbial communities. Our data suggest that in the Poas Volcano-Agrio River system there is a common metabolism but with specialization of species that adapt to the physicochemical conditions of each environment.",

Elevated temperatures in the Arctic are expected to increase metabolic rates, which in turn will result in increased rates of zooplankton production and foraging. We postulate that this may also be tied to elevated incidence of fungi parasitism in key zooplankton species. We present data of in-situ fungal parasitism in the key Arctic zooplankton species complex Calanus spp. We found that >10% of Calanus specimens were internally parasitized by fungi that had 100% molecular identity to Penicillium chrysogenum. Experimental studies with two strains of P. chrysogenum and Calanus spp. revealed an increased mortality effect suggesting that fungi decrease the survival of overwintering zooplankton, which may have cascading effects on higher trophic levels that feed on Calanus. Moreover, Calanus demonstrated reduced swimming activity in the presence of P. chyrsogenum, indicating that fungi could affect predator avoidance and vertical migration patterns of zooplankton. Semi-thin sectioning of live zooplankton incubated with P. chrysogenum revealed the presence of hyphae throughout the body, underscoring the parasitic nature of P. chrysogenum in Calanus. We hypothesize that as the Arctic warms, the balance between host and pathogen could shift in favor of pathogen reproduction, resulting in a greater effect of fungal pathogens on zooplankton.",

    "abstract": "Competitive exclusion can be classified as deterministic or as historically contingent. While competitive exclusion is common in nature, it has remained unclear when multispecies communities should be dominated by deterministic or contingent exclusion. Here, we provide a general theoretical approach to explain both the emergence and sources of competitive exclusion in multispecies communities. We illustrate our approach on an empirical competition system between annual and perennial plant species. First, we find that the life-history of perennial species increases the probability of observing contingent exclusion by increasing their effective intrinsic growth rates. Second, we find that the probability of observing contingent exclusion increases with weaker intraspecific competition, and not with the level of hierarchical competition. Third, we find a shift from contingent exclusion to dominance with increasing numbers of competing species. Our work provides a heuristic framework to increase our understanding about the predictability of species persistence within multispecies communities.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian gut teems with beneficial microbes, yet how hosts acquire these symbionts remains poorly understood. Research in primates suggests that microbes can be picked up via social contact, but the role of social interactions in non-group-living species remains unexplored. Here, we use a passive tracking system to collect high resolution spatiotemporal activity data from wild mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). Social network analysis revealed social association strength to be the strongest predictor of microbiota similarity among individuals, controlling for factors including spatial proximity and kinship, which had far smaller or nonsignificant effects. This social effect was limited to interactions involving males (male-male and male-female), implicating sex-dependent behaviours as driving processes. Social network position also predicted microbiota richness, with well-connected hub individuals having the most diverse microbiotas. Overall, these findings suggest social contact provides a key transmission pathway for gut symbionts even in relatively asocial mammals, that strongly shapes the adult gut microbiota. This work underlines the potential for individuals to pick up beneficial symbionts as well as pathogens from social interactions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAntibiotic treatment is a key tool in the fight against pneumococcal infections. However, the ongoing emergence of antibiotic resistant strains and high frequencies of antibiotic resistance of pneumococci pose a major public health challenge. How and which ecological and evolutionary mechanisms help maintain the coexistence of strains susceptible and resistant to antibiotic treatment remains largely an open question.\n\nMethods/resultsExpanding on a Streptococcus pneumoniae modelling framework, we here explore how both between- and within-host mechanisms of transmission can sustain observed levels of pneumococcal resistance to antibiotics in the pre-vaccination era using a stochastic, individual-based model. Our framework considers that within-host competition for co-colonization between resistant and susceptible strains can arise via pre-existing immunity (immunological competition) or intrinsic fitness differences due to resistance costs (ecological competition). We find that beyond stochasticity, host-population structure or movement at the between-host level, competition at the within-host level can explain observed variation in resistance frequencies.\n\nConclusionIn a series of simulated scenarios informed by observed pneumococcal data in the European region, we demonstrate that ecological competition for co-colonization can explain much of the variation in co-existence observed at the country level in the pre-vaccination era. This work expands our understanding of how within-host pneumococcal competition facilitates the maintenance of antibiotic resistance in the pre-vaccination era. The demonstration of the effects of such underlying, often unmeasured competition-related components of pneumococcal dynamics improves our understanding of the mechanistic drivers for the emergence and maintenance of antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of vertebrates from an invertebrate chordate ancestor involved the evolution of new organs, tissues, and cell types. It was also marked by the origin and duplication of new gene families. If, and how, these morphological and genetic innovations are related is an unresolved question in vertebrate evolution. Hyaluronan is an extracellular matrix (ECM) polysaccharide important for water homeostasis and tissue structure. Vertebrates possess a novel family of hyaluronan binding proteins called Lecticans, and studies in jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) have shown they function in many of the cells and tissues that are unique to vertebrates. This raises the possibility that the origin and/or expansion of this gene family helped drive the evolution of these vertebrate novelties. In order to better understand the evolution of the lectican gene family, and its role in the evolution of vertebrate morphological novelties, we investigated the phylogeny, genomic arrangement, and expression patterns of all lecticans in the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), a jawless vertebrate. Though both P. marinus and gnathostomes have four lecticans, our phylogenetic and syntenic analyses suggest lamprey lecticans are the result of one or more cyclostome-specific duplications. Despite the independent expansion of the lamprey and gnathostome lectican families, we find highly conserved expression of lecticans in vertebrate-specific and mesenchyme-derived tissues. We also find that, unlike gnathostomes, lamprey expresses its lectican paralogs in distinct subpopulations of head skeleton precursors, potentially reflecting an ancestral diversity of skeletal tissue types. Together, these observations suggest that the ancestral pre-duplication lectican had a complex expression pattern, functioned to support mesenchymal histology, and likely played a role in the evolution of vertebrate-specific cell and tissue types.",

    "abstract": "Most traits expressed by organisms, such as gene expression profiles, developmental trajectories, behavioural sequences and reaction norms are function-valued traits (colloquially \"phenotypically plastic traits\"), since they vary across an individuals age and in response to various internal and/or external factors (state variables). Furthermore, most organisms live in populations subject to limited genetic mixing and are thus likely to interact with their relatives. We here formalise selection on genetically determined function-valued traits of individuals interacting in a group-structured population, by deriving the marginal version of Hamiltons rule for function-valued traits. This rule simultaneously gives a condition for the invasion of an initially rare mutant function-valued trait and its ultimate fixation in the population (invasion thus implies substitution). Hamiltons rule thus underlies the gradual evolution of function-valued traits and gives rise to necessary first-order conditions for their uninvadability (evolutionary stability). We develop a novel analysis using optimal control theory and differential game theory, to simultaneously characterise and compare the first-order conditions of (i) open-loop traits - functions of time (or age) only, and (ii) closed-loop (state-feedback) traits - functions of both time and state variables. We show that closed-loop traits can be represented as the simpler open-loop traits when individuals do no interact or when they interact with clonal relatives. Our analysis delineates the role of state-dependence and interdependence between individuals for trait evolution, which has implications to both life-history theory and social evolution.",

    "abstract": "To examine differences in the genetic architecture of BMI between tall and short people, we conducted genome-wide and follow-up analyses using UK Biobank data. We identify 57 loci as height-specific, detect differences in SNP-based heritability between tall and short people and show how genetic correlations between the two rises during the lifespan. Using phenome-wide analyses (PHEWAS), a significant association between a short people-specific locus on MC4R and energy portion size was detected. We identify one locus (GPC5-GPC6) with different effect directions on BMI in short and tall people. PHEWAS indicates this locus is associated with bone mineral density. Transcriptome-wide analyses hint that genes differentially associated with BMI in short vs tall people are enriched in brain tissue. Our findings highlight the role of height in the genetic underpinnings of BMI, provide biological insight into mechanisms underlying height-dependent differences in BMI and show that in short and tall people obesity is a risk factor that differentially increases susceptibility for disease.",

    "abstract": "A key step to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is the attachment of its Spike receptor-binding domain (S RBD) to the host receptor ACE2. Considerable research have been devoted to the development of neutralizing antibodies, including llama-derived single-chain nanobodies, to target the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and to block ACE2-RBD binding. Simple and effective strategies to increase potency are desirable for such studies when antibodies are only modestly effective. Here, we identify and characterize a high-affinity synthetic nanobody (sybody, SR31) as a fusion partner to improve the potency of RBM-antibodies. Crystallographic studies reveal that SR31 binds to RBD at a conserved and  greasy site distal to RBM. Although SR31 distorts RBD at the interface, it does not perturb the RBM conformation, hence displaying no neutralizing activities itself. However, fusing SR31 to two modestly neutralizing sybodies dramatically increases their affinity for RBD and neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Our work presents a tool protein and an efficient strategy to improve nanobody potency.",

    "abstract": "Chemical proteomics provides a powerful strategy for the high-throughput assignment of enzyme function or inhibitor selectivity. However, identifying optimized probes for an enzyme family member of interest and differentiating signal from background remain persistent challenges in the field. To address this obstacle, here we report a physiochemical discernment strategy for optimizing chemical proteomics based on the Coenzyme A (CoA) cofactor. First, we synthesize a pair of CoA-based Sepharose pulldown resins differentiated by a single negatively charged residue, and find this change alters their capture properties in gel-based profiling experiments. Next, we integrate these probes with quantitative proteomics and benchmark analysis of  probe selectivity versus traditional  competitive chemical proteomics. This reveals the former is well-suited for the identification of optimized pulldown probes for specific enzyme family members, while the latter may have advantages in discovery applications. Finally, we apply our anionic CoA pulldown probe to evaluate the selectivity of a recently reported small molecule N-terminal acetyltransferase inhibitor. These studies further validate the use of physical discriminant strategies in chemoproteomic hit identification and demonstrate how CoA-based chemoproteomic probes can be used to evaluate the selectivity of small molecule protein acetyltransferase inhibitors, an emerging class of pre-clinical therapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "While cytosolic Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones have been extensively studied, less is known about how the ER Hsp70 and Hsp90 paralogs (BiP and Grp94) recognize clients and influence their folding. Here, we examine how BiP and Grp94 influence the folding of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). Full-length proIGF2 is composed of an insulin-like hormone and an E-peptide that has sequence characteristics of an intrinsically disordered region. We find that the E-peptide region allows proIGF2 to form oligomers. BiP and Grp94 influence both the folding and the oligomerization of proIGF2. BiP and Grp94 exert a similar holdase function on proIGF2 folding by preferentially binding the proIGF2 unfolded state, rather than stabilizing specific folding intermediates and changing the proIGF2 folding process. In contrast, BiP and Grp94 exert counteracting effects on proIGF2 oligomerization. BiP suppresses proIGF2 oligomerization under both ADP and ATP conditions. Interestingly, Grp94 can enhance proIGF2 oligomerization when Grp94 adopts an open conformation (ADP conditions), but not when Grp94 is in the closed conformation (ATP conditions). We propose that BiP and Grp94 regulate the assembly of proIGF2 oligomers, and that regulated oligomerization may enable proIGF2 to be effectively packaged for export from the ER to the Golgi.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCoronaviruses are a group of viruses that belong to the Family Coronaviridae, Genus Betacoronavirus. In December 2019, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) characterized by severe respiratory symptoms was discovered. The causative pathogen was a novel coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV and later as SARS-CoV-2. Within two months of its discovery, COVID-19 became a pandemic causing widespread morbidity and mortality.\n\nMethodologyWhole genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Nigerian COVID-19 cases were retrieved by downloading from GISAID database. A total of 18 sequences that satisfied quality assurance (length [&ge;] 29700 nts and number of unknown bases denoted as  N [&le;] 5%) were used for the study. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was done in MAFFT (Version 7.471) while SNP calling was implemented in DnaSP (Version 6.12.03) respectively and then visualized in Jalview (Version 2.11.1.0). Phylogenetic analysis was with MEGA X software.\n\nResultsNigerian SARS-CoV-2 had 99.9% genomic similarity with four large conserved genomic regions. A total of 66 SNPs were identified out of which 31 were informative. Nucleotide diversity assessment gave Pi = 0.00048 and average SNP frequency of 2.22 SNPs per 1000 nts. Non-coding genomic regions particularly 5UTR and 3UTR had a SNP density of 3.77 and 35.4 respectively. The region with the highest SNP density was ORF10 with a frequency of 8.55 SNPs/1000 nts). Majority (72.2%) of viruses in Nigeria are of L lineage with preponderance of D614G mutation which accounted for 11 (61.1%) out of the 18 viral sequences. Nigeria SARS-CoV-2 revealed 3 major clades namely Oyo, Ekiti and Osun on a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree.\n\nConclusion and RecommendationNigerian SARS-CoV-2 reveals high mutation rate together with preponderance of L lineage and D614G mutants. Implication of these mutations for SARS-CoV-2 virulence and the need for more aggressive testing and treatment of COVID-19 in Nigeria is discussed. Additionally, attempt to produce testing kits for COVID-19 in Nigeria should consider the conserved regions identified in this study. Strict adherence to COVID-19 preventive measure is recommended in view of Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic clustering pattern, which suggests intensive community transmission possibly rooted in communal culture characteristic of many ethnicities in Nigeria.",

To establish the relationship among globally distributed cc4821 meningococci, we analysed whole genome sequence data from 173 cc4821 meningococci isolated in four continents from 1972-2019. These meningococci clustered into four sub-lineages (1-4), with sub-lineage 1 primarily comprising serogroup C IMD isolates (82%, 41/50). Most isolates from outside China formed a distinct sub-lineage (81.6%, 40/49, the Europe-USA cluster), with the typical strain designation B:P1.17-6,23:F3-36:ST-3200(cc4821) and harbouring mutations in penicillin-binding protein 2. These data show that the quinolone-resistant clone ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B has expanded to other countries. The increasing global distribution of B:cc4821 meningococci raises concern that cc4821 has the potential to cause a global pandemic and, this would be challenging to control though there is indirect evidence that Trumenba(R) vaccine might afford some protection.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, extensive studies on the properties of non-membrane-bound compartments in the cellular cytoplasm have shown that concepts in phase separation drawn from physical chemistry can describe their formation and behaviour1-4. Current evidence also suggests that phase separation plays a role in the organization inside the cell nucleus5-8. However, the influence and role of DNA on the physical chemistry of phase separation is not well understood. Here, we are interested in the role of interactions between phase separating proteins and the DNA surface. The interaction of liquid phases with surfaces has been extensively studied in soft matter physics, in the context of macroscopic surfaces and non-biological liquids9-11. The conditions in the nucleus are different from those studied in conventional soft matter physics because DNA with a diameter of about 2 nm12 provides a microscopic surface, and liquid-like phases are complex mixtures of proteins subject to a myriad of biochemical modifications13. Transcriptional condensates, which are thought to serve as regulatory hubs in gene expression14-21, provide an accessible system to investigate the physics of condensates that emerge from DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. These condensates are typically small22, and the mechanisms that determine their size are unknown. Whether they can be understood as phase separated compartments has been subject to debate23-26. Here, we use optical tweezers to directly observe the condensation of the pioneer transcription factor Klf427,28 on DNA in vitro. We demonstrate that Klf4 forms microphases that are enabled by interaction with the DNA surface. This sets their typical size and allows them to form below the saturation concentration for liquid-liquid phase separation. We combine experiment with theory to show that these microphases can be understood as forming by surface condensation on DNA via a switch-like transition similar to prewetting. Polymer surface mediated condensation reconciles several observations that were previously thought to be at odds with the idea of phase separation as an organizing principle in the nucleus.",

Here we report the first human skeletal muscle SRX measurements, using quantitative epifluorescence microscopy of fluorescent 2/3-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) ATP (mantATP) single-nucleotide turnover. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform expression was determined using gel electrophoresis for each permeabilized vastus lateralis fiber, to allow for novel comparisons of SRX between fiber-types. We find that the fraction of myosin in SRX is less in MHC IIA fibers than in MHC I and IIAX fibers (p = 0.008). ATP turnover of SRX is faster in MHC IIAX fibers compared to MHC I and IIA fibers (p = 0.001). We conclude that SRX biochemistry is measurable in human skeletal muscle, and our data indicate that SRX depends on fiber type as classified by MHC isoform.

    "abstract": "Long-term social aggregations are maintained by multiple mechanisms, including the use of acoustic signals, which may nonetheless entail significant energetic costs. To date, however, no studies have gauged whether there are significant energetic costs to social call production in bats, which heavily rely on acoustic communication for a diversity of social tasks. We measure energetic expenditure during acoustic signaling in Spixs disc-winged bats (Thyroptera tricolor), a species that commonly uses contact calls to locate the ephemeral furled leaves that they use for roosting. To determine the cost of sound production, we measured oxygen consumption using intermittent-flow respirometry methods, with and without social signaling. Our results show that the emission of contact calls significantly increases oxygen consumption; vocal individuals spent, on average, 12.42 kJ more during social signaling trials than they spent during silent trials. Furthermore, production of contact calls during longer periods increased oxygen consumption for males but not for females. We also found that as resting metabolic rates increased in males, there was a decreasing probability that they would emit response calls. These results provide support to the \"allocation model\", which predicts that only individuals with lower self-maintenance costs can afford to spend energy in additional activities. Our results provide a step forward in our understanding of how physiology modulates behavior, specifically how the costs of call production and resting metabolic rates may explain the differences in vocal behavior among individuals.\n\nSummary StatementSpixs disc-winged bats constantly produce contact calls while searching for roosts, which we show significantly increases an individuals metabolic rate.",

Compared to Muilla coronata, the style and stigma combined are longer, the anthers are longer, the fruits are larger, and the seeds are larger. It has a short flowering period in March, and is difficult or impossible to find at other times of the year. It is narrowly distributed, limited to a band of deep, coarse, sandy soils derived primarily from granite. Several species that are otherwise uncommon in the area also occur in this habitat, including Logfia depressa, Pectocarya platycarpa, and Plagiobothrys arizonicus. Invasive species, especially Erodium cicutarium in the winter annual flora, are generally dominant.

    "abstract": "Intercellular signals induce various cellular responses, including growth, proliferation, and differentiation, via the dynamic processes of signal transduction pathways. For cell-fate decisions, ligand-binding induces the phosphorylation of ERBB receptors, which in turn activate downstream molecules. The ERBB family includes four subtypes, which diverged through two gene duplications from a common ancestor, of different kinetic properties. Differences in the expression patterns of the subtypes have been reported between different organs in the human body. However, how these different kinetic and expression properties influence the diverse phosphorylation dynamics of ERBB proteins is not well understood. Here we study the phosphorylation dynamics by experimental and mathematical analyses. The experimental measurements clarified that the phosphorylation dynamics heavily depend on the ERBB expression profiles. We developed a mathematical model consisting of the four subtypes as monomers, homodimers and heterodimers and estimated the rate constants governing the phosphorylation dynamics from the experimental data. To understand the origin of the diversity of the phosphorylation responses of the ERBB system, we analyzed the expression profiles and reaction rates of the ERBB subtypes. The difference in phosphorylation rates between ERBB subtypes showed a much larger contribution to the diversity of the phosphorylation responses than did the dimerization rates. This result implies that divergent evolution in phosphorylation reactions rather than in dimerization reactions after whole genome duplications was essential for increasing the diversity of the phosphorylation responses.\n\nStatement of SignificanceIt is known that the expression patterns of a protein family are different between different organs in the human body. This difference is considered essential for the functional diversity between organs. However, the dynamical processes that translate expression patterns into function are not well understood. Here we study the origin of the diversity in ERBB phosphorylation patterns by combining experimental and mathematical methods. We confirmed experimentally that phosphorylation patterns depend on the ERBB expression profiles. Our mathematical model found that differences in phosphorylation rates made the largest contribution to the diversity of phosphorylation patterns between ERBB subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory microcircuits play an essential role in regulating cortical responses to sensory stimuli. Interneurons that inhibit dendritic or somatic integration in pyramidal neurons act as gatekeepers for neural activity, synaptic plasticity and the formation of sensory representations. Conversely, interneurons that specifically inhibit other interneurons can open gates through disinhibition. In the rodent piriform cortex, relief of dendritic inhibition permits long-term potentiation (LTP) of the recurrent synapses between pyramidal neurons (PNs) thought to underlie ensemble odor representations. We used an optogenetic approach to identify the inhibitory interneurons and disinhibitory circuits that regulate LTP. We focused on three prominent inhibitory neuron classes-somatostatin (SST), parvalbumin (PV), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) interneurons. We find that LTP is gated by the inactivation SST or PV interneurons or by activation of VIP interneurons. Further, activation of VIP interneurons strongly inhibits putative SST-cells during LTP induction, but only weakly inhibit PV-interneurons. Taken together, these findings suggest that VIP-interneurons mediate a disinhibitory circuit that can regulate synaptic plasticity during olfactory processing.",

Here we introduce a novel approach to quantitatively characterize the spatial origin of the P3 component by (1) applying second-order blind identification (SOBI) to continuous, high-density EEG data to extract the P3 component, (2) modeling the underlying generators of the SOBI P3 component as a set of equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) in Talairach space using BESA; (3) using the application Talairach Client to determine the \"hits\" associated with the anatomical structures at three level of resolution (lobe, gyrus, and cell type). We show that the hits information provided by Talairach Client can enable a quantitative characterization of the spatial configuration of the network underlying the P3 component (P3N) via two quantities: cross-individual reliability (or consistency) of a given brain structure as a part of the P3N, and within-individual contribution of a given brain structure to the whole P3N network. We suggest that this method may be used to further differentiate individuals in the absence of differences in P3 amplitude or latency, or when scientific questions or practical application cannot be supported by a yes-no answer regarding the source of a P3 component. Finally, application of our method to a group of 13 participants revealed that frontal structures, particularly BA10, play a special role in the function of a global cortical network underlying novelty processing.",

    "abstract": "Representations of the external world in sensory cortices may define the identity of a stimulus and should therefore vary little over the life of the organism. In the olfactory system the primary olfactory cortex, piriform, is thought to determine odor identity1-6. We have performed electrophysiological recordings of single units maintained over weeks to examine the stability of odor representations in the mouse piriform cortex. We observed that odor representations drift over time, such that the performance of a linear classifier trained on the first recording day approaches chance levels after 32 days. Daily exposure to the same odorant slows the rate of drift, but when exposure is halted that rate increases once again. Moreover, behavioral salience does not stabilize odor representations. Continuous drift poses the question of the role of piriform in odor identification. This instability may reflect the unstructured connectivity of piriform7-15 and may be a property of other unstructured cortices.",

    "abstract": "A prerequisite for the design of an HIV vaccine that elicits protective antibodies is understanding the developmental pathways that result in desirable antibody features. The development of antibodies that mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is particularly relevant because such antibodies have been associated with HIV protection in humans. We reconstructed the developmental pathways of six human HIV-specific ADCC antibodies using longitudinal antibody sequencing data. Most of the inferred naive antibodies did not mediate detectable ADCC. Gain of antigen binding and ADCC function typically required mutations in complementarity determining regions of one or both chains. Enhancement of ADCC potency often required additional mutations in framework regions. Antigen binding affinity and ADCC activity were correlated, but affinity alone was not sufficient to predict ADCC potency. Thus, elicitation of human ADCC antibodies may require mutations that first enable high affinity antigen recognition, followed by mutations that optimize factors contributing to functional ADCC activity.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory viruses such as coronaviruses represent major ongoing global threats, causing epidemics and pandemics with huge economic burden. Rapid spread of virus through populations poses an enormous challenge for outbreak control. Like all respiratory viruses, the most recent novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, initiates infection in the upper respiratory tract (URT). Infected individuals are often asymptomatic, yet highly infectious and readily transmit virus. A therapy that restricts initial replication in the URT has the potential to prevent progression of severe lower respiratory tract disease as well as limiting person-to-person transmission.\n\nWe show that prophylactic intra-nasal administration of the TLR2/6 agonist INNA-051 in a SARS-CoV-2 ferret infection model effectively reduces levels of viral RNA in the nose and throat. The results of our study support clinical development of a therapy based on prophylactic TLR2/6 innate immune activation in the URT to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and provide protection against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses are adept at evading host antiviral pathways induced by viral double-stranded RNA, including interferon (IFN) signaling, oligoadenylate synthetase-ribonuclease L (OAS-RNase L), and protein kinase R (PKR). While dysregulated or inadequate IFN responses have been associated with severe coronavirus infection, the extent to which the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 activates or antagonizes these pathways is relatively unknown. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects patient-derived nasal epithelial cells, present at the initial site of infection, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2), the major cell type infected in the lung, and cardiomyocytes (iCM), consistent with cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19 disease. Robust activation of IFN or OAS-RNase L is not observed in these cell types, while PKR activation is evident in iAT2 and iCM. In SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 and A549ACE2 lung-derived cell lines, IFN induction remains relatively weak; however activation of OAS-RNase L and PKR is observed. This is in contrast to MERS-CoV, which effectively inhibits IFN signaling as well as OAS-RNase L and PKR pathways, but similar to mutant MERS-CoV lacking innate immune antagonists. Remarkably, both OAS-RNase L and PKR are activated in MAVS knockout A549ACE2 cells, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can induce these host antiviral pathways despite minimal IFN production. Moreover, increased replication and cytopathic effect in RNASEL knockout A549ACE2 cells implicates OAS-RNase L in restricting SARS-CoV-2. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 fails to antagonize these host defense pathways, which contrasts with other coronaviruses, the IFN signaling response is generally weak. These host-virus interactions may contribute to the unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSignificanceSARS-CoV-2 emergence in late 2019 led to the COVID-19 pandemic that has had devastating effects on human health and the economy. Early innate immune responses are essential for protection against virus invasion. While inadequate innate immune responses are associated with severe COVID-19 diseases, understanding of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with host antiviral pathways is minimal. We have characterized the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infections in relevant respiratory tract derived cells and cardiomyocytes and found that SARS-CoV-2 activates two antiviral pathways, oligoadenylate synthetase-ribonuclease L (OAS-RNase L), and protein kinase R (PKR), while inducing minimal levels of interferon. This in contrast to MERS-CoV which inhibits all three pathways. Activation of these pathways may contribute to the distinctive pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "T-series phages have been model organisms for molecular biology since the 1940s. Given that these phages have been stocked, distributed, and propagated for decades across the globe, there exists the potential for genetic drift to accumulate between stocks over time. Here we compared the temporal stability and genetic relatedness of laboratory-maintained phage stocks with a T-series collection from 1972. Only the T-even phages produced viable virions. We obtained complete genomes of these T-even phages, along with two contemporary T4 stocks. Performing comparative genomics, we found 12 and 16 nucleotide variations, respectively, in the genomes of T2 and T6; whereas there were ~172 nucleotide variations between T4-sublines when compared with NCBI RefSeq genome. To account for the possibility of artefacts in the NCBI RefSeq, we used the 1972 T4 stock as a reference and compared genetic and phenotypic variations between T4-sublines. Genomic analysis predicted nucleotide variations in genes associated with DNA metabolism and structural proteins. We did not however, observe any differences in growth characteristics or host range between the T4-sublines. Our study highlights the potential for genetic drift between individually maintained T-series phage stocks, yet after 48-years, this has not resulted in phenotypic alternations in these important model organisms.\n\nImportanceT-series bacteriophages have been used throughout the world for various molecular biology researches, which were critical for establishing the fundamentals of molecular biology - from the structure of DNA to advanced gene-editing tools. These model bacteriophages help keep research data consistent and comparable between laboratories. However, we observed genetic variability when compared contemporary sublines of T4-phages to a 48-year old stock of T4. This may have effects in the comparability of results obtained using T4 phage. Here, we highlighted the genomic differences between T4 sublines and examined phenotypic differences in phage replication parameters. We observed limited genomic changes but no phenotypic variations between T4 sublines. Our research highlights the possibility of genetic drift in model bacteriophages.",

    "abstract": "Identifying drugs that regulate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its symptoms has been a pressing area of investigation during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are frequently used for the relief of pain and inflammation, could modulate both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the host response to the virus. NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which mediate the production of prostaglandins (PGs). PGE2, one of the most abundant PGs, has diverse biological roles in homeostasis and inflammatory responses. Previous studies have shown that NSAID treatment or inhibition of PGE2 receptor signaling leads to upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, thus raising concerns that NSAIDs could increase susceptibility to infection. COX/PGE2 signaling has also been shown to regulate the replication of many viruses, but it is not yet known whether it plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 replication. The purpose of this study was to dissect the effect of NSAIDs on COVID-19 in terms of SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced COX-2 upregulation in diverse human cell culture and mouse systems. However, suppression of COX-2/PGE2 signaling by two commonly used NSAIDs, ibuprofen and meloxicam, had no effect on ACE2 expression, viral entry, or viral replication. Our findings suggest that COX-2 signaling driven by SARS-CoV-2 may instead play a role in regulating the lung inflammation and injury observed in COVID-19 patients.\n\nImportancePublic health officials have raised concerns about the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). NSAIDs function by inhibiting the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). These enzymes are critical for the generation of prostaglandins, lipid molecules with diverse roles in maintaining homeostasis as well as regulating the inflammatory response. While COX-1/COX-2 signaling pathways have been shown to affect the replication of many viruses, their effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced COX-2 expression in both human cell culture systems and mouse models. However, inhibition of COX-2 activity with NSAIDs did not affect SARS-CoV-2 entry or replication. Our findings suggest that COX-2 signaling may instead regulate the lung inflammation observed in COVID-19 patients, which is an important area for future studies.",

We identified a panel of human monoclonal antibody clones from a yeast display library with specificity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain that neutralized the virus in vitro. Administration of the lead antibody clone to Syrian hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduced viral load and histopathology score in the lungs. Moreover, the antibody interrupted monocyte infiltration into the lungs, which may have contributed to the reduction of disease severity by limiting immunopathological exacerbation.

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that persists in its vertebrate hosts in the form of dormant tissue cysts, which facilitate transmission through predation. The parasite must strike a balance that allows it to disseminate throughout its host without killing it, which requires the ability to properly counter host cell defenses. For example, oxidative stress encountered by Toxoplasma is suggested to impair parasite replication and dissemination. However, the strategies by which Toxoplasma mitigates oxidative stress are not completely clear. Among eukaryotes, environmental stresses induce the integrated stress response via phosphorylation of a translation initiation factor, eIF2. Here, we show that the Toxoplasma eIF2 kinase, TgIF2K-B, is activated in response to oxidative stress and affords protection. Knockout of TgIF2K-B, {Delta}tgif2k-b, disrupted parasite responses to oxidative stresses and enhanced replication, diminishing the ability of the parasite to differentiate into tissue cysts. In addition, parasites lacking TgIF2K-B exhibited resistance to activated macrophages and showed greater virulence in an in vivo model of infection. Our results establish that TgIF2K-B is essential for Toxoplasma responses to oxidative stress, which are important for the parasites ability to establish persistent infection in its host.\n\nIMPORTANCEToxoplasma gondii is a single-celled parasite that infects nucleated cells of warm-blooded vertebrates, including one-third of the human population. The parasites are not cleared by the immune response and persist in the host by converting into a latent tissue cyst form. Development of tissue cysts can be triggered by cellular stresses, which activate a family of TgIF2 kinases to phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor, TgIF2. Here, we establish that the TgIF2 kinase TgIF2K-B is activated by oxidative stress and is critical for maintaining oxidative balance in the parasite. Depletion of TgIF2K-B alters gene expression, leading to accelerated growth and a diminished ability to convert into tissue cysts. This study establishes that TgIF2K-B is essential for the parasites oxidative stress response and its ability to persist in the host as a latent infection.",

    "abstract": "The ability of bacteria such as the dental pathogen Streptococcus mutans to coordinate a response against damage-inducing oxidants is a critical aspect of their pathogenicity. The oxidative stress regulator SpxA1 has been proven to be a major player in the ability of S. mutans to withstand both disulfide and peroxide stresses. While studying spontaneously-occurring variants of an S. mutans {Delta}spxA1 strain, we serendipitously discovered that our S. mutans UA159 host strain bore a single nucleotide deletion within the coding region ofperR, resulting in a premature truncation of the encoded protein. PerR is a metal-dependent transcriptional repressor that senses and responds to peroxide stress such that loss of PerR activity results in activation of oxidative stress responses. To determine the impact of loss of PerR regulation, we obtained a UA159 isolated bearing an intact perR copy and created a clean perR deletion mutant. Our findings indicate that loss of PerR activity results in a strain that is primed to tolerate oxidative stresses in the laboratory setting. Interestingly, RNA-Seq and targeted transcriptional expression analyses reveal that PerR has a minor contribution to the ability of S. mutans to orchestrate a transcriptional response to peroxide stress. Furthermore, we detected loss-of-function perR mutations in two other commonly used laboratory strains of S. mutans suggesting that this may be not be an uncommon occurrence. This report serves as a cautionary warning regarding the so-called domestication of laboratory strains and advocates for the implementation of more stringent strain authentication practices.\n\nImportanceA resident of the human oral biofilm, Streptococcus mutans is one of the major bacterial pathogens associated with dental caries. This report highlights a spontaneously-occurring mutation within the laboratory strain S. mutans UA159, found in the coding region of perR, a gene encoding a transcriptional repressor associated with peroxide tolerance. Though perR mutant strains of S. mutans showed a distinct growth advantage and enhanced tolerance toward H2O2, a {Delta}perR deletion strain showed a small number of differentially expressed genes as compared to the parent strain, suggesting few direct regulatory targets. In addition to characterizing the role of PerR in S. mutans, our findings serve as a warning to laboratory researchers regarding bacterial adaptation to in vitro growth conditions.",

    "abstract": "Organic matter constitutes a key reservoir in global elemental cycles. However, our understanding of the dynamics of organic matter and its accumulation remains incomplete. Seemingly disparate hypotheses have been proposed to explain organic matter accumulation: the slow degradation of intrinsically recalcitrant substrates, the depletion to concentrations that inhibit microbial consumption, and a dependency on the consumption capabilities of nearby microbial populations. Here, using a mechanistic model, we develop a theoretical framework that explains how organic matter predictably accumulates in natural environments due to biochemical, ecological, and environmental factors. The new framework subsumes the previous hypotheses. Changes in the microbial community or the environment can move a class of organic matter from a state of functional recalcitrance to a state of depletion by microbial consumers. The model explains the vertical profile of dissolved organic carbon in the ocean and connects microbial activity at subannual timescales to organic matter turnover at millenial timescales. The threshold behavior of the model implies that organic matter accumulation may respond nonlinearly to changes in temperature and other factors, providing hypotheses for the observed correlations between organic carbon reservoirs and temperature in past earth climates.",

    "abstract": "In meiosis, Spo11/Rec12-initiated homologous recombination is clustered at hotspots that regulate its frequency and distribution across the genome. Intriguingly, the intensities and positions of recombination hotspots can change dramatically in response to intracellular and extracellular conditions, and can display epigenetic memory. Here, using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we reveal mechanisms for hotspot plasticity. We show that each of six hotspot-activating proteins (transcription factors Atf1, Pcr1, Php2, Php3, Php5, Rst2) is rate-limiting for promoting recombination at its own DNA binding site, allowing each class of hotspot to be regulated independently by agonistic and antagonistic signals. We also discovered that the regulatory protein-DNA complexes can establish a recombinationally poised epigenetic state before meiosis. Notably, Atf1 and Pcr1 controlled the activation of DNA sequence-dependent hotspots to which they do not bind; and they do so by regulating the expression of other hotspot-activating proteins. Thus, while each transcription factor activates its own class of DNA sequence-dependent hotspots directly in cis, cross-talk between regulatory networks modulates in trans the frequency and positioning of recombination at other classes of DNA sequence-dependent hotspots. We posit that such mechanisms allow cells to alter the frequency distribution of meiotic recombination in response to metabolic states and environmental cues.",

They could be grouped into small and long TLPs with conserved thaumatin signature motif. Tightly clustered genes exhibited conserved gene and protein structure. The physicochemical analyses suggested significant differences between small and long TLPs. Evolutionary analyses suggested the role of duplication events and purifying selection in the expansion of the TLP gene family. Expression analyses revealed the possible roles of TLPs in plant development and abiotic and fungal stress response. Recombinant expression of TaTLP2-B in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provided significant tolerance against cold, heat, drought and salt stresses.

    "abstract": "Polygenic scores for educational attainment and intelligence (eduPGS), genetic ancestry, and cognitive ability have been found to be inter-correlated in some admixed American populations. We argue that this could either be due to causally-relevant genetic differences between ancestral groups or be due to population stratification-related confounding. Moreover, we argue that it is important to determine which scenario is the case so to better assess the validity of eduPGS. We investigate the confounding vs. causal concern by examining, in detail, the relation between eduPGS, ancestry, and general cognitive ability in East Coast Hispanic and non-Hispanic samples. European ancestry was correlated with g in the admixed Hispanic (r = .30, N = 506), European-African (r = .26, N = 228), and African (r = .084, N = 2,179) American samples. Among Hispanics and the combined sample, these associations were robust to controls for racial / ethnic self-identification, genetically predicted color, and parental education. Additionally, eduPGS predicted g among Hispanics (B = 0.175, N = 506) and all other groups (European: B = 0.230, N = 4914; European-African: B = 0.215, N = 228; African: B = 0.126, N = 2179) with controls for ancestry. Path analyses revealed that eduPGS, but not color, partially statistically explained the association between g and European ancestry among both Hispanics and the combined sample. Of additional note, we were unable to account for eduPGS differences between ancestral populations using common tests for ascertainment bias and confounding related to population stratification. Overall, our results suggest that eduPGS derived from European samples can be used to predict g in American populations. However, owing to the uncertain cause of the differences in eduPGS, it is not yet clear how the effect of ancestry should be handled. We argue that more research is needed to determine the source of the relation between eduPGS, genetic ancestry, and cognitive ability.",

Previous work established that biohybrid robotic jellyfish can exhibit enhanced speeds up to 2.8 times their baseline behavior in laboratory environments. However, it remains unknown if the results could be applied in natural, dynamic ocean environments and what factors can contribute to large animal variability. Deploying this system in the coastal waters of Massachusetts, we validate and extend prior laboratory work by demonstrating increases in jellyfish swimming speeds up to 2.3 times greater than their baseline, with absolute swimming speeds up to 6.6 {+/-} 0.3 cm s-1. These experimental swimming speeds are predicted using a hydrodynamic model with morphological and time-dependent input parameters obtained from field experiment videos. The theoretical model can provide a basis to choose specific jellyfish with desirable traits to maximize enhancements from robotic manipulation. With future work to increase maneuverability and incorporate sensors, biohybrid robotic jellyfish can potentially be used track environmental changes in applications for ocean monitoring.",

However, the transcription factors and gene regulatory networks underlying cellular identity in the human adult pancreas remain largely unexplored. Here, we integrate multiple single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets of the human adult pancreas, totaling 7393 cells, and comprehensively reconstruct gene regulatory networks. We show that a network of 142 transcription factors forms distinct regulatory modules that characterize pancreatic cell types. We present evidence that our approach identifies regulators of cell identity in the human adult pancreas. We predict that HEYL, BHLHE41 and JUND are active in acinar, beta and alpha cells, respectively, and show that these proteins are present in the human adult pancreas as well as in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived islet cells. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we found that JUND represses beta cell genes in hiPSC-alpha cells. Both BHLHE41 and JUND depletion seemed to increase the number of sc-enterochromaffin cells in hiPSC-derived islets. The comprehensive gene regulatory network atlas can be explored interactively online. We anticipate our analysis to be the starting point for a more sophisticated dissection of how transcription factors regulate cell identity in the human adult pancreas.

Here, we examined specific inhibition of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) expression in rats receiving a single intracerebroventricular injection of HDAC2-targeted anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) one month prior to cognitive testing. The HDAC2 ASO-injected rats displayed increased novelty preference, decreased cortical and hippocampal HDAC2 mRNA and protein, and upregulated gene expression that persisted 1-month post-injection. Cortical RNA-seq revealed strongly increased transcription of a subset of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-response element binding (CREB) genes known to influence synaptic plasticity, along with dopamine (DRD1, DRD2) and adenosine (ADORA2A) G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Our analysis identified evidence of a positive-feedback loop that amplified expression of CREB-regulated Gs GPCRs and genes in cAMP/Gs/Gi signaling pathways. Additionally, we found differential expression of enzymes that shift neurotransmitter biosynthesis away from norepinephrine and toward dopamine and acetylcholine (DBH, CHAT). We also observed increased expression of genes important for neurotransmitter packaging (SV2C, VMAT) and release (SYT9). The data indicate that persistent inhibition of HDAC2 expression enables long-lived enhancement of aspects of cognition through increased cortical transcription of a subset of CREB-regulated genes amplified by a positive-feedback mechanism that increases synaptic plasticity and shifts neurotransmitter balance toward increased dopaminergic and cholinergic signaling.",

    "abstract": "Degenerate neural circuits perform the same function despite being structurally different. However, it is unclear whether neural circuits with interacting neuromodulator sources can themselves be degenerate while maintaining the same neuromodulatory function. Here, we address this by computationally modelling the neural circuits of neuromodulators serotonin and dopamine, local glutamatergic and GABAergic interneurons, and their possible interactions, under reward/punishment-based conditioning tasks. The neural modelling is constrained by relevant experimental studies of the VTA or DRN system using e.g. electrophysiology, optogenetics, and voltammetry. We first show that a single parsimonious, sparsely connected neural circuit model can recapitulate several separate experimental findings that indicated diverse, heterogeneous, distributed and mixed DRN-VTA neuronal signalling in reward and punishment tasks. The inability for this model to recapitulate all observed neuronal signalling suggests potentially multiple circuits acting in parallel. Then using computational simulations and dynamical systems analysis, we demonstrate that several different stable circuit architectures can produce the same observed network activity profile, hence demonstrating degeneracy. Due to the extensive D2-mediated connections in the investigated circuits, we simulate D2 receptor agonist by increasing the connection strengths emanating from the VTA DA neurons. We found that the simulated D2 agonist can distinguish among sub-groups of the degenerate neural circuits based on substantial deviations in specific neural populations activities in reward and punishment conditions. This forms a testable model prediction using pharmacological means. Overall, this theoretical work suggests the plausibility of degeneracy within neuromodulator circuitry and has important implication for the stable and robust maintenance of neuromodulatory functions.",

    "abstract": "Cortical neurons are characterized by irregular firing and a broad distribution of rates. The balanced state model explains these observations with a cancellation of mean excitatory and inhibitory currents, which makes fluctuations drive firing. In networks of neurons with current-based synapses, the balanced state emerges dynamically if coupling is strong, i.e. if the mean number of synapses per neuron K is large and synaptic efficacy is of order [Formula]. When synapses are conductance-based, current fluctuations are suppressed when coupling is strong, questioning the applicability of the balanced state idea to biological neural networks. We analyze networks of strongly coupled conductance-based neurons and show that asynchronous irregular activity and broad distributions of rates emerge if synaptic efficacy is of order 1/log(K). In such networks, unlike in the standard balanced state model, current fluctuations are small and firing is maintained by a drift-diffusion balance. This balance emerges dynamically, without fine tuning, if inputs are smaller than a critical value, which depends on synaptic time constants and coupling strength, and is significantly more robust to connection heterogeneities than the classical balanced state model. Our analysis makes experimentally testable predictions of how the network response properties should evolve as input increases.",

Here, we design a deep sequential decision-making paradigm with sparse reward and abrupt environmental changes. To explain the behavior of human participants in these environments, we show that RL theories need to include surprise and novelty, each with a distinct role. While novelty drives exploration before the first encounter of a reward, surprise increases the rate of learning of a world-model as well as of model-free action-values. Even though the world-model is available for model-based RL, we find that human decisions are dominated by model-free action choices. The world-model is only marginally used for planning but is important to detect surprising events. Our theory predicts human action choices with high probability and allows us to dissociate surprise, novelty, and reward in EEG signals.",

Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed substantial phenotypic heterogeneity within and across LCLs with respect to immunoglobulin isotype; virus-modulated host pathways involved in survival, proliferation, and differentiation; viral replication state; and oxidative stress. This heterogeneity is likely attributable to intrinsic variance in primary B cells and host-pathogen dynamics.

Reversal of the bioenergetic anomalies with lipid-altering drugs, such as rosiglitazone, improved the functional capabilities of naive CD8+ T cells in elderly subjects.\n\nInterpretationInterventions that favor lipid catabolism may find utility as adjunctive therapies in the elderly to promote vaccine-induced immunity against emerging pathogens or tumors.\n\nFundingA full list of the funding sources is detailed in the Acknowledgment section of the manuscript.\n\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOld subjects are highly susceptible to infections and tumors and usually present with low responses to vaccine. This is mainly due to the age-related loss of primary immune resources, i.e. a quantitative decline of naive CD8+ T cells. Nonetheless, few studies have also underlined, within this cell subset, qualitative defects in elderly subjects.\n\nAdded value of this studyConsidering the well-demonstrated link between nutrient usage and lymphocyte functions, we characterized the bioenergetics features of old naive CD8+ T cells. Our data show an age-dependent altered basal metabolism in this cell subset, mostly at the levels of fatty acids and mitochondrial functions. These alterations were associated with functional defects which were partially reverted through the use of lipid-lowering strategies.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThis study highlights the potential role of an altered cellular lipid metabolism in immunosenescence, providing clues to understand the epidemiological profile of emerging infections or tumors and to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies based on metabolic manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Since the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in several somatic cells, little is known about the infection of SASRS-CoV-2 and its related pangolin coronavirus (GX_P2V). Here we present for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V could infect lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm cells causing these cells death, which differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V were inhibited when treated with whey protein of breastmilk and Remdesivir, confirming that these two viruses could infect lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm. Moreover, we found that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could infect endoderm and ectoderm. We found that whey protein blocked SARS-CoV-2 infecting these cells. In line with the SARS-CoV-2 results, GX_P2V could also infected endoderm and ectoderm, and also was inhibited by Remdesivir treatment. Although expressing coronavirus related receptor such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2, mesoderm cells are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection, which needed further to study the mechanisms. Interestingly, we also found that hESCs, which also express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 markers, are permissive for GX_P2V but not SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and replication, indicating the widespread cell types for GX_P2V infection. Heparin treatment blocked efficiently viral infection. These results provided insight that these stem cells maybe provided a stable repository of coronavirus function or genome. The potential consequence of SARS-CoV-2 and animal coronavirus such as GX_P2V infection in hESCs, germ layer and induced progenitors should be closely monitored.",

    "abstract": "Mountains produce distinct environmental gradients that may constrain or facilitate both the presence of avian species and/or specific combinations of functional traits. We addressed species richness and functional diversity to understand the relative importance of habitat structure and elevation in shaping avian diversity patterns in the south temperate Andes, Chile. During 2010-2018, we conducted 2,202 point-counts in four mountain habitats (successional montane forest, old-growth montane forest, subalpine, and alpine) from 211 to 1,768 m in elevation and assembled trait data associated with resource use for each species to estimate species richness and functional diversity and turnover. We detected 74 species. Alpine specialists included 16 species (22%) occurring only above treeline with a mean elevational range of 298 m, while bird communities below treeline (78%) occupied a mean elevational range of 1,081 m. Treeline was an inflection line, above which species composition changed by 91% and there was a greater turnover in functional traits (2-3 times greater than communities below treeline). Alpine birds were almost exclusively migratory, inhabiting a restricted elevational range, and breeding in rock cavities. We conclude that elevation and habitat heterogeneity structure avian trait distributions and community composition, with a diverse ecotonal sub-alpine and a distinct alpine community.",

    "abstract": "Cells are home to a wide variety of biomolecular condensates - phase-separated droplets that lack a membrane. In addition to nonspecific interactions, phase separation depends on specific binding motifs between constituent molecules. Nevertheless, few rules have been established on how these specific, heterotypic interactions drive phase separation. Using lattice-polymer simulations and mean-field theory, we show that the sequence of binding motifs strongly affects a polymers ability to phase separate, influencing both phase boundaries and condensate properties (e.g. viscosity and polymer diffusion). We find that sequences with large blocks of a single motif typically form more inter-polymer bonds which promote phase separation. Notably, the sequence of binding motifs influences phase separation primarily by determining the conformational entropy of self-bonding by single polymers. This contrasts with systems where the molecular architecture primarily affects the energy of the dense phase, providing a new entropy-based mechanism for the biological control of phase separation.",

Through an efficient self-dispersing mechanism, and the ability to induce virus-blocking properties, Wolbachia offers an unmatched potential to gradually modify wild Ae. aegypti populations turning them unsuitable disease vectors. Here in this work, a proof-of-concept field trial was carried out in a small community of Niteroi, greater Rio de Janeiro. Following the release of Wolbachia-infected eggs, we reported a successful invasion and long-term establishment of the bacterium across the territory, as denoted by stable high-infection indexes (>80%). We have also demonstrated that refractoriness to dengue and Zika viruses, either thorough oral-feeding or intra-thoracic saliva challenging assays, were maintained over the adaptation to the natural environment of Southeastern Brazil. These findings further support Wolbachias ability to invade local Ae. aegypti populations and impair disease transmission, and shall pave the way for future epidemiological and economic impact assessments.",

    "abstract": "Study questionTo which degree does maternal age affect the transcriptome of human oocytes at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage or at metaphase II after maturation in vitro (IVM-MII)?\n\nSummary answerWhile the oocytes transcriptome is predominantly determined by maturation stage, transcript levels of genes related to chromosome segregation, mitochondria and RNA processing are affected by age after in vitro maturation of denuded oocytes.\n\nWhat is known alreadyFemale fertility is inversely correlated with maternal age due to both a depletion of the oocyte pool and a reduction in oocyte developmental competence. Few studies have addressed the effect of maternal age on the human mature oocyte (MII) transcriptome, which is established during oocyte growth and maturation, and the pathways involved remain unclear. Here, we characterize and compare the transcriptomes of a large cohort of fully grown GV and IVM-MII oocytes from women of varying reproductive age.\n\nStudy design, size, durationIn this prospective molecular study, 37 women were recruited from May 2018 to June 2019. The mean age was 28.8 years (SD=7.7, range 18-43). A total of 72 oocytes were included in the study at GV stage after ovarian stimulation, and analyzed as GV (n=40) and in vitro matured oocytes (IVM-MII; n=32).\n\nParticipants/materials, setting, methodsDenuded oocytes were included either as GV at the time of ovum pick-up or as IVM-MII after in vitro maturation for 30 hours in G2 medium, and processed for transcriptomic analysis by single-cell RNA-seq using the Smart-seq2 technology. Cluster and maturation stage marker analysis were performed using the Seurat R package. Genes with an average fold change greater than 2 and a p-value < 0.01 were considered maturation stage markers. A Pearson correlation test was used to identify genes whose expression levels changed progressively with age. Those genes presenting a correlation value (R) >= |0.3| and a p-value < 0.05 were considered significant.\n\nMain results and the role of chanceFirst, by exploration of the RNA-seq data using tSNE dimensionality reduction, we identified two clusters of cells reflecting the oocyte maturation stage (GV and IVM-MII) with 4,445 and 324 putative marker genes, respectively. Next we identified genes, for which RNA levels either progressively increased or decreased with age. This analysis was performed independently for GV and IVM-MII oocytes. Our results indicate that the transcriptome is more affected by age in IVM-MII oocytes (1,219 genes) than in GV oocytes (596 genes). In particular, we found that genes involved in chromosome segregation and RNA splicing significantly increase in transcript levels with age, while genes related to mitochondrial activity present lower transcript levels with age. Gene regulatory network analysis revealed potential upstream master regulator functions for genes whose transcript levels present positive (GPBP1, RLF, SON, TTF1) or negative (BNC1, THRB) correlation with age.\n\nLimitations, reasons for cautionIVM-MII oocytes used in this study were obtained after in vitro maturation of denuded GV oocytes, therefore, their transcriptome might not be fully representative of in vivo matured MII oocytes.\n\nThe Smart-seq2 methodology used in this study detects polyadenylated transcripts only and we could therefore not assess non-polyadenylated transcripts.\n\nWider implications of the findingsOur analysis suggests that advanced maternal age does not globally affect the oocyte transcriptome at GV or IVM-MII stages. Nonetheless, hundreds of genes displayed altered transcript levels with age, particularly in IVM-MII oocytes. Especially affected by age were genes related to chromosome segregation and mitochondrial function, pathways known to be involved in oocyte ageing. Our study thereby suggests that misregulation of chromosome segregation and mitochondrial pathways also at the RNA-level might contribute to the age-related quality decline in human oocytes.\n\nStudy funding/competing interest(s)This study was funded by the AXA research fund, the European commission, intramural funding of Clinica EUGIN, the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, the Catalan Agencia de Gestio dAjuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR) and by contributions of the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MEIC) to the EMBL partnership and to the \"Centro de Excelencia Severo Ochoa\".\n\nThe authors have no conflict of interest to declare.",

    "abstract": "Inbreeding depression is a central parameter underlying mating system variation in nature and one that can be altered by environmental stress. Although a variety of systems show that inbreeding depression tends to increase under stressful conditions, we have very little understanding across most organisms how the level of inbreeding depression may change as a result of adaptation to stressors. In this work we examined the potential that inbreeding depression varied among lineages of Ipomoea purpurea artificially evolved to exhibit divergent levels of herbicide resistance. We examined inbreeding depression in a variety of fitness-related traits in both the growth chamber and in the field. We paired our examination of inbreeding depression in fitness-related traits with an examination of gene expression changes associated with the level of herbicide resistance, breeding history (inbred or outcrossed), and the interaction of the breeding system and the level of herbicide resistance. We found that, while inbreeding depression was present across many of the traits, lineages artificially selected for increased herbicide resistance often showed no evidence of inbreeding depression in the presence of herbicide, and in fact, showed evidence of outbreeding depression in some traits compared to non-selected control lines and lineages selected for increased herbicide susceptibility. Further, at the transcriptome level, the resistant selection lines had differing patterns of gene expression according to breeding type (inbred vs outcrossed) compared to the control and susceptible selection lines. Our data together indicate that inbreeding depression may be lessened in populations that are adapting to regimes of strong selection.",

    "abstract": "O_LIDespite the importance of gene function to evolutionary biology, the applicability of comparative methods to gene function is poorly known. A specific case which has crystalized methodological questions is the \"ortholog conjecture\", the hypothesis that function evolves faster after duplication (i.e., in paralogs), and conversely is conserved between orthologs. Since the mode of functional evolution after duplication is not well known, we investigate under which reasonable evolutionary scenarios phylogenetic independent contrasts or pairwise comparisons can recover a putative signal of different functional evolution between orthologs and paralogs.\nC_LIO_LIWe investigate three different simulation models, which represent reasonable but simplified hypotheses about the evolution of a gene function trait. These are time dependent trait acceleration, correlated changes in rates of both sequence and trait evolution, and asymmetric trait jump. For each model we tested phylogenetic independent contrasts and an improved pairwise comparison method which accounts for interactions between events and node age.\nC_LIO_LIBoth approaches lose power to detect the trend of functional evolution when the functional trait accelerates for a long time following duplication for trees with many duplications, with better power of phylogenetic contrasts under intermediate scenarios. Concomitant increase in evolutionary rates of sequence and of trait after duplication can lead to both an incorrect rejection of the null under null simulations of trait evolution, and a false rejection of the ortholog conjecture under ortholog conjecture simulations, by phylogenetic independent contrasts. Improved pairwise comparisons are robust to this bias. Both approaches perform equally well under rapid shifts in traits.\nC_LIO_LIConsidering our ignorance of gene function evolution, and the potential for bias under simple models, we recommend methodological pluralism in studying gene family evolution. Functional phylogenomics is complex and results supported by only one method should be treated with caution.\nC_LI",

Using a structure-based drug discovery approach, we identified a METTL3 inhibitor (UZH1a) with potency in a biochemical assay of 280 nM, while its enantiomer UZH1b is 100 times less active. The crystal structure of the complex of METTL3 with UZH1a illustrates the interactions that make it selective against protein methyltransferases. We observed a dose-dependent reduction in m6A methylation level of mRNA in several cell lines treated with UZH1a already after 16 h of exposure, as determined by triple-quadrupole LC mass spectrometry, while its enantiomer UZH1b was essentially inactive at concentrations up to 100 {micro}M. Interestingly, the kinetics of m6A level reduction in mRNAs followed a first-order reaction model, with a half-decay time {tau} of 1.8 h and a maximum m6A inhibition level of 70%, which is in line with the previously observed shorter half-life of m6A-modified mRNAs. Notably, treatment with the compounds did not alter cellular METTL3 levels, ruling out indirect effects on m6A levels. The effect of the m6A level depletion by UZH1a directly translated into growth inhibition of MOLM-13 leukemia cells, under short-term and long-term culture. Incubation of the MOLM-13 cells with UZH1a, but not with UZH1b, resulted in increased cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest already after 16 h of incubation. Interestingly, other cell lines sensitive to METTL3 level (U2Os, HEK293T) did not reveal statistically significant differences between UZH1a and UZH1b in a cell viability assay, confirming that the degree of reliance on m6A signalling for survival can vary between cancers/cell types.",

    "abstract": "Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is an important cofactor for amino acid decarboxylases with many biological functions, including the synthesis of signalling molecules, such as serotonin, dopamine, histamine,{gamma} -aminobutyric acid, and taurine. Taurine is an abundant amino acid with multiple physiological functions, including osmoregulation, pH regulation, antioxidative protection, and neuromodulation. In mammalian tissues, taurine is mainly produced by decarboxylation of cysteine sulphinic acid to hypotaurine, catalysed by the PLP-dependent cysteine sulphinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD), followed by non-enzymatic oxidation of the product to taurine. We determined the crystal structure of mouse CSAD and compared it to other PLP-dependent decarboxylases in order to identify determinants of substrate specificity and catalytic activity. Recognition of the substrate involves distinct side chains forming the substrate-binding cavity. In addition, the backbone conformation of a buried active-site loop appears to be a critical determinant for substrate side chain binding in PLP-dependent decarboxylases. Phe94 was predicted to affect substrate specificity, and its mutation to serine altered both the catalytic properties of CSAD and its stability. Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we further showed that similarly to its closest homologue, GADL1, CSAD presents open/close motions in solution. The structure of apo-CSAD indicates that the active site gets more ordered upon internal aldimine formation. Taken together, the results highlight details of substrate recognition in PLP-dependent decarboxylases and provide starting points for structure-based inhibitor design with the aim of affecting the biosynthesis of taurine and other abundant amino acid metabolites.",

To address this, rapid and genetically tractable animal models are needed that recapitulate the heterogeneity of RAS-driven cancers in vivo.

We show that low-level expression of oncogenic Ras (RasLo) promotes the survival of Lkb1 mutant tissue, but results in autonomous cell cycle arrest and non-autonomous overgrowth of wild-type tissue. In contrast, high-level expression of oncogenic Ras (RasHi) transforms Lkb1 mutant tissue resulting in lethal malignant tumors. Using simultaneous multiview light-sheet microcopy, we have characterized invasion phenotypes of Ras/Lkb1 tumors in living larvae. Our molecular analysis reveals sustained activation of the AMPK pathway in malignant Ras/Lkb1 tumors, and demonstrate the genetic and pharmacologic dependence of these tumors on CaMK-activated Ampk. We further show that LKB1 mutant human lung adenocarcinoma patients with high levels of oncogenic KRAS exhibit worse overall survival and increased AMPK activation. Our results suggest that high levels of oncogenic KRAS is a driving event in the malignant transformation of LKB1 mutant tissue, and uncover a novel vulnerability that may be used to target this aggressive genetic subset of RAS-driven tumors.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA multivariable Ras-driven Drosophila model reveals a novel LKB1 mutant lung adenocarcinoma patient subpopulation and targetable effector pathway.",

    "abstract": "Despite the connection to distinct mucus-containing colorectal cancer (CRC) histological subtypes, the role of secretory cells, including goblet and enteroendocrine (EEC) cells, in CRC progression has been underexplored. Analysis of TCGA and single cell RNA sequencing data demonstrates that multiple secretory progenitor populations are enriched in BRAF-mutant CRC patient tumors and cell lines. Enrichment of EEC progenitors in BRAF-mutant CRC is maintained by DNA methylation and silencing of NEUROD1, a key gene required for differentiation of EECs. Mechanistically, secretory cells and the factors they secrete, such as Trefoil factor 3, are shown to promote colony formation and activation of cell survival pathways in the entire cell population. We further identify LSD1 as a critical regulator of secretory cell specification in vitro and in a colon orthotopic xenograft model, where LSD1 loss reduces tumor growth and metastasis. This work establishes EEC progenitors, in addition to goblet cells, as targetable populations in BRAF-mutant CRC and identifies LSD1 as a therapeutic target in secretory lineage-containing CRC.",

    "abstract": "Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) isolated from HIV-infected individuals delineate vulnerable sites on the HIV envelope glycoprotein that are potential vaccine targets. A linear epitope at the N-terminal region of the HIV-1 fusion peptide (FP8) is the primary target of VRC34.01, a bnAb that neutralizes ~50% of primary HIV isolates. FP8 has attracted attention as a potential HIV vaccine target because it is a simple linear epitope. Here, we used platform technologies based on RNA bacteriophage virus-like particles (VLPs) to develop multivalent vaccines targeting the FP8 epitope. We produced recombinant MS2 VLPs displaying the FP8 peptide and we chemically conjugated synthetic FP8 peptides to Q{beta} VLPs. Both recombinant and conjugated FP8-VLPs induced high titers of FP8-specific antibodies in mice. A heterologous prime-boost-boost regimen employing the two FP8-VLP vaccines and native envelope trimer was the most effective approach for eliciting HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies. Given the potent immunogenicity of VLP-based vaccines, this vaccination strategy - inspired by bnAb-guided epitope mapping, VLP bioengineering, and optimal prime-boost immunization strategies - may be an effective strategy for eliciting bnAb responses against HIV.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 has high mutation rates and exists as mutant swarms in the host. Rapid evolution of HIV-1 allows the virus to outpace host immune system, leading to viral persistence. Novel approaches to target immutable components are needed to clear HIV-1 infection. Here we report a pattern-recognition receptor CARD8 that senses enzymatic activity of the HIV-1 protease, which is indispensable for the virus. All subtypes of HIV-1 can be sensed by CARD8 despite substantial viral diversity. HIV-1 evades CARD8 sensing because the viral protease remains inactive in infected cells prior to viral budding. Induction of premature intracellular activation of the viral protease triggers CARD8 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis of HIV-1-infected cells. This strategy leads to clearance of latent HIV-1 in patient CD4+ T cells after virus reactivation. Taken together, our study identifies CARD8 as an inflammasome sensor of HIV-1 that holds promise as a strategy for clearance of persistent HIV-1 infection.",

Furthermore, a predictive model was developed, based on random forest analyses, to discriminate between microbial patterns in order to identify the geographical source of the samples with reasonable precision.

    "abstract": "Phosphoinositides (PIs) are important signaling molecules and determinants of membrane identity in the eukaryotic plasma membrane, where they multi-task in divergent signaling pathways. Signaling pleiotropy likely depends on distinct PI pools in the same membrane, although the physical definition of such pools has remained ambiguous. PI(4,5)P2, specifically, is also the precursor for the second messengers in the Gq/PLC pathway, IP3 and DAG, and is broken down by PLC{beta} during signaling. Endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane contact sites (ER-PM junctions) have emerged as central hubs for lipid transport between both membranes, and specifically for PI homeostasis by supplying the PM with phosphatidylinositol.\n\nHere we show that the tubby protein, by virtue of its C-terminal tubby-domain, preferentially localizes to ER-PM junctions by binding to both PI(4,5)P2 and the ER-PM tether E-Syt3. Under conditions of vigorous PI(4,5)P2 consumption by PLC{beta}, additional recruitment of tubby revealed an increase of a local PI(4,5)P2 pool fed by local synthesis through PI kinases. Inhibition of this pool-filling process led to the release of the ER-PM tethers, E-Syts, from the membrane and hence to loss of integrity of the ER-PM contact sites.\n\nWe conclude that spatiotemporal metabolic channeling of PI synthesis initiated by non-vesicular transport in the ER-PM junctions specifies a local pool of PI(4,5)P2 that is pivotal for the maintenance of homeostatic functions during global depletion of PI(4,5)P2. The findings further suggest that the tubby-like proteins (TULPs), so far known to impact on energy homeostasis and obesity through primary cilia signaling, have an additional function at ER-PM junctions.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe tubby domain preferentially assembles into ER-PM junctions due to coincidence detection of PI(4,5)P2 and E-Syt3\nC_LIO_LITubby recruitment reveals an increase of a local pool of PI(4,5)P2 in ER-PM junctions during PLC{beta} signaling\nC_LIO_LIJunctional PI(4,5)P2 dynamics require local synthesis of PI(4,5)P2\nC_LIO_LILocal PI(4,5)P2 supply is required for integrity of ER-PM junctions during PLC{beta} activity.\nC_LI",

We show that lamin A in the nuclear interior is formed from newly expressed pre-lamin A during processing and from soluble mitotic mature lamins in a LAP2-independent manner. Binding of LAP2 to lamins A/C in the nuclear interior during interphase inhibits formation of higher order structures of lamin A/C in vitro and in vivo, keeping lamin A/C in a mobile low assembly state independent of lamin A/C S22 phosphorylation. Loss of LAP2 causes formation of larger, less mobile and biochemically stable lamin A/C structures in the nuclear interior, which reduce the mobility of chromatin. We propose that LAP2 is essential to maintain a mobile lamin A/C pool in the nuclear interior, which is required for proper nuclear functions.",

However, it is still poorly understood how animals can cope with and adapt to these rapid and dramatic transformations of natural environments. The COVID-19 pandemic provides us with a unique opportunity to unveil the mechanisms involved in this process. Lockdown measures imposed in most countries are causing an unprecedented reduction of human activities giving us an experimental setting to assess the effects of our lifestyle on biodiversity. We studied the birds response to the population lockdown by using more than 126,000 bird records collected by a citizen science project in north eastern Spain. We compared the occurrence and detectability of birds during the spring 2020 lockdown with baseline data from previous years in the same urban areas and dates. We found that birds did not increase their probability of occurrence in urban areas during the lockdown, refuting the hypothesis that nature has recovered its space in human emptied urban areas. However, we found an increase in bird detectability, especially during early morning, suggesting a rapid change in the birds daily routines in response to quieter and less crowded cities. In conclusion, urban birds showed high behavioural plasticity to rapidly adjust to novel environmental conditions, as those imposed by the COVID-19.",

Here, we use the evolution of herbicide resistance in the common morning glory (Ipomoea purpurea) as a model for understanding the relative importance of adaptive and maladaptive gene expression responses to herbicide. Specifically, we compare leaf gene expression changes caused by herbicide to the expression changes that evolve in response to artificial selection for herbicide resistance. We identify a number of genes that show plastic and evolved responses to herbicide and find that for the majority of genes with both plastic and evolved responses, plastic responses appear to be adaptive. We also find that selection for herbicide response increases gene expression plasticity. Overall, these results show the importance of adaptive plasticity for herbicide resistance in a common weed and that expression changes in response to strong environmental change can be adaptive.\n\nImpact statementPredicting whether and how organisms will adapt to environmental change is a crucial goal. However, this goal can be complicated because environmental change can alter traits, in a process called plasticity. The extent and fitness consequences of plasticity will have important effects on the adaptive process. In this study, we use adaptation to herbicide in the agricultural weed, the common morning glory, as a model for understanding the extent and fitness consequences of plasticity in gene expression. We find evidence that gene expression plasticity is adaptive in the presence of herbicide, suggesting that understanding plasticity is crucial for understanding how organisms adapt to new environments.",

Suprachoroidal injection of AAV8 using transscleral microneedles enables widespread transgene expression in eyes of nonhuman primates, but may cause intraocular inflammation. We characterized the host humoral and cellular immune responses after suprachoroidal delivery of AAV8 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in rhesus macaques, and found that it can induce a mild chorioretinitis that resolves after systemic corticosteroid administration, with recovery of photoreceptor morphology but persistent immune cell infiltration after 3 months. Suprachoroidal AAV8 triggered B-cell and T-cell responses against GFP, but only mild antibody responses to the viral capsid as compared to intravitreal injections of the same vector and dose. Systemic biodistribution studies showed lower AAV8 levels in liver and spleen after suprachoroidal injection compared with intravitreal delivery. Our findings suggest that suprachoroidal AAV8 primarily triggers host immune responses to GFP, likely due to sustained transgene expression in scleral fibroblasts outside the blood-retinal barrier, but elicits less humoral immune reactivity to the viral capsid than intravitreal delivery due to lower egress into systemic circulation. Thus, suprachoroidal AAV delivery of human transgenes may have significant translational potential for retinal gene therapy.",

Our estimator uses alternating minimization, which enables us to have a computationally-efficient method, prove the identifiability conditions and consistency of our method, and provide statistically-principled procedures to tune our method. All these qualities help advance the single-cell embedding literature, and we provide extensive simulations to demonstrate that the eSVD is competitive compared to other embedding methods.\n\nWe apply the eSVD via Gaussian distributions where the standard deviations are proportional to the means to analyze a single-cell dataset of oligodendrocytes in mouse brains (Marques et al., 2016). Using the eSVD estimated embedding, we then investigate the cell developmental trajectories of the oligodendrocytes. While previous results are not able to distinguish the trajectories among the mature oligodendrocyte cell types, our diagnostics and results demonstrate there are two major developmental trajectories that diverge at mature oligodendrocytes.",

While extensive genomic tools are available for C. gigas, highly contiguous reference genomes are required to support both fundamental and applied research. In the current study, high coverage long and short read sequence data generated on Pacific Biosciences and Illumina platforms from a single female individual specimen was used to generate an initial assembly, which was then scaffolded into 10 pseudo chromosomes using both Hi-C sequencing and a high density SNP linkage map. The final assembly has a scaffold N50 of 58.4 Mb and a contig N50 of 1.8 Mb, representing a step advance on the previously published C. gigas assembly. The new assembly was annotated using Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-Seq data, identifying 30K putative protein coding genes, with an average of 3.9 transcripts per gene. Annotation of putative repeat elements highlighted an inverse relationship with gene density, and identified putative centromeres of the metacentric chromosomes. An enrichment of Helitron rolling circle transponsable elements was observed, suggesting their potential role in shaping the evolution of the C. gigas genome.

    "abstract": "Sarcomeres, the basic contractile units of striated muscle cells, contain arrays of thin (actin) and thick (myosin) filaments that slide past each other during contraction. The Ig-like domain containing protein myotilin provides structural integrity to Z-discs - the boundaries between adjacent sarcomeres. Myotilin binds to Z-disc components, including F-actin and -actinin-2, but the molecular mechanism of binding and implications of these interactions on Z-disc integrity are still elusive. We used a combination of small angle X-ray scattering, cross-linking mass spectrometry, biochemical and molecular biophysics approaches. We discovered that myotilin displays conformational ensembles in solution. We generated a structural model of the F-actin:myotilin complex that revealed how myotilin interacts with and stabilizes F-actin via its Ig-like domains and flanking regions. Mutant myotilin designed with impaired F-actin binding showed increased dynamics in cells. Structural analyses and competition assays uncovered that myotilin displaces tropomyosin from F-actin. Our findings suggest a novel role of myotilin as a co-organizer of Z-disc assembly and advance our mechanistic understanding of myotilins structural role in Z-discs.\n\nSignificance StatementSarcomeres are the primary structural and functional unit of striated muscles, conferring movement in all animals. The Z-disk is the boundary between adjacent sarcomeres, where actin filaments (F-actin) are anchored. Z-disc protein myotilin, is a scaffold protein, which provides structural integrity to the Z-disc by multiple interactions to its central components, including F-actin and -actinin-2. Here we provide the structure of myotilin, revealing its structural plasticity in solution and the first integrative structural model of its complex with F-actin. We further show that myotilin displaces tropomyosin from F-actin, implying a novel role of myotilin in sarcomere biogenesis beyond being an interaction hub for Z-disk partners.\n\nHighlights Myotilin is structurally described as a dynamic ensemble\nFlanking regions enhance F-acting binding to tandem Ig domains\nIntegrative structural model of myotilin bound to F-actin\nMyotilin displaces tropomyosin from F-actin, suggesting an organisational role in Z-disc",

    "abstract": "To reduce the reproductive loss caused by semen quality and provide theoretical guidance for the eradication of human male infertility, differential analysis of the bovine transcriptome among round spermatids, elongated spermatids, and epididymal sperm was carried out with the reference of the mouse transcriptome, and the homology trends of gene expression to the mouse were also analysed. First, to explore the physiological mechanism of spermiogenesis that profoundly affects semen quality, homological trends of differential genes were compared during spermiogenesis in dairy cattle and mice. Next, the Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, protein-protein interaction network (PPI network), and bioinformatics analysis uncovered the regulation network of acrosome formation during the transition from round to elongated spermatids. In addition, processes that regulate gene expression during spermiogenesis from elongated spermatid to epididymal sperm, such as ubiquitination, acetylation, deacetylation, glycosylation, and the functional gene ART3 may play an important role during spermiogenesis. Therefore, its localisation in the seminiferous tubule was investigated by immunofluorescent analysis, and its structure and function were also predicted. This study provides important data for revealing the mystery of life during spermiogenesis resulting from acrosome formation, histone replacement, and the fine regulation of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Photochromic fluorescent proteins have become versatile tools in the life sciences, though our understanding of their structure-function relation is limited. Starting from a single scaffold, we have developed a range of 27 photochromic fluorescent proteins that cover a broad range of spectroscopic properties, yet differ only in one or two mutations. We also determined 43 different crystal structures of these mutants. Correlation and principal component analysis of the spectroscopic and structural properties confirmed the complex relationship between structure and spectroscopy, suggesting that the observed variability does not arise from a limited number of mechanisms, but also allowed us to identify consistent trends and to relate these to the spatial organization around the chromophore. We find that particular changes in spectroscopic properties can come about through multiple different underlying mechanisms, of which the polarity of the chromophore environment and hydrogen bonding of the chromophore are key modulators. Furthermore, some spectroscopic parameters, such as the photochromism, appear to be largely determined by a single or a few structural properties, while other parameters, such as the absorption maximum, do not allow a clear identification of a single cause. We also highlight the role of water molecules close to the chromophore in influencing photochromism. We anticipate that our dataset can open opportunities for the development and evaluation of new and existing protein engineering methods.",

    "abstract": "Nanopore sensing is nearly synonymous with resistive pulse sensing due to the characteristic reduction of ionic flux during molecular occupancy of a pore, particularly at high salt concentrations. However, conductive pulses are widely reported at low salt conditions wherein electroosmotic flow can be quite significant. Aside from transporting molecules like DNA, we investigated whether electroosmotic flow has other potential impacts on sensing attributes such current enhancements due to the analyte molecule. The overwhelming majority of literature reports counterions as the dominant mechanism of conductive events (a moleculecentric theory for conductive events). Conductive events are not well understood due to the complex interplay between (charged) nanopore walls, DNA grooves, ion mobility, and counterion clouds. Yet, the prevailing consensus of counterions being introduced into the pore by the molecule does not fit well with a growing number of experiments including the fact that proteins can generate conductive events despite having a heterogeneous surface charge. Herein, we demonstrate theory and experiments underpinning the translocation mechanism (i.e., electroosmosis or electrophoresis), pulse direction (i.e., conductive or resistive) and shape (e.g., monophasic or biphasic) through fine control of chemical, physical, and electronic parameters. Results from these studies predict strong electroosmosis plays a role in driving DNA events and generating conductive events due to polarization effects (i.e. a pore-centric theory). We believe these findings will stimulate a useful discussion on the nature of conductive events and their impact on molecular sensing in nanoscale pores.",

    "abstract": "The homologous E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF43/ZNRF3 negatively regulate WNT signalling activation. Recently, both genes have been found mutated in several types of cancers. Specifically, loss-of-function mutations result in adenoma formation in mouse small intestine. However, their role in liver cancer has not been explored yet. Here we describe that hepatocyte-specific deletion of both Rnf43/Znrf3 results in altered lipid metabolism and a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) phenotype in mouse, in the absence of exogenous fat supplementation. The effect is cell-autonomous, as evidenced by the intracellular lipid accumulation detected in mutant liver organoids. Upon chronic liver damage, Rnf43/Znrf3 deletion results in impaired hepatocyte regeneration, subsequent to an imbalance between hepatocyte differentiation and proliferation, which leads to hepatocellular carcinoma. Remarkably, hepatocellular carcinoma patients with mutations in ZNRF3 also present altered lipid metabolism and poorer survival. Our findings imply that Wnt activation through the RNF43/ZNRF3 module predisposes to liver cancer by altering the liver lipid metabolic ground-state and impairing liver regeneration, which combined, facilitate the progression towards malignancy. Our results highlight the requirement for personalized therapeutic or dietary interventions for those RNF43/ZNRF3 mutated individuals at risk of developing steatosis, NASH and/or liver cancer.",

    "abstract": "Phytoplasmas inhabit phloem sieve elements and cause abnormal growth and altered sugar partitioning. But how they interact with phloem functions is not clearly known. The phloem responses were investigated in tomato infected by  Candidatus Phytoplasma solani, at the beginning of the symptomatic stage of infection, both in symptomatic and asymptomatic leaves, the first symptoms appearing in the sink top leaf at the stem apex. Antisense lines impaired in the phloem sucrose transporters SUT1 and SUT2 were included. The infection in source leaves was not associated with symptoms. In the symptomatic, sink leaf, yellowing and leaf curling was associated with higher starch accumulation and expression of defense genes. The transcriptional analysis of symptomatic leaf midribs indicated that transcript levels for genes acting in the glycolysis and peroxisome metabolism in infected plants differed from these in non-infected plants. Phytoplasma multiplied actively in at least three additional lower leaves although they were symptomless, with no sign of activation of defense markers, although the rate of exudation of sucrose from these symptomless, source leaves was lower for infected plants. A few metabolites in phloem-enriched exudate were affected by the infection, such as glycolate and aspartate, and some of them were also affected in the control SUT1- and SUT2- antisense lines, in which sucrose retrieval or release in the sieve elements are impaired. A metabolic switch could explain the delivery of more glycolate into the sieve elements of infected plants. The findings suggest a link between sugar transport and redox homeostasis.\n\nOne sentence summaryAn impairment of sucrose retrieval and release in the sieve elements occurs during phytoplasma infection, associated with changes in sugar and peroxisome metabolism",

    "abstract": "Common approaches to studying chronic pain in pre-clinical animal models paradoxically involve measuring reflexive withdrawal responses that are more indicative of acute nociceptive pain. These methods typically do not capture the ongoing nature of chronic pain nor report on behavioral changes associated with pain. In addition, data collection and analysis protocols are often labour-intensive and require direct investigator interactions, potentially introducing bias. In this study, we develop and characterize a low-cost, easily assembled behavioral assay that yields self-reported temperature preference from mice which is sensitive to peripheral sensitization protocols. This system uses a partially automated and freely available analysis pipeline to streamline the data collection process and enable objective analysis. We found that after intraplantar administration of the TrpV1 agonist, capsaicin, mice preferred to stay in cooler temperatures than control injected mice. We further observed that gabapentin, a non-opioid analgesic commonly prescribed to treat chronic pain, reversed this aversion to higher temperatures. We further observed that optogenetic activation of the central terminals of TrpV1+ primary afferents via in vivo spinal light delivery did not induce a similar change in thermal preference, indicating a role for peripheral nociceptor activity in the modulation of temperature preference. We conclude that this easily produced and robust sensory assay provides an alternative approach to investigate the contribution of central and peripheral mechanisms to pathological sensory processing that does not rely on reflexive responses evoked by noxious stimuli.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas systems are functionally diverse prokaryotic anti-viral defense systems, which encompass six distinct types (I-VI) that each encode different effector Cas nucleases with distinct nucleic acid cleavage specificities. By harnessing the unique attributes of the various CRISPR-Cas systems, a range of innovative CRISPR-based DNA and RNA targeting tools and technologies have been developed. Here, we exploit the ability of type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems to carry out RNA-guided and sequence-specific target RNA cleavage for establishment of research tools for post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Type III-A systems from three bacterial species (L. lactis, S. epidermidis and S. thermophilus) were each expressed on a single plasmid in E. coli and the efficiency and specificity of gene knockdown was assessed by Northern blot analysis. We show that engineered type III-A modules can be programmed using tailored CRISPR RNAs to efficiently knock down gene expression of both coding and non-coding RNAs in vivo. Moreover, simultaneous degradation of multiple cellular mRNA transcripts can be directed by utilizing a CRISPR array expressing corresponding gene-targeting crRNAs. Our results demonstrate the utility of distinct type III-A modules to serve as effective gene knockdown platforms in heterologous cells. This transcriptome engineering technology has the potential to be further refined and exploited for key applications including gene discovery and gene pathway analyses in additional prokaryotic and perhaps eukaryotic cells and organisms.",

    "abstract": "Although combination antiretoviral therapies seem to be effective at controlling HIV-1 infections regardless of the viral subtype, there is increasing evidence for subtype-specific drug resistance mutations. The order and rates at which resistance mutations accumulate in different subtypes also remain poorly understood. Here, we present a methodology for the comparison of mutational pathways in different HIV-1 subtypes, based on Hidden Conjunctive Bayesian Networks (H-CBN), a probabilistic model for inferring mutational pathways from cross-sectional genotype data. We introduce a Monte Carlo sampling scheme for learning H-CBN models on a large number of resistance mutations and develop a statistical test to assess differences in the inferred mutational pathways between two groups. We apply this method to the temporal progression of mutations conferring resistance to the protease inhibitor lopinavir in a large cross-sectional data set of South African individuals living with HIV-1 subtype C, as well as a genotype data set of subtype B infections derived from the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database and the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. We find strong support for different initial mutational events in the protease, namely at residue 46 in subtype B and at residue 82 in subtype C. Our results also show that mutations can accumulate along various alternative paths within subtypes, as opposed to a unique total temporal ordering. Furthermore, the maximum likelihood mutational networks for subtypes B and C share only 7 edges (Jaccard distance 0.802) and imply many different evolutionary pathways. Beyond HIV drug resistance, the statistical methodology is applicable more generally for the comparison of inferred mutational pathways between any two groups.\n\nAuthor summaryThere is a disparity in the distribution of infections by HIV-1 subtype in the world. Subtype B is predominant in America, Western Europe and Australia, and most therapeutic strategies are based on research and clinical studies on this subtype. However, non-B subtypes represent the majority of global HIV-1 infections; e.g., subtype C alone accounts for nearly half of all HIV-1 infections. We present a statistical framework enabling the comparison of patterns of accumulating mutations in different HIV-1 subtypes. Specifically, we study lopinavir resistance pathways in HIV-1 subtypes B versus C, but the methodology can be generally applied to compare the temporal ordering of genetic events in different subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Overlapping genes (OLGs) with long protein-coding overlapping sequences are often excluded by genome annotation programs, with the exception of virus genomes. A recent study used a novel algorithm to construct OLGs from arbitrary protein domain pairs and concluded that virus genes are best suited for creating OLGs, a result which fitted with common assumptions. However, improving sequence evaluation using Hidden Markov Models shows that the previous result is an artifact originating from dataset-database biases. When parameters for OLG design and evaluation are optimized we find that 94.5% of the constructed OLG pairs score at least as highly as naturally occurring sequences, while 9.6% of the artificial OLGs cannot be distinguished from typical sequences in their protein family. Constructed OLG sequences are also indistinguishable from natural sequences in terms of amino acid identity and secondary structure, while the minimum nucleotide change required for overprinting an overlapping sequence can be as low as 1.8% of the sequence. Separate analysis of datasets containing only sequences from either archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes or viruses showed that, surprisingly, virus genes are much less suitable for designing OLGs than bacterial or eukaryotic genes. An important factor influencing OLG design is the structure of the standard genetic code. Success rates in different reading frames strongly correlate with their code-determined respective amino acid constraints. There is a tendency indicating that the structure of the standard genetic code could be optimized in its ability to create OLGs while conserving mutational robustness. The findings reported here add to the growing evidence that OLGs should no longer be excluded in prokaryotic genome annotations. Determining the factors facilitating the computational design of artificial overlapping genes may improve our understanding of the origin of these remarkable genetic constructs and may also open up exciting possibilities for synthetic biology.",

The objective of this study is to understand the significance of DDX5 downregulation during HBV infection and poor prognosis HCC, as it pertains to therapy of chronically HBV-infected patients with HCC. IFN- therapy is effective only for a subgroup of HBV-infected patients, for reasons not understood. Herein, we investigated a novel mechanism of STAT1 translational control, involving DDX5-mediated resolution of a G-quadruplex structure, located at the 5UTR of STAT1 mRNA, enabling STAT1 translation.\n\nDesign and ResultsMolecular, pharmacologic, and biophysical assays were used together with cellular model of HBV replication, HCC cell lines, and HBV-related liver tumors. We observed, the protein level of DDX5 correlated with that of transcription factor STAT1. We show, DDX5 regulates STAT1 mRNA translation by resolving a G-quadruplex (rG4) RNA structure, proximal to the 5 end of STAT1 5UTR. We employed luciferase reporter assays comparing wild type (WT) vs. mutant (MT) rG4 sequence, rG4-stabilizing compounds, CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the rG4 sequence, and circular dichroism determination of rG4 structure. Ribonucleoprotein assays identified direct DDX5 binding to WT but not MT rG4. Importantly, liver cancer cell lines expressing low DDX5 exhibited reduced interferon response, while immunohistochemistry of HBV-related HCCs exhibiting absence of DDX5, also lacked STAT1.\n\nConclusionDDX5 resolves a G-quadruplex structure in 5UTR of STAT1 mRNA, enabling STAT1 translation. DDX5 is a key regulator of the dynamic range of interferon response during innate immunity and adjuvant IFN- therapy.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid hormones are important modulators of metabolic activity in mammals and alter cholesterol and fatty acid levels through activation of the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (THR). Currently, there are several THR{beta} agonists in clinical trials for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that have demonstrated the potential to reduce liver fat and restore liver function. In this study, we tested three THR{beta}-agonism-based NASH treatment candidates, GC-1 (sobetirome), MGL-3196 (resmetirom), and VK2809, and compared their selectivity for THR{beta} and their ability to modulate the expression of genes specific to cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism in vitro using human hepatic cells and in vivo using a rat model. Treatment with GC-1 upregulated the transcription of CPT1A in the human hepatocyte-derived Huh-7 cell line with a dose-response comparable to that of the native THR ligand, triiodothyronine (T3). VK2809A (active parent of VK2809), MGL-3196, and VK2809 were approximately 30-fold, 1,000-fold, and 2,000-fold less potent than T3, respectively. Additionally, these relative potencies were confirmed by quantification of other direct gene targets of THR, namely, ANGPTL4 and DIO1. In primary human hepatocytes, potencies were conserved for every compound except for VK2809, which showed significantly increased potency that was comparable to that of its active counterpart, VK2809A. In high-fat diet fed rats, a single dose of T3 significantly reduced total cholesterol levels and concurrently increased liver Dio1 and Me1 RNA expression. MGL-3196 treatment resulted in concentration-dependent decreases in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with corresponding increases in liver gene expression, but the compound was significantly less potent than T3. In conclusion, we have implemented a strategy to rank the efficacy of THR{beta} agonists by quantifying changes in the transcription of genes that lead to metabolic alterations, an effect that is directly downstream of THR binding and activation.",

    "abstract": "Brice et al. (2019) presented data from the first epoch of a longitudinal study of the neurobiological underpinnings of first-language (L1) and second-language (L2) processing. Results showed a similar network of activation for reading across L1 and L2, as well as significant convergence of print and speech processing across a network of left-hemisphere regions in both L1 and L2 with greater activation and convergence for L2 in anterior regions, and greater activation and convergence for L1 in posterior regions of the reading network. Here, we present the first look at longitudinal changes in these effects. L2 showed relatively few changes in activation, with some shifts in the weighting between ventral and dorsal processing. L1, however, showed more widespread differences in processing, suggesting that the neurobiological footprint of reading is dynamic, with both L1 and L2 impacting each other. Print/speech convergence showed very little longitudinal change, suggesting that it is a stable marker of the differences in L1 and L2 processing.",

    "abstract": "In insects, Adipokinetic hormone is the primary hormone responsible for the mobilization of stored energy. While a growing body of evidence has solidified AKHs role in modulating the physiological and behavioral responses to metabolic stress, little is known about the upstream endocrine circuit that directly regulates AKH release. We evaluated the AKH-expressing cell transcriptome to identify potential regulatory elements controlling AKH cell activity, and found that a number of receptors show consistent expression levels, including all known dopamine receptors, dopamine ecdysone receptor (DopEcR), Dopamine 2-like receptor (D2R), Dopamine 1-like receptor 2 (DopR2), DopR, and the Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDFR). We tested the consequences of targeted genetic knockdown and found that RNAi elements targeting each dopamine receptor caused a significant reduction in survival under starvation. In contrast, PDFR knockdown significantly extended lifespan under starvation whereas expression of a tethered PDF in AKH cells resulted in a significantly shorter lifespan during starvation. These manipulations also caused various changes in locomotor activity under starvation. Specifically, there were higher amounts of locomotor activity in dopamine receptor knockdowns, in both replete and starved states. PDFR knockdown resulted in increased locomotion during replete conditions and locomotion levels that were comparable to wild-type during starvation. Expression of a membrane-tethered PDF led to decreased locomotion under baseline and starvation. Next, we used live-cell imaging to evaluate the acute effects of the ligands for these receptors (dopamine, ecdysone, and Pigment Dispersing Factor) on AKH cell activation. Dopamine application led to a transient increase in intracellular calcium in a sugar-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that co-application of dopamine and ecdysone led to a complete loss of this response, suggesting that these two hormones are acting antagonistically. We also found that PDF application directly led to an increase in cAMP in AKH cells, and that this response was dependent on expression of the PDFR in AKH cells. Together these results suggest a complex circuit in which multiple hormones act on AKH cells to modulate metabolic state.",

    "abstract": "Microbial contamination of hospital environment plays an important role in the spread of health care-associated infections (HCAIs). This study was conducted to determine bacterial contamination, bacterial profiles and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial isolates from environmental surfaces and medical equipment. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH) from June to September, 2018. A total of 164 inanimate surfaces located at intensive care units (ICUs) and operation theaters (OTs) were swabbed. All isolates were identified by using routine bacterial culture, Gram staining and a panel of biochemical tests. For each identified bacteria, antibiogram profiles were determined by the Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Out of the 164 swabbed samples, 141 (86%) were positive for bacterial growth. The predominant bacteria identified from OTs and ICUs were S. aureus (23% vs 11.5%), Acinetobacter spp (3.8% vs 17.5%) and Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CONS) (12.6% vs 2.7%) respectively. Linens were the most contaminated materials among items studied at the hospital (14.8%). The proportions of resistance among Gram-positive bacteria (GPB) were high for penicillin (92.8%), cefoxitin (83.5%) and erythromycin (54.1%). However, the most effective antibiotics were clindamycin with only 10.4% and 16.5% resistance rates, respectively. The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) revealed that the most effective antibiotics were amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin with resistance rate of 25%, 37.5%, and 46.3%, respectively. However, the highest resistance was recorded against ampicillin (97.5%), ceftazidime (91.3%), ceftriaxone (91.3%) and aztreonam (90%). The inanimate surfaces near immediate patient environment and commonly touched medical equipment within OTs and ICUs are reservoirs of potential pathogenic bacteria that could predispose critically ill patients to acquire HCAIs. The proportions of antimicrobial resistance profile of the isolates are much higher from studied clean inanimate environments.",

    "abstract": "Aedes aegypti is an important vector of several pathogenic arboviruses including dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Innovative approaches to control Aedes populations, involving synthetic transgenic modifications as well as Wolbachia bacteria, appear promising. For the various techniques requiring offspring inheritance of a trait, released males must successfully compete for mating partners against wildtype males. However, very little is known about mechanisms of mate selection in mosquitoes in general and in particular about potential correlations between mating success and offspring immune performance.\n\nHarmonic convergence signals have been proposed as a cue for females to predict male quality. We investigated whether offspring of converging parental pairs showed differences in immune competence compared to offspring derived from non-converging parental pairs using three different types of immune assays. We found that offspring immune responses (melanization response and response to a bacterial challenge) differed between offspring from converging and non-converging parents. However, immune responses were shaped by several interacting factors such as sex, age, reproductive status, and parental mating behavior. Parental mating behavior had a stronger effect on the immune response of male offspring than on female offspring. Further, a population of female offspring derived from converging parental pairs reached their peak dengue virus dissemination rate earlier compared to a population of offspring derived from non-converging parental pairs. Our results provide insight into a wide range of selective pressures shaping mosquito immune function. Evolutionary trade-offs between naturally and sexually selected traits can have important implications for disease transmission and control and should be considered in the development of reproductive control strategies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe nucleotide composition of the genome is a balance between origin and fixation rates of different mutations. For example, it is well-known that transitions occur more frequently than transversions, particularly at CpG sites. Differences in fixation rates of mutation types are less explored. Specifically, recombination-associated GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) may differentially impact GC-changing mutations, due to differences in their genomic distributions and efficiency of mismatch repair mechanisms. Given that recombination evolves rapidly across species, we explore gBGC of different mutation types across human populations and among great ape species.\n\nResultsWe report a stronger correlation between GC frequency and recombination for transitions than for transversions. Notably, CpG transitions are most strongly affected by gBGC. We show that the strength of gBGC differs for transitions and transversions but that its overall strength is positively correlated with effective population sizes of human populations and great ape species, with some notable exceptions, such as a stronger effect of gBGC on non-CpG transitions in populations of European descent. We study the dependence of gBGC dynamics on flanking nucleotides and show that some mutation types evolve in opposition to the gBGC expectation, likely due to hypermutability of specific nucleotide contexts.\n\nConclusionsDifferences in GC-biased gene conversion are evident between different mutation types, and dependent on sex-specific recombination, population size and flanking nucleotide context. Our results therefore highlight the importance of different gBGC dynamics experienced by GC-changing mutations and their impact on nucleotide composition evolution.",

To map genetic effects on gene regulation in the underrepresented Indonesian population, we have integrated genotype, gene expression, and CpG methylation data from 115 participants across three island populations that capture the major sources of genomic diversity on the region. In a comparison with a European dataset, we identify 166 uniquely Indonesia-specific eQTLs, highlighting the benefits of performing association studies on non-European populations. By combining local ancestry and archaic introgression inference eQTLs and methylQTLs, we identify regulatory loci driven by modern Papuan ancestry as well as introgressed Denisovan and Neanderthal variation. GWAS colocalization connects QTLs detected here to hematological traits.

    "abstract": "Social learning - learning from others - is the basis for behavioural traditions. Different social learning strategies (SLS), where individuals biasedly learn behaviours based on their content or who demonstrates them, may increase an individuals fitness and generate behavioural traditions. While SLS have been mostly studied in isolation, their interaction and the interplay between individual and social learning is less understood. We performed a field-based open diffusion experiment in a wild primate. We provided two groups of vervet monkeys with a novel food, unshelled peanuts, and documented how three different peanut opening techniques spread within the groups. We analysed data using hierarchical Bayesian dynamic learning models that explore the integration of multiple SLS with individual learning. We i) report evidence of social learning compared to strictly individual learning, ii) show that vervets preferentially socially learn the technique that yields the highest observed payoff and iii) also bias attention toward individuals of higher rank. This shows that behavioural preferences can arise when individuals integrate social information about the efficiency of a behaviour alongside cues related to the rank of a demonstrator. When these preferences converge to the same behaviour in a group, they may result in stable behavioural traditions.",
