    "abstract": "The risk of developing cancer is correlated with body size and lifespan within species. Between species, however, there is no correlation between cancer and either body size or lifespan, indicating that large, long-lived species have evolved enhanced cancer protection mechanisms. Elephants and their relatives (Proboscideans) are a particularly interesting lineage for the exploration of mechanisms underlying the evolution of augmented cancer resistance because they evolved large bodies recently within a clade of smaller bodied species (Afrotherians). Here, we explore the contribution of gene duplication to body size and cancer risk in Afrotherians. Unexpectedly, we found that tumor suppresxssor duplication was pervasive in Afrotherian genomes, rather than restricted to Proboscideans. Proboscideans, however, have duplicates in unique pathways that may underlie some aspects of their remarkable anti-cancer cell biology. These data suggest that duplication of tumor suppressor genes facilitated the evolution of increased body size by compensating for decreasing intrinsic cancer risk.",

    "abstract": "Current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread globally within a matter of months. The virus establishes a success in balancing its deadliness and contagiousness, and causes substantial differences in susceptibility and disease progression in people of different ages, genders and pre-existing comorbidities. Since these host factors are subjected to epigenetic regulation, relevant analyses on some key genes underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis were performed to longitudinally decipher their epigenetic correlation to COVID-19 susceptibility. The genes of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, as the major virus receptor) and interleukin (IL)-6 (a key immune-pathological factor triggering cytokine storm) were shown to evince active epigenetic evolution via histone modification and cis/trans-factors interaction across different vertebrate species. Extensive analyses revealed that ACE2 ad IL-6 genes are among a subset of non-canonical interferon-stimulated genes (non-ISGs), which have been designated recently for their unconventional responses to interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory stimuli through an epigenetic cascade. Furthermore, significantly higher positive histone modification markers and position weight matrix (PWM) scores of key cis-elements corresponding to inflammatory and IFN signaling, were discovered in both ACE2 and IL6 gene promoters across representative COVID-19-susceptible species compared to unsusceptible ones. Findings characterize ACE2 and IL-6 genes as non-ISGs that respond differently to inflammatory and IFN signaling from the canonical ISGs and their epigenetic properties may serve as biomarkers to longitudinally predict COVID-19 susceptibility in vertebrates and partially explain COVID-19 inequality in people of different subgroups.",

N-acyl amino acids inhibit GlyT2 through binding to an allosteric binding site to produce analgesia in vivo with minimal overt side effects. In this paper we use a combination of medicinal chemistry, electrophysiology, and computational modelling to explore the molecular basis of GlyT2 inhibition at the allosteric site. We show how N-acyl amino acid head group stereochemistry, tail length and double bond position promote enhanced inhibition by deep penetration into the binding pocket.

    "abstract": "With the advent of increased diversity and scale of molecular data, there has been a growing appreciation for the applications of machine learning and statistical methodologies to gain new biological insights. An important step in achieving this aim is the Relation Extraction process which specifies if an interaction exists between two or more biological entities in a published study. Here, we employed natural-language processing (CBOW) and deep Recurrent Neural Network (bi-directional LSTM) to predict relations between biological entities that describe protein subcellular localisation in plants. We applied our system to 1700 published Arabidopsis protein subcellular studies from the SUBA manually curated dataset. The system was able to extract relevant text and the classifier predicted interactions between protein name, subcellular localisation and experimental methodology. It obtained a final precision, recall rate, accuracy and F1 scores of 0.951, 0.828, 0.893 and 0.884 respectively. The classifier was subsequently tested on a similar problem in crop species (CropPAL) and demonstrated a comparable accuracy measure (0.897). Consequently, our approach can be used to extract protein functional features from unstructured text in the literature with high accuracy. The developed system will improve dissemination or protein functional data to the scientific community and unlock the potential of big data text analytics for generating new hypotheses from diverse datasets.",

    "abstract": "The ability to study cancer-immune cell communication across the whole tumor section without tissue dissociation is needed for cancer immunotherapies, to understand molecular mechanisms and to discover potential druggable targets. In this work, we developed a powerful experimental and analytical toolbox to enable genome-wide scale discovery and targeted validation of cellular communication. We assessed the utilities of five sequencing and imaging technologies to study cancer tissue, including single-cell RNA sequencing and Spatial Transcriptomic (measuring over >20,000 genes), RNA In Situ Hybridization (multiplex 4-12 genes), digital droplet PCR, and Opal multiplex protein staining (4-9 proteins). To spatially integrate multimodal data, we developed a computational method called STRISH that can automatically scan across the whole tissue section for local expression of gene and/or protein markers to recapitulate an interaction landscape across the whole tissue. We evaluated the unique ability of this toolbox to discover and validate cell-cell interaction in situ through in-depth analysis of two types of cancer, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which account for over 70% of cancer cases. We expect that the approach described here will be widely applied to discover and validate ligand receptor interaction in different types of solid cancer tumors.",

Validating the model predictions against faecal metabolomics, our in silico frameworks correctly predicted in vivo species metabolite correlations with high accuracy. In conclusion, highlighting the value of combining statistical association studies with in silico modelling, this study delivers insights on the metabolic role of Fusobacteria in the gut, while providing a proof of concept for the validity of constraint-based community modelling.",

    "abstract": "Brain decoding can predict visual perception from non-invasive electrophysiological data by combining information across multiple channels. However, decoding methods typically confound together the multi-faceted and distributed neural processes underlying perception, so it is unclear what specific aspects of the neural computations involved in perception are reflected in this type of macroscale data. Using MEG data recorded while participants viewed a large number of naturalistic images, we analytically separated the brain signal into a slow 1/f drift (<5Hz) and a oscillatory response in the theta frequency band. Combined with a method for capturing between-trial variability in the way stimuli are processed, this analysis revealed that there are at least three dissociable components that contain distinct stimulus-specific information: a 1/f component, reflecting the temporally stable aspect of the stimulus representation; a global phase shift of the theta oscillation, related to differences in the speed of processing between the stimuli; and differential patterns of theta phase across channels, likely related to stimulus-specific computations. We demonstrate that common cognitive interpretations of decoding analysis can be flawed if the multicomponent nature of the signal is ignored, and suggest that, by acknowledging this fact, we can provide a more accurate interpretation of commonly observed phenomena in the study of perception.",

    "abstract": "Our binocular world is seamlessly assembled from two retinal images that remain segregated until the cerebral cortex. Despite the coherence of this input, there is often an imbalance between the strength of these connections in the brain.  Eye dominance provides a measure of the perceptual dominance of one eye over the other. Theoretical models suggest that eye dominance is related to reciprocal inhibition between monocular units in the primary visual cortex, the first location where the binocular input is combined. As the specific inhibitory interactions in the binocular visual system critically depend on the presence of visual input, we sought to test the role of inhibition by measuring the concentrations of inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmitters during monocular visual stimulation of the dominant and the non-dominant eye. GABA-levels were acquired in V1 using a combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) sequence on a 7-Tesla MRI scanner. Individuals with stronger eye dominance had a greater difference in GABAergic inhibition between the eyes. This relationship was present only when the visual system was actively processing sensory input and was not present at rest. We provide the first evidence that imbalances in GABA levels during ongoing sensory processing are related to eye dominance in the human visual cortex. This provides strong support to the view that intracortical inhibition underlies normal eye dominance.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhat we see is shaped by excitation and inhibition in our brain. We investigated how eye dominance, the perceptual preference of one eyes input over the other, is related to levels of inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA during monocular visual stimulation. GABAergic inhibition is related to eye dominance, but only when the visual system is actively processing sensory input. This provides key support for the view that imbalances in visual competition that are observed in the normal visual system arise from an inability of GABA signalling to suppress the stronger sensory representation.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cell division, with a few exceptions, is driven by FtsZ through a treadmilling mechanism to remodel and constrict the rigid peptidoglycan (PG) layer. Yet, different organisms may differ in the composition of the cell-division complex (divisome). In the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7120, hetF is required for the initiation of the differentiation of heterocysts, cells specialized in N2-fixing cells under combined nitrogen deprivation. In this study, we demonstrate that hetF is expressed in vegetative cells and necessary for cell division in a conditional manner. Under non-permissive conditions, cells of a {Delta}hetF mutant stop dividing, consistent with increased level of HetF under similar conditions in the wild type. Furthermore, HetF is a membrane protein located at midcell and cell-cell junctions. In the absence of HetF, FtsZ rings are still present in the elongated cells; however, PG remodelling is abolished. This phenotype is similar to that observed with the inhibition of septal PG synthase FtsI. We further reveal that HetF is recruited to or stabilized at the divisome by interacting with FtsI and this interaction is necessary for HetF function in cell division. Our results indicate that HetF is a member of the divisome, and reveal distinct features of the cell-division machinery in cyanobacteria that are of high ecological and environmental importance.\n\nSignificance StatementCyanobacteria shaped the Earths evolutionary history, and are still playing important roles for elementary cycles in different environments. They are consisted of highly diverse species with different cell shape, size and morphology. Although these properties are strongly affected by the process of cytokinesis, the mechanism remains largely unexplored. Using different approaches, we demonstrate that HetF is a new component of the cell division machinery in the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7120. The common and diverged characteristics of cell division in prokaryotes reflect the evolutionary history of different bacteria, as an adaptive measure to proliferate under certain environmental conditions. As a protein for cell differentiation, the recruitment of HetF to the septum illustrates such an adaptive mechanism for cyanobacteria.",

In response to hACE2, S opens sequentially into the hACE2-bound S conformation through at least one on-path intermediate.

    "abstract": "Scientists, medical researchers, and health care workers have mobilized worldwide in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; SCoV2). Preliminary data have captured a wide range of host responses, symptoms, and lingering problems post-recovery within the human population. These variable clinical manifestations suggest differences in influential factors, such as innate and adaptive host immunity, existing or underlying health conditions, co-morbidities, genetics, and other factors. As COVID-19-related data continue to accumulate from disparate groups, the heterogeneous nature of these datasets poses challenges for efficient extrapolation of meaningful observations, hindering translation of information into clinical applications. Attempts to utilize, analyze, or combine biomarker datasets from multiple sources have shown to be inefficient and complicated, without a unifying resource. As such, there is an urgent need within the research community for the rapid development of an integrated and harmonized COVID-19 Biomarker Knowledgebase. By leveraging data collection and integration methods, backed by a robust data model developed to capture cancer biomarker data we have rapidly crowdsourced the collection and harmonization of COVID-19 biomarkers. Our resource currently has 138 unique biomarkers. We found multiple instances of the same biomarker substance being suggested as multiple biomarker types during our extensive cross-validation and manual curation. As a result, our Knowledgebase currently has 265 biomarker type combinations. Every biomarker entry is made comprehensive by bringing in together ancillary data from multiple sources such as biomarker accessions (canonical UniProtKB accession, PubChem Compound ID, Cell Ontology ID, Protein Ontology ID, NCI Thesaurus Code, and Disease Ontology ID), BEST biomarker category, and specimen type (Uberon Anatomy Ontology) unified with ontology standards. Our preliminary observations show distinct trends in the collated biomarkers. Most biomarkers are related to the immune system (SAA,TNF-{propto}, and IP-10) or coagulopathies (D-dimer, antithrombin, and VWF) and a few have already been established as cancer biomarkers (ACE2, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2). These trends align with proposed hypotheses of clinical manifestations compounding the complexity of COVID-19 pathobiology. We explore these trends as we put forth a COVID-19 biomarker resource that will help researchers and diagnosticians alike.
