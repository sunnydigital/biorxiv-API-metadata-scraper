    "abstract": "Mimicry facilitates social bonding throughout the lifespan. Mimicry impairments in autism spectrum conditions (ASC) are widely reported, including differentiation of the brain networks associated with its social bonding and learning functions. This study examined associations between volumes of brain regions associated with social bonding versus procedural skill learning, and mimicry of gestures during a naturalistic interaction in ASC and neurotypical (NT) children. Consistent with predictions, results revealed reduced mimicry in ASC relative to the NT children. Mimicry frequency was negatively associated with autism symptom severity. Mimicry was predicted predominantly by the volume of procedural skill learning regions in ASC, and by bonding regions in NT. Further, bonding regions contributed significantly less to mimicry in ASC than in NT, while the contribution of learning regions was not different across groups. These findings suggest that associating mimicry with skill learning, rather than social bonding, may partially explain observed communication difficulties in ASC.",

    "abstract": "Many different functions are regulated by circadian rhythms, including those orchestrated by discrete clock neurons within animal brains. To comprehensively characterize and assign cell identity to the 75 pairs of Drosophila circadian neurons, we optimized a single cell RNA sequencing method and assayed clock neuron gene expression at different times of day. The data identify at least 17 clock neuron categories with striking spatial regulation of gene expression. Transcription factor regulation is prominent and likely contributes to the robust circadian oscillation of many transcripts, including those that encode cell-surface proteins previously shown to be important for cell recognition and synapse formation during development. We suggest that these molecules orchestrate the temporal regulation of synapse formation and/or strength. The many other clock-regulated genes also constitute an important resource for future mechanistic and functional studies between clock neurons and/or for temporal signaling to circuits elsewhere in the fly brain.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in sequencing technologies and metagenomic studies have increased the knowledge of the virosphere associated with honey bees tremendously. In this study, viral-like particle enrichment and deep sequencing was deployed to detect viral communities in managed Belgian honey bees. A substantial number of previously undescribed divergent virus genomes was detected, including a rhabdovirus and a recombinant virus possessing a divergent Lake Sinai Virus capsid and a Hepe-like polymerase. Furthermore, screening > 5,000 public sequencing datasets for the retrieved set of viral genomes revealed an additional plethora of undetected, divergent viruses present in a wide range of Hymenoptera species. The unexpected high number of shared viral genomes within the Apidae family and across different families within the order Hymenoptera suggests that many of these viruses are highly promiscuous, that virus sharing within and between Hymenoptera families occurs frequently, and that the concept of species-specific viral taxa inside the Hymenoptera should be revisited. In particular, this estimation implies that sharing of several viral species, thought to be specific for bees, across other eukaryotic taxa is rampant. This study provides important insights on the host taxonomical breadth of some of the known \"bee viruses\" and might have important implications on strategies to combat viruses that are relevant to pollinators.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is a poorly understood bacterium capable of life-threatening infections in hospitals. Few antibiotics remain effective against this highly resistant pathogen. Developing rationally-designed antimicrobials that can target A. baumannii requires improved knowledge of the proteins that carry out essential processes allowing growth of the organism. Unfortunately, studying essential genes has been challenging using traditional techniques, which usually require time-consuming recombination-based genetic manipulations. Here, we performed saturating mutagenesis with dual transposon systems to identify essential genes in A. baumannii and we developed a CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) system for facile analysis of these genes. We show that the CRISPRi system enables efficient transcriptional silencing in A. baumannii. Using these tools, we confirmed the essentiality of the novel cell division protein AdvA and discovered a previously uncharacterized AraC-family transcription factor (ACX60_RS03245) that is necessary for growth. In addition, we show that capsule biosynthesis is a conditionally essential process, with mutations in late-acting steps causing toxicity in strain ATCC 17978 that can be bypassed by blocking early-acting steps or activating the BfmRS stress response. These results open new avenues for analysis of essential pathways in A. baumannii.\n\nImportanceNew approaches are urgently needed to control A. baumannii, one of the most drug resistant pathogens known. To facilitate the development of novel targets that allow inhibition of the pathogen, we performed a large-scale identification of genes whose products the bacterium needs for growth. We also developed a CRISPR-based gene knockdown tool that operates efficiently in A. baumannii, allowing rapid analysis of these essential genes. We used these methods to define multiple processes vital to the bacterium, including a previously uncharacterized gene-regulatory factor and export of a protective polymeric capsule. These tools will enhance our ability to investigate processes critical for the essential biology of this challenging hospital-acquired pathogen.",

This non-obvious effect is poorly characterized; we dont know whether it is plant developmental stage-dependent, which fractions of the fungal community are affected, and whether it is reflected in the next trophic level. To address the questions, fungal assemblages in soil samples collected from invaded and non-invaded plots in two soil types were compared. Whereas ergosterol as a marker for fungal biomass demonstrated a significant increase in fungal biomass, specific qPCR assays did not point at a quantitative shift. MiSeq-based characterization of the belowground effects of giant goldenrod revealed a local increase of mainly Cladosporiaceae and Glomeraceae. This asymmetric boost in the fungal community was reflected in a specific shift in the fungivorous nematode community.

    "abstract": "Mutations in desmosomal Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) are the most prevalent drivers of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) and a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. However, partner proteins that elucidate PKP2 cellular mechanism to understand cardiac dysfunction in ACM are mostly unknown. Here we identify the actin-based motor proteins Myh9 and Myh10 as key PKP2 interactors, and demonstrate that the expression of the ACM-related PKP2 mutant R735X alters actin fiber organization and cell mechanical stiffness. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein acts similarly to this known pathogenic R735X mutant, altering the actomyosin component distribution on cardiac cells. Our data reveal that the viral Nsp1 hijacks PKP2 into the cytoplasm and mimics the effect of delocalized R735X mutant. These results demonstrate that cytoplasmic PKP2, wildtype or mutant, induces the collapse of the actomyosin network, since shRNA-PKP2 knockdown maintains the cell structure, validating a critical role of PKP2 localization in the regulation of actomyosin architecture. The fact that Nsp1 and PKP2 mutant R735X share similar phenotypes also suggests that direct SARS-CoV-2 heart infection could induce a transient ACM-like disease in COVID-19 patients, which may contribute to right ventricle dysfunction, observed in patients with poor survival prognosis.\n\nHighlightsThe specific cardiac isoform Plakophilin-2a (PKP2) interacts with Myh9 and Myh10.\n\nPKP2 delocalization alters actomyosin cytoskeleton component organization.

    "abstract": "Spermatogenesis, the complex developmental process of male germ cell proliferation, differentiation, and maturation, is the basis of male fertility and reproductive fitness. In the seminiferous tubules of the testes, spermatozoa are constantly generated from spermatogonial stem cells through a stereotyped sequence of mitotic and meiotic divisions. The basic physiological principles, however, that control both maturation and luminal transport of the still immotile spermatozoa within the seminiferous tubules remain poorly, if at all, defined. Here, we show that coordinated contractions of smooth muscle-like testicular peritubular cells provide the propulsive force for luminal sperm transport towards the rete testis and epididymis. Using a mouse model for in vivo imaging, we describe and quantify spontaneous tubular contractions and show a causal relationship between peritubular Ca2+ waves and peristaltic transport. Moreover, we identify P2 receptor-dependent purinergic signaling pathways as physiological triggers of tubular contractions both in vitro and in vivo. When challenged with extracellular ATP, transport of luminal content inside the seminiferous tubules displays stage-dependent directionality. We thus suggest that paracrine purinergic signaling coordinates peristaltic recurrent contractions of the mouse seminiferous tubules to propel immotile spermatozoa to the rete testis. Consequently, our findings could have substantial pharmaceutical implications for both infertility treatment and / or male contraception.",

In the current study, we manipulated heterogenous recombination between human and mouse dental tissues and demonstrate that the dental mesenchyme dominates the tooth developmental tempo and FGF8 could be a critical player during this developmental process. Forced activation of FGF8 signaling in the dental mesenchyme of mice promoted cell proliferation, prevented cell apoptosis via p38 and perhaps PI3K-Akt intracellular signaling, and impelled the transition of the cell cycle from G1- to S-phase in the tooth germ, resulting in the slowdown of the tooth developmental pace. Our results provide compelling evidence that extrinsic signals can profoundly affect tooth developmental tempo and the dental mesenchymal FGF8 could be a pivotal factor in controlling developmental pace in a non-cell-autonomous manner during mammalian odontogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Climate dynamics are inextricably linked to processes in social systems that are highly unequal. This suggests a need for coupled social-climate models that capture pervasive real-world asymmetries in the population distribution of the consequences of anthropogenic climate change and climate (in)action. Here we develop a simple social-climate model with group structure to investigate how anthropogenic climate change and population heterogeneity co-evolve. We find that greater homophily and resource inequality cause an increase in the global peak temperature anomaly by as much as 0.7{degrees}C. Also, climate change can structure human populations by driving opinion polarization. Finally, climate mitigation achieved by reducing the cost of mitigation measures paid by individuals tends to be contingent upon socio-economic conditions, whereas policies that achieve communication between different strata of society show climate mitigation benefits across a broad socio-economic regime. We conclude that advancing climate change mitigation efforts can benefit from a social-climate systems perspective.",

    "abstract": "The photosynthetic unicellular alga Chlamydomonas (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) is a versatile reference for algal biology because of the facility with which it can be cultured in the laboratory. Genomic and systems biology approaches have previously been used to describe how the transcriptome responds to environmental changes, but this analysis has been limited to bulk data, representing the average behavior from pools of cells. Here, we apply single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to probe the heterogeneity of Chlamydomonas cell populations under three environments and in two genotypes differing in the presence of a cell wall. First, we determined that RNA can be extracted from single algal cells with or without a cell wall, offering the possibility to sample algae communities in the wild. Second, scRNA-seq successfully separated single cells into non-overlapping cell clusters according to their growth conditions. Cells exposed to iron or nitrogen deficiency were easily distinguished despite a shared tendency to arrest cell division to economize resources. Notably, these groups of cells recapitulated known patterns observed with bulk RNA-seq, but also revealed their inherent heterogeneity. A substantial source of variation between cells originated from their endogenous diurnal phase, although cultures were grown in constant light. We exploited this result to show that circadian iron responses may be conserved from algae to land plants. We propose that bulk RNA-seq data represent an average of varied cell states that hides underappreciated heterogeneity.\n\nOne-sentence summaryWe show that single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can be applied to Chlamydomonas cultures to reveal the that heterogenity in bulk cultures is largely driven by diurnal cycle phases\n\nThe author responsible for distribution of materials integral to the findings presented in this article in accordance with the policy described in the Instructions for Authors (www.plantcell.org) is: Matteo Pellegrini (matteop@mcdb.ucla.edu)",

    "abstract": "The most frequent genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia is a G4C2 repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene. This expansion gives rise to translation of aggregating dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, including poly-GA as the most abundant species. However, gain of toxic function effects have been attributed to either the DPRs or the pathological G4C2 RNA. Here we analyzed in a cellular model the relative toxicity of DPRs and RNA. Cytoplasmic poly-GA aggregates, generated in the absence of G4C2 RNA, interfered with nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, but had little effect on cell viability. In contrast, nuclear poly-GA was more toxic, impairing nucleolar protein quality control and protein biosynthesis. Production of the G4C2 RNA strongly reduced viability independent of DPR translation and caused pronounced inhibition of nuclear mRNA export and protein biogenesis. Thus, while the toxic effects of G4C2 RNA predominate, DPRs exert additive effects that may contribute to pathology.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancers (CRCs) deficient in DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) are heavily infiltrated by CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and are associated with a better prognosis than the majority of CRCs. The immunogenicity of dMMR CRCs is commonly attributed to abundant neoantigen generation due to their extreme genomic instability. However, lack of neoantigenic overlap between these and other CRCs necessitates study of antigen-independent mechanisms of immune activation by dMMR CRCs in order identify therapeutic strategies for treating MMR proficient CRCs. We show here using organoid cocultures and orthotopic models that a critical component of dMMR CRCs immunogenicity is the activation and recruitment of systemic CD8+ T cells into the tumor epithelium by overexpression of the chemokines CCL5 and CXCL10. This is dependent on endogenous activation of the cGAS/STING and IFN signaling pathways by the damaged DNA in dMMR CRCs. These signaling pathways remain sensitive to exogenous stimulation in other CRCs, identifying an attractive therapeutic avenue for increasing TIL infiltration into normally immune resistant CRC subtypes. We have thus identified a key neoantigen-independent mechanism that underlies the ability for dMMR CRCs to recruit TILs into the tumor epithelium. Given that TIL recruitment is a prerequisite for effective tumor killing either by the endogenous immune system or in the context of immunotherapies, treatments that activate IFN-induced chemokine-production by tumor cells promise to improve the prognosis of patients with many different CRC subsets.\n\nStatement of SignificanceA critical component of antitumor immunity in dMMR CRCs is their ability to recruit T cells into the tumor epithelium as a prerequisite to tumor cell killing. This occurs because their extensive genomic instability leads to endogenous activation of cGAS/STING and overexpression of CCL5 and CXCL10.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of brain-scale functional networks at rest and during cognitive tasks is the subject of intense research efforts to unveil fundamental principles of brain functions. To estimate these large-scale brain networks, the emergent method called \"electroencephalography (EEG) source connectivity\" has generated increasing interest in the network neuroscience community, due to its ability to identify cortical brain networks with satisfactory spatio-temporal resolution, while reducing mixing and volume conduction effects. However, no consensus has been reached yet regarding a unified EEG source connectivity pipeline, and several methodological issues have to be carefully accounted for to avoid pitfalls. Thus, a validation toolbox that provides flexible \"ground truth\" models is needed for an objective methods/parameters evaluation and, thereby an optimization of the EEG source connectivity pipeline. In this paper, we show how a recently developed large-scale model of brain-scale activity, named COALIA, can provide to some extent such ground truth by providing realistic simulations of source-level and scalp-level activity. Using a bottom-up approach, the model bridges cortical micro-circuitry and large-scale network dynamics. Here, we provide an example of the potential use of COALIA to analyze, in the context of epileptiform activity, the effect of three key factors involved in the \"EEG source connectivity\" pipeline: (i) EEG sensors density, (ii) algorithm used to solve the inverse problem, and (iii) functional connectivity measure. Results showed that a high electrode density (at least 64 channels) is required to accurately estimate cortical networks. Regarding the inverse solution/connectivity measure combination, the best performance at high electrode density was obtained using the weighted minimum norm estimate (wMNE) combined with the weighted phase lag index (wPLI). Although those results are specific to the considered aforementioned context (epileptiform activity), we believe that this model-based approach can be successfully applied to other experimental questions/contexts. We aim at presenting a proof-of-concept of the interest of COALIA in the network neuroscience field, and its potential use in optimizing the EEG source-space network estimation pipeline.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is thought to support memory consolidation via reactivation of prior experiences, with particular electrophysiological sleep signatures (slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles) gating the information flow between relevant brain areas. However, empirical evidence for a role of endogenous memory reactivation (i.e., without experimentally delivered memory cues) for consolidation in humans is lacking. Here, we devised a paradigm in which participants acquired associative memories before taking a nap. Multivariate decoding was then used to capture endogenous memory reactivation during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in surface EEG recordings. Our results reveal reactivation of learning material during SO-spindle complexes, with the precision of SO-spindle coupling predicting reactivation strength. Critically, reactivation strength (i.e. classifier evidence in favor of the previously studied stimulus category) in turn predicts the level of consolidation across participants. These results elucidate the memory function of sleep in humans and emphasize the importance of SOs and spindles in clocking endogenous consolidation processes.",

    "abstract": "After colonization of the mosquito midgut by the malaria parasite, Plasmodium differentiates from an invasive, motile ookinete to a multiplicative, sessile oocyst. Despite their importance in establishing the infection and increasing its population, the morphological transformation associated with these changes in function has been scarcely explored. Oocyst differentiation begins with the formation of a spherical protrusion near the center of the crescent-shaped ookinete. As this protuberance grows, it engulfs the content of the two distal ends, thus rounding the cell. In this work, scrutinized observations of the overall changes in shape, coupled with the migration of the malaria pigment granules and the nucleus into the protuberance, revealed that the movement of the cell content happens in an anteroposterior manner. The resulting data, formalized as morphometric measurements, led to the identification of 5 transitional stages and to the development of a computer training algorithm that automatically classifies them. Since cell differentiation has been associated with redox fluctuations, the classification algorithm was tested with parasites stained with a glutathione-specific fluorescent probe, revealing a redox modulation during differentiation.",

These include squinting, abnormal lacrimation, mucus accumulation, swollen eyelids and inflammatory infiltration of lacrimal and meibomian glands. Utilizing a Gpr125-{beta}-gal reporter and scRNAseq, we identify Gpr125 expression in a discrete population of cells located at the tips of migrating embryonic lacrimal ducts. By lineage tracing we show these cells function as progenitors of the adult lacrimal myoepithelium. Beyond defining an essential role for Gpr125 in tear film and identifying its utility as a marker of lacrimal progenitors, this study implicates Gpr125 in the etiology of blepharitis and dry eye syndrome, and defines novel animal models of these common maladies.",

To solve the conundrum is difficult because of the lack of a matched boundary condition. Here, we derive a new boundary condition by considering individual losing at habitat boundaries. With the suitable boundary condition, our results suggest that individuals with high growth rate inside but low growth rate outside the reserve and high movement preference to a large marine reserve boundary can enhance yields benefits from fishing around the marine reserve edge. The findings provide theoretical cautions for fishing near some new reserves in which population growth rate might be low. Moreover, our boundary condition is general enough for the universal phenomenon of losing individual at habitat boundaries such as being applied into classic theories in refuge design to explain some previous counter-intuitive phenomena more reasonably.",

Current attempts to detect cancer predisposition genomic regions are typically based on small-scale familial studies or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) over dedicated case-control cohorts. In this study, we utilized the UK Biobank as a large-scale prospective cohort to conduct a comprehensive analysis of cancer predisposition using both GWAS and proteome-wide association study (PWAS), a method that highlights genetic associations mediated by functional alterations to protein-coding genes. We discovered 137 unique genomic loci implicated with cancer risk in the white British population across nine cancer types and pan-cancer. While most of these genomic regions are supported by external evidence, our results highlight novel loci as well. We performed a comparative analysis of cancer predisposition between cancer types, finding that most of the implicated regions are cancer-type specific. We further analyzed the role of recessive genetic effects in cancer predisposition. We found that 30 of the 137 cancer regions were recovered only by a recessive model, highlighting the importance of recessive inheritance outside of familial studies. Finally, we show that many of the cancer associations exert substantial cancer risk in the studied cohort, suggesting their clinical relevance.",

Gene expression patterns are useful for learning about gene function and give insight into the biochemical state of different cell types; however, in order to understand these cell types, we must also determine how these gene expression levels are regulated. We present the first single cell ATAC-seq study in C. elegans. We collected data in L2 larvae to match the available single cell RNA-seq data set, and we identify tissue-specific chromatin accessibility patterns that align well with existing data, including the L2 single cell RNA-seq results.

Processing and storing these data introduces a risk of abuse by a potential adversary since a human genome contains sensitive personal information. For this reason, we developed a privacy preserving method, called Varlock, for secure storage of sequenced genomic data.\n\nMaterials and methodsWe used a public set of population allele frequencies to mask personal alleles detected in genomic reads. Each personal allele described by the public set is masked by a randomly selected population allele with respect to its frequency. Masked alleles are preserved in an encrypted confidential file that can be shared, in whole or in part, using public-key cryptography.\n\nResultsOur method masked personal variants and introduced new variants detected in a personal masked genome. Alternative alleles with lower population frequency were masked and introduced more often. We performed a joint PCA analysis of personal and masked VCFs, showing that the VCFs between the two groups can not be trivially mapped. Moreover, the method is reversible and personal alleles can be unmasked in specific genomic regions on demand.\n\nConclusionOur method masks personal alleles within genomic reads while preserving valuable non-sensitive properties of sequenced DNA fragments for further research. Personal alleles may be restored in desired genomic regions and shared with patients, clinics, and researchers. We suggest that the method can provide an additional layer of security for storing and sharing the raw aligned reads.",

    "abstract": "Proteins can aggregate into disordered liquid droplets or ordered assemblies such as amyloid fibrils. These two distinct phases determine the spatial organization within cells and serve differing roles in a wide range of biological functions including gene regulation, organelle and synapse formation, and memory consolidation. The ordered phase can also give rise to diseases such as Alzheimers. However, how the protein sequence determines aggregation fate is an open question. Here we establish a general statistical mechanical theory of the disordered-to-ordered transition for polymer aggregates, including proteins, thereby completing the phase diagram for this general class of matter. The theory produces a simple universal equation determining the favored phase as a function of the temperature, polymer length, and inter-residue interaction energy variance. We show that the sequence-dependent energy variance can be efficiently calculated from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, so that the theory has no adjustable parameters. The equation accurately predicts the experimental length-dependent crystallization temperature of synthetic polymers. The theory shows that all protein aggregates, regardless of sequence, will thermodynamically order, even in the most extreme thermophiles. Therefore, energy must be expended to maintain the disordered protein aggregate at steady state. More broadly, the theory establishes a lower bound on the ordering transition temperature for polymers. This bound indicates that condensates of any organic polymer will spontaneously order on all habitable planets.",

    "abstract": "Members of the phage shock protein A (PspA) family, including the inner membrane-associated protein of 30 kDa (IM30), are suggested to stabilize stressed cellular membranes. Furthermore, IM30 is essential in thylakoid membrane-containing chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, where it is involved in membrane biogenesis and/or remodeling. While it is well known that PspA and IM30 bind to membranes, the mechanism of membrane stabilization is still enigmatic. Here we report that ring-shaped IM30 super-complexes disassemble on membranes, resulting in formation of a membrane-protecting protein carpet. Upon ring dissociation, the C-terminal domain of IM30 unfolds, and the protomers self-assemble on membranes. IM30 assemblies at membranes have been observed before in vivo and were associated to stress response in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. These assemblies likely correspond to the here identified carpet structures. Our study defines the thus far enigmatic structural basis for the physiological function of IM30 and related proteins, including PspA, and highlights a hitherto unrecognized concept of membrane stabilization by intrinsically disordered proteins.",

    "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be expanded and differentiated in vitro into almost any adult tissue cell type, and thus have great potential as a source for cell therapies with biomedical application. In this study, a fully-defined polymer synthetic substrate is identified for hPSC culture in completely defined, xeno-free conditions. This system can overcome the cost, scalability and reproducibility limitations of current hPSC culture strategies, and facilitate large-scale production. A high-throughput, multi-generational polymer microarray platform approach was used to test over 600 unique polymers and rapidly assess hPSC-polymer interactions in combination with the fully defined xeno-free medium, Essential 8TM (E8). This study identifies as novel nanoscale phase separated blend of poly(tricyclodecane-dimethanol diacrylate) and poly(butyl acrylate) (2:1 v/v), which supports long-term expansion of hPSCs and can be readily coated onto standard cultureware. Analysis of cell-polymer interface interactions through mass spectrometry and integrin blocking studies provides novel mechanistic insight into the role of the E8 proteins in promoting integrin-mediated hPSC attachment and maintaining hPSC signaling, including ability to undergo multi-lineage differentiation. This study therefore identifies a novel substrate for long-term serial passaging of hPSCs in serum-free, commercial chemically-defined E8, which provides a promising and economic hPSC expansion platform for clinical-scale application.",

While useful as a tool to screen for enhanced TAL biosynthesis, this variant shows elevated background (leaky) expression, poor sensitivity, and relaxed inducer specificity, including responsiveness to orsellinic acid (OA). More sensitive biosensors specific to either TAL or OA can aid in the study and engineering of polyketide synthases that produce these and similar compounds. In this work, we employed a TetA-based dual-selection to isolate new TAL-responsive AraC variants showing reduced background expression and improved TAL sensitivity. To improve TAL specificity, OA was included as a \"decoy\" ligand during negative selection, resulting in isolation of a TAL biosensor that is inhibited by OA. Finally, to engineer OA-specific AraC variants, the IPRO computational framework was employed, followed by two rounds of directed evolution, resulting in a biosensor with 24-fold improved OA/TAL specificity, relative to AraC-TAL1.",

    "abstract": "Aphids are global agricultural pests and important models for bacterial symbiosis. To date, none of the native symbionts of aphids have been genetically manipulated, which limits our understanding of how they interact with their hosts. Serratia symbiotica CWBI-2.3T is a culturable, gut-associated bacterium isolated from the black bean aphid. Closely related Serratia symbiotica strains are facultative aphid endosymbionts that are vertically transmitted from mother to offspring during embryogenesis. We demonstrate that CWBI-2.3T can be genetically engineered using a variety of techniques, plasmids, and gene expression parts. Then, we use fluorescent protein expression to track the dynamics with which CWBI-2.3T colonizes the guts of multiple aphid species, and we measure how this bacterium affects aphid fitness. Finally, we show that we can induce heterologous gene expression from engineered CWBI-2.3T in living aphids. These results inform the development of CWBI-2.3T for aphid paratransgenesis, which could be used to study aphid biology and enable future agricultural technologies.\n\nIMPORTANCEInsects have remarkably diverse and integral roles in global ecosystems. Many harbor symbiotic bacteria, but very few of these bacteria have been genetically engineered. Aphids are major agricultural pests and an important model system for the study of symbiosis. This work describes methods for engineering a culturable aphid symbiont, Serratia symbiotica CWBI-2.3T. These approaches and genetic tools could be used in the future to implement new paradigms for the biological study and control of aphids.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical reactions underlie all living processes. Like many biological and technological systems, their complex web of interactions is difficult to fully capture and quantify with simple mathematical objects. Nonetheless, a huge volume of research has suggested many real-world biological and technological systems - including biochemical systems - can be described rather simply as  scale-free networks, characterized by a power-law degree distribution. More recently, rigorous statistical analyses across a variety of systems have upended this view, suggesting truly scale-free networks may be rare. We provide a first application of these newer methods across two distinct levels of biological organization: analyzing a large ensemble of biochemical networks generated from the reactions encoded in 785 ecosystem-level metagenomes and 1082 individual-level genomes (representing all three domains of life). Our results confirm only a few percent of individual and ecosystem-level biochemical networks meet the criteria necessary to be anything more than super-weakly scale-free. Leveraging the simultaneous analysis of the multiple coarse-grained projections of biochemistry, we perform distinguishability tests across properties of individual and ecosystem-level biochemical networks to determine whether or not they share common structure, indicative of common generative mechanisms across levels. Our results indicate there is no sharp transition in the organization of biochemistry across distinct levels of the biological hierarchy - a result that holds across different network projections. This suggests the existence of common organizing principles operating across different levels of organization in biochemical networks, independent of the project chosen.\n\nAuthor SummaryFully characterizing living systems requires rigorous analysis of the complex webs of interactions governing living processes. Here we apply statistical approaches to analyze a large data set of biochemical networks across two levels of organization: individuals and ecosystems. We find that independent of level of organization, the standard  scale-free model is not a good description of the data. Interestingly, there is no sharp transition in the shape of degree distributions for biochemical networks when comparing those of individuals to ecosystems. This suggests the existence of common organizing principles operating across different levels of biochemical organization that are revealed across different network projections.",

    "abstract": "Dynamics of cell fate decisions are commonly investigated by inferring temporal sequences of gene expression states by assembling snapshots of individual cells where each cell is measured once. Ordering cells according to minimal differences in expression patterns and assuming that differentiation occurs by a sequence of irreversible steps, yields unidirectional, eventually branching Markov chains with a single source node. In an alternative approach, we used multinucleate cells to follow gene expression taking true time series. Assembling state machines, each made from single-cell trajectories, gives a network of highly structured Markov chains of states with different source and sink nodes including cycles, revealing essential information on the dynamics of regulatory events. We argue that the obtained networks depict aspects of the Waddington landscape of cell differentiation and characterize them as reachability graphs that provide the basis for the reconstruction of the underlying gene regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMany important arboviral diseases (e.g. dengue, chikungunya) are transmitted by the bite of a female mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. Hence, the population genetic structure of the mosquito has been studied in order to understand its role as an efficient vector. Several studies utilized an integrative approach; to combine genetic and phenotypic data to determine the population structure of Ae. aegypti but these studies have only focused on female populations. To address this particular gap, our study compared the population variability and structuring between male and female Ae. aegypti populations using phenotypic (wing geometry) and genetic (microsatellites) data from a highly-urbanized and dengue-endemic region of the Philippines, Metropolitan Manila.\n\nMethodsFive mosquito populations comprised of female (n = 137) and male (n = 49) adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were used in this study. All mosquito individuals underwent geometric morphometric (26 landmarks), and genetic (11 microsatellite loci) analyses.\n\nResultsResults revealed that FST estimates (genetic) were 0.055 and 0.009 while QST estimates (phenotypic) were 0.318 and 0.309 in in male and female populations, respectively. Wing shape variation plots showed that male populations were distinctly separated from each other while female populations overlapped. Similarly, discriminant analysis of principal components using genetic data revealed that male populations were also distinctly separated from each other while female populations showed near-overlapping populations. Genetic and phenetic dendrograms showed the formation of two groups in male populations but no groups in female populations. Further analysis indicated a significant correlation (r = 0.68, p = 0.02) between the genetic and phenetic distances of male populations. Bayesian analysis using genetic data also detected multiple clusters in male (K = 3) and female (K = 2) populations, while no clusters were detected using the phenotypic data from both sexes.\n\nConclusionsOur results revealed contrasting phenotypic and genetic patterns between male and female Ae. aegypti, indicating that male populations were more spatially structured than female populations. Although genetic markers demonstrated higher sensitivity in detecting population structures than phenotypic markers, correlating patterns of population structure were still observed between the two markers.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous brain processes play a paramount role in shaping up perceptual phenomenology. This is illustrated by the alternations experienced by humans (and other animals) when watching perceptually ambiguous, static images. We hypothesised that endogenous alpha fluctuations in the visual cortex pace the accumulation of sensory information leading to perceptual outcomes. Here, we addressed this hypothesis using binocular rivalry combined with visual entrainment and electroencephalography in humans (64 female, 53 male). The results revealed a correlation between the individual frequency of alpha oscillations in the occipital cortex and perceptual alternation rates experienced during binocular rivalry. In subsequent experiments we show that regulating endogenous brain activity via rhythmic entrainment produced corresponding changes in perceptual alternation rate. These changes were observed only in the alpha range but not at lower entrainment frequencies, and were much reduced when using arrhythmic stimulation. Additionally, entraining at frequencies above the alpha range did not result in speeding up perceptual alternation rates. Overall, these findings support the notion that visual information is accumulated via alpha cycles to promote the emergence of conscious perceptual representations. We suggest that models of binocular rivalry incorporating posterior alpha as a pacemaker can provide an important advance in the comprehension of the dynamics of visual awareness.",

    "abstract": "The processing of visual motion is carried out by dedicated pathways in the primate brain. These pathways originate with populations of direction-selective neurons in the primary visual cortex, which project to dorsal structures like the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas. Anatomical and imaging studies have suggested that area V3A might also be specialized for motion processing, but there have been very few studies of single-neuron direction selectivity in this area. We have therefore performed electrophysiological recordings from V3A neurons in two macaque monkeys (one male and one female) and measured responses to a large battery of motion stimuli that includes translation motion, as well as more complex optic flow patterns. For comparison, we simultaneously recorded the responses of MT neurons to the same stimuli. Surprisingly, we find that overall levels of direction selectivity are similar in V3A and MT and moreover that the population of V3A neurons exhibits somewhat greater selectivity for optic flow patterns. These results suggest that V3A should be considered as part of the motion processing machinery of the visual cortex, in both human and non-human primates.\n\nSignificance statementAlthough area V3A is frequently the target of anatomy and imaging studies, little is known about its functional role in processing visual stimuli. Its contribution to motion processing has been particularly unclear, with different studies yielding different conclusions. We report a detailed study of direction selectivity in V3A. Our results show that single V3A neurons are, on average, as capable of representing motion direction as are neurons in well-known structures like MT. Moreover, we identify a possible specialization for V3A neurons in representing complex optic flow, which has previously been thought to emerge in higher-order brain regions. Thus it appears that V3A is well-suited to a functional role in motion processing.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies report declines in biomass, abundance and diversity of terrestrial insect groups. While anthropogenic land use is one likely contributor to this decline, studies assessing land cover as a driver of insect dynamics are rare and mostly restricted in spatial scale and types of land cover. In this study, we used rooftop-mounted car nets in a citizen science project ( InsectMobile) to allow for large-scale geographic sampling of flying insects across Denmark and parts of Germany. Citizen scientists sampled insects along 278 10 km routes in urban, farmland and semi-natural (grassland, wetland and forest) landscapes in the summer of 2018. We assessed the importance of local to landscape-scale effects and land use intensity by relating insect biomass to land cover in buffers of 50, 250, 500 and 1000 m along the routes. We found a negative association of urban cover and a positive association of farmland on insect biomass at a landscape-scale (1000 m buffer) in both countries. In Denmark, we also found positive effects of all semi-natural land covers, i.e. grassland (largest at the landscape-scale, 1000 m), forests (largest at intermediate scales, 250 m), and wetlands (largest at the local-scale, 50 m). The negative association of insect biomass with urban land cover and positive association with farmland were not clearly modified by any variable associated with land use intensity. Our results show that land cover has an impact on flying insect biomass with the magnitude of this effect varying across spatial scales. Since we consistently found negative effects of urban land cover, our findings highlight the need for the conservation of semi-natural areas, such as wetlands, grasslands and forests, in Europe.",

We generated genome and transcriptome data from non-axenic zoospores of Olpidium bornovanus and used a metagenome approach to extract phylogenetically informative fungal markers. Our phylogenetic reconstruction strongly supported Olpidium as the closest zoosporic relative of the non-flagellated terrestrial fungi. Super-alignment analyses resolved Olpidium as sister to the non-flagellated terrestrial fungi, whereas a super-tree approach recovered different placements of Olpidium, but without strong support. Further investigations detected little conflicting signal among the sampled markers but revealed a potential polytomy in early fungal evolution associated with the branching order among Olpidium, Zoopagomycota and Mucoromycota. The branches defining the evolutionary relationships of these lineages were characterized by short branch lengths and low phylogenetic content and received equivocal support for alternative phylogenetic hypotheses from individual markers. These nodes were marked by important morphological innovations, including the transition to hyphal growth and the loss of flagellum, which enabled early fungi to explore new niches and resulted in rapid and temporally concurrent Precambrian diversifications of the ancestors of several phyla of fungi.",

We engineered ACE2 to enhance the affinity with directed evolution in 293T cells. Three cycles of random mutation and cell sorting achieved 100-fold higher affinity to RBD than wild-type ACE2. The extracellular domain of modified ACE2 fused to the human IgG1-Fc region had stable structure and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 without the emergence of mutational escape. Therapeutic administration protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection, decreasing lung virus titers and pathology. Engineering ACE2 decoy receptors with human cell-based directed evolution is a promising approach to develop a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing drug that has affinity comparable to monoclonal antibodies yet displaying resistance to escape mutations of virus.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryEngineered ACE2 decoy receptor has a therapeutic potential against COVID-19 without viral escape mutation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLab equipments could be expensive and their cost can be unsustainable for scientist with limited financial resources. In order to overcome these impediments and to improve our experimental studies on liver resection in rat, a multipurpose pressure measurement device was project and realized using low cost components.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe device is based on an Arduino board, an easy-to-use and open-source microcontroller, that receives analog inputs from an instrumental amplifier connected to a disposable pressure traducer. The analogic inputs are converted to digital values and an LCD can visualize the pressure values calculated from the digital inputs. Programs has been written using C++ within the Arduino IDE, while the pressure data has been recorded on PC using data-logging freeware. Calibration has been performed using a water column as standard. Measure agreement was studied by comparing this device with a water column and with a standard clinical monitoring system.\n\nResultsThe final device it is handy and portable, it costs less the 20 euros and both the hardware and the software are easy modifiable. Calibration procedures resulted in reliable measurements as showed by the Bland-Altman measure agreement analysis.\n\nDiscussion and conclusionThe final device meets the goals of the original project and offers pressure measurements that are enough accurate for our studies on liver regeneration.\n\nIn a wider contest the present article shows the potentiality of the open-source-hardware movement to increase the opportunities for scientists and educators.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has swept over the world in the past months, causing significant loss of life and consequences to human health. Although numerous drug and vaccine developments efforts are underway, many questions remain outstanding on the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral association to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its main host receptor, and entry in the cell. Structural and biophysical studies indicate some degree of flexibility in the viral extracellular Spike glycoprotein and at the receptor binding domain-receptor interface, suggesting a role in infection. Here, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the glycosylated, full-length membrane-bound ACE2 receptor, in both an apo and spike receptor binding domain (RBD) bound state, in order to probe the intrinsic dynamics of the ACE2 receptor in the context of the cell surface. A large degree of fluctuation in the full length structure is observed, indicating hinge bending motions at the linker region connecting the head to the transmembrane helix, while still not disrupting the ACE2 homodimer or ACE2-RBD interfaces. This flexibility translates into an ensemble of ACE2 homodimer conformations that could sterically accommodate binding of the spike trimer to more than one ACE2 homodimer, and suggests a mechanical contribution of the host receptor towards the large spike conformational changes required for cell fusion. This work presents further structural and functional insights into the role of ACE2 in viral infection that can be exploited for the rational design of effective SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.\n\nStatement of SignificanceAs the host receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 has been the subject of extensive structural and antibody design efforts in aims to curtail COVID-19 spread. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of the homodimer ACE2 full-length structure to study the dynamics of this protein in the context of the cellular membrane. The simulations evidence exceptional plasticity in the protein structure due to flexible hinge motions in the head-transmembrane domain linker region and helix mobility in the membrane, resulting in a varied ensemble of conformations distinct from the experimental structures. Our findings suggest a dynamical contribution of ACE2 to the spike glycoprotein shedding required for infection, and contribute to the question of stoichiometry of the Spike-ACE2 complex.",

    "abstract": "Background and ObjectivesRemdesivir and hydroxychloroquine are or were among the most promising therapeutic options to tackle the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Besides the use of the prodrug remdesivir itself, the direct administration of GS-441 524, the resulting main metabolite of remdesivir, could be advantageous and even more effective. All substances were not originally developed for the treatment of COVID-19 and especially for GS-441 524 little is known about its pharmacokinetic and physical-chemical properties. To justify the application of new or repurposed drugs in humans, pre-clinical in vivo animal models are mandatory to investigate relevant PK and PD properties and their relationship to each other. In this study, an adapted mouse model was chosen to demonstrate its suitability to provide sufficient information on the model substances GS-441 524 and HCQ regarding plasma concentration and distribution into relevant tissues a prerequisite for treatment effectiveness.\n\nMethodsGS-441 524 and HCQ were administered intravenously as a single injection to male mice. Blood and organ samples were taken at several time points and drug concentrations were quantified in plasma and tissue homogenates by two liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry methods. In vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the degradation of remdesivir in human plasma and blood. All pharmacokinetic analyses were performed with R Studio using non-compartmental analysis.\n\nResultsHigh tissue to plasma ratios for GS-441 524 and HCQ were found, indicating a significant distribution into the examined tissue, except for the central nervous system and fat. For GS-441 524, measured tissue concentrations exceeded the reported in vitro EC50 values by more than 10-fold and in consideration of its high efficacy against feline infectious peritonitis, GS-441 524 could indeed be effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. For HCQ, relatively high in vitro EC50 values are reported, which were not reached in all tissues. Facing its slow tissue distribution, HCQ might not lead to sufficient tissue saturation for a reliable antiviral effect.\n\nConclusionThe mouse model was able to characterise the PK and tissue distribution of both model substances and is a suitable tool to investigate early drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we could demonstrate a high tissue distribution of GS-441 524 even if not administered as the prodrug remdesivir.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent behind the COVID-19 pandemic, and responsible for over 170 million infections, and over 3.7 million deaths worldwide. Efforts to test, treat and vaccinate against this pathogen all benefit from an improved understanding of the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2. Both viral and cellular proteases play a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, and inhibitors targeting proteases have already shown success at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models. Here, we study proteolytic cleavage of viral and cellular proteins in two cell line models of SARS-CoV-2 replication using mass spectrometry to identify protein neo-N-termini generated through protease activity. We identify previously unknown cleavage sites in multiple viral proteins, including major antigenic proteins S and N, which are the main targets for vaccine and antibody testing efforts. We discovered significant increases in cellular cleavage events consistent with cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and identify 14 potential high-confidence substrates of the main and papain-like proteases, validating a subset with in vitro assays. We showed that siRNA depletion of these cellular proteins inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, and that drugs targeting two of these proteins: the tyrosine kinase SRC and Ser/Thr kinase MYLK, showed a dose-dependent reduction in SARS-CoV-2 titres. Overall, our study provides a powerful resource to understand proteolysis in the context of viral infection, and to inform the development of targeted strategies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and treat COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak that started in China at the end of 2019 has rapidly spread to become pandemic. Several investigational vaccines that have already been tested in animals and humans were able to induce neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, however protection and long-term efficacy in humans remain to be demonstrated.\n\nWe have investigated if a virus-like particle (VLP) derived from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) could be engineered to become a candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine amenable to mass production. First, we showed that a codon optimized version of the S protein could migrate efficiently to the cell membrane. However, efficient production of infectious viral particles was only achieved with stable expression of a shorter version of S in its C-terminal domain ({Delta}S) in 293 cells that express MLV Gag-Pol (293GP). The incorporation of {Delta}S was 15-times more efficient into VLPs as compared to the full-length version, and that was not due to steric interference between the S cytoplasmic tail and the MLV capsid. Indeed, a similar result was also observed with extracellular vesicles released from parental 293 and 293GP cells. The amount of {Delta}S incorporated into VLPs released from producer cells was robust, with an estimated 1.25 g/ml S2 equivalent (S is comprised of S1 and S2). Thus, a scalable platform that has the potential for production of pan-coronavirus VLP vaccines has been established. The resulting nanoparticles could potentially be used alone or as a boost for other immunization strategies for COVID-19.\n\nIMPORTANCESeveral candidate COVID-19 vaccines have already been tested in humans, but their protective effect and long-term efficacy are uncertain. Therefore, it is necessary to continue developing new vaccine strategies that could be more potent and/or that would be easier to manufacture in large-scale. Virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines are considered highly immunogenic and have been successfully developed for human papilloma virus as well as hepatitis and influenza viruses. In this study, we report the generation of a robust Moloney murine leukemia virus platform that produces VLPs containing the spike of SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine platform that is compatible with lyophilization could simplify storage and distribution logistics immensely.",

    "abstract": "Various behavioral and cognitive states exhibit circadian variations in animals across phyla including Drosophila, in which only [~]0.1% of the entire brain neurons contain circadian clocks. This suggests that clock neurons communicate with a plethora of non-clock neurons to transmit the timing information to gate various behavioral outputs in Drosophila. Here, we address the molecular underpinning of this phenomenon by performing circadian RNA-seq analysis of non-clock neurons that constitute the mushroom body (MB), the center of information processing and sleep regulation. We identify hundreds of genes rhythmically expressed in the MB, including the Drosophila ortholog of Neurofibromin 1 (Nf1), the gene responsible for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Rhythmic expression of Nf1 promotes daytime wakefulness by activating cAMP-PKA signaling and increasing excitability of the MB. These findings reveal the pervasive, non-cell-autonomous circadian regulation of gene expression in the brain and its role in sleep, with implications in the pathology of NF1.",

Baricitinib, a clinically approved JAK1/2 inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory properties is currently being investigated in COVID-19 human clinical trials. Recent reports suggest that baricitinib may also have antiviral activity in limiting viral endocytosis. Here, we investigated the immunologic and virologic efficacy of baricitinib in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral shedding measured from nasal and throat swabs, bronchoalveolar lavages and tissues was not reduced with baricitinib. Type I IFN antiviral responses and SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses remained similar between the two groups. Importantly, however, animals treated with baricitinib showed reduced immune activation, decreased infiltration of neutrophils into the lung, reduced NETosis activity, and more limited lung pathology. Moreover, baricitinib treated animals had a rapid and remarkably potent suppression of alveolar macrophage derived production of cytokines and chemokines responsible for inflammation and neutrophil recruitment. These data support a beneficial role for, and elucidate the immunological mechanisms underlying, the use of baricitinib as a frontline treatment for severe inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Here, we collected and analyzed metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing data of cerebrospinal fluid specimens from a cohort of 23 pregnant women aged between 23 and 40 and one-to-one matched contamination controls. From data analysis of 116 specimens of eight different types, we detected 619 nonredundant microbial taxa which were dominated by bacteria (75%) and viruses (24%). In cerebrospinal fluids metagenomic samples, a total of 76 redundant species were detected including four (one nonredundant) eukaryota taxa, eleven (four nonredundant) bacteria, and 61 (21 nonredundant) viruses that were mostly bacteriophages. Metagenomic data analysis found no significant difference between cerebrospinal fluid specimens and negative controls in terms of microbial species diversity. In addition, no active or viable microbiome were present in the cerebrospinal fluid samples after subtracting microbes detected in contamination controls.

Here, we expressed a GFP-tagged SARS-CoV-2 S-Ectodomain in Tni insect cells. That contained sialic acid-enriched N- and O-glycans. Surface resonance plasmon (SPR) and Luminex assay showed that the purified S-Ectodomain binding to human ACE-2 and immunoreactivity with COVID-19 positive samples. We demonstrate that bromelain (isolated from pineapple stem and used as a dietary supplement) treatment diminishes the expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 in VeroE6 cells and dramatically lowers the expression of S-Ectodomain. Importantly, bromelain treatment reduced the interaction between S-Ectodomain and VeroE6 cells. Most importantly, bromelain treatment significantly diminished the SARS-CoV-2 infection in VeroE6 cells. Altogether, our results suggest that bromelain or bromelain rich pineapple stem may be used as an antiviral against COVID-19.\n\nHighlights\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=178 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/297366v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b7afb0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16f8185org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a07df8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ae33fa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG O_LIBromelain inhibits / cleaves the expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2\nC_LIO_LIBromelain cleaves / degrades SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\nC_LIO_LIBromelain inhibits S-Ectodomain binding and SARS-CoV-2 infection\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Microtubules (MTs) are cytoskeletal elements that provide structural support, establish morphology, and act as roadways for intracellular transport in cells. Neurons extend and must maintain long axons and dendrites to transmit information through the nervous system. Therefore, in neurons, the ability to independently regulate cytoskeletal stability and MT-based transport in different cellular compartments is essential. Post-translational modification of MTs is one mechanism by which neurons can regulate the cytoskeleton.\n\nThe carboxypeptidase CCP1 negatively regulates post-translational glutamylation of MTs. We previously demonstrated that the CCP1 homolog in C. elegans is important for maintenance of cilia. In mammals, loss of CCP1, and the resulting hyperglutamylation of MTs, causes neurodegeneration. It has long been known that CCP1 expression is activated by neuronal injury; however, whether CCP1 plays a neuroprotective role after injury is unknown. Furthermore, it not yet clear whether CCP1 acts on ciliary MTs in spinal cord neurons.\n\nUsing an in vitro model of excitotoxic neuronal injury coupled with shRNA-mediated knockdown of CCP1, we demonstrate that CCP1 protects neurons from excitotoxic death. Unexpectedly, excitotoxic injury reduced CCP1 expression in our system, and knockdown of CCP1 did not result in loss or shortening of cilia in cultured spinal cord neurons. Our results suggest that CCP1 acts on axonal and dendritic MTs to promote cytoskeletal rearrangements that support neuroregeneration and that enzymes responsible for glutamylation of MTs might be therapeutically targeted to prevent excitotoxic death after spinal cord injuries.",

Prior reports used cell lines to demonstrate the antiviral potential of nafamostat against coronaviral infections and determined its mechanism of action through inhibition of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). We selected a biologically relevant pre-clinical experimental model of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection using a 3D human reconstituted airway epithelial model of nasal origin to characterize the effects of nafamostat on tissue-level cellular ultrastructure and viral infection kinetics. Our results confirm the not only the relevance of this model for the preclinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of antiviral candidates, but also the highly potent nature of nafamostat SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity. The studies described herein provided evidence demonstrating the therapeutic potential of nafamostat against COVID-19, as well as its safety upon exposure to lung airway cellular.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUsing a human airway model, study demonstrates the powerful inhibitory effect of nafamostat on SARS-CoV-2 genome copy detection when applied apically.",

    "abstract": "Protein glycosylation is essential in all domains of life and its mutational impairment in humans can result in severe diseases named Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDGs). Studies on molecular level are however challenging, because many glycosyltransferases in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are low abundance membrane proteins. We established a comprehensive multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assay to quantify most human glycosyltransferases involved in the processes of N-glycosylation,O- and C-mannosylation in the ER. To increase reproducibility, a membrane protein fraction of isotopically labeled HEK 293T cells was used as an internal standard. With this internal standard the MRM assay is easily transferable between laboratories. 22 glycosyltransferases could be reliably quantified from whole cell lysates of HEK 293T cells, HeLa cells and skin fibroblast cell lines. We then analyzed fibroblasts derived from CDG type I patients with mutations in the ALG1,ALG2 or ALG11 gene. Mutations in ALG1 or ALG2 gene strongly reduced the levels of the ALG1 and ALG2 protein, respectively. In contrast, the levels of all other glycosyltransferases remained unchanged, which was unexpected given evidence that the ALG1, ALG2 and ALG11 proteins form a stable complex. This study describes an efficient workflow for the development of MRM assays for low abundance proteins, establishes a ready-to-use tool for the comprehensive quantification of ER-localized glycosyltransferases and provides new insight into the organization of disease-relevant glycosylation processes.",

    "abstract": "Despite renewed interest, development of chemical biology methods to study peptidoglycan metabolism has lagged in comparison to the glycobiology field in general. To address this, a panel of diamides were screened against the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae to identify inhibitors of bacterial growth. The screen identified the diamide fgkc as a narrow spectrum bacteriostatic inhibitor of S. pneumoniae growth with an MIC of 7.8 M. The diamide inhibited detergent-induced autolysis in a concentration dependent manner indicating peptidoglycan degradation as the mode-of-action. Genetic screening of autolysin mutants suggested LytB, an endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase, involved in cell division as the potential target. Surprisingly, biochemical, and phenotypic analysis contradicted the genetic screen results. Phenotypic studies with the{Delta} lytb strain illustrate the difference between genetic and chemical inactivation of autolysins. These findings suggest that meta-phenotypes including autolytic activity, cell morphology, and genetic screening can be the result of the complex interaction of one or more possible pathways that are connected to cell wall metabolism.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need for vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Encouraging progress has been made in developing antivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Among the drug targets being investigated, the viral main protease (Mpro) is one of the most extensively studied drug targets. Mpro is a cysteine protease that hydrolyzes the viral polyprotein at more than 11 sites and it is highly conserved among coronaviruses. In addition, Mpro has a unique substrate preference for glutamine in the P1 position. Taken together, it appears that Mpro inhibitors can achieve both broad-spectrum antiviral activity and a high selectivity index. Structurally diverse compounds have been reported as Mpro inhibitors, with several of which also showed antiviral activity in cell culture. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of six previously reported Mpro inhibitors, ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 using a consortium of techniques including FRET-based enzymatic assay, thermal shift assay, native mass spectrometry, cellular antiviral assays, and molecular dynamics simulations. Collectively, the results showed that the inhibition of Mpro by these six compounds is non-specific and the inhibition is abolished or greatly reduced with the addition of reducing reagent DTT. In the absence of DTT, these six compounds not only inhibit Mpro, but also a panel of viral cysteine proteases including SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease, the 2Apro and 3Cpro from enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and EV-D68. However, none of the compounds inhibits the viral replication of EV-A71 or EV-D68, suggesting that the enzymatic inhibition potency IC50 values obtained in the absence of DTT cannot be used to faithfully predict their cellular antiviral activity. Overall, we provide compelling evidence suggesting that ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 are non-specific SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors, and urge the scientific community to be stringent with hit validation.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=92 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/299164v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (13K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e68820org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f31c02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b406e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2fa8e8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The rather low diversity of samples used to construct existing catalogs of mouse gut metagenomes limits the size and numbers of identified genes in existing catalogs. We therefore established an expanded gene catalog of genes in the mouse gut metagenomes (EMGC) containing >5.8 million genes by integrating 88 newly sequenced samples, 86 mouse-gut-related bacterial genomes and 3 existing gene catalogs. EMGC increases the number on non-redundant genes by more than one million genes compared to the so far most extensive catalog. More than 50% of the genes in EMGC were taxonomically assigned and 30% were functionally annotated. 902 Metagenomic species (MGS) assigned to 122 taxa are identified based on the EMGC. The EMGC-based analysis of samples from groups of mice originating from different animal providers, housing laboratories and genetic strains substantiated that diet is a major contributor to differences in composition and functional potential of the gut microbiota irrespective of differences in environment and genetic background. We envisage that EMGC will serve as an efficient and resource-saving reference dataset for future metagenomic studies in mice.",

If tumors were affected by the wasting factors, mechanisms allowing tumors to evade the adverse effects of the wasting factors must exist and impairing such mechanisms may attenuate tumors. We used Drosophila midgut tumor models to show that tumors upregulate Wingless (Wg) to oppose the growth-impeding effects caused by the wasting factor, ImpL2 (Insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-related protein). Growth of Yorkie (Yki)-induced tumors is dependent on Wg while either elimination of ImpL2 or elevation of Insulin/IGF signaling in tumors revokes this dependency. Notably, Wg augmentation could be a general mechanism for supporting the growth of tumors with elevated ImpL2 and exploited to attenuate muscle degeneration during wasting. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which tumors negate the action of ImpL2 and implies that targeting the Wnt/Wg pathway might be an efficient treatment strategy for cancers with elevated IGFBPs.",

    "abstract": "Promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation represents a promising option for remyelination therapy for treating the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). The Wnt effector TCF7l2 was upregulated in MS lesions and had been proposed to inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation. Recent data suggest the opposite yet underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we unravel a previously unappreciated function of TCF7l2 in controlling autocrine bone morphogenetic protein (BMP4)-mediated signaling. Disrupting TCF7l2 results in oligodendroglial-specific BMP4 upregulation and canonical BMP4 signaling activation in vivo. Mechanistically, TCF7l2 binds to Bmp4 gene regulatory element and directly represses its transcriptional activity. Functionally, enforced TCF7l2 expression promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation by reducing autocrine BMP4 secretion and dampening BMP4 signaling. Importantly, compound genetic disruption demonstrates that oligodendroglial-specific BMP4 deletion rescues arrested oligodendrocyte differentiation elicited by TCF7l2 disruption in vivo. Collectively, our study reveals a novel connection between TCF7l2 and BMP4 in oligodendroglial lineage and provides new insights into augmenting TCF7l2 for promoting remyelination in demyelinating disorders such as MS.\n\nSignificance StatementIncomplete or failed myelin repairs, primarily resulting from the arrested differentiation of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes from oligodendroglial progenitor cells, is one of the major reasons for neurological progression in people affected by multiple sclerosis (MS). Using in vitro culture systems and in vivo animal models, this study unraveled a previously unrecognized autocrine regulation of BMP4-mediated signaling by the Wnt effector TCF7l2. We showed for the first time that TCF7l2 promotes oligodendroglial differentiation by repressing BMP4-mediated activity, which is dysregulated in MS lesions. Our study suggests that elevating TCF7l2 expression may be possible in overcoming arrested oligodendroglial differentiation as observed in MS patients.",

    "abstract": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a typically-lethal molecularly heterogeneous disease, with few broad-spectrum therapeutic targets. Unusually, most AML retain wild-type TP53, encoding the pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor p53. MDM2 inhibitors (MDM2i), which activate wild-type p53, and BET inhibitors (BETi), targeting the BET-family co-activator BRD4, both show encouraging pre-clinical activity, but limited clinical activity as single agents. Here, we report synergistic toxicity of combined MDM2i and BETi towards AML cell lines, primary human blasts and mouse models, resulting from BETis ability to evict an unexpected repressive form of BRD4 from p53 target genes, and hence potentiate MDM2i-induced p53 activation. These results indicate that wild-type TP53 and a transcriptional repressor function of BRD4 together represent a potential broad-spectrum synthetic therapeutic vulnerability for AML.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic plaques consist mostly of smooth muscle cells (SMC), and genes that influence SMC biology can modulate coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Allelic variation at 15q22.33 has been identified by genome-wide association studies to modify the risk of CAD, and is associated with expression of SMAD3 in SMC, but the mechanism by which this gene modifies CAD risk remains poorly understood. SMC-specific deletion of Smad3 in a murine atherosclerosis model resulted in greater plaque burden, positive remodeling, and increased vascular calcification. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses revealed that loss of Smad3 altered SMC progeny phenotype toward the previously described chondromyocyte fate, but importantly also promoted transition to a novel cell-state that governs remodeling and recruitment of inflammatory cells. This new remodeling population was marked by uniquely high Mmp3 and Cxcl12 expression, and its appearance correlated with higher-risk plaque features such as increased positive remodeling and macrophage content. Further, investigation of transcriptional mechanisms by which Smad3 alters SMC cell-fate revealed novel roles for Hox and Sox transcription factors whose direct interaction with Smad3 regulate an extensive transcriptional program balancing remodeling and vascular ECM with significant implications for human Mendelian aortic aneurysmal diseases. Together, these data suggest that Smad3 expression in SMC inhibits the emergence of specific SMC phenotypic transition cells that mediate adverse plaque features, including positive remodeling, monocyte recruitment, and vascular calcification.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) associated with severe acute respiratory disease (COVID-19) has prompted efforts to understand the genetic basis for its unique characteristics and its jump from non-primate hosts to humans. Tests for positive selection can identify apparently nonrandom patterns of mutation accumulation within genomes, highlighting regions where molecular function may have changed during the origin of a species. Several recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have identified signals of conservation and positive selection within the gene encoding Spike protein based on the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitution. Such tests cannot, however, detect changes in the function of RNA molecules.\n\nMethodsHere we apply a test for branch-specific oversubstitution of mutations within narrow windows of the genome without reference to the genetic code.\n\nResultsWe recapitulate the finding that the gene encoding Spike protein has been a target of both purifying and positive selection. In addition, we find other likely targets of positive selection within the genome of SARS-CoV-2, specifically within the genes encoding Nsp4 and Nsp16. Homology-directed modeling indicates no change in either Nsp4 or Nsp16 protein structure relative to the most recent common ancestor. Thermodynamic modeling of RNA stability and structure, however, indicates that RNA secondary structure within both genes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome differs from those of RaTG13, the reconstructed common ancestor, and Pan-CoV-GD (Guangdong). These SARS-CoV-2-specific mutations may affect molecular processes mediated by the positive or negative RNA molecules, including transcription, translation, RNA stability, and evasion of the host innate immune system. Our results highlight the importance of considering mutations in viral genomes not only from the perspective of their impact on protein structure, but also how they may impact other molecular processes critical to the viral life cycle.",

    "abstract": "The kinetic skull is a key innovation that allowed snakes to capture, manipulate, and swallow prey exclusively using their heads using the coordinated movement of 8 bones. Despite these unique feeding behaviors, patterns of evolutionary integration and modularity within the feeding bones of snakes in a phylogenetic framework have yet to be addressed. Here, we use a dataset of 60 {micro}CT scanned skulls and high-density geometric morphometric methods to address the origin and patterns of variation and integration in the feeding bones of aquatic-foraging snakes. By comparing alternate superimposition protocols allowing us to analyze the entire kinetic feeding system simultaneously, we find that the feeding bones are highly integrated, driven predominantly by functional selective pressures. The most supported pattern of modularity contains four modules each associated with distinct functional roles: the mandible, the palatopterygoid arch, the maxilla, and the suspensorium. Further, the morphological disparity of each bone is not linked to its magnitude of integration, indicating that integration within the feeding system does not constrain morphological evolution and that adequate biomechanical solutions to a wide range of feeding ecologies and behaviors is readily evolvable within the constraint due to integration in the snake feeding system.",

    "abstract": "Higher eukaryotic cell lines like HEK293 are the preferred hosts for production of therapeutic proteins requiring human post translational processing. However, recombinant protein production can result in severe stress on the cellular machinery, resulting in limited titre and product quality. To investigate the cellular and metabolic characteristics associated with these limitations, we compared erythropoietin (secretory) and GFP (non-secretory) protein producer HEK293 cell-lines using transcriptomics analysis. Despite the high demand for ATP in all protein producer clones, a significantly higher capacity for ATP production was observed with erythropoietin producers as evidenced by the enrichment of upregulated genes in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. In addition, ribosomal genes exhibited specific patterns of expression depending on the recombinant protein and the production rate. In a clone displaying a dramatically increased erythropoietin secretion, we detected higher ER stress, including upregulation of the ATF6B gene. Our results are significant in recognizing key pathways for recombinant protein production and identifying potential target genes for further development of secretory power in mammalian cell factories.\n\nIn BriefAlthough the protein secretion process has been widely studied, the complexity of it leaves many questions with regards to defining bottlenecks for successful protein secretion to be answered. By investigating the transcriptomic profiles of different HEK293 clones with varying translational rates producing either the secreted protein erythropoietin or the intracellular GFP, we reveal that high ATP production and improved capacity of specific post-translational pathways are key factors associated with boosting erythropoietin production.\n\nHighlightsO_LITranscriptomics analysis of a panel of HEK293 stable cell lines expressing GFP or erythropoietin (EPO) at varying translational rates\nC_LIO_LIExpression of mitochondrial ribosomal genes is positively correlated with EPO secretion\nC_LIO_LIExpression of different cytosolic ribosomal genes are correlated with productivity in a recombinant-protein specific manner\nC_LIO_LIHigh EPO producing clones have significant upregulation of ATF6B, potentially enabling a beneficial ER stress response to cope with high protein secretion\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/299966v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (87K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e35efforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@71cee2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c56d33org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@843a6f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

To understand the responses of cellular RBPs to an immune elicitor, we applied RNA interactome capture to Arabidopsis leaves treated with flg22. Strikingly, flg22 induced a pervasive remodelling of the cellular RBPome affecting 186 proteins. Flg22-responsive RBPs included classical RBPs involved in RNA metabolism as well as non-canonical RBPs. RBP responders detected after 2h of treatment are enriched in putative sites for post-translational modifications, which may play a regulatory role. By contrast, changes in RBP abundance becomes increasingly important for the RBPome responses to flg22 after 12h. Plant resistance to Pseudomonas syringae is strongly altered in mutant lines lacking individual flg22-responsive RBPs, supporting the importance of RBP dynamics in plant immunity. This study provides a comprehensive and systematic census of flg22 responsive plant RBPs, discovering novel components of plant immunity.",

    "abstract": "During spaceflight and immediately after it, adaptive neuroplastic changes occur in the sensorimotor structures of the central nervous system, which are associated with changes of mainly vestibular and visual signals. It is known that the movement of the eyeball in the vertical direction is carried out by muscles that are innervated by the trochlear nerve (CN IV) and the oculomotor nerve (CN III). To elucidate the cellular processes underlying the atypical vertical nystagmus that occurs under microgravity conditions, it seems necessary to study the state of these nuclei in animals in more detail after prolonged space flights. In this work, we carried out a qualitative and quantitative light-optical and ultrastructural analysis of the nuclei of the trochlear nerve in mice after a 30-day flight on the Bion-M1 biosatellite and followed by a stay for 13-14 hours under the influence of the Earths gravity after landing. As a result, it was shown that the motoneurons in the nucleus of the trochlear nerve changed their morphology under the influence of microgravity. Cell nuclei of the motoneurons had a more simplified rounded shape than in the control. In addition, the dendrites of these motoneurons significantly reorganized geometry and orientation under microgravity conditions; the number of dendritic branches has been increased to enhance the reduced signal flow. Apparently, to ensure such plastic changes, the number and size of mitochondria in the soma of motoneurons and in axons coming from the vestibular structures increased. In addition, the experimental animals showed an increase in the size of the cisterns of the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in comparison with the control group of animals left on Earth, for which the environmental conditions in the spacecraft were reproduced. Thus, the main role in the adaptation of the trochlear nucleus to microgravity conditions, apparently, belongs to the dendrites of motoneurons, which rearrange their structure and function to enhance the flow of sensory information. These results are useful for the development of new, more effective means to facilitate the stay and work of space travelers in a long spaceflight.",

    "abstract": "Use of polyethylene beads in facial cleansers has been continuously questioned by scientific communities for they adversely affect aquatic organisms once these beads find their way into their habitats. This study specifically aims to determine Danio rerio mortality rate using lethal endpoints and to evaluate sublethal teratogenic effects in Danio rerio due to polyethylene microbead exposure. Danio rerio, a model organism for ecotoxicology, was subjected to the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity Test. Embryos were exposed to polyethylene microbead suspensions (PE-MBS) of varying concentrations (i.e., 20 g/L, 200 g/L, 2000 g/L). They were also exposed to 5% ethanol (positive control), reconstituted water (negative control), 0.01% Tween 80 (emulsifier control), and 1% DMSO (solvent control). Toxicological endpoints (i.e., egg coagulation, lack of somite formation, non-detachment of tail, and lack of heartbeat) were observed every 24 hours until the 96th hour exposure. Hatching was observed from 48 hpf while teratogenicity was observed at 144 hpf. Significant differences between means and variances were observed for all treatment groups in relation to the negative control. For all groups, 0.01% Tween 80, 1% DMSO and 20 g/L PE-MBS did not significantly differ with the negative control due to negligible concentration but 5% ethanol and higher concentrations of PE-MBS did. This indicated that high concentrations of PE-MBS exposure may induce early hatching, mortality, increased malformation, and increased heart rate. Tukey Kramer post hoc Test substantiated that PE-MBS toxicity is dose dependent since embryotoxicity and teratogenicity increases at higher concentrations. LC50 obtained using probit analysis based on experimental data was 2455.096 g/L, and was higher than the concentrations used in this study. Further studies should be conducted to know more about the adverse effects of polyethylene microbeads to the biota.\n\nAuthor SummaryMargaret De Guzman, MSc, Patricia Chua, and Franceska Sedano have all equally contributed to this work in conceptualization, formal analysis, funding acquisition, and investigation.

    "abstract": "Alkane-based biofuels are desirable to produce at a commercial scale as these have properties similar to our current petroleum-derived transportation fuels. Rationally engineering microorganisms to produce a desirable compound, such as alkanes, is, however, challenging. Metabolic engineers are therefore increasingly implementing evolutionary engineering approaches combined with high-throughput screening tools, including metabolite biosensors, to identify productive targets. Engineering Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce alkanes can be facilitated by using an alkane-responsive biosensor, which can potentially be developed from the native alkane-sensing system in Yarrowia lipolytica, a well-known alkane-assimilating yeast. This putative alkane-sensing system is, at least, based on three different transcription factors (TFs) named Yas1p, Yas2p and Yas3p. Although this system is not fully elucidated in Y. lipolytica, we were interested in evaluating the possibility of translating this system into an alkane-responsive biosensor in S. cerevisiae. We evaluated the alkane-sensing system in S. cerevisiae by developing one sensor based on the native Y. lipolytica ALK1 promoter and one sensor based on the native S. cerevisiae CYC1 promoter. In both systems, we found that the TFs Yas1p, Yas2p and Yas3p do not seem to act in the same way as these have been reported to do in their native host. Additional analysis of the TFs suggests that more knowledge regarding their mechanism is needed before a potential alkane-responsive sensor based on the Y. lipolytica system can be established in S. cerevisiae.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is implicated in the onset and progression of various diseases, including cerebral pathologies. Here we report that DJ-1, which plays a role within cells as an antioxidant protein, functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), and triggers inflammation if released from dead cells into the extracellular space. We first found that recombinant DJ-1 protein induces the production of various inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). We further identified a unique peptide sequence in the G and H helices of DJ-1 that activates Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4. In the ischemic brain, DJ-1 is released into the extracellular space from necrotic neurons within 24 hours after stroke onset and makes direct contact with the surfaces of infiltrating myeloid cells. Administration of an antibody against DJ-1 suppresses the expression of inflammatory cytokines in infiltrating immune cells and attenuates ischemic neuronal damage. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown function of DJ-1 as a DAMP and suggest that extracellular DJ-1 could be a therapeutic target to prevent inflammation in tissue injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nSignificance statementDJ-1 has been thoroughly investigated as a cytoprotective antioxidant protein in neurons. However, here we demonstrate that extracellularly released DJ-1 triggers neurotoxic inflammation after ischemic stroke. Intracellular DJ-1 increases in response to oxidative stress in ischemic neurons, but if ischemic stresses result in necrotic cell death, DJ-1 is released extracellularly. Released DJ-1 interacts with TLR2 and TLR4 on the surface of infiltrating myeloid cells and triggers post-ischemic inflammation, leading to the exacerbated pathologies of ischemic stroke. Thus, extracellular DJ-1 is a previously unknown inflammatogenic DAMP, and may be a putative target for therapeutic intervention to prevent progression of inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "A therapeutic vaccine that induces lasting control of HIV infection has the potential to eliminate the need for lifelong adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study investigated the efficacy of a therapeutic DNA vaccine delivered with a novel combination of adjuvants and immunomodulators to augment T cell immunity in the blood and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. In SIV-infected rhesus macaques, a DNA vaccine delivered by intradermal electroporation and expressing SIV Env, Gag, and Pol, and a combination of adjuvant plasmids expressing the catalytic A1 subunit of E. coli heat labile enterotoxin (LTA1), IL-12, IL-33, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 and the immunomodulators soluble PD-1 and soluble CD80, significantly enhanced the breadth and magnitude of Gag-specific IFN-{gamma} T cell responses when compared to controls that were mock vaccinated or received the same DNA vaccine delivered by Gene Gun with a single adjuvant, the E. coli heat labile enterotoxin, LT. Notably, the DNA vaccine and adjuvant combination protected 3/5 animals from viral rebound, compared to only 1/4 mock vaccinated animals and 1/5 animals that received the DNA vaccine and LT. The lower viral burden among controllers during analytical treatment interruption significantly correlated with higher polyfunctional CD8+ T-cells (CD8+ T cells expressing 3 or more effector functions) in both mesenteric lymph nodes and blood measured during ART and analytical treatment interruption. Interestingly, controllers also had lower viral loads during acute infection and ART suggesting that inherent host-viral interactions induced prior to ART initiation likely influenced the response to therapeutic vaccination. These data indicate that gut mucosal immune responses combined with effective ART may play a key role in containing residual virus post-ART and highlight the need for therapeutic vaccines and adjuvants that can restore functional quality of peripheral and mucosal T cell responses before and during ART.\n\nAuthor SummaryHIV has caused significant human disease and mortality since its emergence in the 1980s. Furthermore, although antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively reduces viral replication, stopping ART leads to increased viral loads and disease progression in most HIV-infected people. A therapeutic vaccine could enable HIV-infected people to control their infection without ART, but none of the vaccines that were tested in clinical trials so far have induced long-lasting control of virus replication. Here, we used the SIV rhesus macaque model to test a therapeutic vaccine consisting of DNA expressing SIV proteins and a novel combination of adjuvants to boost virus-specific immune responses. We found that our vaccine strategy significantly enhanced SIV-specific T cell responses when compared to controls and protected 3/5 animals from viral rebound. We determined that lower levels of virus replication post-ART were associated with enhanced T cell immunity in the gut-draining lymph nodes and blood. Our study highlights the critical role of T cell immunity for control of SIV and HIV replication and demonstrates that a successful therapeutic vaccine for HIV will need to elicit potent T cell responses in both the blood and gut-associated tissues.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecurrence is a hallmark of ocular toxoplasmosis (OT), and conditions that influence its occurrence remain a challenge. Natural killer cells (NK) are effectors cells whose primary function is the cytotoxic activity against many parasites, including Toxoplasma gondii. Among the NK cell receptors, immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) deserve attention due to their high polymorphism. This study aimed to analyze the influence of KIR gene polymorphism in the course of OT infection and its association with recurrences after an active episode.\n\nMethodsNinety-six patients from the Ophthalmologic Clinic of the National Institute of Infectology Evandro Chagas (INI/Fiocruz/RJ, Brazil) were followed for up to five years. After DNA extraction, genotyping of the patients was performed by PCR-SSO utilizing Luminex equipment for reading. During follow-up, 57.4% had a recurrence.\n\nResultsWe identified 25 KIR genotypes and found a higher frequency of genotypes 1 (31.7%) with worldwide distribution. We note that the KIR2DL2 inhibitor gene and the gene activator KIR2DS2 were more frequent in patients without recurrence (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02, respectively). Additionally, we observed one activating gene, KIR2DS1, associated with more than four times faster progression to the development of recurrent ocular toxoplasmosis than individuals without this gene (aRR = 4.6, P = 0.04).\n\nConclusionThe KIR2DL2 and KIR2DS2 are associated as possible protection markers and the KIR2DS1 acting as a possible susceptibility marker. Additionally, the lower proportion of activating genes observed in individuals with recurrence corroborating with the hypothesis that these individuals are more susceptible to ocular toxoplasmosis recurrence (OTR).",

    "abstract": "The alignment of primary sequences is a fundamental step in the analysis of protein structure, function, and evolution. Integral membrane proteins pose a significant challenge for such sequence alignment approaches, because their evolutionary relationships can be very remote, and because a high content of hydrophobic amino acids reduces their complexity. Frequently, biochemical or biophysical data is available that informs the optimum alignment, for example, indicating specific positions that share common functional or structural roles. Currently, if those positions are not correctly aligned by a standard pairwise alignment procedure, the incorporation of such information into the alignment is typically addressed in an ad hoc manner, with manual adjustments. However, such modifications are problematic because they reduce the robustness and reproducibility of the alignment. An alternative approach is the use of restraints, or anchors, to incorporate such position-matching explicitly during alignment. Here we introduce position anchoring in the alignment tool AlignMe as an aid to pairwise sequence alignment of membrane proteins. Applying this approach to realistic scenarios involving distantly-related and low complexity sequences, we illustrate how the addition of even a single anchor can dramatically improve the accuracy of the alignments, while maintaining the reproducibility and rigor of the overall alignment.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAccess to biological sequence data, such as genome, transcript, or protein sequence, is at the core of many bioinformatics analysis workflows. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Ensembl, and other sequence database maintainers provide methods to access sequences through network connections. For many users, the convenience and currency of remotely managed data are compelling, and the network latency is non-consequential. However, for high-throughput and clinical applications, local sequence collections are essential for performance, stability, privacy, and reproducibility.\n\nResultsHere we describe SeqRepo, a novel system for building a local, high-performance, non-redundant collection of biological sequences. SeqRepo enables clients to use primary database identifiers and several digests to identify sequences and sequence alises. SeqRepo provides a native Python interface and a REST interface, which can run locally and enables access from other programming languages. SeqRepo also provides an alternative REST interface based on the GA4GH refget protocol.\n\nSeqRepo provides fast random access to sequence slices. We provide results that demonstrate that a local SeqRepo sequence collection yields significant performance benefits of up to 1300-fold over remote sequence collections. In our use case for a variant validation and normalization pipeline, SeqRepo improved throughput 50-fold relative to use with remote sequences. SeqRepo may be used with any species or sequence type. Regular snapshots of Human sequence collections are available.\n\nIt is often convenient or necessary to use a computed digest as a sequence identifier. For example, a digest-based identifier may be used to refer to proprietary reference genomes or segments of a graph genome, for which conventional identifiers will not be available. Here we also introduce a convention for the application of the SHA-512 hashing algorithm with Base64 encoding to generate URL-safe identifiers. This convention, sha512t24u, combines a fast digest mechanism with a space-efficient representation that can be used for any object. Our report includes an analysis of timing and collision probabilities for sha512t24u. SeqRepo enables clients to use sha512t24u as identifiers, thereby seamlessly integrating public and private sequence sets.\n\nAvailabilitySeqRepo is released under the Apache License 2.0 and is available on github and PyPi. Docker images and database snapshots are also available. See https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo.",

    "abstract": "Tomato leaves were inoculated with 1x104conidia{middle dot}mL-1 and placed in a dew chamber for 0 to 18hrs at 10 to 25{degrees}C. Eighteen days after inoculation, leaf mold incidence appeared in 9hr treatment of leaf wet duration and the proper temperature was 15 to 20{degrees}C. In 10 and 25{degrees}C treatments, the incidence rate was 0% and 4.2%, respectively. The most important factors regard to leaf mold incidence were leaf wet duration and temperature. Considering the proper tomato growth temperature is 15-25{degrees}C, control by leaf wet duration is easier than control by temperature to prevent leaf mold incidence. After leaf mold inoculation, incidence appeared at 20 days and the latency period was estimated as 14-15 days. The leaf mold incidence rate was the highest at 15{degrees}C and 20{degrees}C. When  trihumin (triflumizole 30%) was applied at 12 hr of leaf wet duration, the control effect was the highest at 90% up to 168 hr but after 240 hr, it dropped to 60%. When  Demani B (polyoxin B 50%) was applied at 12 hour of leaf wet duration, the control effect was the highest at 91% up to 144hr but after 240hr, it dropped to 58%, similar to trihumin application treatment.
