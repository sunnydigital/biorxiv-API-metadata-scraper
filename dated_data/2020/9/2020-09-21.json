    "abstract": "The gastrointestinal (GI) tract constitutes an essential barrier against ingested pathogens. While immune reactions are well-studied in the lower GI tract, it remains unclear how adaptive immune responses are initiated during microbial challenge of the oral mucosa, the primary site of pathogen encounter in the upper GI tract. Here, we identify mandibular lymph nodes (mandLN) as sentinel lymphoid organs that collect orally administered Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), leading to local CD8+ T cell activation. In contrast to CD8+ T effector cells (TEFF) generated in mesenteric lymph nodes, mandLN CD8+ TEFF lacked a gut-seeking phenotype but contributed to systemic host protection. Accordingly, mandLN stromal and dendritic cells expressed low levels of enzymes required for gut homing imprinting. Our findings extend the concept of regional specialization of immune responses along the length of the GI tract, with mandLN acting as oral lymph-draining counterparts of intestinal lymph-draining LN of the lower GI tract.\n\nSummaryListeria monocytogenes ingestion leads to priming of cytotoxic T cells in oral mucosa draining mandibular lymph nodes, which contribute to systemic host protection.",

    "abstract": "Immature neutrophils and HLA-DRneg/low monocytes expand in cancer, autoimmune diseases and viral infections, but their appearance and functional characteristics after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remain underexplored. We found an expansion of circulating immature CD16+CD66b+CD10neg neutrophils and CD14+HLA-DRneg/low monocytes in patients with AMI, correlating with cardiac damage, function and serum levels of immune-inflammation markers. Increased frequency of immature CD10neg neutrophils and elevated circulating levels of IFN-{gamma} were linked, mainly in cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seropositive patients with high anti-CMV antibody titers and expanded CD4+CD28null T-cells. At a mechanistic level, CD10neg neutrophils enhance IFN-{gamma} production by CD4+ T-cells through induction of interleukin-12. Moreover, we showed that HLA-DRneg/low monocytes are not immunosuppressive but secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after differentiation to macrophages and IFN-{gamma} stimulation. Thus, the immunoregulatory functions of immature CD10neg neutrophils play a dynamic role in mechanisms linking myeloid cell compartment dysregulation, Th1-type immune responses and inflammation in patients with AMI.",

    "abstract": "Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are disease vectors responsible for the transmission of several viruses of economic and animal health importance. The recent deployment of Wolbachia with pathogen-blocking capacity to control viral disease transmission by mosquitoes has led to a focus on the potential use of endosymbionts to control arboviruses transmitted by other vector species. Previous screens of Culicoides have described the presence of Candidatus Cardinium hertigii (Bacteroidetes). However, the biological impact of this symbiont is yet to be uncovered and awaits a suitable system to study Cardinium-midge interactions. To identify candidate species to investigate these interactions, accurate knowledge of the distribution of the symbiont within Culicoides populations is needed. We used a sensitive nested PCR assay to screen Cardinium infection in 337 individuals of 25 Culicoides species from both Palearctic and Afrotropical regions. Infections were observed in several vector species including C. imicola and the pulicaris complex (C. pulicaris, C. bysta, C. newsteadi and C. punctatus) with prevalence ranging from low and intermediate, to fixation. Infection in C. pulicaris was very rare in comparison to a previous study, and there is evidence the prior record of high prevalence represents a laboratory contamination error. Phylogenetic analysis based on the Gyrase B gene sequence grouped all new isolates within \"group C\" of the genus, a clade which has to date been exclusively described in Culicoides. Through a comparison of our results with previous screens, we evaluate the suitability of Cardinium-infected species for future work pertaining to the symbiont.",

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of Acanthamoeba polyphaga Mimivirus, the first giant virus of amoeba, the historical hallmarks defining a virus have been challenged. Giant virion sizes can reach up to 2.3 {micro}m, making them visible by optical microscopy. They have large genomes of up to 2.5 Mb that encode proteins involved in the translation apparatus. Herein, we investigated possible energy production in Pandoravirus massiliensis, the largest of our giant virus collection. MitoTracker and TMRM mitochondrial membrane markers allowed for the detection of a membrane potential in virions that could be abolished by the use of the depolarizing agent CCCP. An attempt to identify enzymes involved in energy metabolism revealed that 8 predicted proteins of P. massiliensis exhibited low sequence identities with defined proteins involved in the universal tricarboxylic acid cycle (acetyl Co-A synthase; citrate synthase; aconitase; isocitrate dehydrogenase; -ketoglutarate decarboxylase; succinate dehydrogenase; fumarase). All 8 viral predicted ORFs were transcribed together during viral replication, mainly at the end of the replication cycle. Two of these proteins were detected in mature viral particles by proteomics. The product of the ORF132, a predicted protein of P. massiliensis, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, provided a functional isocitrate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which converts isocitrate to -ketoglutarate. We observed that membrane potential was enhanced by low concentrations of Acetyl-CoA, a regulator of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Our findings show for the first time that energy production can occur in viruses, namely, pandoraviruses, and the involved enzymes are related to tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. The presence of a proton gradient in P. massiliensis coupled with the observation of genes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle make this virus a form a life for which it is legitimate to question  what is a virus?.",

Yet AMF also perform other essential functions, notably improving plant-water relations2. Some research attributes the role of AMF in plant-water relations solely to enhancing plant nutrition and osmoregulation for plants partnered with AMF3,4,5, while indirect evidence suggests AMF may transport water to plants1,6,7. Here, we used isotopically-labeled water and a fluorescent dye to directly track and quantify water transport by AMF to plants in a greenhouse experiment. We specifically assessed whether AMF can access water in soil unavailable to plants and transport it across an air gap to host plants. Plants grown with AMF that had access to a physically separated 18O-labeled water source transpired twice as much, and this transpired water contained three times as much label compared to plants with AMF with no access to the separated labeled water source. We estimated that water transported by AMF could explain 46.2% of the water transpired. In addition, a fluorescent dye indicated that water was transported via an extracytoplasmic hyphal pathway.",

    "abstract": "RationaleEndogenously cycling adult cardiomyocytes (CMs) increase after myocardial infarction (MI) but remain scare, and are generally thought not to contribute to myocardial function. However, this broadly held assumption has not been tested, mainly because of the lack of transgenic reporters that restrict Cre expression to adult CMs that reenter the cell cycle.\n\nObjectiveWe created and validated a new transgenic mouse, MHC-MerDreMer-Ki67p-RoxedCre::Rox-Lox-tdTomato-eGFP (denoted DKRC) that restricts Cre expression to cycling adult CMs and uniquely integrates spatial and temporal adult CM cycling events based on the DNA specificities of orthologous Dre- and Cre recombinases. We then created mice that expressed an inducible Diphtheria toxin (DTA), DKRC::DTA mice, in adult cycling CMs and examined the effects of ablating these endogenously cycling CMs on myocardial function after Ischemic-Reperfusion (I/R) MI.\n\nMethods and ResultsA tandem DKRC transgene was designed, validated in cultured cells, and used to make transgenic mice. The DKRC transgene integrated between MYH6 and MYH7 and did not disrupt expression of the surrounding genes. Compared to controls, DKRC::RLTG mice treated with Tamoxifen expressed tdTomato+ in CMs with rare Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)+, eGFP+ CMs, consistent with reentry of the cell cycle. We then pre- treated DKRC::RLTG mice with Tamoxifen to activate the reporter before sham or reperfusion (I/R) myocardial infarction (MI) surgeries. Compared to Sham surgery, the I/R MI group had increased single and paired eGFP+ CMs predominantly in the border zones (5.8 {+/-} 0.5 vs. 3.3 {+/-} 0.3 CMs per ten-micron section, N = 8 mice, n = 16 sections per mouse), indicative of cycled CMs. The single to paired eGFP+ CM ratio was [~]9 to 1 (5.2 {+/-} 0.4 single vs. 0.6 {+/-} 0.2 paired CMs) in the I/R MI group after MI, suggesting that cycling CMs were more likely to undergo polyploidy than replication. The ablation of endogenously cycling adult CMs in DKRC::DTA mice caused progressive worsening left ventricular chamber size and function after I/R MI, compared to controls.\n\nConclusionsAlthough scarce, endogenously cycling adult CMs contribute to myocardial function after injury, suggesting that these cells may be physiologically relevant.",

    "abstract": "Previous work with cultured cells has shown transcription of muscle genes by serum response factor (SRF) can be stimulated by actin polymerization driven by proteins of the formin family. However, it is not clear if endogenous formins similarly promote SRF-dependent transcription during muscle development in vivo. We tested whether formin activity promotes SRF-dependent transcription in striated muscle in the simple animal model, Caenorhabditis elegans. Our lab has shown FHOD-1 is the only formin that directly promotes sarcomere formation in the worms striated muscle. We show here FHOD-1 and SRF homolog UNC-120 both support muscle growth and also muscle myosin II heavy chain expression. However, while a hypomorphic unc-120 allele blunts transcription of a set of striated muscle genes, these genes are upregulated or unchanged by absence of FHOD-1. Instead, pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome restores myosin protein levels in worms lacking FHOD-1, suggesting elevated proteolysis accounts for their myosin deficit. Interestingly, proteasome inhibition does not restore normal muscle growth to fhod-1({Delta}) mutants, suggesting formin contributes to muscle growth by some alternative mechanism. Overall, we find SRF does not depend on formin to promote muscle gene transcription in a simple in vivo system.",

To address this, we employed small molecule targeting of the endocannabinoid receptor signaling pathway, JNK and FOXO1, known to mediate endodermal development and/or hormone production, together with directed differentiation of human ISCs from the duodenum and rectum. We observed marked induction of EE cell differentiation and gut-derived expression and secretion of SST, 5HT, GIP, CCK, GLP-1 and PYY upon treatment with various combinations of three small molecules: rimonabant, SP600125 and AS1842856.

Using a gradient of reef degradation, we show that the gut microbiome of a facultative, coral-feeding butterflyfish (Chaetodon capistratus) is significantly more variable among individuals at degraded reefs with very low live coral cover (~0%) than reefs with higher coral cover (~30%), mirroring a known pattern of microbial imbalance observed in immunodeficient humans and other stressed or diseased animals. We demonstrate that fish gut microbiomes on severely degraded reefs have a lower abundance of Endozoicomonas and a higher diversity of anaerobic fermentative bacteria, which suggests a broader and less coral dominated diet. The observed shifts in fish gut bacterial communities across the habitat gradient extend to a small set of potentially beneficial host associated bacteria (i.e., the core microbiome) suggesting essential fish-microbiome interactions are vulnerable to severe coral degradation.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) represent a large and dynamic portion of most eukaryotic genomes, yet little is known about their mutation rates or the correspondence between rates and long-term patterns of accrual. We compare TE activity over long and short time periods by quantifying TE profiles and mutation rates (with and without minimizing selection) among 9 genotypes from three populations of Daphnia magna sampled along a latitudinal gradient. The patterns of genome-wide variation observed in nature mirror direct estimates of rates and spectra observed in a multi-year laboratory mutation accumulation experiment, where net rates range from -11.98 to 12.79 x 10-5 per copy per generation across genotypes. Overall, gains outnumber losses and both types of events are highly deleterious based on comparing lines with and without selection minimized. The rate and spectrum of TE mutations vary widely among genotypes and across TE families/types, even within the same population. We compare TE mutation rates to previously published rates of base substitution, microsatellite mutation, and gene conversion for the same genotypes, and show a correlation only with the latter. Our study provides strong evidence for the notion that TEs represent a highly mutagenic force in the genome. Furthermore, the variation we observe underscores the need to expand the repertoire of mutations studied to include a wider array of mutation types with different underlying mechanisms in order to better understand the evolution of the mutation rate and the ways in which genetic variation is generated genome wide.",

    "abstract": "Fungi are prolific producers of natural products, compounds which have had a large societal impact as pharmaceuticals, mycotoxins, and agrochemicals. Despite the availability of over 1000 fungal genomes and several decades of compound discovery efforts from fungi, the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoded by these genomes and the associated chemical space have yet to be analyzed systematically. Here we provide detailed annotation and analyses of fungal biosynthetic and chemical space to enable genome mining and discovery of fungal natural products. Using 1037 genomes from species across the fungal kingdom (e.g., Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and non-Dikarya taxa), 36,399 predicted BGCs were organized into a network of 12,067 gene cluster families (GCFs). Anchoring these GCFs with reference BGCs enabled automated annotation of 2,026 BGCs with predicted metabolite scaffolds. We performed parallel analyses of the chemical repertoire of Fungi, organizing 15,213 fungal compounds into 2,945 molecular families (MFs). The taxonomic landscape of fungal GCFs is largely species-specific, though select families such as the equisetin GCF are present across vast phylogenetic distances with parallel diversifications in the GCF and MF. We compare these fungal datasets with a set of 5,453 bacterial genomes and their BGCs and 9,382 bacterial compounds, revealing dramatic differences between bacterial and fungal biosynthetic logic and chemical space. These genomics and cheminformatics analyses reveal the large extent to which fungal and bacterial sources represent distinct compound reservoirs. With a >10-fold increase in the number of interpreted strains and annotated BGCs, this work better regularizes the biosynthetic potential of fungi for rational compound discovery.\n\nSignificance StatementFungi represent an underexploited resource for new compounds with applications in the pharmaceutical and agriscience industries. Despite the availability of >1000 fungal genomes, our knowledge of the biosynthetic space encoded by these genomes is limited and ad hoc. We present results from systematically organizing the biosynthetic content of 1037 fungal genomes, providing a resource for data-driven genome mining and large-scale comparison of the genetic and molecular repertoires produced in fungi and compare to those present in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for invasive breast cancer improves patient survival. Unfortunately, long-term treatment comes with side effects that impact health and quality of life, including hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue. Partly due to a lack of proven animal models, the tissues and cell types that mediate these negative side effects are largely unknown. Here we show that mice undergoing a 28-day course of tamoxifen treatment experience dysregulation of core and skin temperature, changes in bone density, and decreased physical activity, recapitulating key aspects of the human physiological response. Single cell RNA sequencing reveals that tamoxifen treatment induces significant and widespread gene expression changes in different cell types of the hypothalamus, most strongly in neurons and ependymal cells. These expression changes are dependent on estrogen receptor alpha (ER), as conditional knockout of ER in the hypothalamus ablated or reversed tamoxifen-induced gene expression. Accordingly, ER-deficient mice do not exhibit changes in thermal regulation, bone density, or movement in response to tamoxifen treatment. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the effects of tamoxifen on the hypothalamus and support a model in which hypothalamic ER mediates several key side effects of tamoxifen therapy.",

Here we report on the genome-wide binding dynamics of components from both PRC1 and PRC2 in the developing limb. We show that a large proportion of PRC-bound promoters are occupied exclusively by PRC1, suggesting a more extensive PRC1-specific activity than anticipated. We found that PRC1 (RING1B) and PRC2 (SUZ12) co-occupy the promoters of developmental genes, for which a subset become up-regulated upon the inactivation of PRC2. Strikingly, we found that RING1B occupancy is largely unaffected by the loss of PRC2, revealing a complex functional relationship between these two complexes in regulating gene expression and possibly an expansive functional interplay between canonical and non-canonical PRC1.",

It was classified as \"Endangered\" by IUCN in 2017. Detailed demographic and distribution information about T. pelengensis in the wild is not available even though they are crucial to setting up conservation priorities and strategies. The aim of this study was to analyze distribution, and population of T. pelengensis across the island group. Surveys were conducted over approximately five months in 2017 and 2018 across Peleng and the neighboring islands of Banggai, Labobo, and Bangkurung. It is now established that tarsiers occur on two of the major islands, namely Peleng and Banggai Island proper. Average density in Peleng and Banggai islands were estimated to be 247 individuals/km2, and this roughly fall within the broad ranges of tarsier densities in Sulawesi and offshore islands. In stark contrast to the only previously available supposition of distribution and conservation status (IUCN 2017), Tarsiers were found in nearly all elevations (0-937 m above sea level) and all habitats in Peleng island. There is also an entire newly discovered population in Banggai Island proper, which similarly distributed in varied habitats. Therefore, the conservation status of Peleng tarsier needs to be re-evaluated.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater ecosystems of tropical urban canals systems (TrUCS), are highly dynamic and experience constant pressures from interspersed effects of land-use and rain. The dynamic nature of TrUCS ecosystems presents a unique opportunity to unravel the signature interactions between the macro-organisms (top-down), sedimentary microbial communities (SedMICs), their functioning and the geochemical environment (bottom-up). A systems level understanding of the molecular and mechanistic basis of the highly dynamic behaviour that leads to specific ecosystem outcomes, is currently lacking. Therefore, a research framework to identify the direct link between top-down and bottom-up ecological effects on SedMICs in a highly dynamic urban canal sedimentary system is needed. Here, we present a framework of integrated multi-dimensional data across system-level biotic and abiotic ecological descriptors, such as environmental variables and active SedMICs. We followed the ecosystem shifts after a natural disturbance (rain) in two different anthropogenic disturbance (land-use) regimes. Shifts in profiles of metabolically active community were conserved across different land-use types, indicating resilience to perturbation is an intrinsic property of the TrUCs ecosystem. Three distinct phases, which were dominated sequentially by autotrophy, anoxic-heterotrophy and oxic-heterotrophy, were identified within these shifts. The first two phases were influenced by the bottom-up effects of specific metal-ion combinations of nitrates and sulfates with magnesium, aluminum and iron, and the third phase was triggered by top-down influences of bioturbation. This generalized systems-level approach, which provides an ecosystem-centric understanding of TrUCS and integrates them in sustainable management practices, can also be extended to other freshwater ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Microplastics may affect soil ecosystem functioning in critical ways, with previously documented effects including changes in soil structure and water dynamics; this suggests that microbial populations and the processes they mediate could also be affected. Given the importance for global carbon and nitrogen cycle and greenhouse warming potential, we here experimentally examined potential effects of plastic microfiber additions on CO2 and N2O greenhouse gas fluxes. We carried out a fully factorial laboratory experiment with the factors presence of microplastic fibers (0.4% w/w) and addition of urea fertilizer (100 mg N kg-1). The conditions in an intensively N-fertilized arable soil were simulated by adding biogas digestate at the beginning of the incubation to all samples. We continuously monitored CO2 and N2O emissions from soil before and after urea application using a custom-built flow-through steady-state system, and we assessed soil properties, including soil structure. Microplastics affected soil properties, notably increasing soil aggregate water-stability and pneumatic conductivity, and caused changes in the dynamics and overall level of emission of both gases, but in opposite directions: overall fluxes of CO2 were increased by microplastic presence, whereas N2O emission were decreased, a pattern that was intensified following urea addition. This divergent response is explained by effects of microplastic on soil structure, with the increased air permeability likely improving O2 supply: this will have stimulated CO2 production, since mineralization benefits from better aeration. Increased O2 would at the same time have inhibited denitrification, a process contributing to N2O emissions, thus likely explaining the decrease in the latter. Our results clearly suggest that microplastic consequences for greenhouse gas emissions should become an integral part of future impact assessments, and that to understand such responses, soil structure should be assessed.",

    "abstract": "The metazoan 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) family contains several members localized in different subcellular compartments. The cytosolic members have been classified into inducible HSP70s and constitutive heat shock cognates (HSC70s), but their distinction and evolutionary relationship remain unclear because of occasional reports of \"constitutive HSP70s\" and the lack of cross-phylum comparisons. Here we provide novel insights into the evolution of these important molecular chaperones. Phylogenetic analyses of [~]100 full-length HSP70s revealed an ancient duplication that gave rise to two lineages from which all metazoan cytosolic HSP70s descend. One lineage (A) contains a relatively small number of Lophotrochozoan and Ecdysozoan genes, none of which have been shown to be constitutively expressed (i.e., either inducible or unknown). The other lineage (B) included both inducible and constitutive genes from diverse phyla. Species-specific duplications are present in both lineages, and Lineage B contains well-supported phylum-specific clades for Rotifera, Nematoda, and Chordata. Some genes in Lineage B have likely independently acquired inducibility, which may explain the sporadic distribution of \"HSP70\" or \"HSC70\" in previous analyses. Consistent with the diversification history within each group, inducible members show lower purifying selection pressure compared to constitutive members. These results illustrate the evolutionary history of the HSP70 family, encouraging us to propose a new nomenclature: \"HSP70 + subcellular localization + linage + copy number in the organism + inducible or constitutive, if known.\" e.g., HSP70cA1i for cytosolic Lineage A, copy 1, inducible.",

We also explored the extent to which nitrate and nitrite treatment affected the brain metabolome in order to understand how nitrate and nitrite supplementation may affect indices of cognitive function.\n\nMethodsFish were exposed to sodium nitrate (606.9 mg/L), sodium nitrite (19.5 mg/L), or control water for 2-4 weeks and free swim, startle response, innate predator avoidance, social cohesion, and shuttle box assays were performed.\n\nResultsNitrate and nitrite treatment did not change fish weight, length, predator avoidance, or distance and velocity traveled in an unstressed environment. Nitrate- and nitrite-treated fish initially experienced more negative reinforcement and increased time to decision in the shuttle box assay, which is consistent with a decrease in associative learning or executive function however, over multiple trials, all treatment groups demonstrated behaviors associated with learning. Nitrate and nitrite treatment significantly increased anxiety-like behavior but did not alter epinephrine, norepinephrine or dopamine levels. Targeted LC-MS/MS analysis revealed no significant increase in brain nitrate or nitrite concentrations with treatment. An untargeted metabolomics analysis found 47 metabolites whose abundance was significantly altered in the brain with nitrate and nitrite treatment including an 18-19% reduction in the neurotransmitter {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and 17-22% reduction in its precursor, glutamine, which may contribute to the increased anxiety-like behavior.\n\nConclusionNitrate and nitrite treatment did not adversely affect multiple parameters of zebrafish health but was associated with mild anxiety-like behavior, changes in the brain metabolome, and caused a short-term decrease in executive function or associative learning.",

    "abstract": "Etiologically, 5% of all cancers worldwide are caused by the high-risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPVs). These viruses encode two oncoproteins (E6 and E7) whose expression is required for cancer initiation and maintenance. Among their cellular targets are the p53 and the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor proteins. Inhibition of the hrHPV E6-mediated ubiquitylation of p53 through the E6AP ubiquitin ligase results in the stabilization of p53, leading to cellular apoptosis. We utilized a live cell high throughput screen to determine whether exogenous microRNA (miRNA) transfection had the ability to stabilize p53 in hrHPV-positive cervical cancer cells expressing a p53-fluorescent protein as an in vivo reporter of p53 stability. Among the miRNAs whose transfection resulted in the greatest p53 stabilization was 375-3p that has previously been reported to stabilize p53 in HeLa cells, providing validation of the screen. The top 32 miRNAs in addition to 375-3p were further assessed using a second cell-based p53 stability reporter system as well as in non-reporter HeLa cells to examine their effects on endogenous p53 protein levels, resulting in the identification of 23 miRNAs whose transfection increased p53 levels in HeLa cells. While a few miRNAs that stabilized p53 led to decreases in E6AP protein levels, all targeted HPV oncoprotein expression. We further examined subsets of these miRNAs for their abilities to induce apoptosis and determined whether it was p53-mediated. The introduction of specific miRNAs revealed surprisingly heterogeneous responses in different cell lines. Nonetheless, some of the miRNAs described here have potential as therapeutics for treating HPV-positive cancers.\n\nImportanceHuman papillomaviruses cause approximately 5% of all cancers worldwide and encode genes that contribute to both the initiation and maintenance of these cancers. The viral oncoprotein E6 is expressed in all HPV-positive cancers and functions by targeting the degradation of p53 through the engagement of the cellular ubiquitin ligase E6AP. Inhibiting the degradation of p53 leads to apoptosis in HPV-positive cancer cells. Using a high throughput live cell assay we identified several miRNAs whose transfection stabilize p53 in HPV-positive cells.

These spatial models have been shown to successfully increase the quality of phenotypic data resulting in improved effectiveness of selection by plant breeders. The models were developed for continuous data types such as grain yield and plant height, but data for most traits, such as in iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC), are recorded on ordinal scales. Is it reasonable to make spatial adjustments to ordinal data by simply applying methods developed for continuous data? The objective of the research described herein is to evaluate methods for spatial adjustment on ordinal data, using soybean IDC as an example. Spatial adjustment models are classified into three different groups: group I, moving average grid adjustment; group II, geospatial autoregressive regression (SAR) models; and group III, tensor product penalized P-splines. Comparisons of eight models sampled from these three classes demonstrate that spatial adjustments depend on severity of field heterogeneity, the irregularity of the spatial patterns, and the model used. SAR models generally produce better performance metrics than other classes of models. However, none of the eight evaluated models fully removed spatial patterns indicating that there is a need to either adjust existing models or develop novel models for spatial adjustments of ordinal data collected in fields exhibiting discontinuous transitions between heterogeneous patches.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWGROSAVIAC_SCPLOW (Corporacion Colombiana de Investigacion Agropecuaria) is the Colombian state institution in charge of the agricultural research at the national level, including plant breeding. Since 2014, AO_SCPLOWGROSAVIAC_SCPLOW started to increase its research staff and has reset the leadership of public research to solve the needs of the agricultural sector population, focusing on small producers. However, the current team working on plant breeding and plant genetic resources are facing some challenges associated with generation gaps and the lack of a collaborative working plan for the next years. To identify the opportunities and actions in this research area, we surveyed all the 52 researchers working in AO_SCPLOWGROSAVIAC_SCPLOW in this area in 2017. We analyzed the opinions of researchers to detect the strengths and weaknesses of the program using a sentiment score. We also examined the networking to test both how consolidated the group is and if among top leaders are gender parity and also have a higher academic degree. Results showed that there is a mixed community of old and new researchers with clear gender bias in the proportion of male-female. Within the network, the interactions are weak, with several subgroups where the top-ten of both central leaders and the most influencer are frequently males with mostly an M.Sc. degree but with significant experience in the area. Researchers have an interest in 31 crops. From them, 26 are in the national germplasm bank, but this bank is not the primary source for their breeding programs. The top-five of plants with increasing interest are corn, cocoa tree, golden berries, oil palm, and sugarcane. Researchers also want to establish collaborations with 54 different institutions, where the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, which is the top public university in the country, is on the head. Researchers also perceived weaknesses in the marker-assisted selection, experimental design, and participatory plant breeding, but those criticisms have a positive sentiment score average of 1.55 (0.3 SE) across 31 texts analyzed. Based on all results, we identified five critical strategic principles to improve the plant-breeding research program. They include a gender diversity policy to hire new researchers strategically to reduce the gender gap and strength the generational shift. Better collaboration between the national germplasm bank and plant breeding research. A coordinate plan where the studies focus on food security crops that the government supports independently of market trends. And finally, adequate spaces for the projects design and training programs. Hence, we recommend the creation of a consultant group to implement these policies progressively in the next years.",

    "abstract": "Cholinergic modulation of hippocampal network function is implicated in multiple behavioral and cognitive states. Activation of nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors affects neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and rhythmic oscillations in the hippocampus. In this work, we study the ability of the cholinergic system to sustain hippocampal epileptiform activity independently from glutamate and GABA transmission. Simultaneous CA3 and CA1 field potential recordings were obtained during the perfusion of hippocampal slices with the aCSF containing AMPA, NMDA and GABA receptor antagonists. Under these conditions, recurrent field discharges synchronous between CA3 and CA1 were recorded. Field discharges were blocked by addition of calcium-channel blocker Cd2+ and disappeared in CA1 after a surgical cut between CA3 and CA1. Cholinergic antagonist mecamylamine abolished CA3-CA1 synchronous field discharges, while antagonists of 7 and 4{beta}2 nAChRs - MLA and Dh{beta}E had no effect. Our results suggest that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is able to sustain CA3-CA1 synchronous epileptiform activity independently from AMPA NMDA and GABA transmission. In addition, mecamylamine but not 7 and 4{beta}2 nAChRs antagonists reduce bicuculline-induced seizure-like activity. The ability of mecamylamine to decrease hippocampal network synchronization might be associated with its therapeutic effects in a wide variety of CNS disorders including addiction, depression and anxiety.",

    "abstract": "The skin of vertebrates is the outermost organ of the body and serves as the first line of defense against external aggressions. In contrast to mammalian skin, that of teleost fish lacks keratinization and has evolved to operate as a mucosal surface containing a skin-associated lymphoid tissue (SALT). Thus far, IgT representing the prevalent immunoglobulin (Ig) in SALT have only been reported upon infection with a parasite. However, very little is known about the types of B cells and Igs responding to bacterial infection in the teleost skin mucosa, as well as the inductive or effector role of the SALT in such responses. To address these questions, here we analyzed the immune response of trout skin upon infection with one of the most widespread fish skin bacterial pathogens, Flavobacterium columnare. This pathogen induced strong skin innate immune and inflammatory responses at the initial phases of infection. More critically, we found that the skin mucus of fish having survived the infection contained significant IgT-but not IgM- or IgD-specific titers against the bacteria. Moreover, we demonstrate the local proliferation and production of IgT+ B-cells and specific IgT titers respectively within the SALT upon bacterial infection. Thus, our findings represent the first demonstration that IgT is the main Ig isotype induced by the skin mucosa upon bacterial infection, and that because of the large surface of the skin, its SALT probably represents a prominent IgT inductive site in fish.",

    "abstract": "Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) belongs to the genus Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae and can cause acute acinar pancreatitis in adults. However, the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis underlying CVB3-induced acute pancreatitis have remained unclear. In this study, we discovered that CVB3 capsid protein VP1 inhibited pancreatic cell proliferation and exerted strong cytopathic effects on HPAC cells. Through yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy, we show that Menage a trois 1 (MAT1), a subunit of the Cdk-Activating Kinase (CAK) complex involved in cell proliferation and transcription, is a novel interaction protein with CVB3 VP1. Moreover, CVB3 VP1 inhibited MAT1 accumulation and localization, thus interfering with its interaction with CDK7. Furthermore, CVB3 VP1 could suppress CAK complex enzymic phosphorylation activity towards RNA Pol II and CDK4/6, direct substrates of CAK. VP1 also suppresses phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb), an indirect CAK substrate, especially at phospho-pRb Ser780 and phospho-pRb Ser807/811 residues, which are associated with cell proliferation. Finally, we present evidence using deletion mutants that the C-terminal domain (VP1-D8, 768-859aa) is the minimal VP1 region required for its interaction with MAT1, and furthermore, VP1-D8 alone was sufficient to arrest cells in G1/S phase as observed during CVB3 infection. Taken together, we demonstrate that CVB3 VP1 can inhibit CAK complex assembly and activity through direct interaction with MAT1, to block MAT1-mediated CAK-CDK4/6-Rb signaling, and ultimately suppress cell proliferation in pancreatic cells. These findings substantially extend our basic understanding of CVB3-mediated pancreatitis, providing strong candidates for strategic therapeutic targeting.",

    "abstract": "ELAV/Hu factors are conserved RNA binding proteins that play diverse roles in mRNA processing and regulation. The founding member, Drosophila Elav, was recognized as a vital neural factor 35 years ago. Nevertheless, still little is known about its impacts on the transcriptome, and potential functional overlap with its paralogs. Building on our recent findings that neural-specific lengthened 3 UTR isoforms are co-determined by ELAV/Hu factors, we address their impacts on splicing. In ectopic contexts, all three members (Elav, Fne and Rbp9) induce similar and broad changes to cassette exon and alternative last exon (ALE) splicing. Reciprocally, double mutants of elav/fne, but not elav alone, have opposite effects on both types of mRNA processing events in the larval CNS. Accordingly, while fne mutants are normal, fne loss strongly enhances elav mutants with respect to neuronal differentiation. While manipulation of Drosophila ELAV/Hu factors induces both exon skipping and inclusion, motif analysis indicates their major direct effects are to suppress cassette exon usage. Moreover, we find direct analogies in their roles in global promotion of distal ALE splicing and terminal 3 UTR extension, since both involve local suppression of proximal polyadenylation signals via ELAV/Hu binding sites downstream of cleavage sites. Finally, we provide evidence for analogous co-implementation of distal ALE and APA lengthening programs in mammalian neurons, linked to ELAV/Hu motifs downstream of regulated polyadenylation sites. Overall, ELAV/Hu proteins orchestrate multiple conserved programs of neuronal mRNA processing by suppressing alternative exons and polyadenylation sites.",

Jugal, a traditional rice cultivar from West Bengal, India possess multiple ovaries before flowering and multiples kernels per spikelet. In this endeavour, the single grained-spikelet varied from 0.00 to 46.26% per panicle. Single pistillated-spikelet was first reported on 8th day before flowering and it was 2.63%. The number of spikelet bearing single ovary/kernel gradually increased till the panicle emergence and then till physiological maturity of grains. Maximum single kernelled-spikelet was recorded on 30th day after panicle emergence (46.26%). The double ovary/kernelled-spikelet per panicle varied from 53.74% to 95.39%. High percentage of double pistillated-spikelet per panicle was recorded before heading and it was more than 90% or very near to 90%. Gradually the double pistillated-spikelet per panicle decreased with the advancement of developmental course of the panicle and continued to decrease till grain maturity. Lowest percentage (53.74%) of double kernelled-spikelet per panicle was observed on 30th day after panicle emergence and it almost remained static till harvest of the crop. Triple pistillated-spikelet was 4.33% per on 10th day before panicle emergence. On 9th day before panicle emergence it was 2.33% and on 8th day before panicle it was 1.00% only and subsequently, no triple pistillated-spikelet was observed till grain maturity. However, randomly one/two triple kernelled-spikelet was also reported. It would be useful if all the spikelets were doubled kernelled. The shape of kernels obtained from doubled kernelled-spikelets were slender, which has high demand among the urban and sub-urban consumers.",

    "abstract": "XIST establishes inactivation across its chromosome of origin, even when expressed from autosomal transgenes. To identify the regions of human XIST essential for recruiting heterochromatic marks we generated a series of overlapping deletions in an autosomal inducible XIST transgene. We examined the ability of each construct to enrich its unified XIST territory with the histone marks established by PRC1 and PRC2 as well as the heterochromatin factors MacroH2A and SMCHD1. PRC1 recruitment required four distinct regions of XIST, and these were completely distinct from the two domains crucial for PRC2 recruitment. Both the domains required and the impact of inhibitors suggest that PRC1 is required for SMCHD1 while PRC2 function is necessary for MacroH2A recruitment, although incomplete overlap of regions implicates a role for additional factors. The independence of the PRC1/PRC2 pathways, yet important of all regions tested, demonstrate both modularity and cooperativity across the XIST lncRNA.\n\nAuthor SummaryXIST functions as a long, non-protein coding, RNA to initiate various pathways for the silencing of one of the two X chromosomes in female placental mammals. CRISPR-directed mutations of an inducible human XIST construct in somatic cells allowed us to discover which regions of the RNA are required for chromatin modification and protein recruitment. This was the first large-scale dissection of human XIST domains, and every function assessed was dependent on multiple regions of XIST, suggesting considerable interactions between domains of XIST. We observed similarities, but also differences, with the domains previously identified in mouse Xist and demonstrated the presence of independent pathways for chromosome reorganization in humans as well as ascribing new functionality to regions of XIST. The ability of XIST to inactivate large sections of chromosomes from which it is expressed makes it both an exciting potential therapeutic for chromosome number abnormalities as well as a paradigm for how non-coding RNA genes are able to regulate cellular biology.",

    "abstract": "Locust swarms are a major threat to agriculture, affecting every continent except Antarctica and impacting the lives of 1 in 10 people. Locusts are short horned grasshoppers that exhibit two behaviour types depending on their local population density. These are; solitarious, where they will actively avoid other locusts, and gregarious where they will seek them out. It is in this gregarious state that locusts can form massive and destructive flying swarms or plagues. However, these swarms are usually preceded by the formation of hopper bands by the juvenile wingless locust nymphs. It is thus important to understand the hopper band formation process to control locust outbreaks.\n\nOn longer time-scales, environmental conditions such as rain events synchronize locust lifecycles and can lead to repeated outbreaks. On shorter time-scales, changes in resource distributions at both small and large spatial scales have an effect on locust gregarisation. It is these short time-scale locust-resource relationships and their effect on hopper band formation that are of interest.\n\nIn this paper we investigate not only the effect of food on both the formation and characteristics of locust hopper bands but also a possible evolutionary explanation for gregarisation in this context. We do this by deriving a multi-population aggregation equation that includes non-local inter-individual interactions and local inter-individual and food interactions. By performing a series of numerical experiments we find that there exists an optimal food width for locust hopper band formation, and by looking at foraging efficiency within the model framework we uncover a possible evolutionary reason for gregarisation.\n\nAuthor summaryLocusts are short horned grass hoppers that live in two diametrically opposed behavioural states. In the first, solitarious, they will actively avoid other locusts, whereas the second, gregarious, they will actively seek them out. It is in this gregarious state that locusts form the recognisable and destructive flying adult swarms. However, prior to swarm formation juvenile flightless locusts will form marching hopper bands and make their way from food source to food source. Predicting where these hopper bands might form is key to controlling locust outbreaks.\n\nResearch has shown that changes in food distributions can affect the transition from solitarious to gregarious. In this paper we construct a mathematical model of locust-locust and locust-food interactions to investigate how and why isolated food distributions affect hopper band formation. Our findings suggest that there is an optimal food width for hopper band formation and that being gregarious increases a locusts ability to forage when food width decreases.",

In the present study, we analyzed the efficacy an antioxidant enriched fraction (AEF) from the tuber extract of P. tuberosa against menopausal osteoporosis and breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. The AEF from P. tuberosa was identified by determining phenolic composition (total phenolic and flavonoid amount). Antioxidant property (in vitro assays) was also carried out followed by analysis of the AEF for its antiosteoporotic and anticancer potentials. Antiosteoporotic activity of AEF was investigated in ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in rats and in vitro anticancer activity by MTT assay. Also, the GC/MS analysis of AEF was performed to determine various phytoconstituents. A docking analysis was performed to verify the interaction of bioactive molecules with estrogen receptors (ERs). Ethyl acetate fraction of the mother extract was proved as the AEF. AEF significantly improved various biomechanical and biochemical parameters in a dose dependent manner in the ovariectomized animals. AEF also controlled the increased body weight and decreased uterus weight following ovariectomy. Histopathology of femur revealed the restoration of typical bone structure and trabecular width in ovariectomized animals after AEF and raloxifene treatment. AEF also exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity in breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and ovarian (SKOV-3) cancer cells. Further, genistein and daidzein exhibited a high affinity towards both estrogen receptors ( and {beta}) in docking study revealing the probable mechanism of the antiosteoporotic activity. GC/MS analysis confirmed the presence of bioactive molecules such as stigmasterol, {beta}-sitosterol, and stigmasta-3,5-dien-7-one. The observations of this study vindicate the potency of AEF from P. tuberosa in the treatment of menopausal osteoporosis and cancer.",
