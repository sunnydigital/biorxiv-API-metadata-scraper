    "abstract": "Bacterial-derived RNA and DNA can function as ligands for intracellular receptor activation and induce downstream signaling to modulate the host response to bacterial infection. The mechanisms underlying the secretion of immunomodulatory RNA and DNA by pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and their delivery to intracellular host cell receptors are not well understood. Recently, extracellular membrane vesicle (MV) production has been proposed as a general secretion mechanism that could facilitate the delivery of functional bacterial nucleic acids into host cells. S. aureus produce membrane-bound, spherical, nano-sized, MVs packaged with a select array of bioactive macromolecules and they have been shown to play important roles in bacterial virulence and in immune modulation through the transmission of biologic signals to host cells. Here we show that S. aureus secretes RNA and DNA molecules that are mostly protected from degradation by their association with MVs. Importantly, we demonstrate that MVs can be delivered into cultured macrophage cells and subsequently stimulate a potent IFN-{beta} response in recipient cells via activation of endosomal Toll-like receptors. These findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which bacterial nucleic acids traffic extracellularly to trigger the modulation of host immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Intensive aquaculture conditions expose fish to bacterial infections, leading to significant financial losses, extensive antibiotic use and risk of antibiotic resistance in target bacteria. Flavobacterium columnare causes columnaris disease in aquaculture worldwide. To develop a bacteriophage-based control of columnaris disease, we isolated and characterized 126 F. columnare strains and 63 phages against F. columnare from Finland and Sweden. Bacterial isolates were virulent on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and fell into four previously described genetic groups A, C, E and G, with genetic groups C and E being the most virulent. Phage host range studied against a collection of 228 bacterial isolates demonstrated modular infection patterns based on host genetic group. Phages infected contemporary and previously isolated bacterial hosts, but bacteria isolated most recently were generally resistant to previously isolated phages. Despite large differences in geographical origin, isolation year or host range of the phages, whole genome sequencing of 56 phages showed high level of genetic similarity to previously isolated F. columnare phages (Ficleduovirus, Myoviridae). Altogether, this phage collection demonstrates a potential to be used in phage therapy.\n\nSignificance StatementBacteriophages were discovered already over a century ago, and used widely in treatment of bacterial diseases before the era of antibiotics. Due to harmful effects of antibiotic leakage into environment, aquaculture is a potential target for phage therapy. However, the development of efficient phage therapy approach requires detailed characterization of bacterial pathogen virulence and phage host range. Here, we describe phage-bacterium interactions in the fish pathogen Flavobacterium columnare. We found that genetically similar phages are found from different fish farms, and their infectivity cluster according to genetic group of bacteria. In addition, phages were able to infect bacterial hosts from other farms, which is a preferable trait considering phage therapy approach. However, the most recently isolated phages had broader host range than the previously isolated phages, suggesting a response in the phage community to evolution of resistance in the bacteria. These results show that designing phage therapy for aquaculture (and other) systems needs consideration of both temporal and geographical aspects of the phage-bacterium interaction.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous molecular chaperone Hsp90 is a key regulator of cellular proteostasis and environmental stress responses. Hsp90 also regulates cellular morphogenesis, drug resistance, and virulence in human pathogenic fungi, which kill more than 1.6 million patients each year worldwide. Invasive fungal infections are difficult to treat due to the lack of effective antifungal therapies, resulting in mortality rates of up to 95%. As a key regulator of fungal virulence, Hsp90 is an attractive therapeutic target. However, fungal and animal homologs are highly conserved, impeding fungal-specific targeting. Thus, understanding the factors that regulate Hsp90 could provide an alternative strategy aimed at exclusively targeting this regulator of fungal virulence. Here, we demonstrate how CK2-mediated phosphorylation of two Hsp90 residues modulates virulence in a major fungal pathogen of humans, Candida albicans. We combined proteomics, molecular evolution and structural modelling with molecular biology to identify and characterize two Hsp90 phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation negatively affects thermal stress response, morphogenesis, drug susceptibility and fungal virulence. Our results provide the first record of specific Hsp90 phosphorylation sites acting as modulators of fungal virulence. Post-translational modifications of Hsp90 could prove valuable in future exploitation as antifungal drug targets.",

    "abstract": "Thrombopoietin (TPO) and the TPO-receptor (TPO-R, or c-MPL)) are essential for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance and megakaryocyte differentiation. Agents that can modulate TPO-R signaling are highly desirable, both experimentally and clinically. We have developed a series of surrogate protein-ligands for TPO-R, in the form of diabodies, that homodimerize the TPO-R on the cell surface in different geometries, in effect  tuning downstream signaling responses. These surrogate ligands exhibit diverse pharmacological properties, inducing graded signaling outputs, from full to partial TPO agonism and antagonism, thus decoupling the dual functions of TPO/TPO-R. Using scRNA sequencing and HSC self-renewal assays we find that partial agonistic diabodies preserved the stem-like properties of cultured HSCs, but also blocked oncogenic colony formation in Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) through inverse agonism. Our data suggest that dampening downstream TPO signaling is a powerful approach not only for HSC preservation in culture, but also for inhibiting oncogenic signaling through the TPO-R.\n\nSignificance StatementThe TPO cytokine, which signals through its receptor c-MPL (or TPO-R), is essential for megakaryocyte differentiation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Its signaling is deregulated in Essential Thrombocythemia (ET). Here, we engineered diabodies (DBs) against the TPO-R as surrogate TPO ligands to manipulate TPO-R signaling, from full to partial to antagonism, thus decoupling the dual functions of TPO/TPO-R (i.e, HSC maintenance versus megakaryopoiesis). We subsequently discovered that partial agonistic DBs, by reducing the strength of the TPO-R signal, not only preserved HSCs in culture, but also blocked oncogenic signaling in ET. This finding has the potential to improve HSC cultures for transplants, as well as serve as a unique therapeutic approach for ET.",

    "abstract": "The formation of differential cell lineages in the mammalian blastocyst from the totipotent zygote is crucial for implantation and the success of the whole pregnancy. The first lineage segregation generates the polarised trophectoderm (TE) tissue, which forms the placenta, and the apolar inner cell mass (ICM), which mainly gives rise to all foetal tissues and also the yolk sac1-3. The mechanism underlying this cell fate segregation has been extensively studied in the mouse embryo4,5. However, when and how it takes place in the human embryo remains unclear. Here, using time-lapse imaging and 325 surplus human embryos, we provide a detailed characterisation of morphological events and transcription factor expression and localisation to understand how they lead to the first lineage segregation in human embryogenesis. We show that the first lineage segregation of the human embryo is triggered by cell polarisation that occurs at the 8-cell stage in two sequential steps. In the first step, F-actin becomes apically polarised concomitantly with embryo compaction. In the second step, the Par complex becomes polarised to form the apical cellular domain. Mechanistically, we show that activation of Phospholipase C (PLC) triggers actin polarisation and is therefore essential for apical domain formation, as is the case in mouse embryos6. Finally, we show that, in contrast to the mouse embryo, the key extra-embryonic determinant GATA37,8 is expressed not only in extra-embryonic lineage precursors upon blastocyst formation. However, the cell polarity machinery enhances the expression and nuclear accumulation of GATA3. In summary, our results demonstrate for the first time that cell polarisation reinforces the first lineage segregation in the human embryo.",

We augmented our IVF mouse model to longitudinally investigate cardiometabolic outcomes in offspring from optimal neonatal litter sizes. We found that IVF-conceived females had higher body weight and cholesterol levels compared to naturally-conceived females, whereas IVF-conceived males had higher levels of triglycerides and insulin, and increased body fat composition. Through transcriptomics and proteomics of adult liver, we identified sexually-dimorphic dysregulation of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) pathways that are associated with the sex-specfic phenotypes. We also found that global loss of DNA methylation in placenta was linked to higher cholesterol levels in IVF-conceived females. Our findings indicate that IVF procedures have long-lasting sex-specific effects on metabolic health of offspring and lay the foundation to utilize the placenta as a predictor of long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Systematic identification of molecular networks in disease relevant immune cells of the nervous system is critical for elucidating the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimers disease (AD). Two key immune cell types, disease-associated microglia (DAM) and disease-associated astrocytes (DAA), are biologically involved in AD pathobiology. Therefore, uncovering molecular determinants of DAM and DAA will enhance our understanding of AD biology, potentially identifying novel therapeutic targets for AD treatment. Here, we present an integrative, network-based methodology to uncover conserved molecular networks between DAM and DAA. Specifically, we leverage single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from both AD transgenic mouse models and AD patient brains, drug-target networks, metabolite-enzyme associations, and the human protein-protein interactome, along with large-scale patient data validation from the MarketScan Medicare Supplemental Database. We find that common and unique molecular network regulators between DAM (i.e, PAK1, MAPK14, and SYK) and DAA (i.e., NFKB1, FOS, and JUN) are significantly enriched by multiple neuro-inflammatory pathways and well-known genetic variants (i.e., BIN1) from genome-wide association studies. Further network analysis reveal shared immune pathways between DAM and DAA, including Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, Th17 cell differentiation, and chemokine signaling. Furthermore, integrative metabolite-enzyme network analyses imply that fatty acids (i.e., elaidic acid) and amino acids (i.e., glutamate, serine, and phenylalanine) may trigger molecular alterations between DAM and DAA. Finally, we prioritize repurposed drug candidates for potential treatment of AD by agents that specifically reverse dysregulated gene expression of DAM or DAA, including an antithrombotic anticoagulant triflusal, a beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist salbutamol, and the steroid medications (fluticasone and mometasone). Individuals taking fluticasone (an approved anti-inflammatory and inhaled corticosteroid) displayed a significantly decreased incidence of AD (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.858, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.829-0.888, P < 0.0001) in retrospective case-control validation. Furthermore, propensity score matching cohort studies also confirmed an association of mometasone with reduced incidence of AD in comparison to fluticasone (HR =0.921, 95% CI 0.862-0.984, P < 0.0001).",

    "abstract": "Rickettsia are arthropod-borne pathogens that cause severe human disease worldwide. The spotted fever group (SFG) pathogen Rickettsia parkeri elicits skin lesion (eschar) formation in humans after tick bite. However, intradermal inoculation of inbred mice with millions of bacteria fails to elicit eschar formation or disseminated disease, hindering investigations into understanding eschar-associated rickettsiosis. Here, we report that intradermal infection of mice deficient for both interferon receptors (Ifnar-/-Ifngr-/-) with R. parkeri causes eschar formation, recapitulating the hallmark clinical feature of human disease. Intradermal infection with doses that recapitulate tick infestation caused eschar formation and lethality, including with as few as 10 bacteria. Using this model, we found that the actin-based motility protein Sca2 is required for R. parkeri dissemination from the skin to internal organs and for causing lethal disease, and that the abundant R. parkeri outer membrane protein OmpB contributes to eschar formation. We also found that immunizing mice with sca2 and ompB mutant R. parkeri protects against subsequent rechallenge with wild-type bacteria, revealing live-attenuated vaccine candidates. Thus, interferon receptor-deficient mice are a tractable model to investigate rickettsiosis, bacterial virulence factors, and immunity. Our results suggest that differences in interferon signaling in the skin between mice and humans may explain the discrepancy in susceptibility to SFG Rickettsia.",

    "abstract": "Microbes tend to organize into communities consisting of hundreds of species involved in complex interactions with each other. 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) amplicon profiling provides snapshots that reveal the phylogenies and abundance profiles of these microbial communities. These snapshots, when collected from multiple samples, have the potential to reveal which microbes co-occur, providing a glimpse into the network of associations in these communities. The inference of networks from 16S data is prone to statistical artifacts. There are many tools for performing each step of the 16S analysis workflow, but the extent to which these steps affect the final network is still unclear. In this study, we perform a meticulous analysis of each step of a pipeline that can convert 16S sequencing data into a network of microbial associations. Through this process, we map how different choices of algorithms and parameters affect the co-occurrence network and estimate steps that contribute most significantly to the variance. We further determine the tools and parameters that generate the most accurate and robust co-occurrence networks based on comparison with mock and synthetic datasets. Ultimately, we develop a standardized pipeline (available at https://github.com/segrelab/MiCoNE) that follows these default tools and parameters, but that can also help explore the outcome of any other combination of choices. We envisage that this pipeline could be used for integrating multiple data-sets, and for generating comparative analyses and consensus networks that can help understand and control microbial community assembly in different biomes.\n\nImportanceTo understand and control the mechanisms that determine the structure and function of microbial communities, it is important to map the interrelationships between its constituent microbial species. The surge in the high-throughput sequencing of microbial communities has led to the creation of thousands of datasets containing information about microbial abundances. These abundances can be transformed into networks of co-occurrences across multiple samples, providing a glimpse into the structure of microbiomes. However, processing these datasets to obtain co-occurrence information relies on several complex steps, each of which involves multiple choices of tools and corresponding parameters. These multiple options pose questions about the accuracy and uniqueness of the inferred networks. In this study, we address this workflow and provide a systematic analysis of how these choices of tools and parameters affect the final network, and on how to select those that are most appropriate for a particular dataset.",

    "abstract": "Fungi contribute to upwards of 1.5 million human deaths annually, are involved in the spoilage of up to a third of food crops, and have a devastating effect on plant and animal biodiversity. Moreover, this already significant issue is exacerbated by a rise in antifungal resistance and a critical requirement for novel drug targets. Quadruplexes are four-stranded secondary structures in nucleic acids which can regulate processes such as transcription, translation, replication, and recombination. They are also found in genes linked to virulence in microbes, and quadruplex-binding ligands have been demonstrated to eliminate drug resistant pathogens. Using a computational approach, we identified putative quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) in 1362 genomes across the fungal kingdom and explored their potential involvement in virulence, drug resistance, and pathogenicity. Here we present the largest analysis of PQS in fungi and identified significant heterogeneity of these sequences throughout phyla, genera, and species. Moreover, PQS were genetically conserved. Notably, loss of PQS in cryptococci and aspergilli was associated with pathogenicity. PQS in the clinically important pathogens Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida albicans were located within genes (particularly coding regions), mRNA, repeat regions, mobile elements, tRNA, ncRNA, rRNA, and the centromere. Genes containing PQS in these organisms were found to be primarily associated with metabolism, nucleic acid binding, transporter activity, and protein modification. Finally, PQS were found in over 100 genes associated with virulence, drug resistance, or key biological processes in these pathogenic fungi and were found in genes which were highly upregulated during germination, hypoxia, oxidative stress, iron limitation, and in biofilms. Taken together, quadruplexes in fungi could present interesting novel targets to ameliorate fungal virulence and overcome drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are functional plant proteoglycans, but their functions are largely unexplored, mainly because of the complexity of the sugar moieties, which are generally analyzed with the aid of glycoside hydrolases. In this study, we solved the apo and liganded structures of exo-{beta}-1,3-galactanase from the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Pc1,3Gal43A), which specifically cleaves AGPs. It is composed of a glycoside hydrolase family 43 subfamily 24 (GH43_sub24) catalytic domain together with a carbohydrate-binding module family (CBM) 35 binding domain. GH43_sub24 lacks the catalytic base Asp that is conserved among other GH43 subfamilies. Crystal structure and kinetic analyses indicated that the tautomerized imidic acid function of Gln263 serves instead as the catalytic base residue. Pc1,3Gal43A has three subsites that continue from the bottom of the catalytic pocket to the solvent. Subsite -1 contains a space that can accommodate the C-6 methylol of Gal, enabling the enzyme to bypass the {beta}-1,6-linked galactan side chains of AGPs. Furthermore, the galactan-binding domain in CBM35 has a different ligand interaction mechanism from other sugar-binding CBM35s. Some of the residues involved in ligand recognition differ from those of galactomannan-binding CBM35, including substitution of Trp for Gly, which affects pyranose stacking, and substitution of Asn for Asp in the lower part of the binding pocket. Pc1,3Gal43A WT and its mutants at residues involved in substrate recognition are expected to be useful tools for structural analysis of AGPs. Our findings should also be helpful in engineering designer enzymes for efficient utilization of various types of biomass.",

    "abstract": "How cells control the numbers of its subcellular components is a fundamental question in biology. Given that biosynthetic processes are fundamentally stochastic it is utterly puzzling that some structures display no copy number variation within a cell population. Centriole biogenesis, with each centriole being duplicated once and only once per cell cycle, stands out due to its remarkable fidelity. This is a highly controlled process, which depends on low-abundance rate-limiting factors. How can exactly one centriole copy be produced given the natural variation in the concentration of these key players? Hitherto, tentative explanations of this control evoked lateral inhibition-or phase separation-like mechanisms emerging from the dynamics of these rate-limiting factors, but how centriole number is regulated remains unclear. Here, we propose a novel solution to centriole copy number control based on the assembly of a centriolar scaffold, the cartwheel. We hypothesise that once the first cartwheel is formed it continues to elongate by stacking the intermediate cartwheel building blocks that would otherwise form supernumerary structures. Using probability theory and computer simulations, we show that this mechanism may ensure formation of one and only one cartwheel over a wide range of parameter values at physiologically relevant conditions. By comparison to alternative models, we conclude that the key signatures of this novel mechanism are an increasing assembly time with cartwheel numbers and that stochasticity in cartwheel building blocks should be converted into variation in cartwheel numbers or length, both of which can be tested experimentally.\n\nAuthor summaryCentriole duplication stands out as a biosynthetic process of exquisite fidelity in the noisy world of the cell. Each centriole duplicates exactly once per cell cycle, such that the number of centrioles per cell shows no variance across cells, in contrast with most cellular components that show broadly distributed copy numbers. We propose a new solution to the number control problem. We show that elongation of the first cartwheel, a core centriolar structure, may sequester the building blocks necessary to assemble supernumerary centrioles. As a corollary, the variation in regulatory kinases and cartwheel components across the cell population is predicted to translate into cartwheel length variation instead of copy number variation, which is an intriguing overlooked possibility.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporally dynamic microtubule acetylation underlies diverse physiological events ranging from cell migration to intracellular trafficking, autophagy and viral infections. Despite its ubiquity, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the sole microtubule acetylating agent, -tubulin N-acetyltransferase 1 (-TAT1) remain obscure. Here we report that dynamic intracellular localization of -TAT1 unexpectedly determines the efficiency of microtubule acetylation. Specifically, we newly identified a conserved signal motif in the intrinsically disordered C-terminus of -TAT1, consisting of three competing regulatory elements - nuclear export, nuclear import and cytosolic retention. Their balance is tuned via phosphorylation by serine-threonine kinases including CDK1 and CK2. While the un-phosphorylated form resides both in the cytosol and nucleus, the phosphorylated form binds to specific 14-3-3 adapters and accumulates in the cytosol for maximal substrate access. Cytosolic localization of -TAT1 predominantly mediates microtubule acetylation, cell proliferation and DNA damage response. In contrast to other molecules with a similar phospho-regulated signal motif including transcription factors, -TAT1 uniquely uses the nucleus as a hideout. As amino acid mutations to the motif have been reported in cancer patients, the present mechanism of subcellular -TAT1 localization may help uncover a spatiotemporal code of microtubule acetylation in normal and aberrant cell functions.",

    "abstract": "Some stalk-eyed flies in the genus Teleopsis carry selfish genetic elements that induce sex ratio meiotic drive (SR) and impact the fitness of male and female carriers. Here, we produced a chromosome-level genome assembly of the stalk-eyed fly, T. dalmanni, to elucidate patterns of genomic divergence associated with the presence of drive elements. We find evidence for multiple nested inversions along the sex ratio haplotype and widespread differentiation and divergence between XSR and XSR along the entire chromosome. These include a striking XSR-specific expansion of an array of partial copies of JASPer, a gene necessary for maintenance of euchromatin and regulation of transposable element expression (TEs). In addition, the genome contains tens of thousands of TE insertions and hundreds of transcriptionally and insertionally active TE families. Moreover, we find that several TE families are differentially expressed and/or present at a different copy number in SR male testes, suggesting an association between these two categories of selfish genetic elements in this species. We identify T. dalmanni orthologs of genes involved in genome defense via the piRNA pathway, including core members maelstrom, piwi and Argonaute3, that have diverged in sequence, expression or copy number between the SR and standard (ST) X chromosomes, consistent with altered TE regulation in flies carrying a sex ratio X chromosome. Overall, the evidence suggests that this ancient XSR polymorphism has had a variety of impacts on repetitive DNA and its regulation in this species.",

    "abstract": "SummaryGenetic recombination generates novel trait combinations and understanding how recombination is distributed across the genome is key to modern genetics. The PRDM9 protein defines recombination hotspots, however megabase-scale recombination patterning is independent of PRDM9. The single round of DNA replication, which precedes recombination in meiosis, may establish these patterns, therefore we devised a novel approach to study meiotic replication that includes robust and sensitive mapping of replication origins. We find that meiotic DNA replication is distinct; reduced origin firing slows replication in meiosis and a distinctive replication pattern in human males underlies the sub-telomeric increase in recombination. We detected a robust correlation between replication and both contemporary and ancestral recombination and found that replication origin density coupled with chromosome size determines the recombination potential of individual chromosomes. Our findings and methods have far-reaching implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying DNA replication, genetic recombination, and the landscape of mammalian germline variation.",

Structural biology strives to capture biomolecular structures in action, but the samples are often highly simplified versions of the complex native environment. Here we present an E. coli model system that allows us to probe the structure and function of Ail, the major surface protein of the deadly pathogen Yersinia pestis. We show that cell surface expression of Ail produces Y. pestis virulence phenotypes in E. coli, including resistance to human serum, co-sedimentation of human vitronectin and pellicle formation. Moreover, isolated bacterial cell envelopes, encompassing inner and outer membranes, yield high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra that reflect the structure of Ail and reveal Ail sites that are sensitive to the bacterial membrane environment and involved in the interactions with human serum components. The data capture the structure and function of Ail in a bacterial outer membrane and set the stage for probing its interactions with the complex milieu of immune response proteins present in human serum.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEAil is a critical virulence factor of Y. pestis, and its interactions with human serum are central for promoting the immune resistance of bacteria to the human host defenses. Here we capture the action of Ail in a functional bacterial environment and set the stage for probing its interactions with the complex milieu of immune response proteins present in human serum.

    "abstract": "Self-assembly of proteins on lipid membranes underlies many important processes in cell biology, such as, exo- and endo-cytosis, assembly of viruses, etc. An attractive force that can cause self-assembly is mediated by membrane thickness interactions between proteins. The free energy profile associated with this attractive force is a result of the overlap of thickness deformation fields around the proteins. The thickness deformation field around proteins of various shapes can be calculated from the solution of a boundary value problem and is relatively well understood. Yet, the time scales over which self-assembly occurs has not been explored. In this paper we compute this time scale as a function of the initial distance between two inclusions by viewing their coalescence as a first passage time problem. The first passage time is computed using both Langevin dynamics and a partial differential equation, and both methods are found to be in excellent agreement. Inclusions of three different shapes are studied and it is found that for two inclusions separated by about hundred nanometers the time to coalescence is hundreds of milliseconds irrespective of shape. Our Langevin dynamics simulation of self-assembly required an efficient computation of the interaction energy of inclusions which was accomplished using a finite difference technique. The interaction energy profiles obtained using this numerical technique were in excellent agreement with those from a previously proposed semi-analytical method based on Fourier-Bessel series. The computational strategies described in this paper could potentially lead to efficient methods to explore the kinetics of self-assembly of proteins on lipid membranes.\n\nAuthor summarySelf-assembly of proteins on lipid membranes occurs during exo- and endo-cytosis and also when viruses exit an infected cell. The forces mediating self-assembly of inclusions on membranes have therefore been of long standing interest. However, the kinetics of self-assembly has received much less attention. As a first step in discerning the kinetics, we examine the time to coalescence of two inclusions on a membrane as a function of the distance separating them. We use both Langevin dynamics simulations and a partial differential equation to compute this time scale. We predict that the time to coalescence is on the scale of hundreds of milliseconds for two inclusions separated by about hundred nanometers. The deformation moduli of the lipid membrane and the membrane tension can affect this time scale.",

    "abstract": "Reaction-diffusion waves have long been used to describe the growth and spread of populations undergoing a spatial range expansion. Such waves are generally classed as either pulled, where the dynamics are driven by the very tip of the front and stochastic fluctuations are high, or pushed, where cooperation in growth or dispersal results in a bulk-driven wave in which fluctuations are suppressed. These concepts have been well studied experimentally in populations where the cooperation leads to a density-dependent growth rate. By contrast, relatively little is known about experimental populations that exhibit density-dependent dispersal.\n\nUsing bacteriophage T7 as a test organism, we present novel experimental measurements that demonstrate that the diffusion of phage T7, in a lawn of host E. coli, is hindered by steric interactions with host bacteria cells. The coupling between host density, phage dispersal and cell lysis caused by viral infection results in an effective density-dependent diffusion coefficient akin to cooperative behavior. Using a system of reaction-diffusion equations, we show that this effect can result in a transition from a pulled to pushed expansion. Moreover, we find that a second, independent density-dependent effect on phage dispersal spontaneously emerges as a result of the viral incubation period, during which phage is trapped inside the host unable to disperse. Additional stochastic agent-based simulations reveal that lysis time dramatically affects the rate of diversity loss in viral expansions. Taken together, our results indicate both that bacteriophage can be used as a controllable laboratory population to investigate the impact of density-dependent dispersal on evolution, and that the genetic diversity and adaptability of expanding viral populations could be much greater than is currently assumed.",

The organizational principles of bi-hemispheric signals and the functions they serve throughout motor planning remain unclear. Using an instructed-delay reaching task in monkeys, we identified two components in population responses spanning PMd and M1. A \"dedicated\" component, which segregated activity at the level of individual units, emerged in PMd during preparation. It was most prominent following movement when M1 became strongly engaged, and principally involved the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast to recent reports, these dedicated signals solely accounted for divergence of arm-specific neural subspaces. The other \"distributed\" component mixed signals for each arm within units, and the subspace containing it did not discriminate between arms at any stage. The statistics of the population response suggest two functional layers of the cortical network: one that spans both hemispheres for supporting preparatory and ongoing processes, and another that is predominantly housed in the contralateral hemisphere and specifies unilateral output.",

    "abstract": "Driving is an everyday task involving a complex interaction between visual and cognitive processes. As such, an increase in the cognitive and/or visual demands can lead to a mental overload which can be detrimental for driving safety. Compiling evidence suggest that eye and head movements are relevant indicators of visuo-cognitive demands and attention allocation. This study aims to investigate the effects of visual degradation on eye-head coordination as well as visual scanning behavior during a highly demanding task in a driving simulator. A total of 21 emmetropic participants (21 to 34 years old) performed dual-task driving in which they were asked to maintain a constant speed on a highway while completing a visual search and detection task on a navigation device. Participants did the experiment with optimal vision and with contact lenses that introduced a visual perturbation (myopic defocus). The results indicate modifications of eye-head coordination and the dynamics of visual scanning in response to the visual perturbation induced. More specifically, the head was more involved in horizontal gaze shifts when the visual needs were not met. Furthermore, the evaluation of visual scanning dynamics, based on time-based entropy which measures the complexity and randomness of scanpaths, revealed that eye and gaze movements became less explorative and more stereotyped when vision was not optimal. These results provide evidence for a reorganization of both eye and head movements in response to increasing visual-cognitive demands during a driving task. Altogether, these findings suggest that eye and head movements can provide relevant information about visuo-cognitive demands associated with complex tasks. Ultimately, eye-head coordination and visual scanning dynamics may be good candidates to estimate drivers workload and better characterize risky driving behavior.",

The lineally expressed coreceptor CD8 interacts coordinately with MHCI at a distinct and largely invariant site to slow the TCR/peptide-MHCI (pMHCI) dissociation rate and enhance antigen sensitivity. However, this biological effect is not necessarily uniform, and theoretical models suggest that antigen sensitivity can be modulated in a differential manner by CD8. We used an intrinsically controlled system to determine how the relationship between the TCR/pMHCI interaction and the pMHCI/CD8 interaction affects the functional sensitivity of antigen recognition. Our data show that modulation of the pMHCI/CD8 interaction can reorder the agonist hierarchy of peptide ligands across a spectrum of affinities for the TCR.\n\nSIGNIFICANCESufficient immune coverage of the peptide universe within a finite host requires highly degenerate T cell receptors (TCRs).

Investigation of additional toxins from the deaminase superfamily revealed that mutagenic activity is a common feature of these proteins, including a representative we show targets single-stranded DNA and displays a markedly divergent structure.

Here, we discovered a central function of the poorly understood C-terminal domain (CTD) of PGC-1 to bind RNAs and assemble multi-protein complexes. Surprisingly, in addition to controlling the coupling of transcription and processing of target genes, RNA binding is indispensable for the recruitment of PGC-1 to chromatin into liquid-like nuclear condensates, which compartmentalize and regulate active transcription. These results demonstrate a hitherto unsuspected molecular mechanism by which complexity in the regulation of large transcriptional networks by PGC-1 is achieved. These findings are not only essential for the basic understanding of transcriptional coregulator-driven control of biological programs, but will also help to devise new strategies to modulate these processes in pathological contexts in which PGC-1 function is dysregulated, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases or skeletal muscle wasting.",

    "abstract": "Meiosis produces haploid gametes that will give rise to the next diploid generation. Chromosome segregation errors occurring at one or both meiotic divisions result in aneuploidy, which can lead to miscarriages or birth defects in humans. During meiosis I, ring-shaped cohesin complexes play important roles to aid in the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes. While REC8 is a specialized meiosis-specific cohesin that functions to hold sister chromatids together, the role of its vertebrate-specific paralog, RAD21L, is poorly understood. Here we tested if Rad21l1, the zebrafish homolog of human and mouse RAD21L, is required for meiotic chromosome dynamics during oogenesis and spermatogenesis. We found that Rad21l1 is an abundant component of meiotic chromosomes where it localizes to both the chromosome axes and the transverse filament of the synaptonemal complex (SC). Knocking out rad21l1 causes nearly the entire mutant population to develop as fertile males, suggesting the mutation triggers a sex reversal from female to male due to a failure in oocyte production. The rad21l1-/- mutant males display normal fertility at sexual maturity. Sex reversal was partially suppressed in the absence of tp53, suggesting that the rad21l1-/- mutation causes defects leading to a Tp53 dependent response, specifically in females. The rad21l1-/-;tp53-/- double mutant females produced elevated rates of decomposing eggs and deformed offspring compared to tp53-/- controls. This response, however, is not linked to a defect in repairing Spo11-induced double-strand breaks since deletion of Spo11 does not suppress the sex reversal phenotype. Overall, our data highlight an exceptional sexually dimorphic phenotype caused by knocking out a meiotic-specific cohesin subunit. We propose that Rad21l1 is required for maintaining the integrity of meiotic chromatin architecture during oogenesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryA prominent symptom of age-linked reproductive decline in women is the increased rate of miscarriage and birth defects due to aneuploidy. Aneuploidy can arise when chromosomes fail to segregate properly during meiosis, the process of creating haploid gametes from a diploid germ cell. Oocyte progression normally arrests prior to anaphase I, after homologous chromosomes have formed crossovers, but before ovulation, which triggers the first round of segregation. This prolonged arrest makes oocytes especially vulnerable to degradation of meiotic chromosome structure and homolog connections over time. Cohesin complexes play a major role in maintaining the meiotic chromosome architecture. Here we assess the role of the vertebrate-specific Rad21l1 cohesin subunit in zebrafish. We find that while males appear mostly unaffected by loss of Rad21l1, oocyte production is massively compromised, leading to sex reversion to males. Sex reversion can be partially prevented in the absence of Tp53, demonstrating that loss or Rad21l1 leads to a Tp53-dependent response in oocytes. Strikingly, double mutant rad21l1 tp53 females produce large numbers of poor quality eggs and malformed offspring. This demonstrates a cohesin-linked vulnerability in female meiosis not present in males and sheds light on a potential mechanism associated with the decline in female reproductive health.",
