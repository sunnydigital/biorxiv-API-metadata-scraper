    "abstract": "Noncoding RNA plays important regulatory and functional roles in microorganisms, such as gene expression regulation, signaling, protein synthesis, and RNA processing. Given its essential role in microbial physiology, it is natural to question whether we can use noncoding RNAs as biomarkers to distinguish among environments under different biological conditions, such as those between healthy versus disease status. The current metagenomic sequencing technology primarily generates short reads, which contain incomplete structural information that may complicate noncoding RNA homology detection. On the other hand, de novo assembly of the metagenomics sequencing data remains fragmentary and has a risk of missing low-abundant noncoding RNAs. To tackle these challenges, we have developed DRAGoM (Detection of RNA using Assembly Graph from Metagenomics data), a novel noncoding RNA homology search algorithm. DRAGoM operates on a metagenome assembly graph, rather than on unassembled reads or assembled contigs. Our benchmark experiments show DRAGoMs improved performance and robustness over the traditional approaches. We have further demonstrated DRAGoMs real-world applications in disease characterization via analyzing a real case-control gut microbiome dataset for Type-2 diabetes (T2D). DRAGoM revealed potential ncRNA biomarkers that can clearly separate the T2D gut microbiome from those of healthy controls. DRAGoM is freely available from https://github.com/benliu5085/DRAGoM.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix mechanics influence diverse cellular functions, yet surprisingly little is known about the mechanical properties of their constituent collagen proteins. In particular, network-forming collagen IV, an integral component of basement membranes, has been far less studied than fibril-forming collagens. A key feature of collagen IV is the presence of interruptions in the triple-helix-defining (Gly-X-Y) sequence along its collagenous domain. Here, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the impact of sequence heterogeneity on the local flexibility of collagen IV and of the fibril-forming collagen III. Our extracted flexibility profile of collagen IV reveals that it possesses highly heterogeneous mechanics, ranging from semi-flexible regions as found for fibril-forming collagens to a lengthy region of high flexibility towards its N terminus. A simple model in which flexibility is dictated only by the presence of interruptions fit the extracted profile reasonably well, providing insight into the alignment of chains and demonstrating that interruptions - particularly when coinciding in multiple chains - significantly enhance local flexibility. To a lesser extent, sequence variations within the triple helix lead to variable flexibility, as seen along the continuously triple-helical collagen III. We found this fibril-forming collagen to possess a high-flexibility region around its matrix-metalloprotease (MMP) binding site, suggesting a unique mechanical fingerprint of this region that is key for matrix remodeling. Surprisingly, proline content did not correlate with local flexibility in either collagen type. We also found that physiologically relevant changes in pH and chloride concentration did not alter the flexibility of collagen IV, indicating such environmental changes are unlikely to control its compaction during secretion. Although extracellular chloride ions play a role in triggering collagen IV network formation, they do not appear to modulate the structure of its collagenous domain.\n\nSignificance StatementCollagens are the predominant proteins in vertebrates, forming diverse hierarchical structures to support cells and form connective tissues. Despite their mechanical importance, surprisingly little is established about the molecular encoding of mechanics. Here, we image single collagen proteins and find that they exhibit variable flexibility along their backbones. By comparing collagens with continuous and discontinuous triple-helix-forming sequences, we find that the type of helix interruption correlates with local flexibility, providing the first steps towards a much-needed map between sequence, structure, and mechanics in these large proteins. Our results inform our understanding of collagens ability to adopt compact conformations during cellular secretion and suggest a physical mechanism by which higher-order structure may be regulated by the distinct molecular properties of different collagens.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, rho-independent termination occurs through the formation of an intrinsic RNA terminator loop, which disrupts the RNA polymerase elongation complex, resulting in dissociation from the DNA template. ANTAR domains are a class of antiterminator that bind and stabilise mutually exclusive dual hexaloop motifs within the nascent RNA chain to prevent terminator loop formation. We have determined the structures of the dimeric ANTAR domain protein EutV, from E. faecialis, both in the absence of and in complex with the dual hexaloop RNA target. The structures illustrate the conformational changes that occur upon RNA binding and reveal the molecular interactions between the ANTAR domains and RNA are restricted to a single hexaloop of the motif. Our findings thereby redefine the minimal ANTAR domain binding motif to a single hexaloop and revise the current model for ANTAR-mediated antitermination. These insights will inform and facilitate the discovery of novel ANTAR domain RNA targets.",

    "abstract": "G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), or 7-transmembrane receptors, are a superfamily of membrane proteins that are critically important to physiological processes in the human body. Determining high-resolution structures of GPCRs without signaling partners bound requires crystallization in lipidic cubic phase (LCP). GPCR crystals grown in LCP are often too small for traditional X-ray crystallography. These microcrystals are ideal for investigation by microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED), but the gel-like nature of LCP makes traditional approaches to MicroED sample preparation insurmountable. Here we show that the structure of a human A2A adenosine receptor can be determined by MicroED after converting the LCP into the sponge phase followed by cryoFIB milling. We determined the structure of the A2A receptor to 2.8 [A] resolution and resolved an antagonist in its orthosteric ligand-binding site as well as 4 cholesterol molecules bound to the receptor. This study lays the groundwork for future GPCR structural studies using single microcrystals that would otherwise be impossible by other crystallographic methods.\n\nOne sentence summaryFIB milled LCP-GPCR structure determined by MicroED",

    "abstract": "Lymphedema is a chronic tissue edema that frequently occurs following lymph node resection for cancer treatment, and is characterized by progressive swelling, chronic inflammation, excessive fibrosis and adipose deposition in the affected limbs. We still lack targeted medical therapies for this disease due to the incomplete understanding of the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-seq of 70,209 cells of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of subcutaneous adipose tissue from patients with cancer-related lymphedema and healthy donors. Unbiased clustering revealed 21 cell clusters, which were assigned to 10 cell lineages. One of the four ASC subpopulations, c3, was significantly expanded in lymphedema, which may be related to the fibrosis and pathologic mineralization of adipose tissues in lymphedema. Dysregulated pathways and genes of ASCs in lymphedema were identified through gene set enrichment analysis and differential regulatory network analysis, which reflect the pathophysiological changes in ASCs in lymphedema: enhanced fibrosis, mineralization and proliferation as well as compromised immunosuppression capacity. In addition, we characterized the three subpopulations of macrophages, and found that the adipose tissue of lymphedema displayed immunological dysfunction characterized by a striking depletion of anti-inflammatory macrophages, i.e., LYVE+ resident-like macrophages. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed a perivascular ligand-receptor interaction module among ASCs, macrophages and vascular endothelial cells in adipose tissue. Communication changes for ASCs in lymphedema were identified. For example, PDGFD-PDGFR complex interactions were significantly enhanced between a number of lineages and ASCs, reflecting the role of PDGFD signaling in the pathophysiological changes in ASCs. Finally, we mapped the previously reported candidate genes predisposing to cancer-related lymphedema to cell subpopulations in the SVF, and found that GJC2, the most likely causal gene was highly expressed in the lymphedema-associated ASC subpopulation c3. In summary, we provided the first comprehensive analysis of cellular heterogeneity, lineage-specific regulatory changes and intercellular communication alterations of the SVF in adipose tissues from cancer-related lymphedema at a single-cell resolution. The lymphedema-associated cell subpopulations and dysregulated pathways may serve as potential targets for medical therapies. Our large-scale dataset constitutes a valuable resource for further investigations of the mechanism of cancer-related lymphedema.",

Topical application of glutamic acid decreased expression of genes related to apoptosis signaling in the skin. Also, we showed Glutamic acid increased viability and proliferation in cultured human keratinocyte. For the first time, we identified the excitotoxic GA concentration and we provided evidence for the existence of a novel skin signaling pathway mediated by a neurotransmitter controlling keratinocyte and hair follicle proliferation. In perspective, we anticipate our results could be the starting point to elucidate how exogenous glutamic acid from food intake or even endogenous GA from neuropsychiatric disorders modulate skin diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is considered a predominantly inherited disease in dogs. Recent reports suggest an increased incidence of DCM in atypical breeds eating grain-free and/or legume-rich diets. However, little data regarding incidence of DCM within the US is available; and no existing data quantifies DCM among breeds over time.\n\nHypothesisWe hypothesized that DCM incidence among breeds could be estimated by retrospective polling of veterinary cardiologists. Further, if a correlation existed between grain-free diets and DCM, an increase in DCM would be on trend with increased grain-free pet food sales.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThirty-six U.S. cardiology specialty practices were asked for all initial canine and DCM cases evaluated from 2000-2019; fourteen cardiology practices participated. DCM signalment data was provided by three hospitals over 15 years; representing 68 breeds. Age distribution of DCM cases upon diagnosis were compared to other cardio cases and general hospital population from one hospital. All data were evaluated using linear regression models. Grain-free pet food sales data was evaluated from 2011-2019.\n\nResultsFourteen hospitals participated and reported 67,243 unique canine patients. Nationally, data did not support a significant change in percent DCM over time (p=0.85). The overall average incidence rate of DCM during the study period was 3.83% (range 2.41-5.65%), while grain-free diet sales increased 500% from 2011-2019. No correlation between overall DCM incidence and grain free diet sales was discovered. A significant upward trend in mixed breeds diagnosed with DCM, with no significant trend in other breeds was appreciated. An upward trend in age at DCM diagnosis was identified, correlating with trends from overall hospital populations.\n\nConclusionsThese data do not support overall increased DCM incidence, or a correlation with grain-free pet food sales. Additional data are necessary to understand whether regional factors contribute to increased DCM within smaller cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the evolutionary stability and possible context-dependence of biological containment techniques is critical as engineered microbes are increasingly under consideration for applications beyond biomanufacturing. While batch cultures of synthetic auxotrophic Escherichia coli previously exhibited undetectable escape throughout 14 days of monitoring, the long-term effectiveness of synthetic auxotrophy is unknown. Here, we report automated continuous evolution of a synthetic auxotroph using custom chemostats that supply a decreasing concentration of essential biphenylalanine (BipA). After 100 days of evolution in three separate trials, populations exhibit no observable escape and are capable of normal growth rates at 10-fold lower BipA concentration than the ancestral synthetic auxotroph. Allelic reconstruction of three proteins implicated in small molecule transport reveals their contribution to increased fitness at low BipA concentrations. Mutations do not appear in orthogonal translation machinery nor in synthetic auxotrophic markers. Based on its evolutionary stability, we introduce the progenitor synthetic auxotroph directly to mammalian cell culture. We observe containment of bacteria without detrimental effects on HEK293T cells. Overall, our findings reveal that synthetic auxotrophy is effective on timescales and in contexts that enable diverse applications.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTo ascertain whether life inevitably finds a way, we continuously evolve an Escherichia coli strain that was not able to escape from engineered biocontainment before, and we find that it does not escape even after 100 days of evolution, nor does it escape when added to mammalian cell culture.",

    "abstract": "Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful model system for systems-wide biology screens and large-scale proteomics methods. Nearly complete proteomics coverage has been achieved owing to advances in mass spectrometry. However, it remains challenging to scale this technology for rapid and high-throughput analysis of the yeast proteome to investigate biological pathways on a global scale. Here we describe a systems biology workflow employing plate-based sample preparation and rapid, single-run data independent mass spectrometry analysis (DIA). Our approach is straightforward, easy to implement and enables quantitative profiling and comparisons of hundreds of nearly complete yeast proteomes in only a few days. We evaluate its capability by characterizing changes in the yeast proteome in response to environmental perturbations, identifying distinct responses to each of them, and providing a comprehensive resource of these responses. Apart from rapidly recapitulating previously observed responses, we characterized carbon source dependent regulation of the GID E3 ligase, an important regulator of cellular metabolism during the switch between gluconeogenic and glycolytic growth conditions. This unveiled new regulatory targets of the GID ligase during a metabolic switch. Our comprehensive yeast system read-out pinpointed effects of a single deletion or point mutation in the GID complex on the global proteome, allowing the identification and validation novel targets of the GID E3 ligase. Moreover, our approach allowed the identification of targets from multiple cellular pathways that display distinct patterns of regulation. Although developed in yeast, rapid whole proteome-based readouts can serve as comprehensive systems-level assay in all cellular systems.",

Thap1-/- OPCs accumulate and secrete excess GAGs, inhibiting their maturation through an auto-inhibitory mechanism. THAP1 controls GAG metabolism by binding to and regulating the GusB gene encoding {beta}-glucuronidase, a GAG-catabolic lysosomal enzyme. Applying GAG-degrading enzymes or overexpressing {beta}-glucuronidase rescues Thap1-/- OL maturation deficits in vitro and in vivo.

    "abstract": "Quantifying the similarity between artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their biological counterparts is an important step towards building more brain-like artificial intelligence systems. Recent efforts in this direction use neural predictivity, or the ability to predict the responses of a biological brain given the information in an ANN (such as its internal activations), when both are presented with the same stimulus. We propose a new approach to quantifying neural predictivity by explicitly mapping the activations of an ANN to brain responses with a nonlinear function, and measuring the error between the predicted and actual brain responses. Further, we propose to use a neural network to approximate this mapping function by training it on a set of neural recordings. The proposed method was implemented within the Tensorflow framework and evaluated on a suite of 8 state-of-the-art image recognition ANNs. Our experiments suggest that the use of a non-linear mapping function leads to higher neural predictivity. Our findings also reaffirm the observation that the latest advances in classification performance of image recognition ANNs are not matched by improvements in their neural predictivity. Finally, we examine the impact of pruning, a widely used ANN optimization, on neural predictivity, and demonstrate that network sparsity leads to higher neural predictivity.",

By systematically analyzing the trafficking itinerary of a misfolded GPI-anchored prion protein (PrP) mutant, we unveil endocytic pathways that drive its immediate degradation in the soma, versus its aggregation in axons inside endosomal structures we termed endoggresomes. Axonal sorting occurs post-Golgi, by association of mutant PrP vesicles with Arl8b/kinesin-1/HOPS, a complex that earmarks them for axonal entry, fusion, and aggregation via a mechanism of axonal rapid endosomal sorting and transport-dependent aggregation (ARESTA). Endoggresomes persist in axons due to transport and lysosomal deficits, impairing calcium dynamics and accelerating neuronal death. Reducing ARESTA inhibits endoggresome formation and circumvents these defects. These data identify the endo-lysosomal system as critical for the sorting of misfolded PrP, and ARESTA as an actionable anti-aggregation target that can ameliorate axonal dysfunction in the prionopathies.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of mental illness, testing of treatment effects, and design of prevention strategies all require brain-based biomarkers that can serve as effective targets of evaluation. The search for such markers often starts with a search for neural correlates from brain imaging studies with measures of functions and behavior of interest.

Only when the markers map onto neurocomputationally-relevant parameters can such markers best serve the intended function. Here we take an alternative approach to begin with targeting the neuroanatomically and neurophysiologically well-defined neuromoduatory systems that are well positioned to serve the computational role of generating globally synchronized neural activity for the purpose of functional integration [1]. By applying second-order blind identification (SOBI) [2], a blind source separation algorithm (BSS), to five minutes of resting-state EEG data (n=13), we provide evidence to support our conclusion that neuroelectrical signals associated with synchronized global network activity can be extracted using the detailed temporal information in the on-going continuously recorded EEG, instead of event-related potentials (ERPs). We report reliable extraction of a SOBI component, which we refer to as the P3-like component, in every individual studied, replicating our earlier report on data from a single participant [3]. We show that individual differences in the neural networks underlying this P3-like component can be revealed in high dimensional space by a vector of hits-based measures [4] for each of the P3-like networks constituent structures. Given that resting-state EEG can be obtained with greater ease at natural non-hospital settings and at much lower cost in comparison with fMRI, and that mobile EEG systems have become increasingly available, the present work offers an enabling technology to support rapid and low-cost assessment of much larger and diverse populations of individuals, addressing several methodological limitations in our current investigation of brain function. Future opportunities and current limitations will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria use extracellular appendages called type IV pili (T4P) for diverse behaviors including DNA uptake, surface sensing, virulence, protein secretion, and twitching motility1. Dynamic extension and retraction of T4P is essential for their function, yet little is known about the mechanisms controlling these dynamics or the extent to which their regulation is conserved across bacterial species. Here, we develop Acinetobacter baylyi as a new model to study T4P by employing a recently developed pilus labeling method2,3. Our findings overturn the current dogma that T4P extension occurs through the action of a single, highly conserved motor, PilB, by showing that T4P synthesis in A. baylyi is dependent on an additional, phylogenetically distinct motor, TfpB. Furthermore, we uncover an inhibitor of T4P extension that specifically binds to and inhibits PilB but not TfpB. These results expand our understanding of T4P regulation and highlight how inhibitors might be exploited to inhibit T4P synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) exposure to skin causes photo-damage and acts as the primary etiological agent in photo-carcinogenesis. UV-B exposure induces photodamage in epidermal cells and is the major factor that challenges skin homeostasis. Autophagy allows fundamental adaptation of cells to metabolic needs and stresses. Cellular dysfunction is observed in aged tissues and in toxic insults to cells that undergo through stress. Conversely, promising anti-aging strategies aimed at inhibiting the mTOR pathway has been found to significantly improve the aging related disorders. Recently, autophagy has been found to positively regulate skin homeostasis by enhancing DNA damage recognition. Here we investigated the Geno-protective roles of autophagy in UV-B exposed primary HDFs. We found that improving autophagy levels in HDFs regulates UV-B mediated cellular stress by decreasing the formation of DNA photo adducts, alleviates oxidative and ER stress response and by regulating the expression levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins P21 and P27. Autophagy also prevents HDFs from UV-B -induced nuclear damage as is evident from Tunnel assay and Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide co-staining. Salubrinal, (an eIf2 inhibitor) significantly decreases the DNA damage response in HDFs. P62 silenced HDFs show enhanced DNA damage response and disturbs the tumor suppressor axis PTEN/pAKT towards damage whereas ATG7 silenced HDFs reveal an unexpected consequence by decreasing the UV-B -induced DNA damage compared to UV-B treated HDFs. Together, our results suggest that autophagy is essential in protecting skin cells from UV-B radiation -induced photo-damage and holds great promise in devising it as a suitable therapeutic strategy against skin photo-damage.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAutophagy is an immediate molecular event induced following exposure of primary HDFs to UV-B -irradiation\nC_LIO_LIAutophagy offers pro-survival capacity to HDFs under UV-B induced genotoxic stress\nC_LIO_LIAutophagy regulates DNA Damage Response via regulation of oxidative and ER stress in UV-B exposed HDFs\nC_LIO_LIRelieving ER stress response offers significant protection to primary HDFs from UV-B by decreasing the DNA damage\nC_LIO_LIAutophagy deprivation to HDFs via P62 silencing potentiates UV-B -induced DNA damage response\nC_LIO_LIATG7 silencing in UV-B exposed HDFs unexpectedly alleviates the DNA Damage Response in primary HDFs\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Coral reefs are facing increasingly devasting impacts from ocean warming and acidification due to anthropogenic climate change. In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, potential solutions have focused either on reducing light stress during heating, or the potential for identifying or engineering \"super corals\". These studies, however, have tended to focus primarily on the bleaching response of corals, and assume that corals that bleach earlier in a thermal event are more likely to die. Here, we explore how survival, potential bleaching, and coral skeletal growth (as branch extension and densification) varies for conspecifics collected from distinctive reef zones at Heron Island on the Southern Great Barrier Reef. A series of reciprocal transplantation experiments were undertaken using the dominant reef building coral (Acropora formosa) between the highly variable  reef flat and the less variable  reef slope environments. Coral colonies originating from the reef flat had higher rates of survival and thicker tissues but reduced rates of calcification than conspecifics originating from the reef slope. The energetics of both populations however benefited from greater light intensity offered in the shallows. Reef flat origin corals moved to the lower light intensity of reef slope reduced protein density and calcification rates. For A. formosa, genetic difference, or long-term entrainment to a highly variable environment, appeared to promote coral survival at the expense of calcification. The response divorces coral resilience from carbonate coral reef resilience, a response that was further exacerbated by reductions in irradiance. As we begin to discuss interventions necessitated by the CO2 that has already been released to the atmosphere, we need to prioritise our focus on the properties that maintain valuable carbonate ecosystems. Rapid and dense calcification by corals such as branching Acropora is essential to the ability of carbonate coral reefs to rebound following disturbances events, but may be the first property that is sacrificed to enable coral genet survival under stress.",

    "abstract": "Flexible learning of changing reward contingencies can be realized with different strategies. A fast learning strategy involves using working memory of recently rewarded objects to guide choices. A slower learning strategy uses prediction errors to gradually update value expectations to improve choices. How the fast and slow strategies work together in scenarios with real-world stimulus complexity is not well known. Here, we disentangle their relative contributions in rhesus monkeys while they learned the relevance of object features at variable attentional load. We found that learning behavior across six subjects is consistently best predicted with a model combining (i) fast working memory (ii) slower reinforcement learning from differently weighted positive and negative prediction errors, as well as (iii) selective suppression of non-chosen feature values and (iv) a meta-learning mechanism adjusting exploration rates based on a memory trace of recent errors. These mechanisms cooperate differently at low and high attentional loads. While working memory was essential for efficient learning at lower attentional loads, enhanced weighting of negative prediction errors and meta-learning were essential for efficient learning at higher attentional loads. Together, these findings pinpoint a canonical set of learning mechanisms and demonstrate how they cooperate when subjects flexibly adjust to environments with variable real-world attentional demands.\n\nSignificance statementLearning which visual features are relevant for achieving our goals is challenging in real-world scenarios with multiple distracting features and feature dimensions. It is known that in such scenarios learning benefits significantly from attentional prioritization. Here we show that beyond attention, flexible learning uses a working memory system, a separate learning gain for avoiding negative outcomes, and a meta-learning process that adaptively increases exploration rates whenever errors accumulate. These subcomponent processes of cognitive flexibility depend on distinct learning signals that operate at varying timescales, including the most recent reward outcome (for working memory), memories of recent outcomes (for adjusting exploration), and reward prediction errors (for attention augmented reinforcement learning). These results illustrate the specific mechanisms that cooperate during cognitive flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sensor that functions in the innate immune system. Upon binding dsDNA in the cytoplasm, cGAS and dsDNA form phase-separated aggregates in which cGAS catalyzes synthesis of 23-cyclic GMP-AMP that subsequently triggers a STING-dependent, type I IFN response. Here, we showed that cytoplasmic RNAs, especially tRNAs, regulate cGAS activity. We discovered that RNAs did not activate cGAS but rather promoted phase separation in vitro. In cells, cGAS colocalized with RNAs and formed phase-separated granules even in the absence of cytoplasmic dsDNA. An Opti-prep gradient analysis of cell lysates showed that the endogenous cGAS was associated with cytoplasmic RNAs in an aggregative form. Further in vitro assays showed that RNAs compete for binding of cGAS with dsDNA and inhibit cGAS activity when the dsDNA concentration is high and promote the formation of phase separations and enhance cGAS activity when the dsDNA concentration is low. Thus, cytoplasmic RNAs regulate cGAS activity by interfering with formation of cGAS-containing aggregates.",

    "abstract": "MotivationFacing the increasing gap between high-throughput sequence data and limited functional insights, computational protein function annotation provides a high-throughput alternative to experimental approaches. However, current methods can have limited applicability while relying on data besides sequences, or lack generalizability to novel sequences, species and functions.\n\nResultsTo overcome aforementioned barriers in applicability and generalizability, we propose a novel deep learning model, named Transformer-based protein function Annotation through joint sequence-Label Embedding (TALE). For generalizbility to novel sequences we use self attention-based transformers to capture global patterns in sequences. For generalizability to unseen or rarely seen functions, we also embed protein function labels (hierarchical GO terms on directed graphs) together with inputs/features (sequences) in a joint latent space. Combining TALE and a sequence similarity-based method, TALE+ outperformed competing methods when only sequence input is available. It even outperformed a state-of-the-art method using network information besides sequence, in two of the three gene ontologies. Furthermore, TALE and TALE+ showed superior generalizability to proteins of low homology and never/rarely annotated novel species or functions compared to training data, revealing deep insights into the protein sequence-function relationship. Ablation studies elucidated contributions of algorithmic components toward the accuracy and the generalizability.\n\nAvailabilityThe data, source codes and models are available at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/TALE\n\nContactyshen@tamu.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Here, we developed AFTME, an alignment-free method for automatic mapping of 3D motifs to different FGs of a specific ligand through two-dimensional clustering. Applying our method to 233 nature-existing ligands, we defined 481 FG-binding motifs that are highly conserved across different ligand-binding pockets. Systematic analysis further reveals four main classes of binding motifs corresponding to distinct sets of FGs. Combinations of FG-binding motifs facilitate proteins to bind a wide spectrum of ligands with various binding affinities. Finally, we showed that these general binding patterns are also applicable to target-drug interactions, providing new insights into structure-based drug design.",

While H&E stainings are still the gold standard to diagnose disease, the integration of microscopic and molecular information is becoming crucial to advance our understanding of tissue heterogeneity. To this end, we propose a data fusion method that integrates spatial omics and microscopic data obtained from the same tissue slide. Through correspondence-aware manifold learning, we can visualise the biological trends observed in the high-dimensional omics data at microscopic resolution. While data fusion enables the detection of elements that would not be detected taking into account the separate data modalities individually, out-of-sample prediction makes it possible to predict molecular trends outside of the measured tissue area. The proposed dimensionality reduction-based data fusion paradigm will therefore be helpful in deciphering molecular heterogeneity by bringing molecular measurements such as MSI to the cellular resolution.",

Binding affinity helps in understanding the degree of protein-ligand interactions and has wide protein applications. Protein-ligand docking using virtual screening and molecular dynamic simulations are required to predict the binding affinity of a ligand to its cognate receptor. In order to perform such analyses, it requires intense computational power and it becomes impossible to cover the entire chemical space of small molecules. Recent developments using deep learning has enabled us to make sense of massive amounts of complex datasets where the ability of the model to \"learn\" intrinsic patterns in a complex plane of data is the strength of the approach. Here, we have incorporated Convolutional Neural Networks to find spatial relationships amongst data to help us predict affinity of binding of proteins in whole superfamilies towards a diverse set of ligands without the need of a docked pose or complex as input. The models were trained and validated using a detailed methodology for feature extraction. We have also tested DEELIG on protein complexes relevant to the current public health scenario.

    "abstract": "The current COVID-19 pandemic has a devastating global impact and is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 attaches to human host cells through interaction of its receptor binding domain (RBD) located on the viral Spike (S) glycoprotein with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells. RBD binding to ACE2 is a critical first step in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral attachment occurs in dynamic environments where forces act on the binding partners and multivalent interactions play central roles, creating an urgent need for assays that can quantitate SARS-CoV-2 interactions with ACE2 under mechanical load and in defined geometries. Here, we introduce a tethered ligand assay that comprises the RBD and the ACE2 ectodomain joined by a flexible peptide linker. Using specific molecular handles, we tether the fusion proteins between a functionalized flow cell surface and magnetic beads in magnetic tweezers. We observe repeated interactions of RBD and ACE2 under constant loads and can fully quantify the force dependence and kinetics of the binding interaction. Our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 interaction has higher mechanical stability, a larger free energy of binding, and a lower off-rate than that of SARS-CoV-1, the causative agents of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. In the absence of force, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD rapidly (within [&le;]1 ms) engages the ACE2 receptor if held in close proximity and remains bound to ACE2 for 400-800 s, much longer than what has been reported for other viruses engaging their cellular receptors. We anticipate that our assay will be a powerful tool investigate the roles of mutations in the RBD that might alter the infectivity of the virus and to test the modes of action of neutralizing antibodies and other agents designed to block RBD binding to ACE2 that are currently developed as potential COVID-19 therapeutics.",

Cancer-relevant mRNAs BIRC5 (Survivin) and YBX1 as well as long-noncoding RNAs HOTAIR, ZFAS1, and AGAP2-AS1 were detected in BT-474 EVs by quantitative RT-PCR.

    "abstract": "siRNAs hold a great potential for cancer therapy, however, poor stability in body fluids and low cellular uptake limit their use in the clinic. To enhance the bioavailability of siRNAs in tumors, novel, safe, and effective carriers are needed. Here, we developed cationic solid lipid nanoparticles (cSLNs) to carry siRNAs targeting EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase (siEphA2), which is overexpressed in many solid tumors including prostate cancer (PCa). Using DDAB cationic lipid instead of DOTMA reduced nanoparticle size and enhanced both cellular uptake and gene silencing in PCa cells. After verifying the efficacy of siEphA2-loaded nanoparticles, we further evaluated a potential combination with a histone lysine demethylase inhibitor, JIB-04. Silencing EphA2 by siEphA2-loaded DDAB-cSLN did not affect the viability (2D and 3D), migration, and clonogenicity of PC-3 cells alone. However, upon co-administration, there was a decrease in the aforementioned cellular responses due to JIB-04. Furthermore, JIB-04 decreased EphA2 expression, and thus, silencing efficiency of siEphA2-loaded nanoparticles was further increased with co-treatment. In conclusion, we have successfully developed a novel siRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticle for targeting EphA2. Moreover, detailed preliminary results of the effects of JIB-04, alone and in combination with siEphA2, on PCa cells and tumor spheroids were presented for the first time. Our delivery system provides high transfection efficiency and shows a great promise for targeting other genes and cancer types in further in vitro and in vivo studies.",

    "abstract": "Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) are biomarkers of and contributors to the etiology of disease. Skeletal muscle (SkM) and white adipose tissue (WAT) are the two largest organs by mass in humans and rodents but the relative contribution of EVs from these tissues is unknown. We hypothesized that SkM tissue secretes more EVs than WAT and that a dual fluorescent reporter mouse could be used to detect SkM myofiber-derived EVs in vivo. Human Protein Atlas data and directly measuring EV secretion in mouse SkM and WAT using an ex vivo tissue explant model confirmed that SkM tissue secretes more EVs than WAT. Differences in EV secretion between SkM and WAT were not due to SkM contraction but may be explained by differences in tissue metabolic capacity. A SkM myofiber-specific dual fluorescent reporter mouse was created. Spectral flow cytometry revealed that SkM myofibers are a major source of SkM tissue-derived EVs ex vivo but few reach the circulation in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that SkM secretes more EVs than WAT and many come from SkM myofibers, but our in vivo data indicate that EVs secreted by SkM myofibers may remain primarily in their local extracellular environment.",

    "abstract": "Although degree of T-cell infiltration in CRC was shown to correlate with a positive prognosis, the contribution of phenotypically and functionally distinct T cell subtypes within tumors remains unclear. We analyzed 37,931 single T cells with respect to transcriptome, TCR sequence and 23 cell surface proteins, from tumors and adjacent normal colon of 16 patients. Our comprehensive analysis revealed two phenotypically distinct cytotoxic T cell populations within tumors, including positively prognostic effector memory cells and non-prognostic resident memory cells. These cytotoxic T cell infiltrates transitioned from effector memory to resident memory in a stage-dependent manner. We further defined several Treg subpopulations within tumors. While Tregs overall were associated with positive clinical outcomes, CD38+ peripherally-derived Tregs, phenotypically related to Th17 cells, correlated with poor outcomes independent of cancer stage. Thus, our data highlight the diversity of T cells in CRC and demonstrate the prognostic significance of distinct T cell subtypes, which could inform therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "The innate immune response to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin infection culminates in forming an abscess that prevents the bacterial spread and tissue damage. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) dictate the balance between microbial control and tissue damage. Therefore, intracellular brakes are of fundamental importance to tune the appropriate host defense while preventing injury. The intracellular inhibitor suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1); is a classic JAK/STAT inhibitor that prevents PRR responses by influencing the expression and actions of PRR adaptors and downstream effectors. Whether SOCS-1 is a molecular component of skin host defense remains to be determined. Here, we hypothesized that SOCS-1 decreases type I interferon production and IFNAR-mediated antimicrobial effector functions of the inflammatory response during MRSA skin infection. Our data show that MRSA skin infection enhances SOCS-1 expression, and both SOCS-1 inhibitor peptide treated and myeloid-specific SOCS-1 deficient mice display decreased lesion size, bacterial loads, and increased abscess thickness when compared to wild-type mice treated or not with scrambled peptide control. SOCS-1 deletion/inhibition increases phagocytosis and bacterial killing, dependent on nitric oxide release. SOCS-1 inhibition also increases antimicrobial effector function correlated with type I and type II interferon levels in vivo. IFNAR deletion and antibody blockage abolished the beneficial effects of SOCS-1 inhibition in vivo. Notably, we unveiled that hyperglycemia triggers aberrant SOCS-1 expression that correlates with decreased overall IFN signatures in the skin. SOCS-1 inhibition restores skin host defense in highly susceptible hyperglycemic mice. Overall, these data demonstrate a role for type I interferons in enhancing microbial clearance and host defense during MRSA skin infection.",

    "abstract": "Cilia are hair-like membrane protrusions that emanate from the surface of most vertebrate cells and are classified into motile and primary cilia. Motile cilia move fluid flow or propel cells, while also fulfilling sensory functions. Primary cilia are immotile and act as a cellular antenna, translating environmental cues into cellular responses. Ciliary dysfunction leads to severe diseases, commonly termed ciliopathies. The molecular details underlying ciliopathies and ciliary function are, however, not well understood. Since cilia are small subcellular compartments, imaging-based approaches have been used to study them. However, tools to comprehensively analyze images are lacking. Automatic analysis approaches require commercial software and are limited to 2D analysis and only a few parameters. The widely used manual analysis approaches are time consuming, user-biased, and difficult to compare. Here, we present CiliaQ, a package of open-source, freely-available, and easy-to-use ImageJ plugins. CiliaQ allows high throughput analysis of 2D and 3D, static or time-lapse images from fluorescence microscopy of cilia in cell culture or tissues, and outputs a comprehensive list of parameters for ciliary morphology, length, bending, orientation, and fluorescence intensity, making it broadly applicable. We envision CiliaQ as a resource and platform for reproducible and comprehensive analysis of ciliary function in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe Indian Thar desert has lost much of its grasslands over the last few decades, mainly due to land-use change from pastoralism to agriculture. Expanding croplands and intensifying grazing pressures are popularly hypothesized to be major drivers of biodiversity loss in the region. Our study aims to investigate the effects of contemporary land-use change on bird communities of the Western Thar Desert.\nC_LIO_LIWe surveyed 58 randomly laid line transects in a c2000 sq.km study area, to quantify parameters of bird community structure in three predominant land-use types viz. protected grasslands, rangelands, and non-irrigated croplands. Fieldwork for the study was conducted in the dry season (winter and summer) between December 2018 and April 2019.\nC_LIO_LIDuring winter, overall bird richness and abundance were highest in protected grasslands followed by non-irrigated croplands and rangelands. Protected grasslands also had a higher abundance of diet and habitat specialists. Compared to protected grasslands, density was lower in non-irrigated croplands and rangelands for 35% and 10% of species, respectively. A majority of the negatively affected species were insectivorous grassland specialists.\nC_LIO_LIContrary to the pattern in winter, overall bird richness, abundance, community composition, and guild structure in summer were similar across three land-use types. Only one of the 17 analysed species had lower density in modified land-use types.\nC_LIO_LIOverall, protected grassland was the best habitat for birds and was specifically important for specialists, particularly during the winter. Rangelands and fallow croplands sustained most generalists at comparable densities but had severe negative impacts on specialists.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis and application: Our results point out that low-intensity agro-pastoral land-uses can supplement, but not replace, protected areas in conservation of Thar deserts avifaunal diversity. Our results are consistent with the idea of managing dryland habitats as agro-grassland mosaics with embedded protected areas, in order to reconcile human needs and biodiversity conservation at a landscape scale.\nC_LI",

We hypothesis that integration of GAR dwarfing-genes into elite wheat cultivars can promote early vigor and weed-competitiveness under Mediterranean climate. We develop near-isogenic lines of bread wheat cultivars with GAR dwarfing genes and evaluate them for early vigor and weed-competitiveness under various environmental and management conditions to identify promising NIL for weed-competitiveness and grain yield. While all three NILs, OC1 (Rht8,12), ZC4 (Rht12,13), and BNMF12 (Rht12), responded to gibberellic acid, they exhibited differences in early vigor. Greenhouse and field evaluation highlighted OC1 as a promising line, with significant advantage in early vigor over its parental. To facilitate accurate and continuous early vigor data collection, we applied non-destructive image-based phenotyping approaches which offers non-expensive and end-user friendly solution for selection. NIL OC1 was tested under different weed density level, infestation waves, and temperatures and highlight the complex genotypic x environmental x management interactions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of genetic modification of dwarfing genes as promising approach to improve weed-competitiveness, and serve as basis for future breeding efforts to support sustainable wheat production under semi-arid Mediterranean climate.",

    "abstract": "Plants display a remarkable ability to adjust their growth and development to changes in environmental conditions, such as reduction in water availability. This high degree of plasticity is apparent not only as altered root and shoot growth rates, but also as changes to tissue patterning and cell morphology [1,2]. We have previously shown that Arabidopsis thaliana root xylem displays plastic developmental responses to limited water availability, mediated by non-cell autonomous action of abscisic acid, ABA [2]. Here, we show through analyses of ABA response reporters and tissue specific suppression of ABA signalling that xylem cells act as primary signalling centres for mediation of changes to both xylem cell fate and differentiation rate revealing a cell autonomous control of xylem development by ABA. Transcriptomic changes in response to ABA showed that members of the VASCULAR RELATED NAC DOMAIN (VND) transcription factor family are rapidly activated. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that the two aspects of xylem developmental changes, cell fate and differentiation rate, are dependent on distinct members of this transcription factor family. Thus, this study provides insights into how different aspects of developmental plasticity can be interlinked, yet genetically independent of each other. Moreover, similarities in phenotypic and molecular responses to ABA in diverse species indicate an evolutionary conservation of the ABA-xylem development regulatory network among eudicots. Hence, this study gives molecular insights on how environmental stress promotes anatomical plasticity to key plant traits with potential relevance for water use optimization and adaptation to drought conditions.",

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable success and efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy against the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, it induces sustained responses in a sizeable minority of cancer patients due to the activation of immunosuppressive factors such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Inhibiting the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs is critical for successful cancer ICB therapy. Interestingly, lipid metabolism is a crucial factor in modulating MDSCs function. Fatty acid transport protein 2 (FATP2) conferred the function of PMN-MDSCs in cancer via the upregulation of arachidonic acid metabolism. However, whether regulating lipid accumulation in MDSCs by targeting FATP2 could block MDSCs reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhance PD-L1 blockade-mediated tumor immunotherapy remains unexplored. Here we report that FATP2 regulated lipid accumulation, ROS, and immunosuppressive function of MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice. Tumor cells-derived granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induced FATP2 expression in MDSCs by activation of STAT3 signaling pathway. Pharmaceutical blockade of FATP2 expression in MDSCs by lipofermata decreased lipid accumulation, reduced ROS, blocked immunosuppressive activity, and consequently inhibited tumor growth. More importantly, lipofermata inhibition of FATP2 in MDSCs enhanced anti-PD-L1 tumor immunotherapy via the upregulation of CD107a and reduced PD-L1 expression on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells. Furthermore, the combination therapy blocked MDSCs suppressive role on T-cells thereby enhanced T-cells ability for the production of IFN-{gamma}. These findings indicate that FATP2 plays a key role in modulating lipid-induced ROS in MDSCs and targeting FATP2 in MDSCs provides a novel therapeutic approach to enhance anti-PD-L1 cancer immunotherapy.\n\nResearch highlightsO_LIFATP2 inhibition in MDSCs blocked ROS-mediated immunosuppressive function and promoted MDSCs differentiation to immune-stimulatory phenotype.\nC_LIO_LIGM-CSF mediated FATP2 expression via activation of STAT3 signaling leading to lipid accumulation-induced ROS in MDSCs.\nC_LIO_LIFATP2 inhibition enhanced anti-PD-L1 tumor immunotherapy by reducing MDSCs immunosuppressive activity in blocking T-cells ability to produce IFN-{gamma}.\nC_LIO_LICombination of anti-PD-L1 antibody and FATP2 inhibitor decreased MDSCs accumulation and PD-L1 surface expression in the spleens of LLC-bearing mice.\nC_LIO_LICombined treatment of FATP2 inhibitor and PD-L1 blockade-mediated tumor immunotherapy enhanced tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells activation via increased CD107a and reduced PD-L1 surface expression.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Shigellosis is a diarrhoeal disease caused mainly by Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei. Infection from Shigella is thought to be largely self-limiting, with short- to medium- term and serotype-specific immunity provided following clearance. However, cases of men who have sex with men (MSM) associated shigellosis have been reported where Shigella of the same serotype were serially sampled from individuals between 1 to 1862 days apart, possibly due to persistent carriage or reinfection with the same serotype. Here, we investigate the accessory genome dynamics of MSM associated S. flexneri and S. sonnei isolates serially sampled from individual patients at various days apart. We find that pairs likely associated with persistent carriage infection and with smaller single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distance, demonstrated significantly less variation in accessory genome content than pairs likely associated with reinfection and with greater SNP-distance. We also observed evidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) acquisition during persistent Shigella infection, specifically the gain of extended spectrum beta-lactamase genes in two pairs associated with persistent carriage. Finally, we explored chromosomal structural variations and rearrangements in seven (5 chronic and 2 reinfection associated) pairs of S. flexneri 3a isolates from a MSM-associated epidemic sublineage, which revealed variations at several common regions across pairs. These variations were mediated by insertion sequence (IS) elements which facilitated plasticity of genetic material with a distinct predicted functional profile. This study provides insight on the variation of accessory genome dynamics and large structural genomic changes in Shigella during persistent infection.\n\nImportanceShigella spp are Gram-negative bacteria that are the etiological agent of shigellosis, the second most common cause of diarrhoeal illness globally, particularly among children under the age of 5 in low-income countries. In high-income countries, an alternative transmission pathway of sexually transmissible disease among men who have sex with men (MSM) is emerging as the dominant presentation of the disease. Within MSM we have captured prolonged infection and/or recurrent infection with shigellae of the same serotype, challenging the belief that Shigella infection is short-lived, and confers homologous serotypic immunity. Using this recently-emerged transmission scenario we comprehensively characterise the genomic changes that occur over the course of individual infection with Shigella and uncover a distinct functional profile of variable genome regions in these globally important pathogens.",

We perform shotgun transcriptome sequencing of human RNA obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with COVID-19, and identify a molecular signature associated with disease severity. Specifically, we identify globally dysregulated immune related pathways, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, JAK-STAT, and TGF-{beta} signaling pathways in all, though to a higher extent in patients with severe symptoms. The excessive release of cytokines and chemokines such as CCL2, CCL22, CXCL9 and CXCL12 and certain interferons and interleukins related genes like IFIH1, IFI44, IFIT1 and IL10 were significantly higher in patients with severe clinical presentation compared to mild and moderate presentations. Moreover, early induction of the TGF-{beta} signaling pathway might be the primary cause of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with severe disease. Differential gene expression analysis identified a small set of regulatory genes that might act as strong predictors of patient outcome.

    "abstract": "Membrane proteins play numerous physiological roles and are thus of tremendous interest in pharmacology. Nevertheless, stable and homogeneous sample preparation is one of the bottlenecks in biophysical and pharmacological studies of membrane proteins because membrane proteins are typically unstable and poorly expressed. To overcome such obstacles, GFP fusion-based Fluorescence-detection Size-Exclusion Chromatography (FSEC) has been widely employed for membrane protein expression screening for over a decade. However, fused GFP itself may occasionally affect the expression and/or stability of the targeted membrane protein, leading to both false-positive and false-negative results in expression screening. Furthermore, GFP fusion technology is not well suited for some membrane proteins depending on their membrane topology. Here, we developed an FSEC assay utilizing nanobody (Nb) technology, named FSEC-Nb, in which targeted membrane proteins are fused to a small peptide tag and recombinantly expressed. The whole-cell extracts are solubilized, mixed with anti-peptide Nb fused to GFP and applied to a size-exclusion chromatography column attached to a fluorescence detector for FSEC analysis. FSEC-Nb enables one to evaluate the expression, monodispersity and thermostability of membrane proteins without the need of purification by utilizing the benefits of the GFP fusion-based FSEC method, but does not require direct GFP fusion to targeted proteins. We applied FSEC-Nb to screen zinc-activated ion channel (ZAC) family proteins in the Cys-loop superfamily and membrane proteins from SARS-CoV-2 as examples of the practical application of FSEC-Nb. We successfully identified a ZAC ortholog with high monodispersity but moderate expression levels that could not be identified with the previously developed GFP fusion-free FSEC method. Consistent with the results of FSEC-Nb screening, the purified ZAC ortholog showed monodispersed particles by both negative staining EM and cryo-EM. Furthermore, we identified two membrane proteins from SARS-CoV-2 with high monodispersity and expression level by FSEC-Nb, which may facilitate structural and functional studies of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our results show FSEC-Nb as a powerful tool for membrane protein expression screening that can provide further opportunity to prepare well-behaved membrane proteins for structural and functional studies.",

We investigated whether Slc26a9 loss causes spontaneous gastric carcinogenesis in mice and plays a role in the development and progression in human gastric cancer (GC). Gastric histopathology and potential molecular mechanism were explored in Slc26a9 knockout mice and wild-type littermates as well as Slc26a9fl/fl/Atp4b-Cre and Slc26a9fl/fl mice from 8 days to 18 months by histological and immunohistochemical analyses, quantitative PCR, in situ hybridization, and RNA microarray analysis, respectively.

    "abstract": "Wildlife in cities can act as reservoirs for parasites that can infect domestic pets and have implications for human health. For example, the Coccidian parasite Toxoplasma gondii can infect all mammalian species, with felids acting as the only definitive hosts. Rodents, such as squirrels, could play an important role in urban infection dynamics of T. gondii, as squirrels occur at higher densities in cities than in natural environments and regularly share their territories with cats. In urban and suburban areas squirrels can encounter infectious oocysts shed in cat feces in contaminated soil or in the food they eat. They are also preyed upon by cats making them a potentially important species for completing the T. gondii life cycle in cities. We hypothesized that due to increased exposure to cats, urban squirrels would be more susceptible to T. gondii infection relative to squirrels in more natural areas. We investigated this using molecular and serological methods on samples collected from American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), eastern grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus), and least chipmunks (Tamias minimus) in and around the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. We tested a total of 230 tissue samples from 46 squirrels for T. gondii DNA using quantitative PCR and supplemented these data with analyses of 13 serum samples from grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) testing for T. gondii antibodies by indirect ELISA. We found no evidence of T. gondii infection in any squirrel. This suggests that squirrels may not be important intermediate hosts of T. gondii in cities and do not need to be considered as sources of infection to cats.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInherited mutations in the LRRK2 protein are the most common known cause of Parkinsons, but the mechanisms by which increased kinase activity of mutant LRRK2 leads to pathological events remain to be determined. In vitro assays (heterologous cell culture, phospho-protein mass spectrometry) suggest that several Rab proteins might be directly phosphorylated by LRRK2-G2019S. Which Rabs interact with LRRK2 in dopaminergic neurons to facilitate normal and pathological physiological responses remains to be determined. An in vivo screen of Rab expression in dopaminergic neurons in young adult Drosophila demonstrated a strong genetic interaction between LRRK2-G2019S and Rab10. We now ask if Rab10 is required for LRRK2-induced physiological responses in DA neurons.\n\nMethodsLRRK2-G2019S was expressed in Drosophila dopaminergic neurons and the effects of Rab10 depletion on Proboscis Extension, vision, circadian activity pattern and courtship memory determined in aged flies.\n\nResultsRab10 loss-of-function rescued bradykinesia of the Proboscis Extension Response (PER) and visual defects of aged flies expressing LRRK2-G2019S in DA neurons. Rab10 knock-down however, did not rescue the marked sleep phenotype which results from dopaminergic expression of LRRK2-G2019S. Courtship memory is not affected by LRRK2 expression, but is markedly improved by Rab10 depletion. Anatomically, both LRRK2-G2019S and Rab10 are seen in the cytoplasm and at the synaptic endings of dopaminergic neurons.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude that, in Drosophila dopaminergic neurons, Rab10 is involved differentially in LRRK2-induced behavioral deficits. Therefore, variations in Rab expression may contribute to susceptibility of different dopaminergic nuclei to neurodegeneration seen in people with Parkinsons.\n\nGraphical AbstractRab10 depletion ameliorates the proboscis extension bradykinesia and loss of synaptic signalling in the retina induced by LRRK2-G2019S expression (magenta arrows / orange crosses). Rab10 manipulation does not affect the  sleep phenotype from LRRK2-G2019S (magenta arrow). Reduction of Rab10 facilitates conditioned courtship memory, but LRRK2 has no effect (yellow arrow). All manipulations of Rab10 and G2019S in dopaminergic neurons, shown in the outline of the brain (filled cells have high levels of Rab10). We conclude that Rab10 and LRRK2 interact in some, but not all dopaminergic neurons. This may underlie differences in the susceptibility of different human striatal dopaminergic cells to Parkinsons and explain why different symptoms initiate particular ages.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=172 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/316992v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e9a923org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15f7135org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@101525borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c5da02_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Over 7 million liters of Corexit EC9500A and EC9527A were applied to the Gulf of Mexico in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The impacts of dispersants remain under debate and negative, positive, and inconclusive impacts have been reported. Here, metatrancriptomics was applied in the context of metapangenomes to microcosms that simulated environmental conditions comparable to the hydrocarbon-rich 1,100 m deep plume. Within this microcosm study, negative effects of dispersants on microbial hydrocarbon degradation were previously reported based on activity measurements and geochemical data. Transcriptional enrichment of Colwellia, a potential dispersant degrader, followed variable time-dependent trajectories due to interactions between oil, dispersants, and nutrients. The Colwellia metapangenome captured a mixture of environmental responses linked to the Colwellia psychrerythraea 34H genome and to the genomes of other members of the Colwellia genus. The activation of genes involved in lipid degradation, nitrogen metabolism, and membrane composition under oil or nutrient availability, suggested an opportunistic growth strategy for Colwellia. In contrast, transcripts of Marinobacter, a natural hydrocarbon degrader, increased only in oil treatments. Marinobacter transcripts largely recruited to the accessory metapangenome of Marinobacter sp. C18, the closest genomic reference. A complex response involving carbon and lipid metabolism, chemotaxis and a type IV secretion system suggested active energy-dependent processes in Marinobacter. These findings highlight chemistry-dependent responses in the metabolism of key hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria and underscore that dispersant-driven selection could temper the ability of the community to respond to hydrocarbon injection.",

    "abstract": "Plant-derived phenolic acids are metabolized by soil microorganisms whose activity may enhance the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC). We characterized whether phenolic acid-degrading bacteria would enhance SOC mineralization in forest soils when primed with 13C-labeled p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHB). We further investigated whether PHB-induced priming could explain differences in SOC content among mono-specific tree plantations in a 70-year-old common garden experiment. The activity of Paraburkholderia and Caballeronia dominated PHB degradation in all soils regardless of tree species or soil type. We isolated the principal PHB-degrading phylotype (Paraburkholderia madseniana RP11T), which encoded numerous oxidative enzymes, including secretion signal-bearing laccase, aryl-alcohol oxidase and DyP-type peroxidase, and confirmed its ability to degrade phenolics. The addition of PHB to soil led to significant enrichment (23-fold) of the RP11T phylotype (RP11ASV), as well as enrichment of other phylotypes of Paraburkholderia and Caballeronia. Metabolism of PHB primed significant loss of SOC (3 to 13 {micro}mols C g-1 dry wt soil over 7 days). In contrast, glucose addition reduced SOC mineralization (-3 to -8 {micro}mols C g-1 dry wt soil over 7 days). RP11ASV abundance and the expression of PHB monooxygenase (pobA) correlated with PHB respiration and were inversely proportional to SOC content in the field. We propose that plant-derived phenolics stimulate the activity of phenolic acid-degrading bacteria thereby causing soil priming and SOC loss. We show that Burkholderiaceae dominate soil priming in diverse forest soils and this observation counters the prevailing view that priming phenomena are a generalized non-specific response of community metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Grapevine Trunk Diseases (GTDs) are a major challenge to the grape industry worldwide. GTDs are responsible for considerable loss of quality, production, and vineyard longevity. Seventy five percent of Chilean vineyards are estimated to be affected by GTDs. GTDs are complex diseases caused by several species of fungi, including Neofusicoccum parvum, Diplodia seriata, and Phaeomoniella chlamydospora. In this study, we report the isolation of 169 endophytic and 209 epiphytic fungi from grapevines grown under organic and conventional farming in Chile. Multiple isolates of Clonostachys rosea, Trichoderma sp., Purpureocillium lilacium, Epiccocum nigrum, Cladosporium sp., and Chaetomium sp. were evaluated for their potential of biocontrol activity against fungal trunk pathogens. Tests were carried out using two dual-culture-plate methods with multiple media types, including agar containing grapevine wood extract to simulate in planta nutrient conditions. Significant pathogen growth inhibition was observed by all isolates tested. C. rosea showed 98.2% inhibition of all pathogens in presence of grapevine wood extract. We observed 100% pathogen growth inhibition when autoclaved lignified grapevine shoots were pre-inoculated with either C. rosea strains or Trichoderma sp.. Overall these results show that C. rosea strains isolated from grapevines are promising biocontrol agents against GTDs.",

    "abstract": "Conserving additional energy from sunlight through bacteriochlorophyll (BChl)-based reaction center or proton-pumping rhodopsin is a highly successful life strategy in environmental bacteria. Rhodopsin and BChl based systems display contrasting characteristics in the size of coding operon, cost of biosynthesis, ease of expression control, and efficiency of energy production. This raises an intriguing question of whether a single bacterium has evolved the ability to perform these two types of phototrophy complementarily according to energy needs and environmental conditions. Here we report four Tardiphaga sp. strains (Alphaproteobacteria) of monophyletic origin isolated from a high Arctic glacier in northeast Greenland (81.566{degrees} N, 16.363{degrees} W) that are at different evolutionary stages concerning phototrophy. Their >99.8% identical genomes contain footprints of horizontal operon transfers (HOT) of the complete gene clusters encoding BChl and xanthorhodopsin (XR)-based dual phototrophy. Two strains only possess a complete xanthorhodopsin (XR) operon, while the other two strains have both a photosynthesis gene cluster (PGC) and an XR operon in their genomes. All XR operons are heavily surrounded by mobile genetic elements and located close to a tRNA gene, strongly signaling that a HOT event of XR operon has occurred recently. Mining public genome databases and our High Arctic glacial and soil metagenomes revealed that phylogenetically diverse bacteria have the metabolic potential of performing BChl and rhodopsin-based dual phototrophy. Our data provide new insights on how bacteria cope with the harsh and energy-deficient environments in surface glaciers, possibly by maximizing the capability of exploiting solar energy.\n\nImportanceOver billions of years of evolution, bacteria capable of light-driven energy production have occupied every corner of surface Earth where solar irradiation can reach. Only two general biological systems have evolved in bacteria to be capable of net energy conservation via light-harvesting: one is based on the pigment of (bacterio-)chlorophyll and the other based on light-sensing retinal molecules. There is emerging genomic evidence that these two rather different systems can co-exist in a single bacterium to take advantage of their contrasting characteristics in the number of genes involved, biosynthesis cost, ease of expression control and efficiency of energy production, and thus enhance the capability of exploiting solar energy. Our data provide the first clear-cut evidence that such dual phototrophy potentially exist in glacial bacteria. Further public genome mining suggests this understudied dual phototrophic mechanism is possibly more common than our data alone suggested.\n\nSequence data availabilityGenomes, metagenomes and raw reads were deposited into GenBank under Bioprojects PRJNA548505 and PRJNA552582.",

Drosophila and mammals also encode divergent non-canonical Arps in their male-germline whose roles remain unknown. Here, we show that Arp53D, a rapidly-evolving Drosophila Arp, localizes to fusomes and actin cones, two male germline-specific actin structures critical for sperm maturation, via its non-canonical N-terminal tail. Although we expected that Arp53D loss would reduce male fertility, we instead find that Arp53D-KO males are more fertile, both in isolation and in competition with wildtype males. Upon investigating why evolution would retain a gene that negatively impacts male fertility, we unexpectedly found that Arp53D-KO females are less fertile. Moreover, KO embryos exhibit reduced viability, which worsens under heat stress. We conclude that  testis-specific Arp53D is detrimental to male fertility, but is required for female fertility and early development, leading to its long-term retention and recurrent adaptation in Drosophila.",

Interactions between the RPE and their basement membrane, i.e. the inner layer of Bruchs membrane, are essential for RPE cell health and function, but the signals induced by Bruchs membrane engagement, and their contributions to RPE cell fate determination remain poorly defined. Here, we studied the functional role of the soluble complement regulator and component of Bruchs membrane, Factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1). Human primary RPE cells adhered to FHL-1 in a manner that was eliminated by either mutagenesis of the integrin-binding RGD motif in FHL-1 or by using competing antibodies directed against the 5 and {beta}1 integrin subunits. The results obtained from primary RPE cells were replicated using the hTERT-RPE cell line. RNAseq expression analysis of hTERT-RPE cells bound to FHL-1 showed an increased expression of the heat-shock protein genes HSPA6, CRYAB, HSPA1A and HSPA1B when compared to cells bound to fibronectin (FN) or laminin (LA). Pathway analysis implicated changes in EIF2 signalling, the unfolded protein response, and mineralocorticoid receptor signalling as putative pathways. Subsequent cell survival assays using H2O2 to induce oxidative stress-induced cell death showed hTERT-RPE cells had significantly greater protection when bound to FHL-1 or LA compared to plastic or FN. These data show a non-canonical role of FHL-1 in protecting RPE cells against oxidative stress and identifies a novel interaction that has implications for ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration.",

    "abstract": "The small molecule ISRIB antagonises the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) by phosphorylated translation initiation factor 2, eIF2(P). ISRIB and eIF2(P) bind distinct sites in their common target, eIF2B, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for eIF2. We have found that ISRIB-mediated acceleration of eIF2B activity in vitro is observed preferentially in the presence of eIF2(P) and is attenuated by mutations that desensitise eIF2B to the inhibitory effects of eIF2(P). ISRIBs efficacy as an ISR inhibitor in cells also depends on presence of eIF2(P). Cryo-EM showed that engagement of both eIF2B regulatory sites by two eIF2(P) molecules remodels both the ISRIB-binding pocket and the pockets that would engage eIF2 during active nucleotide exchange, thereby discouraging both binding events. In vitro, eIF2(P) and ISRIB reciprocally opposed each others binding to eIF2B. These findings point to antagonistic allostery in ISRIB action on eIF2B, culminating in inhibition of the ISR.",

    "abstract": "Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKII) is an abundant neuronal signaling protein involved in synaptic plasticity and memory formation1,2. The central hub domain regulates the activity of CaMKII by organizing the holoenzyme complex into functional oligomers3-6. Recent findings have suggested that the hub is also an allosteric determinant of kinase activity7, and is thus an emerging target for therapies to correct CaMKII dysregulation8,9. However, pharmacological modulation of the hub domain has never been demonstrated. Here we show that stabilization of the CaMKII hub domain confers neuroprotection. By combining photoaffinity labeling and chemical proteomics using small molecule analogs of the natural metabolite {gamma}-hydroxybutyrate (GHB)10 we reveal that CaMKII is the selective target for GHB. We further find that these GHB analogs bind to the hub interior by solving a 2.2 [A] crystal structure of CaMKII with bound ligand. Using differential scanning fluorimetry, we show that binding of ligands to the hub interior increases the thermal stability of hub oligomers in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, we demonstrate the functional significance of this hub stabilization by showing substantial neuroprotective effects in cellular excitotoxicity assays and in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia. Together, our results reveal that CaMKII hub stabilization is the mechanism by which GHB provides endogenous neuroprotection and that small-molecule CaMKII-selective ligands have therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Human articular cartilage is comprised of two main components, the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the pericellular matrix (PCM). The PCM helps to protect chondrocytes in the cartilage from mechanical loads, but in patients with osteoarthritis, the PCM is weakened resulting in increased chondrocyte stress. As chondrocytes are responsible for cartilage synthesis and maintenance, it is important to understand how mechanical loads affect cellular responses of chondrocytes. Many studies have examined the chondrocyte response to in vitro mechanical loading by embedding in stiff agarose. However, these experiments are mostly performed in the absence of PCM which may obscure important responses to mechanotransduction. Here, we demonstrate that drop-based microfluidics allows culture of single chondrocytes in alginate microgels for cell-directed PCM synthesis that closely mimics the in vivo microenvironment. Chondrocytes form PCM over 10 days in these single cell microenvironments. Single cell microgels and monolayer controls were encapsulated in high stiffness agarose to mimic the cartilage PCM. After physiological dynamic compression in a custom-built bioreactor, microgels exhibited distinct metabolomic profiles from both uncompressed and monolayer controls. These results demonstrate the potential of single cell encapsulation in alginate microgels to advance cartilage tissue engineering and basic chondrocyte mechanobiology.",

Amino acid changes may affect protein function in a number of ways including direct perturbations of activity or indirect effects on protein folding and stability. We have analysed 6749 experimentally determined variant effects from multiplexed assays on abundance and activity in two proteins (NUDT15 and PTEN) to quantify these effects, and find that a third of the variants cause loss of function, and about half of loss-of-function variants also have low cellular abundance. We analyse the structural and mechanistic origins of loss of function, and use the experimental data to find residues important for enzymatic activity. We performed computational analyses of protein stability and evolutionary conservation and show how we may predict positions where variants cause loss of activity or abundance. In this way, our results link thermodynamic stability and evolutionary conservation to experimental studies of different properties of protein fitness landscapes.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing pandemic caused by coronavirus SARS-COV-2 continues to rage with devastating consequences on human health and global economy. The spike glycoprotein on the surface of coronavirus mediates its entry into host cells and is the target of all current antibody design efforts to neutralize the virus. The glycan shield of the spike helps the virus to evade the human immune response by providing a thick sugar-coated barrier against any antibody. To study the dynamic motion of glycans in the spike protein, we performed microsecond-long MD simulation in two different states that correspond to the receptor binding domain in open or closed conformations. Analysis of this microsecond-long simulation revealed a scissoring motion on the N-terminal domain of neighboring monomers in the spike trimer. Role of multiple glycans in shielding of spike protein in different regions were uncovered by a network analysis, where the high betweenness centrality of glycans at the apex revealed their importance and function in the glycan shield. Microdomains of glycans were identified featuring a high degree of intra-communication in these microdomains. An antibody overlap analysis revealed the glycan microdomains as well as individual glycans that inhibit access to the antibody epitopes on the spike protein. Overall, the results of this study provide detailed understanding of the spike glycan shield, which may be utilized for therapeutic efforts against this crisis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations account for 10% of all EGFR mutations and are mostly insensitive to approved EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). Novel EGFR-TKIs have been developed or repurposed for these mutants. A limited number of preclinical studies have detailed these EGFR-TKIs. We sought to use commercially available mobocertinib (TAK-788) to characterize the preclinical therapeutic window of this EGFR-TKI against EGFR mutations and to probe possible on-target mechanisms of resistance (EGFR-C797S).\n\nMethodsWe used models of EGFR mutations to probe representative 1st, 2nd, 3rd generation, and in-development EGFR exon 20-active (poziotinib, mobocertinib) TKIs. We also introduced EGFR-C797S to these models to identify mechanisms of resistance.\n\nResultsCells driven by the most common EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations (A767_V769dupASV, D770_N771insSVD, H773_V774insH and others) were inhibited by in-development EGFR TKIs at doses below those affecting EGFR-wildtype; albeit more common EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions and L858R) were inhibited more readily by mobocertinib and poziotinib. Mobocertinib was able to inhibit phosphorylation of EGFR in multiple preclinical models. The presence of EGFR-C797S led to >200-fold resistance in proliferation assays probing mobocertinib and osimertinib. Review of clinical studies of mobocertinib disclosed responses that could be lasting.\n\nConclusionsThis is one of the initial reports to characterize the novel EGFR TKI mobocertinib and highlights its broad activity against EGFR mutants plus the therapeutic window to EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations; as well as EGFR-C797S as a possible mechanism of resistance. Further clinical development of mobocertinib merits continuation.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is among the deadliest of human cancers. Despite extensive efforts, it has proven to be highly resistant to chemo- and immune-based therapeutic strategies, and little headway has been made with targeted inhibitors. Like many cancers, metabolism is dysregulated in GBM. Thus, to identify new vulnerabilities and drug targets in GBM, we conducted genetic screens using pooled RNAi libraries targeting metabolic enzymes. We screened multiple glioma stem cell-derived (GSC) xenograft models, which revealed that several enzymes involved in the mitochondrial metabolism of fatty acids were required for tumor cell proliferation. From among these, we focused on medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), which oxidizes medium-chain fatty acids, due to its consistently high score across all of our screens, as well as its high expression level in multiple GSC models and its upregulation in GBM compared to normal brain.\n\nIn this manuscript, we describe the dependence of GBM on sustained fatty acid metabolism to actively catabolize lipid species that would otherwise damage the mitochondrial structure. The uptake of mediumchain fatty acids lacks negative feedback regulation; therefore, in the absence of MCAD, medium-chain fatty acids accumulate to toxic levels, inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial damage and failure, and apoptosis. Taken together, our findings uncover a previously unappreciated protective role exerted by MCAD in GBM cells, making it a unique and therapeutically exploitable vulnerability.",

These mice have a high level of gut-derived serotonin (GDS), a potent osteoblastogenesis inhibitor. We explored the underlying mechanisms of bone loss associated with chronic intestinal inflammation.\n\nDesignWinnie male and female mice prior to colitis onset (6 weeks old) and progression (14 and 24 weeks) were compared to age- and sex-matched C57BL/6 controls. We assessed bone quality (static and dynamic histomorphometry, micro-CT, 3-point bending), intestinal inflammation (lipocalin-2), GDS levels, serum levels of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D, ex vivo bone marrow analysis and molecular mechanisms inhibiting osteoblastogenesis.\n\nResultsSignificant deterioration in trabecular and cortical microarchitecture, reductions in bone formation, mineral apposition rate, bone volume, osteoid volume and bone strength were observed in Winnie mice compared to C57BL/6 controls. Decreased osteoblast and increased osteoclast numbers were prominent in Winnie mice. We report for the first time that elevated GDS cross-talks with molecular pathways to inhibit bone formation in Winnie mice. Increased expression of 5-HTR1B and FOXO1 mRNAs, dissociation of FOXO1/CREB1 complex and association of FOXO1 with ATF4, promoting the transcriptional activity of FOXO1, results in suppression of osteoblast proliferation in Winnie mice compared to controls.\n\nConclusionThese findings open avenues for the development of targeted therapies for IBD-related bone loss.\n\nSignificance of this studyO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this subject?C_ST_ABS- Osteoporosis is a common extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n- Currently available treatments are not effective for IBD-associated bone loss.\n- The mechanisms of bone loss are poorly understood.

In this study, we used larval zebrafish to characterize the response of macrophages to ototoxic injury of lateral line hair cells. Macrophages migrated into neuromasts within 20 min of exposure to the ototoxic antibiotic neomycin. The number of macrophages in close proximity of injured neuromasts was similar to that observed near uninjured neuromasts, suggesting that this early inflammatory response was mediated by  local macrophages. Upon entering injured neuromasts, macrophages actively phagocytosed hair cell debris. Such phagocytosis was significantly reduced by inhibiting Src-family kinases. Using chemical-genetic ablation of macrophages prior to ototoxic injury, we also examined whether macrophages were essential for the initiation of hair cell regeneration after neomycin exposure. Results revealed only minor differences in hair cell recovery in macrophage-depleted vs. control fish, suggesting that macrophages are not essential for the regeneration of lateral line hair cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAn effective syphilis vaccine should elicit antibodies to Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (T. p. pallidum) surface antigens to induce pathogen clearance through opsonophagocytosis. Although the combination of bioinformatics, structural, and functional analyses of T. p. pallidum genes to identify putative outer membrane proteins (OMPs) resulted in a list of potential vaccine candidates, still very little is known about whether and how transcription of these genes is regulated during infection. This knowledge gap is a limitation to vaccine design, as immunity generated to an antigen that can be down-regulated or even silenced at the transcriptional level without affecting virulence would not induce clearance of the pathogen, hence allowing disease progression.\n\nPrincipal findingsWe report here that tp1031, the T. p. pallidum gene encoding the putative OMP and vaccine candidate TprL is differentially expressed in several T. p. pallidum strains, suggesting transcriptional regulation. Experimental identification of the tprL transcriptional start site revealed that a homopolymeric G sequence of varying length resides within the tprL promoter and that its length affects promoter activity compatible with phase variation. Conversely, in the closely related pathogen T. p. subsp. pertenue, the agent of yaws, where a naturally-occurring deletion has eliminated the tprL promoter region, elements necessary for protein synthesis, and part of the gene ORF, tprL transcription level are negligible compared to T. p. pallidum strains. Accordingly, the humoral response to TprL is absent in yaws-infected laboratory animals and patients compared to syphilis-infected subjects.\n\nConclusionThe ability of T. p. pallidum to stochastically vary tprL expression should be considered in any vaccine development effort that includes this antigen. The role of phase variation in contributing to T. p. pallidum antigenic diversity should be further studied.\n\nAuthor SummarySyphilis is still an endemic disease in many low- and middle-income countries and has been resurgent in high-income nations for almost two decades now. In endemic areas, syphilis still causes significant morbidity and mortality in patients, particularly when its causative agent, the bacterium Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum is transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy. Although there are significant ongoing efforts to identify an effective syphilis vaccine to bring into clinical trials within the decade in the U.S., such efforts are partially hindered by the lack of knowledge on transcriptional regulation of many genes encoding vaccine candidates. Here, we start addressing this knowledge gap for the putative outer membrane protein (OMP) and vaccine candidates TprL, encoded by the tp1031 gene. As we previously reported for other putative OMP-encoding genes of the syphilis agent, tprL transcription level appears to be affected by the length of a homopolymeric sequence of guanosines (Gs) located within the gene promoter. This is a mechanism known as phase variation and often involved in altering the surface antigenic profile of a bacterial pathogen to facilitate immune evasion and/or adaptation to the host milieu.",

Although I38T viruses replicate and transmit between ferrets, our data suggest that viruses with this amino acid substitution have lower fitness relative to WT and this relative fitness cost was greater in A/H1N1pdm09 viruses than in A/H3N2 viruses.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of age-related DNA methylation changes in skeletal muscle is limited, yet this tissue is severely affected by aging in humans. Using a large-scale epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) meta-analysis of age in human skeletal muscle from 10 studies (total n = 908 human muscle methylomes), we identified 9,986 differentially methylated regions at a stringent false discovery rate < 0.005, spanning 8,748 unique genes, many of which related to skeletal muscle structure and development. We then integrated the DNA methylation results with known transcriptomic and proteomic age-related changes in skeletal muscle, and found that even though most differentially methylated genes are not altered at the mRNA or protein level, they are nonetheless strongly enriched for genes showing age-related differential expression. We provide here the most comprehensive picture of DNA methylation aging in human skeletal muscle, and have made our results available as an open-access, user-friendly, web-based tool called MetaMeth (https://sarah-voisin.shinyapps.io/MetaMeth/).",

    "abstract": "Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which has been proposed as a therapeutic or prophylactic drug for SARS-COV-2, has been administered to thousands of individuals with varying efficacy; however, our understanding of its adverse effects is insufficient. It was reported that HCQ induced psychiatric symptoms in a few patients with autoimmune diseases, but it is still uncertain whether HCQ poses a risk to mental health. Therefore, in this study, we treated healthy mice with two different doses of HCQ that are comparable to clinically administered doses for 7 days. Psychiatric-like behaviors and the expression of related molecules in the brain were evaluated at two time points, i.e., 24 h and 10 days after drug administration. We found that HCQ increased anxiety behavior at both 24 h and 10 days and enhanced depressive behavior at 24 h. Furthermore, HCQ decreased the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta and corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh) in the hippocampus and decreased the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in both the hippocampus and amygdala. Most of these behavioral and molecular changes were sustained beyond 10 days after drug administration, and some of them were dose-dependent. Although this animal study does not prove that HCQ has a similar effect in humans, it indicates that HCQ poses a significant risk to mental health and suggests that further clinical investigation is essential. According to our data, we recommend that HCQ be carefully used as a prophylactic drug in people who are susceptible to mental disorders.",

    "abstract": "PDZ domains are one of the most abundant protein domains in eukaryotes and frequently found on junction-localized scaffold proteins. Various signaling molecules bind to PDZ proteins via PDZ-binding motifs (PBM) and finetune cellular signaling. Here we describe the presence of a PBM on GIV/Girdin (CCDC88A) that is conserved throughout evolution, from invertebrates to vertebrates, and is generated as a long isoform-variant in humans, which we named GIV-L. Unlike GIV, which lacks PBM and is cytosolic, GIV-L localizes to the cell junctions, and has a unique PDZ-interactome, which impacts GIV-Ls ability to bind and activate trimeric G-protein, Gi through its guanine-nucleotide exchange modulator (GEM) module; the GEM module is found exclusively in vertebrates. Thus, the two functional modules in GIV evolved sequentially: the ability to bind PDZ proteins via the PBM evolved earlier in invertebrates, whereas G-protein binding and activation may have evolved later only among vertebrates. Phenotypic studies in Caco-2 cells revealed that GIV and GIV-L may have antagonistic effects on cell growth, proliferation (cell cycle), and survival. Immunohistochemical analyses in human colon tissues showed that GIV expression increases with a concomitant decrease in GIV-L during cancer initiation. Taken together, these findings reveal how GIV/CCDC88A in humans displays evolutionary flexibility in modularity, which allows the resultant isoforms to play opposing roles either as a tumor suppressor (GIV-L) or as an oncogene (GIV).",

    "abstract": "Cellular force generation and force transduction are of fundamental importance for numerous biological processes and can be studied with the methods of Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) and Monolayer Stress Microscopy. Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy solve the inverse problem of reconstructing cell-matrix tractions and inter- and intra-cellular stresses from the measured cell force-induced deformations of an adhesive substrate with known elasticity. Although several laboratories have developed software for Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy computations, there is currently no software package available that allows non-expert users to perform a full evaluation of such experiments. Here we present pyTFM, a tool to perform Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy on single cells, cell patches and cell layers grown in a 2-dimensional environment. pyTFM was optimized for ease-of-use; it is open-source and well documented (hosted at https://pytfm.readthedocs.io/) including usage examples and explanations of the theoretical background. pyTFM can be used as a standalone Python package or as an add-on to the image annotation tool ClickPoints. In combination with the ClickPoints environment, pyTFM allows the user to set all necessary analysis parameters, select regions of interest, examine the input data and intermediary results, and calculate a wide range of parameters describing forces, stresses, and their distribution. The Monolayer Stress Microscopy implementation in pyTFM allows for the analysis of small cell patches and single cells; we analyze the accuracy and performance of Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy algorithms using synthetic and experimental data from epithelial cell patches.",

    "abstract": "The number and activity of Cav1.2 channels in the cardiomyocyte sarcolemma tunes the magnitude of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and myocardial contraction. {beta}-adrenergic receptor ({beta}AR) activation stimulates sarcolemmal insertion of CaV1.2 channels. This supplements the pre-existing sarcolemmal CaV1.2 population, forming large  super-clusters wherein neighboring channels undergo enhanced cooperative-gating behavior, amplifying Ca2+ influx and myocardial contractility. Here, we determine this stimulated insertion is fueled by an internal reserve of early- and recycling endosome-localized, pre-synthesized CaV1.2 channels. {beta}AR-activation decreased CaV1.2/endosome colocalization in ventricular myocytes, as it triggered  emptying of endosomal CaV1.2 cargo into the sarcolemma. We examined the rapid dynamics of this stimulated insertion process with live-myocyte imaging of channel trafficking, and discovered that CaV1.2 are often inserted into the sarcolemma as pre-formed, multi-channel clusters. Likewise, entire clusters were removed from the sarcolemma during endocytosis, while in other cases, a more incremental process suggested removal of individual channels. The amplitude of the stimulated insertion response was doubled by co-expression of constitutively-active Rab4a, halved by co-expression of dominant-negative Rab11a, and abolished by co-expression of dominant-negative mutant Rab4a. In ventricular myocytes, {beta}AR-stimulated recycling of CaV1.2 was diminished by both nocodazole and latrunculin-A, suggesting an essential role of the cytoskeleton in this process. Functionally, cytoskeletal disruptors prevented {beta}AR-activated Ca2+ current augmentation. Moreover, {beta}AR-regulation of CaV1.2 was abolished when recycling was halted by co-application of nocodazole and latrunculin-A. These findings reveal that {beta}AR-stimulation triggers an on-demand boost in sarcolemmal CaV1.2 abundance via targeted, Rab4a and Rab11a-dependent insertion of CaV1.2 channels is essential for {beta}AR-regulation of cardiac CaV1.2.\n\nSignificance StatementThe L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel CaV1.2 is essential for excitation-contraction coupling in the heart. During the fight-or-flight response, CaV1.2 channel activity is augmented as a result of PKA-mediated phosphorylation, downstream of {beta}-adrenergic receptor ({beta}AR) activation. We discovered that enhanced sarcolemmal abundance of CaV1.2 channels, driven by stimulated insertion/recycling of specific CaV1.2 containing endosomes, is essential for {beta}AR-mediated regulation of these channels in the heart. These data reveal a new conceptual framework of this critical and robust pathway for on-demand tuning of cardiac EC-coupling during fight-or-flight.",

    "abstract": "Miscanthus is a close relative of Saccharum and a potentially valuable genetic resource for improving sugarcane. Differences in flowering time within and between Miscanthus and Saccharum hinders intra- and interspecific hybridizations. A series of greenhouse experiments were conducted over three years to determine how to synchronize flowering time of Saccharum and Miscanthus genotypes. We found that day length was an important factor influencing when Miscanthus and Saccharum flowered. Sugarcane could be induced to flower in a central Illinois greenhouse using supplemental lighting to reduce the rate at which days shortened during the autumn and winter to 1 min d-1, which allowed us to synchronize the flowering of some sugarcane genotypes with Miscanthus genotypes primarily from low latitudes. In a complementary growth chamber experiment, we evaluated 33 Miscanthus genotypes, including 28 M. sinensis, 2 M. floridulus, and 3 M. xgiganteus collected from 20.9{degrees} S to 44.9{degrees} N for response to three day lengths (10 h, 12.5 h, and 15 h). High latitude-adapted M. sinensis flowered mainly under 15 h days, but unexpectedly, short days resulted in short, stocky plants that did not flower; in some cases, flag leaves developed under short days but heading did not occur. In contrast, for M. sinensis and M. floridulus from low latitudes, shorter day lengths typically resulted in earlier flowering, and for some low latitude genotypes, 15 h days resulted in no flowering. However, the highest ratio of reproductive shoots to total number of culms was typically observed for 12.5 h or 15 h days. Latitude of origin was significantly associated with culm length, and the shorter the days, the stronger the relationship. Nearly all entries achieved maximal culm length under the 15 h treatment, but the nearer to the equator an accession originated, the less of a difference in culm length between the short-day treatments and the 15 h day treatment. Under short days, short culms for high-latitude accessions was achieved by different physiological mechanisms for M. sinensis genetic groups from the mainland in comparison to those from Japan; for mainland accessions, the mechanism was reduced internode length, whereas for Japanese accessions the phyllochron under short days was greater than under long days. Thus, for M. sinensis, short days typically hastened floral induction, consistent with the expectations for a facultative short-day plant. However, for high latitude accessions of M. sinensis, days less than 12.5 h also signaled that plants should prepare for winter by producing many short culms with limited elongation and development; moreover, this response was also epistatic to flowering. Thus, to flower M. sinensis that originates from high latitudes synchronously with sugarcane, the former needs day lengths >12.5 h (perhaps as high as 15 h), whereas that the latter needs day lengths <12.5 h.",

    "abstract": "PhD-trained scientists are essential contributors to the workforce in diverse employment sectors that include academia, industry, government, and non-profit organizations. Hence, best practices for training the future biomedical workforce are of national concern. Complementing coursework and laboratory research training, many institutions now offer professional training that enables career exploration and develops a broad set of skills critical to various career paths. The National Institutes of Health funded academic institutions to design innovative programming to enable this professional development through a mechanism known as Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training (BEST). Programming at the BEST awardee institutions included career panels, skill-building workshops, job-searching workshops, site visits, and internships. An initial concern was since doctoral training is lengthy and requires focused attention on dissertation research, having students participate in additional complementary training activities might lengthen time to degree and hamper student research productivity. To address this concern, using time to degree and publication records as measures of efficiency and productivity, metrics were analyzed from ten BEST awardee institutions. Comparing doctoral students who participated to those who did not, results revealed that across these diverse academic institutions, there were no differences in time to degree or manuscript output. Furthermore, a few institutions even demonstrated a positive correlation between participation in career and professional development activities and productivity. Our findings suggest that doctoral students should be encouraged to participate in career and professional development opportunities to ensure their preparedness for a variety of diverse and important careers in the workforce.\n\nSignificance StatementOur study is unique in that it compiled doctoral degree durations at ten different universities, recorded individual participation in career and professional development activities in terms of dosage, and tracked individual engagement in real-time rather than relying on surveys sent to trainees after graduation. Participation in career and professional development activities, including internships, did not decrease efficiency or productivity. Our findings suggest that doctoral students should be encouraged to participate in career and professional development opportunities to ensure their preparedness for a variety of diverse and important careers in the workforce.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWith the proposed pathophysiologic mechanism of neurologic injury by SARS COV-2 the frequency of stroke and henceforth the related hospital admissions were expected to rise. In this paper we investigate this presumption by comparing the frequency of admissions of stroke cases in Bangladesh before and during the pandemic.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of stroke admissions in a 100-bed stroke unit at the National Institute of Neurosciences and Hospital (NINS&H) which is considerably a large stroke unit. We considered all the admitted cases from the 1st January to the 30th June, 2020. We used Poisson regressions to determine whether statistically significant changes in admission counts can be found before and after 25 March since when there is a surge in COVID-19 infections.\n\nResultsA total of 1394 stroke patients got admitted during the study period. Half of the patients were older than 60 years, whereas only 2.6% were 30 years old or younger with a male-female ratio of 1.06:1. From January to March, 2020 the mean rate of admission was 302.3 cases per month which dropped to 162.3 cases per month from April to June with an overall reduction of 46.3% in acute stroke admission per month. In those two periods, reductions in average admission per month for ischemic stroke (IST), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and venous stroke (VS) were 45.5%, 37.2%, 71.4% and 39.0%, respectively. Based on weekly data, results of Poisson regressions confirm that the average number of admissions per week dropped significantly during the last three months of the sample period. Further, in the first three months, a total of 22 cases of hyperacute stroke management were done whereas in the last three months there was an 86.4% reduction in the number of hyperacute stroke patients getting reperfusion treatment. Only 38 patients (2.7%) were later found to be RT- PCR for SARS Cov-2 positive based on nasal swab testing.\n\nConclusionOur study revealed more than fifty percent reduction in acute stroke admission during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is still elusive whether the reduction is related to the fear of getting infected by COVID-19 from hospitalization or the overall restriction on public movement and stay-home measures.",

This study accordingly reports analysis of transcriptome of a white-rot Basidiomycete L.squarrosulus grown in simple potato dextrose broth supplemented with aromatic compound, reactive black dye to gain an insight into the degradation ability of the fungus. RNA was sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500 to obtain 6,679,162 high quality paired end reads that were assembled de novo using CLC assembly cell to generate 25,244 contigs.Putative functions were assigned for the 10,494 transcripts based on sequence similarities through BLAST2GO 5.2 and Function annotator. Functional assignments revealed enhanced oxidoreductase activity through the expression of diverse biomass degrading enzymes and their corresponding co-regulators. CAZyme analysis through dbCAN and CUPP revealed the presence of 6 families of polysaccharide lyases, 51 families of glycoside hydrolases, 23 families of glycoside transferases, 7 families of carbohydrate esterases and 10 families of Auxiliary activities.Genes encoding the ligninolytic enzymes and auxiliary activities among the transcript sequences were identified through gene prediction by AUGUSTUS and FGENESH. Biochemical analysis of a couple of biomass degrading enzymes substantiated the functional predictions. In essence, L.squarrosulus grown in a simple medium devoid of lignocellulosic substrate demonstrated presence of a repertoire of lignocellulose degrading enzymesimplying that source of lignocellulose is not required for expression of these biomass degrading enzymes. The study hereby underlines the significance of L.squarrosulus in biomass degradation and its future functional exploitation in biomass conversion applications.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining neuron transcriptomes is challenging; their complex morphology and interconnected microenvironments make it difficult to isolate neurons without potentially altering gene expression. Multidendritic sensory neurons (md neurons) of Drosophila larvae are commonly used to study peripheral nervous system biology, particularly dendrite arborization. We sought to test if EC-tagging, a biosynthetic RNA tagging and purification method that avoids the caveats of physical isolation, would enable discovery of novel regulators of md neuron dendrite arborization. RNAs were biosynthetically tagged by expressing CD:UPRT (a nucleobase-converting fusion enzyme) in md neurons and feeding 5-ethynylcytosine (EC) to larvae. Tagged RNAs were subsequently purified and used for RNA-sequencing. Reference RNA was prepared in a similar manner using 5-ethynyluridine (EUd) to tag RNA in all cells and negative control RNA-seq was performed on \"mock tagged\" samples to identify non-specifically purified transcripts. Differential expression analysis identified md neuron enriched and depleted transcripts. Three candidate genes encoding RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) were tested for a role in md neuron dendrite arborization. Loss-of-function for the m6A-binding factor Ythdc1 did not cause any dendrite arborization defects while RNAi of the other two candidates, the poly(A) polymerase Hiiragi and the translation regulator Hephaestus, caused significant defects in dendrite arborization. This work provides an expanded view of transcription in md neurons and a technical framework for combining EC-tagging with RNA-seq to profile transcription in cells that may not be amenable to physical isolation.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this paper was to systematically analyze the trend of plant ecological research in Ethiopia. The inclusion and exclusion of the articles for analysis were performed using Reporting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES) flow diagram developed for systematic review/meta-analysis. The number of articles published, authors, and collaboration has increased dramatically since the 1960s. Most of the research largely focused on the Dry evergreen Afromontane Forest and grassland complex (DAF) and Moist evergreen Afromontane Forest (MAF) vegetation types, comprising of about 52.6%. Of the remaining vegetation types, the woodlands (14.3%) i.e. Acacia-Commiphora woodland and bushland proper (ACW), and Combretum-Terminalia woodland and wooded grassland (CTW), desert and semi-desert scrubland (DSS) (2.3%), and the Afroalpine (AA) and Ericaceous Belt (EB) (1.5%) received little attention. A descriptive study on plant community ecology revolving on floristic composition and community structure is the dominant research theme, which revealed a narrow theme in contrast to the global trend. Other plant ecological studies such as reproductive and dispersal ecology of invasive plant species, and pollination ecology seems largely a neglected topic by the academia. Furthermore, the recommendations forwarded are not result-based. As a future direction, the Ethiopian government should develop a project database both for completed and ongoing projects.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic adaptation is thought to be an important mechanism of phenotypic evolution in humans, although recent evidence of confounding due to residual stratification in consortium GWAS made studies of polygenic adaptation more difficult to interpret. Using FST as a measure of allele frequency differentiation, a previous study has shown that the mean FST among African, East Asian, and European populations is significantly higher at height-associated SNPs than that found at matched non-associated SNPs, suggesting that polygenic adaptation is one of the reasons for differences in human height among these continental populations. However, we showed here even though the height-associated SNPs were identified using only European ancestry individuals, the estimated effect sizes are significantly associated with structures across continental populations, potentially explaining the elevated level of differentiation previously reported. To alleviate concerns of biased ascertainment of SNPs, we re-examined the distribution of FST at height-associated alleles ascertained from two biobank level GWAS (UK Biobank, UKB, and Biobank Japan, BBJ). We showed that when compared to non-associated SNPs, height-associated SNPs remain significantly differentiated among African, East Asian, and European populations from both 1000 Genomes (p = 0.0012 and p = 0.0265 when height SNPs were ascertained from UKB and BBJ, respectively), and Human Genome Diversity Panels (p = 0.0225 for UKB and p = 0.0032 for BBJ analyses). In contrast to FST-based analyses, we found no significant difference or consistent ranked order among continental populations in polygenic height scores constructed from SNPs ascertained from UKB and BBJ. In summary, our results suggest that, consistent with previous reports, height-associated SNPs are significantly differentiated in frequencies among continental populations after removing concerns of confounding by uncorrected stratification. Polygenic score-based analysis in this context appears to be susceptible to the choice of SNPs and, as we compared to FST-based statistics in simulations, would lose power in detecting polygenic adaptation if there are independent converging selections in more than one population.",
