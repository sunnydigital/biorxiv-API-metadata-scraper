    "abstract": "MotivationThe exponential growth of assembled genome sequences greatly benefits metagenomics studies. However, currently available methods struggle to manage the increasing amount of sequences and their frequent updates. Indexing the current RefSeq can take days and hundreds of GB of memory on large servers. Few methods address these issues thus far, and even though many can theoretically handle large amounts of references, time/memory requirements are prohibitive in practice. As a result, many studies that require sequence classification use often outdated and almost never truly up-to-date indices.\n\nResultsMotivated by those limitations we created ganon, a k-mer based read classification tool that uses Interleaved Bloom Filters in conjunction with a taxonomic clustering and a k-mer counting/filtering scheme. Ganon provides an efficient method for indexing references, keeping them updated. It requires less than 55 minutes to index the complete RefSeq of bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses. The tool can further keep these indices up-to-date in a fraction of the time necessary to create them. Ganon makes it possible to query against very large reference sets and therefore it classifies significantly more reads and identifies more species than similar methods. When classifying a high-complexity CAMI challenge dataset against complete genomes from RefSeq, ganon shows strongly increased precision with equal or better sensitivity compared with state-of-the-art tools. With the same dataset against the complete RefSeq, ganon improved the F1-Score by 65% at the genus level. It supports taxonomy- and assembly-level classification, multiple indices and hierarchical classification.\n\nAvailabilityThe software is open-source and available at: https://gitlab.com/rki_bioinformatics/ganon\n\nContactbernhard.renard@hpi.de",

    "abstract": "Cellular heterogeneity in gene expression is driven by cellular processes such as cell cycle and cell-type identity, and cellular environment such as spatial location. The cell cycle, in particular, is thought to be a key driver of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression, even in otherwise homogeneous cell populations. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitate detailed characterization of gene expression heterogeneity, and can thus shed new light on the processes driving heterogeneity. Here, we combined fluorescence imaging with scRNA-seq to measure cell cycle phase and gene expression levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Using these data, we developed a novel approach to characterize cell cycle progression. While standard methods assign cells to discrete cell cycle stages, our method goes beyond this, and quantifies cell cycle progression on a continuum. We found that, on average, scRNA-seq data from only five genes predicted a cells position on the cell cycle continuum to within 14% of the entire cycle, and that using more genes did not improve this accuracy. Our data and predictor of cell cycle phase can directly help future studies to account for cell-cycle-related heterogeneity in iPSCs. Our results and methods also provide a foundation for future work to characterize the effects of the cell cycle on expression heterogeneity in other cell types.",

With a wide range of implications including drug resistance, understanding amino acid changes is important. In this study, we calculated the probabilities of substitutions mutations in the genetic code leading to the 20 amino acids and stop codons. Our calculations reveal an enigmatic in-built self-preserving organization of the genetic code that averts disruptive changes at the physicochemical properties level.

Here we present a model of free-operant behavior in which goal-directed control is determined by the correlation between the rates of the action and the outcome whereas the total prediction error generated by contiguous reinforcement by the outcome controls habitual response strength. The outputs of these two systems summate to generate a total response strength. This cooperative model addresses the difference in the behavioral impact of ratio and interval schedules, the transition from goal-directed to habitual control with extended training, the persistence of goal-directed control under choice procedures and following extinction, among other phenomena.

However, we only know very little about its role in early human development. The present study therefore investigated the impact of maternal odor on infant brain responses to emotional expression. We recorded the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal of seven-month-old infants watching happy and fearful faces. Infants in two control groups exposed to no specific odor (control 1) or the odor of a different infants mother (control 2) showed the expected EEG fear response. Crucially, this response was markedly absent in the experimental group exposed to their mothers odor. Thus, infants respond differently to fear signals in the presence of maternal odor. Our data therefore suggest that maternal odor can be a strong modulator of social perception in human infants.",

    "abstract": "Working memory (WM) needs to protect current content from interference and simultaneously be amenable to rapid updating with newly relevant information. An influential model suggests these opposing requirements are met via a basal ganglia (BG) - thalamus gating mechanism that allows for selective updating of prefrontal cortex (PFC) WM representations. A large neuroimaging literature supports the general involvement of the PFC, BG, and thalamus, as well as posterior parietal cortex (PPC), in WM. However, the specific functional contributions of these regions to key sub-processes of WM updating, namely gate-opening, content substitution, and gate closing, are still unknown, as common WM tasks conflate these processes. We therefore combined functional MRI with the reference-back task, specifically designed to tease apart these sub-processes. Participants compared externally presented face stimuli to a reference face held in WM, while alternating between updating and maintaining this reference, resulting in opening vs. closing the gate to WM. Gate opening and substitution processes were associated with strong BG, thalamic and fronto-parietal activation, but - intriguingly - the same activity profile was observed for sensory cortex supporting task stimulus processing (i.e., the fusiform face area). In contrast, gate closing was not reliably associated with any of these regions. These findings provide new support for the involvement of the BG in gate opening as suggested by the gating model, but qualify the models assumptions by demonstrating that gate closing does not seem to depend on the BG, and that gate opening also involves task-relevant sensory cortex.",

    "abstract": "Cognition is not always directed to the events in the here and now and we often self-generate thoughts and images in imagination. Important aspects of these self-generated experiences are associated with various dispositional traits. In this study, we explored whether these psychological associations relate to a common underlying neurocognitive mechanism. We acquired resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a large cohort of participants and asked them to retrospectively report their experience during the scan. Participants also completed questionnaires reflecting a range of dispositional traits. We found thoughts emphasising visual imagery at rest were associated with dispositional tendency towards internally directed attention (self-consciousness and attentional problems) and linked to a stronger correlation between a posterior parietal network and a lateral fronto-temporal network. Furthermore, decoupling between the brainstem and a lateral visual network was associated with dispositional internally directed attention. Critically, these brain-cognition associations were related: the correlation between parietal-frontal regions and reports of visual imagery was stronger for individuals with increased connectivity between brainstem and visual cortex. Our results highlight neural mechanisms linked to the dispositional basis for patterns of self-generated thought, and suggest that accounting for dispositional traits is important when exploring the neural substrates of self-generated experience (and vice versa).",

Computational theories predict that the benefits of new information depend on prior uncertainty, but the cellular effects of uncertainty on the executive network are incompletely understood. Using simultaneous recordings in monkeys, we reveal several mechanisms by which the fronto-parietal network reacts to uncertainty independently of average reward gains. We show that the variance of expected rewards, independently of the value of the rewards, was represented in single neuron and population spiking activity and local field potential (LFP) oscillations. Moreover, uncertainty asymmetrically affected the coherence between spikes and LFPs, selectively suppressing information transmission from the frontal to the parietal lobe but enhancing transmission from the parietal to the frontal lobe, consistent with Bayesian principles of optimal inference under uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Recent meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies identified a number of genetic risk factors of Alzheimers disease; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which they contribute to the pathological process. As synapse loss is observed at the earliest stage of Alzheimers disease, deciphering the impact of Alzheimers risk genes on synapse formation and maintenance is of great interest. In this paper, we report a microfluidic co-culture device that physically isolates synapses from pre- and postsynaptic neurons and chronically exposes them to toxic amyloid-beta (A{beta}) peptides secreted by model cell lines overexpressing wild-type or mutated (V717I) amyloid precursor protein (APP). Co-culture with cells overexpressing mutated APP exposed the synapses of primary hippocampal neurons to A{beta}1-42 molecules at nanomolar concentrations and induced a significant decrease in synaptic connectivity, as evidenced by distance-based assignment of postsynaptic puncta to presynaptic puncta. Treating the cells with antibodies that target different forms of A{beta} suggested that low molecular weight oligomers are the likely culprit. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that overexpression of protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta (Pyk2) -an Alzheimers disease genetic risk factor involved in synaptic plasticity and shown to decrease in Alzheimers disease brains at gene expression and protein levels-selectively in postsynaptic neurons is protective against A{beta}1-42-induced synaptotoxicity. In summary, our lab-on-a-chip device provides a physiologically-relevant model of Alzheimers disease-related synaptotoxicity, optimal for assessing the impact of risk genes in pre- and postsynaptic compartments.",

    "abstract": "A functional primary cilium is essential for normal and regulated signalling. Primary ciliary defects cause a group of developmental conditions known as ciliopathies, but the precise mechanisms of signal regulation by the cilium remain unclear. Previous studies have implicated the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in regulation of Wnt signalling at the ciliary basal body. Here, we provide mechanistic insight into ciliary ubiquitin processing in cells and for a ciliopathy mouse model lacking the ciliary protein Mks1. In vivo loss of Mks1 sensitizes cells to proteasomal disruption, leading to abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. To substantiate a direct link between MKS1 and the UPS, we identified UBE2E1, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that polyubiquitinates {beta}-catenin, and RNF34, an E3 ligase, as novel interactants of MKS1. UBE2E1 and MKS1 colocalized, particularly during conditions of ciliary resorption, and loss of UBE2E1 recapitulates the ciliary and Wnt signalling phenotypes observed during loss of MKS1. Levels of UBE2E1 and MKS1 are co-dependent and UBE2E1 mediates both regulatory and degradative ubiquitination of MKS1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that processing of phosphorylated {beta}-catenin occurs at the ciliary base through the functional interaction between UBE2E1 and MKS1. These observations suggest that correct {beta}-catenin levels are tightly regulated at the primary cilium by a ciliary-specific E2 (UBE2E1) and a regulatory substrate-adaptor (MKS1), confirming the fundamental role of UPS defects in the molecular pathogenesis of ciliopathies.",

    "abstract": "Perceiving the sensory consequences of our actions with a delay alters the interpretation of these afferent signals and impacts motor learning. For reaching movements, delayed visual feedback of hand position reduces the rate and extent of visuomotor adaptation, but substantial adaptation still occurs. Moreover, the detrimental effect of visual feedback delay on reach motor learning--selectively affecting its implicit component--can be mitigated by prior habituation to the delay. Auditory-motor learning for speech has been reported to be more sensitive to feedback delay, and it remains unknown whether habituation to auditory delay reduces its negative impact on learning. We investigated whether 30 minutes of exposure to auditory delay during speaking (a) affects the subjective perception of delay, and (b) mitigates its disruptive effect on speech auditory-motor learning. During a speech adaptation task with real-time perturbation of vowel spectral properties, participants heard this frequency-shifted feedback with no delay, 75 ms delay, or 115 ms delay. In the delay groups, 50% of participants had been exposed to the delay throughout a preceding 30-minute block of speaking whereas the remaining participants completed this block without delay. Although habituation minimized awareness of the delay, no improvement in adaptation to the spectral perturbation was observed. Thus, short-term habituation to auditory feedback delays is not effective in reducing the negative impact of delay on speech auditory-motor adaptation. Combined with previous findings, the strong negative effect of delay and the absence of an influence of delay awareness suggest the involvement of predominantly implicit learning mechanisms in speech.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LISpeech auditory-motor adaptation to a spectral perturbation was reduced by ~50% when feedback was delayed by 75 or 115 ms.\nC_LIO_LIThirty minutes of prior delay exposure without perturbation effectively reduced participants awareness of the delay.\nC_LIO_LIHowever, habituation was ineffective in remediating the detrimental effect of delay on speech auditory-motor adaptation.\nC_LIO_LIThe dissociation of delay awareness and adaptation suggests that speech auditory-motor learning is mostly implicit.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "How we see is fundamentally limited by the eyes optics, which determine retinal image quality and constrain neural processing. Elucidating how long-term exposure to optical defects alters visual processing is vital for understanding the human brains capacity for and limits of sensory plasticity. Using adaptive optics to bypass the eyes optical aberrations, we assessed changes in visual processing in neurotypically-developed adults with keratoconus (KC)--a corneal disease causing severe optical aberrations during adulthood that cannot be fully corrected using conventional methods. As a result, KC patients are chronically exposed to degraded retinal images in their everyday life, making them an ideal model to understand how prolonged exposure to poor optical quality alters visual processing. Here, we show that when tested under similar fully-corrected optical conditions as neurotypical observers, KC patients exhibited altered contrast sensitivity, with impaired sensitivity for fine spatial details and better sensitivity for coarse spatial details. Both gains and losses in contrast sensitivity were more pronounced in patients with poorer habitual optical quality. Moreover, using an equivalent noise paradigm and a computational model of visual processing, we show that these alterations in visual processing are mediated by changes in signal enhancement of spatial frequency selective mechanisms. The present findings uncover fundamental properties of neural compensation mechanisms in response to long-term exposure to optical defects, which alter sensory processing and limit the benefits of improved optics. The outcome is a large-scale functional reorganization favoring the processing of sensory information less affected by the eyes optics.\n\nSignificance statementThe eyes optics represent an intrinsic limit to human visual perception, determining the quality of retinal images. Neural adaptation optimizes the brains limited sensory processing capacity to the structure of the degraded retinal inputs, providing an exceptional quality of vision given these optical limitations. Here, we show that prolonged exposure to poor optical quality results in a functional reorganization of visual processing that favors sensory information less affected by the eyes optics. The present study helps elucidate how optical factors shape the way the brain processes visual information. Notably, the resulting adaptive neural plasticity limits the immediate perceptual benefits of optical interventions, a factor that must be taken into consideration when treating the increasing human population affected by optical defects.",

Notably, SGC-like coding emerges from traditional evolutionary mechanisms, and a superior path can be identified.\n\nTo objectively measure evolution, progress values from 0 (random coding) to 1 (SGC-like) are defined: these measure fractions of random-code-to-SGC distance. Progress types are spacing/distance/delta Polar Requirement, detecting space between identical assignments /mutational distance to the SGC/chemical order, respectively. A coding system was based on known RNAs performing aminoacyl-RNA synthetase reactions. Acceptor RNAs exhibit SGC-like wobble; alternatively, non-wobbling triplets uniquely encode 20 amino acids/start/stop. Triplets acquire 22 functions by stereochemistry, selection, coevolution, or randomly. Assignments also propagate to an assigned triplets neighborhood via single mutations, but can also decay.\n\nFutile evolutionary paths are plentiful due to the vast code universe. Thus SGC evolution is critically sensitive to disorder from random assignments. Evolution also inevitably slows near coding completion. Coding likely avoided these difficulties, and two suitable paths are compared. In late wobble, a majority of non-wobble assignments are made before wobble is adopted. In continuous wobble, a uniquely advantageous early intermediate supplies the gateway to an ordered SGC. Revised coding evolution (limited randomness, late wobble, concentration on amino acid encoding, chemically conservative coevolution with a chemically-ordered elite) produces varied full codes with excellent joint progress values. A population of only 600 independent coding tables includes SGC-like members; a Bayesian path toward more accurate SGC evolution is available.",

    "abstract": "Voluntary movements are believed to be advantageously prepared before they are executed, but the neural mechanisms at work have been unclear. For example, there are no overt changes in skeletal muscle activity during movement preparation. Here, using a delayed-reach manual task, we demonstrate a decrease in the firing rate of human muscle afferents (primary spindles) when preparing stretch rather than shortening of the spindle-bearing muscle. This goal-dependent modulation of proprioceptors begun early after target onset but was markedly stronger at the latter parts of the preparatory period. In two additional experiments, whole-arm perturbations during reach preparation revealed a congruent modulation of stretch reflex gains of shoulder and upper arm muscles. Our study shows that movement preparation can involve sensory elements of the peripheral nervous system. We suggest that central preparatory activity can also reflect sensory control, and preparatory tuning of muscle spindle mechanoreceptors is a component of planned reaching movements.",

    "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5), an X-linked gene encoding a serine-threonine kinase, is enriched in the mammalian forebrain and critical for neuronal maturation and synaptic function. Mutations in this gene cause CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) that is characterized by early-onset epileptic seizures, autistic behaviors and intellectual disability. Although numerous CDD symptoms have been recapitulated in mouse models, spontaneous seizures have not been reported in mice with CDKL5 deficiency. Here, we present the first systematic study of spontaneous seizures in a mouse model of CDD. Through wireless electroencephalographic (EEG) recording and simultaneous videotaping, we observed epileptiform discharges accompanied with ictal behaviors in pups lacking CDKL5 at a selective time window during the pre-weaning period. The seizure-like patterns of EEG showed robust increase in total number of spike events, the total number and duration of bursts in Cdkl5 null pups compared to wild-type littermate controls at the age of postnatal day 12 (P12). The mutants displayed not only jerky and spasm-like movements during the prolonged bursts of discharges at P12, but also strengthened ictal grasping in both juvenile stage and adulthood. In addition, loss of CDKL5 remarkably reduced the phosphorylation of K+/Cl- co-transporter 2, which may impede GABA-mediated inhibition, in the cortex of P12 mouse pups. Our study reveals previously unidentified phenotypes of early-onset seizures in CDKL5-deficient mice, highlights the translational value of mouse models of CDD and provides a potential molecular target for early diagnosis and treatment for CDD.\n\nSignificance StatementCyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) is an X-linked gene encoding a serine-threonine kinase. Mutations in this gene cause CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), a rare disease characterized by developmental delays, autistic behaviors and early-onset epilepsy. Even though many symptoms of CDD patients have been phenocopied in mice, spontaneous seizures are yet to be reported in mouse models of CDD. Here, for the first time, we identified early-onset seizures and ictal behaviors in neonatal pups of CDKL5-deficient mice. Loss of CDKL5 also selectively reduced protein levels of phosphorylated K+/Cl-cotransporter 2 in neonatal cortex of mice. Our study reveals an indispensible role of CDKL5 in regulating neuronal excitability in developing brains and highlights the translational significance of the CDD mouse models.",

    "abstract": "A novel coronavirus (the SARS-CoV-2) has been identified in January 2020 as the causal pathogen for COVID-19 pneumonia, an outbreak started near the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China. The SARS-CoV-2 was found to be closely related to the SARS-CoV, based on the genomic analysis. The Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) utilized by the SARS-CoV as a receptor was found to facilitate the infection of SARS-CoV-2 as well, initiated by the binding of the spike protein to the human ACE2. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods, we report here the detailed structure of the ACE2 in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The predicted model is highly consistent with the experimentally determined complex structures. Plausible binding modes between human ACE2 and the RBD were revealed from all-atom MD simulations. The simulation data further revealed critical residues at the complex interface and provided more details about the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2. Two mutants mimicking rat ACE2 were modeled to study the mutation effects on RBD binding to ACE2. The simulations showed that the N-terminal helix and the K353 of the human ACE2 alter the binding modes of the CoV2-RBD to the ACE2.",

    "abstract": "Altered olfactory function is a common symptom of COVID-19, but its etiology is unknown. A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) - the causal agent in COVID-19 - affects olfaction directly by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing revealed that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing and immunostaining demonstrated ACE2 expression in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells; in contrast, neurons in both the olfactory epithelium and bulb did not express ACE2 message or protein. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients.",

Improved resolutions allow identification and placement of secondary structural elements in the majority of the CR components. The two Y complexes in each CR subunit interact with each other and associate with those from flanking subunits, forming a circular scaffold. Within each CR subunit, the Nup358-containing region wraps around the stems of both Y complexes, likely stabilizing the scaffold. Nup205 connects the short arms of the two Y complexes and associates with the stem of a neighbouring Y complex. The Nup214-containing region uses an extended coiled-coil to link Nup85 of the two Y complexes and protrudes into the axial pore of the NPC. These previously uncharacterized structural features reveal insights into NPC assembly.",

    "abstract": "De novo DNA methylation (DNAme) during mammalian spermatogenesis yields a densely methylated genome, with the exception of CpG islands (CGIs), which are hypomethylated in sperm. Following fertilization, the paternal genome undergoes widespread DNAme loss before the first S-phase. Paradoxically, recent mass spectrometry analysis revealed that a low level of de novo DNAme occurs exclusively on the zygotic paternal genome. However, the loci involved and impact on genic transcription was not addressed. Here, we employ allele-specific analysis of wholegenome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) data and show that a number of genomic regions, including several dozen CGI promoters, are de novo methylated on the paternal genome in 2-cell embryos. A subset of these promoters maintains DNAme through development to the blastocyst stage. Consistent with zygotic paternal DNAme acquisition (PDA), many of these loci are hypermethylated in androgenetic blastocysts but hypomethylated in parthenogenetic blastocysts. Strikingly, PDA is lost following maternal deletion of Dnmt3a. Furthermore, a subset of promoters showing PDA which are normally transcribed from the paternal allele in blastocysts show premature transcription at the 4-cell stage in maternal Dnmt3a knockout embryos. These observations uncover an unexpected role for maternal DNMT3A activity in postfertilization epigenetic reprogramming and transcriptional silencing of the paternal genome.",

    "abstract": "TRF2 (TATA-box-binding protein-related factor 2) is an evolutionarily conserved general transcription factor that is essential for embryonic development of Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, zebrafish and Xenopus. Nevertheless, the cellular processes that are regulated by TRF2 are largely underexplored.\n\nHere, using Drosophila Schneider cells as a model, we discovered that TRF2 regulates cell cycle progression. Using flow cytometry, high-throughput microscopy and advanced imaging-flow cytometry, we demonstrate that TRF2 knockdown regulates cell cycle progression and exerts distinct effects on G1 and specific mitotic phases. RNA-seq analysis revealed that TRF2 regulates the expression of Cyclin E and the mitotic cyclins, Cyclin A, Cyclin B and Cyclin B3, but not Cyclin D or Cyclin C. To identify proteins that could account for the observed regulation of these cyclin genes, we searched for TRF2-interacting proteins. Interestingly, mass spectrometry analysis of TRF2-containing complexes identified GFZF, a nuclear glutathione S-transferase implicated in cell cycle regulation, and Motif 1 binding protein (M1BP). Furthermore, available ChIP-exo data revealed that TRF2, GFZF and M1BP co-occupy the promoters of TRF2-regulated genes. Using RNAi to knockdown the expression of either M1BP, GFZF, TRF2 or their combinations, we demonstrate that although GFZF and M1BP interact with TRF2, it is TRF2, rather than GFZF or M1BP, that is the main factor regulating the expression of Cyclin E and the mitotic cyclins. Taken together, our findings uncover a critical and unanticipated role of a general transcription factor as a key regulator of cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "Intron detention in precursor RNAs serves to regulate expression of a substantial fraction of genes in eukaryotic genomes. How detained intron (DI) splicing is controlled is poorly understood. Here we show that a ubiquitous post-translational modification called O-GlcNAc, which is thought to integrate signaling pathways as nutrient conditions fluctuate, controls detained intron splicing. Using specific inhibitors of the enzyme that installs O-GlcNAc (O-GlcNAc transferase, or OGT) and the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc (O-GlcNAcase, or OGA), we first show that O-GlcNAc regulates splicing of the highly conserved detained introns in OGT and OGA to control mRNA abundance in order to buffer O-GlcNAc changes. We show that OGT and OGA represent two distinct paradigms for how DI splicing can control gene expression. We also show that when DI splicing of the O-GlcNAc-cycling genes fails to restore O-GlcNAc homeostasis, there is a global change in detained intron levels. Strikingly, almost all detained introns are spliced more efficiently when O-GlcNAc levels are low, yet other alternative splicing pathways change minimally. Our results demonstrate that O-GlcNAc controls detained intron splicing to tune system-wide gene expression, providing a means to couple nutrient conditions to the cells transcriptional regime.",

    "abstract": "After reprogramming to naive pluripotency, human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) still exhibit very low ability to make interspecies chimeras. Whether this is because they are inherently devoid of the attributes of chimeric competency or because naive PSCs cannot colonize embryos from distant species remains to be elucidated. Here, we have used different types of mouse, human and rhesus monkey naive PSCs and analyzed their ability to colonize rabbit and cynomolgus monkey embryos. Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remained mitotically active and efficiently colonized host embryos. In contrast, primate naive PSCs colonized host embryos with much lower efficiency. Unlike mouse ESCs, they slowed DNA replication after dissociation and, after injection into host embryos, they stalled in the G1 phase and differentiated prematurely, regardless of host species. We conclude that human and non-human primate naive PSCs do not efficiently make chimeras because they are inherently unfit to remain mitotically active during colonization.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular particles (EP) including extracellular vesicles (EVs) and exomeres have been shown to play significant roles in diseases and therapeutic applications. However, their spatiotemporal dynamics in vivo have remained largely unresolved in detail due to the lack of a suitable method. We therefore created a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based reporter, PalmGRET, to enable pan-EP labelling ranging from exomeres (< 50 nm) to small (< 200 nm) and medium and large (> 200 nm) EVs. PalmGRET emits robust, sustained signals and allows the visualization, tracking and quantification of the EPs from whole-animal to nanoscopic resolutions under different imaging modalities, including bioluminescence, BRET and fluorescence. Using PalmGRET, we show that EPs released by lung metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exhibit lung tropism with varying distributions to other major organs in immunocompetent mice. We further demonstrate that gene knockdown of lung-tropic membrane proteins, solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2A1 (Slco2a1), alanine aminopeptidase (Cd13) and chloride intracellular channel (Clic1) decreases HCC-EP distribution to the lungs and yields distinct biodistribution profiles. We anticipate that EP-specific imaging, quantitative assays and detailed in vivo characterization to be a starting point for more accurate and comprehensive in vivo models of EP biology and therapeutic design.",

Therefore, we built a Pancreatlas resource that integrates several technologies into a novel interface, allowing users to access richly annotated web pages, drill down to individual images, and deeply explore data online. The current version of Pancreatlas contains over 800 unique images acquired by whole-slide scanning, confocal microscopy, and imaging mass cytometry, and is available at https://www.pancreatlas.org. To create this human pancreas-specific biological imaging resource, we developed a React-based web application and Python-based application programming interface, collectively called Flexible Framework for Integrating and Navigating Data (FFIND), which can be adapted beyond Pancreatlas to meet countless imaging or other structured data management needs.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1) is involved in the processing and removal of RNA/DNA hybrids in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. The enzyme comprises a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal hybrid-binding domain (HBD), separated by a linker of variable length, which in Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) is exceptionally long, 115 amino acids. Molecular modeling predicted this extended linker to fold into a structure similar to the conserved HBD. We measured catalytic activity and substrate binding by EMSA and biolayer interferometry, using a deletion series of protein variants. Both the catalytic domain and the conserved HBD were required for high-affinity binding to heteroduplex substrates, whilst loss of the novel HBD led to a [~]90% drop in K[cat] with a decreased K[M], and a large increase in the stability of the RNA/DNA hybrid-enzyme complex. The findings support a bipartite binding model for the enzyme, whereby the second HBD facilitates dissociation of the active site from the product, allowing for processivity. We used shotgun proteomics to identify protein partners of the enzyme involved in mediating these effects. Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins from both the nuclear and mitochondrial compartments, respectively RpA-70 and mtSSB, were prominently detected by this method. However, we were not able to document direct interactions between mtSSB and Dm RNase H1 when co-overexpressed in S2 cells, or functional interactions in vitro. Further studies are needed to determine the exact reaction mechanism of Dm RNase H1, the nature of its interaction with mtSSB and the role of the second HBD in both.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms of reduced frataxin (FXN) expression in Friedreichs ataxia (FRDA) are linked to epigenetic modification of the FXN locus caused by the disease-associated GAA expansion. Here, we identify that SUV4-20 histone methyltransferases, specifically SUV4-20 H1, play an important role in the regulation of FXN expression and represent a novel therapeutic target. Using a human FXN-GAA-Luciferase repeat expansion genomic DNA reporter model of FRDA, we screened the Structural Genomics Consortium epigenetic probe collection. We found that pharmacological inhibition of the SUV4-20 methyltransferases by the tool compound A-196 increased the expression of FXN by approximately 1.5-fold in the reporter cell line and in several FRDA cell lines and patient-derived primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells. SUV4-20 inhibition was accompanied by a reduction in H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 and an increase in H4K20me1, but only modest (1.4-7.8%) perturbation in genome-wide expression was observed. Finally, based on the structural activity relationship and crystal structure of A-196, novel small molecule A-196 analogues were synthesized and shown to give a 20-fold increase in potency for increasing FXN expression. Overall, our results suggest that histone methylation is important in the regulation of FXN expression, and highlight SUV4-20 H1 as a potential novel therapeutic target for FRDA.",

    "abstract": "Neurons maintain constant levels of excitability using homeostatic scaling, which adjusts relative synaptic strength in response to large changes in overall activity. It is still unknown how homeostatic scaling affects network-level protein interactions in the synapse despite extensive reporting of individual scaling-associated transcriptomic and proteomic changes. Here, we assessed a glutamatergic synapse protein interaction network (PIN) composed of 380 binary interactions among 21 protein members to identify protein complexes altered by synaptic scaling in vitro and in vivo. In cultured cortical neurons, we observed widespread bidirectional PIN alterations during up- and downscaling that reflected rapid glutamate receptor shuttling via synaptic scaffold remodeling. Sensory deprivation of the barrel cortex caused a PIN response that reflected changes in mGluR tone and NMDAR-dependent metaplasticity, consistent with emerging models of homeostatic plasticity in the barrel cortex that restore excitatory/inhibitory balance. Mice lacking Homer1 or Shank3B did not undergo normal PIN rearrangements, suggesting that these Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)-linked proteins serve as structural hubs for synaptic homeostasis. Our approach demonstrates how changes in the protein content of synapses during homeostatic plasticity translate into functional PIN alterations that mediate changes in neuron excitability.",

    "abstract": "The advent of long-read sequencing holds great promise for research on transposable elements (TEs). Long reads may finally allow us to obtain reliable assemblies of repetitive regions, and thus shed light on many open questions in TE biology, such as the evolution of piRNA clusters, i.e., the master loci controlling TE activity. Currently, many different assembly strategies exist and it is not clear how to obtain the most suitable assemblies for TE research. In fact, it is not even clear how to best identify suitable assemblies as classic quality metrics such as BUSCO and NG50 are ignorant of TEs. To address these problems, we introduce four novel quality metrics that assess i) how well piRNA clusters are assembled (CUSCO) and ii) to which extent an assembly captures the TE landscape of an organism (TE abundance, SNPs and internal deletions). Using these novel metrics, we evaluate the effect of assemblers, polishing, read length, coverage, residual polymorphisms, and finally, identify suitable assembly strategies. Using an optimized approach, we provide high-quality assemblies for the two Drosophila melanogaster strains Canton-S and Pi2. Around 80% of the piRNA clusters were contiguously assembled in these two strains. Such high-quality assemblies will provide novel insights into the biology of TEs. It is, for example, an open question of whether piRNA clusters contain abundant presence/absence polymorphism of TE insertions, as expected when piRNA clusters are responsible for stopping TE invasions. A comparison of the sequences of our assembled piRNA clusters reveals that such polymorphisms are indeed abundantly found in clusters.",

In this study, we firstly verified that SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a cell receptor and its spike (S) protein mediates high membrane fusion activity. Comparing to that of SARS-CoV, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased -helicity and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 (HR1) site. Then, we designed a HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed IPB02, which showed highly poent activities in inibibiting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus infection. IPB02 also inhibited the SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the strcuture and activity relationship (SAR) of IPB02 were characterzized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities. Therefore, the presented results have provided important information for understanding the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 and the design of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step.",

Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need to understand the biological behavior of the virus and provide a basis for developing effective therapies. Since the proteome of the virus was determined, some of the protein structures could be determined experimentally, and others were predicted via template-based modeling approaches. However, tertiary structures for several proteins are still not available from experiment nor they could be accurately predicted by template-based modeling because of lack of close homolog structures. Previous efforts to predict structures for these proteins include efforts by DeepMind and the Zhang group via machine learning-based structure prediction methods, i.e. AlphaFold and C-I-TASSER. However, the predicted models vary greatly and have not yet been subjected to refinement. Here, we are reporting new predictions from our in-house structure prediction pipeline. The pipeline takes advantage of inter-residue contact predictions from trRosetta, a machine learning-based method. The predicted models were further improved by applying molecular dynamics simulation-based refinement. We also took the AlphaFold models and refined them by applying the same refinement method. Models based on our structure prediction pipeline and the refined AlphaFold models were analyzed and compared with the C-I-TASSER models.

    "abstract": "In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia (Coronavirus disease 2019 - COVID-19) associated with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. The outbreak was traced to a seafood wholesale market and human to human transmission was confirmed. The rapid spread and the death toll of the new epidemic warrants immediate intervention. The intra-host genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, but also in the design of accurate diagnostics.\n\nWe analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher-frequency single nucleotide variations (SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral genes. The majority of these SNVs corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of intra-host but also strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints. The bioinformatics analysis disclosed genomic rearrangements over poly-A / poly-U regions located in ORF1ab and spike (S) gene, including a potential recombination hot-spot within S gene.\n\nOur results highlight the intra-host genomic diversity and plasticity of SARS-CoV-2, pointing out genomic regions that are prone to alterations. The isolated SNVs and genomic rearrangements, reflect the intra-patient capacity of the polymorphic quasispecies, which may arise rapidly during the outbreak, allowing immunological escape of the virus, offering resistance to anti-viral drugs and affecting the sensitivity of the molecular diagnostics assays.",

    "abstract": "The effect of the rapid accumulation of non-synonymous mutations on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known. To predict the impact of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions identified in ORF3a on the formation of B-cell epitopes and their role in evading the immune response, nucleotide and protein sequences of 537 available SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analyzed for the presence of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions. Mutations were correlated with changes in epitope formation. A total of 19 different non-synonymous amino acids substitutions were detected in ORF3a among 537 SARS-CoV-2 strains. G251V was the most common and identified in 9.9% (n=53) of the strains and was predicted to lead to the loss of a B-cell like epitope in ORF3a. Polyproline regions were detected in two strains (EPI_ISL_410486, France and EPI_ISL_407079, Finland) and affected epitopes formation. The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations and detected polyproline regions in ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 could be driving the evasion of the host immune response thus favoring viral spread. Rapid mutations accumulating in ORF3a should be closely monitored throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nImportanceAt the surge of the COVID-19 pandemic and after three months of the identification of SARS-CoV-2 as the disease-causing pathogen, nucleic acid changes due to host-pathogen interactions are insightful into the evolution of this virus. In this paper, we have identified a set of non-synonymous mutations in ORF3a and predicted their impact on B-cell like epitope formation. The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in ORF3a could be driving protein changes that mediate immune evasion and favoring viral spread.",

These viruses make use of a large envelope protein called spike (S) to engage host cell receptors and catalyze membrane fusion. Because of the vital role that these S proteins play, they represent a vulnerable target for the development of therapeutics to combat these highly pathogenic coronaviruses. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of single-domain antibodies (VHHs) from a llama immunized with prefusion-stabilized coronavirus spikes. These VHHs are capable of potently neutralizing MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1 S pseudotyped viruses. The crystal structures of these VHHs bound to their respective viral targets reveal two distinct epitopes, but both VHHs block receptor binding. We also show cross-reactivity between the SARS-CoV-1 S-directed VHH and SARS-CoV-2 S, and demonstrate that this cross-reactive VHH is capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses as a bivalent human IgG Fc-fusion. These data provide a molecular basis for the neutralization of pathogenic betacoronaviruses by VHHs and suggest that these molecules may serve as useful therapeutics during coronavirus outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has quickly become a worldwide pandemic, which has significantly impacted the economy, education, and social interactions. Understanding the humoral antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins may help identify biomarkers that can be used to detect and treat COVID-19 infection. However, no immuno-proteomics platform exists that can perform such proteome-wide analysis. To address this need, we created a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray to analyze antibody interactions at amino acid resolution by spotting peptides 15 amino acids long with 5-amino acid offsets representing full-length SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Moreover, the array processing time is short (1.5 hours), the dynamic range is ~2 orders of magnitude, and the lowest limit of detection is 94 pg/mL. Here, the SARS-CoV-2 proteome array reveals that antibodies commercially available for SARS-CoV-1 proteins can also target SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These readily available reagents could be used immediately in COVID-19 research. Second, IgM and IgG immunogenic epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were profiled in the serum of ten COVID-19 patients. Such epitope biomarkers provide insight into the immune response to COVID-19 and are potential targets for COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccine development. Finally, serological antibodies that may neutralize viral entry into host cells via the ACE2 receptor were identified. Further investigation into whether these antibodies can inhibit the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 is warranted. Antibody and epitope profiling in response to COVID-19 is possible with our peptide-based SARS-COV-2 proteome microarray. The data gleaned from the array could provide invaluable information to the scientific community to understand, detect, and treat COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Specific antiviral drug are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 infections. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key CoV enzyme that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, which makes it an attractive drug target. In an effort to rapidly discover lead compounds targeting Mpro, two compounds (11a and 11b) were designed and synthesized, both of which exhibited excellent inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.05 M and 0.04 M respectively. Significantly, both compounds exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in a cell-based assay with an EC50 value of 0.42 M and 0.33 M, respectively. The X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with 11a and 11b were determined at 1.5 [A] resolution, respectively. The crystal structures showed that 11a and 11b are covalent inhibitors, the aldehyde groups of which are bound covalently to Cys145 of Mpro. Both compounds showed good PK properties in vivo, and 11a also exhibited low toxicity which is promising drug leads with clinical potential that merits further studies.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is raging across the world, leading to a global mortality rate of 3.4% (estimated by World Health Organization in March 2020). As a potential vaccine and therapeutic target, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (nCoVN) functions in packaging the viral genome and viral self-assembly. To investigate the biological effects of nCoVN to human stem cells, genetically engineered human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) expressing nCoVN (iPSC-nCoVN) were generated by lentiviral expression systems, in which the expression of nCoVN could be induced by the doxycycline. The proliferation rate of iPSC-nCoVN was decreased. Unexpectedly, the morphology of iPSC started to change after nCoVN expression for 7 days. The pluripotency marker TRA-1-81 were not detectable in iPSC-nCoVN after a four-day induction. Meanwhile, iPSC-nCoVN lost the ability for differentiation into cardiomyocytes with a routine differentiation protocol. The RNA-seq data of iPSC-nCoVN (induction for 30 days) and immunofluorescence assays illustrated that iPSC-nCoVN were turning to fibroblast-like cells. Our data suggested that nCoVN disrupted the pluripotent properties of iPSC and turned them into other types of cells, which provided a new insight to the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.",

In order to develop treatment options able to stop or ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 effects, we need to understand the biology of the virus inside cells, but this kind of studies are still scarce. A recent study investigated translatome and proteome host cell changes induced in vitro by SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we use the publicly available proteomics data from this study to re-analyze the mechanisms altered by the virus infection by impact pathways analysis and network analysis. Proteins linked to inflammatory response, but also proteins related to chromosome segregation during mitosis, were found to be regulated. The up-regulation of the inflammatory-related proteins observed could be linked to the propagation of inflammatory reaction and lung injury that is observed in advanced stages of COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "As the COVID-19 outbreak spreads, there is a growing need for a compilation of conserved RNA genome regions in the SARS-CoV-2 virus along with their structural propensities to guide development of antivirals and diagnostics. Using sequence alignments spanning a range of betacoronaviruses, we rank genomic regions by RNA sequence conservation, identifying 79 regions of length at least 15 nucleotides as exactly conserved over SARS-related complete genome sequences available near the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. We then confirm the conservation of the majority of these genome regions across 739 SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported to date from the current COVID-19 outbreak, and we present a curated list of 30  SARS-related-conserved regions. We find that known RNA structured elements curated as Rfam families and in prior literature are enriched in these conserved genome regions, and we predict additional conserved, stable secondary structures across the viral genome. We provide 106  SARS-CoV-2-conserved-structured regions as potential targets for antivirals that bind to structured RNA. We further provide detailed secondary structure models for the 5 UTR, frame-shifting element, and 3 UTR. Last, we predict regions of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome have low propensity for RNA secondary structure and are conserved within SARS-CoV-2 strains. These 59  SARS-CoV-2-conserved-unstructured genomic regions may be most easily targeted in primer-based diagnostic and oligonucleotide-based therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "The genus Synechococcus (also named Synechococcus collective, SC) is a major contributor to global primary productivity. It is found in a wide range of aquatic ecosystems. Synechococcus is metabolically diverse, with some lineages thriving in polar and nutrient-rich locations, and other in tropical riverine waters. Although many studies have discussed the ecology and evolution of Synechococcus, there is a paucity of knowledge on the taxonomic structure of SC. Only a few studies have addressed the taxonomy of SC, and this issue still remains largely ignored. Our aim was to establish a new classification system for SC. Our analyses included comparing GC% content, genome size, pairwise Average Amino acid Identity (AAI) values, phylogenomics and gene cluster profiles of 170 publicly available SC genomes. All analyses were consistent with the discrimination of 11 genera, from which 2 are newly proposed (Lacustricoccus and Synechospongium). The new classification is also consistent with the habitat distribution (seawater, freshwater and thermal environments) and reflects the ecological and evolutionary relationships of SC. We provide a practical and consistent classification scheme for the entire Synechococcus collective.",

    "abstract": "DOCK3 is a member of the DOCK family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors that function to regulate cell migration, fusion, and overall viability. Previously, we identified a miR-486/Dock3 signaling cascade that was dysregulated in dystrophin-deficient muscle which resulted in the overexpression of DOCK3, however not much else is known about the role of DOCK3 in muscle. In this work, we characterize the functional role of DOCK3 in normal and dystrophic skeletal muscle. By utilizing Dock3 global knockout (Dock3 KO) mice, we found reducing Dock3 gene via haploinsufficiency in DMD mice improved dystrophic muscle histology, however complete loss of Dock3 worsened overall muscle function on a dystrophin-deficient background. Consistent with this, Dock3 KO mice have impaired muscle architecture and myogenic differentiation defects. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses of Dock3 knockout muscles reveal a decrease in factors known for myogenesis, suggesting a possible mechanism of action. These studies identify DOCK3 as a novel modulator of muscle fusion and muscle health and may yield additional therapeutic targets for treating dystrophic muscle symptoms.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic genomes, transcription units of genes often overlap with other protein-coding and/or noncoding transcription units1,2. In such intertwined genomes, coordinated transcription of nearby or overlapping genes would be important to ensure integrity of genome function; however, the mechanisms underlying this coordination are largely unknown3-6. Here, we show in Arabidopsis thaliana that genes with convergent orientation of transcription are major sources of overlapping bidirectional transcripts and that these bidirectionally transcribed genes are regulated by a putative LSD1 family histone demethylase, FLD7,8. Our genome-wide chromatin profiling revealed that FLD downregulated histone H3K4me1 in regions with convergent overlapping transcription. FLD localizes to actively transcribed genes where it colocalizes with elongating RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at Ser-2 or Ser-5 sites. Genome-wide transcription analyses suggest that FLD-mediated H3K4me1 removal negatively regulates bidirectional transcription by retaining the elongating transcription machinery. Furthermore, this effect of FLD on transcription dynamics is mediated by DNA topoisomerase I. Our study has revealed chromatin-based mechanisms to cope with overlapping bidirectional transcription, likely by modulating DNA topology. This global mechanism to cope with bidirectional transcription could be co-opted for specific epigenetic processes, such as cellular memory of responses to environment9.",

    "abstract": "Sex and sexual differentiation are ubiquitous across the tree of life. Because females and males often have substantially different functional requirements, we expect selection to differ between the sexes. Recent studies in diverse species, including humans, suggest sexually antagonistic viability selection creates allele frequency differences between the sexes at many different loci. However, theory and population-level simulations indicate that sex-specific differences in viability would need to be very extreme in order to produce and maintain reported levels of between-sex allelic differentiation. We address this paradox between theoretical predictions and empirical observations by evaluating evidence for sexually antagonistic viability selection on autosomal loci in humans using the largest cohort to date (UK Biobank, n=438,427) along with a second large, independent cohort (BioVU, n=93,864). We performed association tests between genetically ascertained sex and genotypes. Although we found dozens of genome-wide significant associations, none replicated across samples. Moreover, closer inspection revealed that all associations are likely due to cross-hybridization with sex chromosome regions during genotyping. We report loci with potential for mis-hybridization found on commonly used genotyping platforms that should be carefully considered in future genetic studies of sex-specific differences. Despite being well-powered to detect allele frequency differences of up to 0.8% between the sexes, we do not detect evidence for this signature of sexually antagonistic viability selection on autosomal variation. These findings suggest a lack of strong ongoing sexually antagonistic viability selection acting on single locus autosomal variation in humans.",

We therefore developed the first red fluorescent GPCR-activation-based DA (GRABDA) sensors and optimized versions of green fluorescent GRABDA sensors following our previous studies. In response to extracellular DA, both the red and green GRABDA sensors have a large increase in fluorescence ({Delta}F/F0 values of 150% and 340%, respectively), with subcellular resolution, subsecond kinetics, and nanomolar to submicromolar affinity. Moreover, both the red and green GRABDA sensors readily resolve evoked DA release in mouse brain slices, detect compartmental DA release in live flies with single-cell resolution, and report optogenetically elicited nigrostriatal DA release as well as mesoaccumbens dopaminergic activity during sexual behavior in freely behaving mice. Importantly, co-expressing red GRABDA with either green GRABDA or the calcium indicator GCaMP6s provides a robust tool for simultaneously tracking neuronal activity and dopaminergic signaling in distinct circuits in vivo.",
