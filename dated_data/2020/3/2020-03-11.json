    "abstract": "While the steady-state behavior of stochastic gene expression with auto-regulation has been extensively studied, its time-dependent behavior has received much less attention. Here, under the assumption of fast promoter switching, we derive and solve a reduced chemical master equation for an auto-regulatory gene circuit with translational bursting and cooperative protein-gene interactions. The analytical expression for the time-dependent probability distribution of protein numbers enables a fast exploration of large swaths of parameter space. For a unimodal initial distribution, we identify three distinct types of stochastic dynamics: (i) the protein distribution remains unimodal at all times; (ii) the protein distribution becomes bimodal at intermediate times and then reverts back to being unimodal at long times (transient bimodality) and (iii) the protein distribution switches to being bimodal at long times. For each of these, the deterministic model predicts either monostable or bistable behaviour and hence there exist six dynamical phases in total. We investigate the relationship of the six phases to the transcription rates, the protein binding and unbinding rates, the mean protein burst size, the degree of cooperativity, the relaxation time to the steady state, the protein mean and the type of feedback loop (positive or negative). We show that transient bimodality is a noise-induced phenomenon that occurs when protein expression is sufficiently bursty and we use theory to estimate the observation time window when it is manifest.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocyte-like cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-HLCs) offer an alternative to primary hepatocytes commonly used for drug screenings and toxicological tests. Although tremendous efforts have been made to facilitate hepatic functions of hPSC-HLCs using growth factors and chemicals, these cells have not yet reached hepatic functions comparable to hepatocytes in vivo. Therefore, there exists a critical need to use an alternative trigger to facilitate hepatic functions in hPSC-HLCs. We noted that human liver temperature (around 39{degrees}C) is higher than normal human body temperature (around 36.5{degrees}C), yet hepatocytes are generally cultured at 37{degrees}C in-vitro. Here we showed that hepatic functions of hPSC-HLCs would be facilitated under physiological liver temperatures. We identified the optimal temperature by treating HLCs derived from H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESC-HLCs) at 39{degrees}C and 42{degrees}C. 42{degrees}C-treatment caused significantly greater cell death compared to 39{degrees}C. We also confirmed the increases of hepatic functions, such as secretion of albumin, cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) activities, and collagen productions, without severe cell damages. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of heat-induced hepatic functions, RNA-seq was to identify gene expression signatures due to 39{degrees}C-treated hESC-HLCs. This study also showed the possible mechanisms of heat-induced hepatic function via glucocorticoid receptor pathway and molecular chaperons. In combination with existing hepatic differentiation protocols, the method proposed here may further improve hepatic functions for hPSCs, and lead to the realization of drug discovery efforts and drug toxicological tests.\n\nSignificance statementHepatocyte-like cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-HLCs) offer an alternative to primary hepatocytes commonly used for drug screenings and toxicological tests.

While the role of postzygotic isolation has been extensively characterized in the context of hybrid zones, the contribution of prezygotic isolation is less well explored. Here, we investigate the effects of assortative mate choice, the underlying preference function and mating-trait architecture, and the strength of sexual selection on hybrid zone dynamics. We explore this question by means of a mathematical model parameterized with phenotype and genotype data from the hybrid zone between all-black carrion and grey-coated hooded crows. The best-fit model resulted in narrow clines for two mating-trait loci coding for colour phenotype maintained by a moderate degree of assortative mating. Epistasis between the two loci induced hybrid-zone movement in favor of alleles conveying dark plumage followed by a shift in the opposite direction favouring grey-coated phenotypes [~]1,200 generations after secondary contact. Unlinked neutral loci diffused near-unimpeded across the zone. These results were generally robust to the choice of matching rule (self-referencing or parental imprinting) and effects of genetic drift. Overall, this study illustrates under which conditions assortative mating can maintain steep clines in mating-trait loci without generalizing to genome-wide reproductive isolation. It further emphasizes the importance of mating-trait architecture for spatio-temporal hybrid-zone dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most prevalent form of liver disease worldwide. This term covers a spectrum of pathologies, from benign hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). As the disease progresses, NASH can develop into cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the underlying mechanisms and the factors which predispose an individual to disease progression remain poorly understood. Whilst NAFLD appears to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, it is unclear whether this is due to respiratory impairment, changes in mitochondrial mass, or mitochondrial fragmentation. Using a human pluripotent stem cell-based model of NAFLD we show that exposure to lactate, pyruvate and octanoic acid results in the development of macrovesicular steatosis. We do not observe changes in mitochondrial mass or fragmentation but do find decreases in maximal respiration and reserve capacity, suggesting impairment in the electron transport chain (ETC). Taken together, these findings indicate that the development of macrovesicular steatosis in NAFLD may be linked to the impairment of the ETC in mitochondria.",

S. pyogenes NCTC 8198T and CCUG 4207T are derived from deposit of the same strain at two different culture collections. NCTC 8198T was sequenced, using a PacBio platform; the genome sequence was assembled de novo, using HGAP. CCUG 4207T was sequenced and a de novo hybrid assembly was generated, using SPAdes, combining Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequence reads. Both strategies, yielded closed genome sequences of 1,914,862 bp, identical in length and sequence identity. Combining short-read Illumina and long-read Oxford Nanopore sequence data circumvented the expected error rate of the nanopore sequencing technology, producing a genome sequence indistinguishable to the one determined with PacBio. Sequence analyses revealed five prophage regions, a CRISPR-Cas system, numerous virulence factors and no relevant antibiotic resistance genes.\n\nThese two complete genome sequences of the type strain of S. pyogenes will effectively serve as valuable taxonomic and genomic references for infectious disease diagnostics, as well as references for future studies and applications within the genus Streptococcus.",

    "abstract": "Herpes Simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) encode up to 16 envelope proteins, four of which are essential for entry. However, whether these four proteins alone are sufficient to dictate the broad cellular tropism of HSV-1 and the selection of different cell-type dependent entry routes is unknown. To begin addressing this, we previously pseudotyped VSV, lacking its native glycoprotein G, with only the four essential entry glycoproteins of HSV-1: gB, gH, gL, and gD. This novel VSV{Delta}G-BHLD pseudotype recapitulated several important features of HSV-1 entry: the requirement for gB, gH, gL, gD, a cellular receptor, and sensitivity to anti-gB and anti-gH/gL neutralizing antibodies. However, due to the use of a single cell type in that study, the tropism of the VSV{Delta}G-BHLD pseudotype was not investigated. Here, we show that the cellular tropism of the pseudotype is severely limited compared to wild-type HSV-1 and that its entry pathways differ from the native HSV-1 entry pathways. To test the hypothesis that other HSV-1 envelope proteins may contribute to HSV-1 tropism, we generated a derivative pseudotype containing the HSV-1 glycoprotein gC (VSV{Delta}G-BHLD-gC) and observed a gC-dependent increase in entry efficiency in two cell types. We propose that the pseudotyping platform developed here has the potential to uncover functional contributions of HSV-1 envelope proteins to entry in a gain-of-function manner.\n\nImportanceHerpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) contain up to 16 different proteins in their envelopes. Four of these, glycoproteins gB, gD, gH, and gL, are termed essential with regard to entry whereas the rest are typically referred to as non-essential based on the entry phenotypes of the respective single genetic deletions. However, the single-gene deletion approach, which relies on robust loss-of-function phenotypes, may be confounded by functional redundancies among the many HSV-1 envelope proteins. We have developed a pseudotyping platform, in which the essential four entry glycoproteins are isolated from the rest, which can be added back individually for systematic gain-of-function entry experiments. Here, we show the utility of this platform for dissecting the contributions of HSV envelope proteins, both the essential four and the remaining dozen (using gC as an example), to HSV entry.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-10 is a dimeric cytokine with both immune-suppressive and immune-stimulatory activities. Despite its immuno-modulatory potential, IL-10-based therapies have shown only marginal benefits in the clinic. Here we have explored whether the stability of the IL-10-receptor complex contributes to IL-10 immuno-modulatory potency. For that, we have generated an IL-10 mutant with greatly enhanced affinity for its IL-10R{beta} receptor via yeast surface display. The affinity enhanced IL-10 variants recruited IL-10R{beta} more efficiently into active cell surface signaling complexes than the wild-type cytokine and triggered more potent STAT1 and STAT3 activation in human monocytes and CD8 T cells. This in turn led to more robust induction of IL-10-mediated gene expression programs at a wide range of ligand concentrations in both human cell subsets. IL-10 regulated genes are involved in monocyte energy homeostasis, migration and trafficking, and genes involved in CD8 T cell exhaustion. Interestingly, at non-saturating doses, IL-10 lost key components of its gene-expression program, which may explain its lack of efficacy in clinical settings. Remarkably, our engineered IL-10 variant exhibited a more robust bioactivity profile than IL-10 wt at all the doses tested in monocytes and CD8 T cells. Moreover, CAR-modified T cells expanded with the engineered IL-10 variant displayed superior cytolytic activity than those expanded with IL-10 wt. Our study provides unique insights into how IL-10-receptor complex stability fine-tunes IL-10 biology, and opens new opportunities to revitalize failed IL-10 therapies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding the effects of anaesthetic drugs on cortical oscillations can help to elucidate the mechanistic link between receptor physiology and their clinical effects. Propofol produces divergent effects on visual cortical activity: increasing induced gamma-band responses (GBR) while decreasing stimulus-onset-evoked responses) 1. Dexmedetomidine, an 2-adrenergic agonist, differs from GABA-ergic sedatives both mechanistically and clinically as it allows easy arousability from deeper sedation with less cognitive side-effects. Here we use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to characterize and compare the effects of GABAergic (propofol) and non-GABA-ergic (dexmedetomidine) sedation, on visual and motor cortical oscillations.\n\nMethodsSixteen male participants received target-controlled infusions of propofol and dexmedetomidine, producing mild-sedation, in a placebo-controlled, cross-over study. MEG data was collected during a combined visual and motor task.\n\nResultsThe key findings were that propofol significantly enhanced visual stimulus induced GBR (44% increase in amplitude) while dexmedetomidine decreased it (40%). Propofol also decreased the amplitudes of the M100 (27%) and M150 (52%) evoked responses, whilst dexmedetomidine had no effect on these. During the motor task, neither drug had any significant effect on motor GBR or movement related beta de-synchronisation (MRBD). However, dexmedetomidine increased (92%) post-movement beta synchronisation/rebound (PMBR) power while propofol reduced it (70%).\n\nConclusionsDexmedetomidine and propofol, at equi-sedative doses, have contrasting effects on visual stimulus induced GBR, visual evoked responses and PMBR. These findings provide a mechanistic link between the known receptor physiology of these sedative drugs and their known clinical effects and may be used to explore mechanisms of other anaesthetic drugs on human consciousness.",

    "abstract": "In Arabidopsis, lateral roots initiate along the primary root in a process preceded by periodic gene expression, a phenomenon known as the root clock. Many genes involved in lateral root initiation have been identified. However, very little is known about the structural changes underlying the initiation process nor about how root clock function is regulated. In genetic screens, we identified the vesicle trafficking regulators, GNOM and its suppressor, AGD3, as critical to root clock function. We show that GNOM is required for the proper distribution of pectin, a mediator of intercellular adhesion, and that pectin esterification state is essential for a functional root clock. We found that in sites of lateral root primordia emergence, both esterified and de-esterified pectin are differentially distributed. Using a reverse genetic approach, we identified significant enrichment of GO terms associated with pectin modifying enzymes in the oscillation zone were the root clock is established. In agreement with a recent study on the function of pectin in pavement cell morphogenesis, our results indicate that the balance between esterified and de-esterified pectin is essential for proper root clock function and the subsequent initiation of lateral root primordia.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic CD4+ T cells are capable of initiating neuroinflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the precise effector mechanism of these autoaggressive CD4+ T cells is not entirely elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that pathogenic CD4+ T cells, upon autoantigen stimulation, developed a cytotoxic phenotype at the onset of EAE. The cytotoxic activity of pathogenic CD4+ T cells was sufficient to explain the initial myelin lesion. Consistently, CD4+ T cells of peripheral blood (PBMCs) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients present an enhancement of the cytotoxic profile in comparison with healthy control (HC). Moreover, cytotoxic CD4+ T cells (CD4-CTLs) are restrained in the PBMCs of Natalizumab-treated RRMS patients. Mechanistically, autoaggressive CD4-CTLs matched the majority of the molecular pathways of effector CD8+ T cells. Altogether, our findings point to potential new targets for monitoring MS diagnosis, treatment, and the development of novel therapeutic avenues.",

    "abstract": "Organisms continuously modify their living conditions via extended genetic effects on their envi-ronment, microbiome, and in some species culture. These effects can impact the fitness of current but also future conspecifics due to non-genetic transmission via ecological or cultural inheritance. In this case, selection on a gene with extended effects depends on the degree to which current and future genetic relatives are exposed to modified conditions. Here, we detail the selection gradient on a quantitative trait with extended effects in a patch-structured population, when gene flow between patches is limited and ecological inheritance within patches can be biased towards offspring. Such a situation is relevant to understand evolutionary driven changes in individual condition that can be preferentially transmitted from parent to offspring, such as cellular state, micro-environments (e.g., nests), pathogens, microbiome, or culture. Our analysis quantifies how the interaction between limited gene flow and biased ecological inheritance influences the joint evolutionary dynamics of traits together with the conditions they modify, helping understand adaptation via non-genetic modifications. As an illustration, we apply our analysis to a gene-culture coevolution scenario in which genetically-determined learning strategies coevolve with adaptive knowledge. In particular, we show that when social learning is synergistic, selection can favour strategies that generate remarkable levels of knowledge under intermediate levels of both vertical cultural transmission and limited dispersal. More broadly, our theory yields insights into the interplay between genetic and non-genetic inheritance, with implications for how organisms evolve to transform their environments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ancestral genetic heterogeneity (admixture) of Caribbean Hispanics makes studies of this population critical to the discovery of ancestry-specific genetic factors in Alzheimer disease. In this study, we performed whole genome sequencing in multiplex Caribbean Hispanic Puerto Rican families to identify rare causal variants influencing Alzheimer disease through linkage and segregation-based approaches.\n\nMethodsAs part of the Puerto Rican Alzheimer Disease Initiative, whole genome sequencing data were generated for 100 individuals (61 affected) from 23 Puerto Rican families. To identify the genetic loci likely to carry risk variants, we performed a parametric multipoint affected individuals-only linkage analysis using MERLIN software. Following the linkage analysis, we identified the consensus region (heterogeneity logarithm of the odds score (HLOD) > 5.1), annotated variants using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor, and combined annotation dependent depletion score (CADD). Finally, we prioritized variants according to allele frequency (< 0.01), function (CADD > 10), and complete segregation among affected individuals.\n\nResultsA locus at 9p21 produced a linkage HLOD score of 5.1 in the parametric affecteds-only multipoint affected individuals-only model supported by 9 families. Through the prioritization step, we selected 36 variants (22 genic variants). Candidate genes in the regions include C9orf72, UNC13B, and ELAVL2.\n\nConclusionsLinkage analysis of Caribbean Hispanics Puerto Rican families confirmed previously reported linkage to 9p21 in non-Hispanic White and Israeli-Arap families. Our results suggest several candidates in the region as conferring AD risk. Identified putative damaging rare variants in multiplex families indicates the critical role of rare variation in Alzheimer disease etiology.",

    "abstract": "The gene pair hgcAB is essential for microbial mercury methylation. Our understanding of its abundance and diversity in nature is rapidly evolving. In this study we developed a new broad-range primer set for hgcAB, plus an expanded hgcAB reference library, and used these to characterize Hg-methylating communities from diverse environments. We applied this new Hg-methylator database to assign taxonomy to hgcA sequences from clone, amplicon, and metagenomic datasets. We evaluated potential biases introduced in primer design, sequence length, and classification, and suggest best practices for studying Hg-methylator diversity. Our study confirms the emerging picture of an expanded diversity of HgcAB-encoding microbes in many types of ecosystems, with abundant putative mercury methylators Nitrospirae and Chloroflexi in several new environments including salt marsh and peat soils. Other common microbes encoding HgcAB included Phycisphaerae, Aminicenantes, Spirochaetes, and Elusimicrobia. Gene abundance data also corroborate the important role of two \"classic\" groups of methylators (Deltaproteobacteria and Methanomicrobia) in many environments, but generally show a scarcity of hgcAB+ Firmicutes. The new primer set was developed to specifically target hgcAB sequences found in nature, reducing degeneracy and providing increased sensitivity while maintaining broad diversity capture. We evaluated mock communities to confirm primer improvements, including culture spikes to environmental samples with variable DNA extraction and PCR amplification efficiencies. For select sites, this new workflow was combined with direct high-throughput hgcAB sequencing. The hgcAB diversity generated by direct amplicon sequencing confirmed the potential for novel Hg-methylators previously identified using metagenomic screens. A new phylogenetic analysis using sequences from freshwater, saline, and terrestrial environments showed Deltaproteobacteria HgcA sequences generally clustered among themselves, while metagenome-resolved HgcA sequences in other phyla tended to cluster by environment, suggesting horizontal gene transfer into many clades. HgcA from marine metagenomes often formed distinct subtrees from those sequenced from freshwater ecosystems. Overall the majority of HgcA sequences branch from a cluster of HgcAB fused proteins related to Thermococci, Atribacteria (candidate division OP9), Aminicenantes (OP8), and Chloroflexi. The improved primer set and library, combined with direct amplicon sequencing, provide a significantly improved assessment of the abundance and diversity of hgcAB+ microbes in nature.\n\nContribution to the Field StatementThe gene pair hgcAB is essential for microbial production of the neurotoxin methylmercury. In recent years these genes have been used as biomarkers to determine the potential of a microbiome to generate methylmercury via PCR amplification using degenerate primers from several research groups. However, improved techniques for capturing hgcAB diversity are necessary for identifying the major environmental producers of the neurotoxin as well as the expanding diversity of novel putative methylators, and the genes evolutionary history. The work described herein advances hgcAB detection in environmental samples through an updated primer set coupled with a direct high-throughput sequencing method that enables broader diversity capture. We provide an expanded hgcAB sequence reference library that allows for more sensitive and robust estimations of Hg-methylator diversity and potential for MeHg generation in the environment. The hgcAB diversity generated by high-throughput sequencing confirms the potential for novel Hg-methylators previously only identified using metagenomic screens. This study provides a significantly improved assessment of the abundance and diversity of hgcAB+ microbes in nature. By expanding our understanding of the microbial metabolic clades associated with mercury methylation, this work improves our ability to predict environmental conditions that drive production and accumulation of the neurotoxin in aquatic ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups. ApoE {varepsilon}4 is the most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD and shows the strongest effect among East Asian populations followed by non-Hispanic White populations and has a relatively lower effect in African descent populations. Admixture analysis in the African American and Puerto Rican populations showed that the variation in{varepsilon} 4 risk is correlated with the genetic ancestral background local to the ApoE gene. Native American populations are substantially underrepresented in AD genetic studies. The Peruvian population with up to [~]80 of Amerindian ancestry provides a unique opportunity to assess the role of Amerindian ancestry in Alzheimer disease. In this study we assess the effect of the ApoE {varepsilon}4 allele on AD in the Peruvian population.\n\nA total of 78 AD cases and 128 unrelated cognitive healthy controls were included in the study. Genome-wide genotyping was performed using the Illumina Global screening array. Global ancestry and local ancestry analyses were assessed. The effect of the ApoE {varepsilon}4 allele on Alzheimer disease was tested using a logistic regression model by adjusting for age, gender, and population substructure (first three principal components). Logistic regression results showed that ApoE {varepsilon}4 allele is significantly associated with AD in Peruvian population with the high-risk effect (OR = 5.02, CI: 2.3-12.5, p-value = 2e-4). The average values of the local ancestries surrounding the ApoE gene (chr19:44Mb-46Mb) have the highest proportion of Amerindian (60.6%), followed by European (33.9%) and African (5.5%) ancestral backgrounds.\n\nOur results showed that the risk for AD from ApoE {varepsilon}4 in Peruvians is higher than we have observed in non-Hispanic White populations. Given the high admixture of Amerindian ancestry in the Peruvian population, it suggests that the Amerindian local ancestry is contributing to a strong risk for AD in ApoE {varepsilon}4 carriers. Our data also support the findings of an interaction between the genetic risk allele ApoE {varepsilon}4 and the ancestral backgrounds located around the genomic region of ApoE gene.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodenerative debilitating disorder characterized by progressive disturbances in motor, autonomic and psychiatric functions. The pathological hallmark of PD is the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which causes striatal dopamine deficiency. Although most PD cases are sporadic (iPD), approximately 5-10% of all patients suffer from monogenic PD forms caused by highly penetrant rare mutations segregating with the disease in families (fPD). One of the genes linked to monogenic PD is DJ-1. Mutations in DJ-1 cause autosomal recessive early-onset forms of fPD; however, it has been shown that an over-oxidized and inactive form of the DJ-1 protein is found in the brains of iPD individuals. Valuable insights into potential PD pathogenic mechanisms involving DJ-1 have been obtained from studies in cell and animal PD models based on DJ-1 deficiency such as Drosophila. Flies mutant for the DJ-1{beta} gene, the Drosophila ortholog of human DJ-1, exhibited disease-related phenotypes such as motor defects, increased reactive oxygen species production and high levels of protein carbonylation. In the present study, we show that loss of DJ-1{beta} function significantly increased the activities of several regulatory glycolytic enzymes. Similar results were obtained in DJ-1-deficient SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, thus suggesting that loss of DJ-1 function in both PD models produces an enhancement of glycolysis. Our results also show that FDA-approved compounds such as meclizine and dimethyl fumarate, which have different clinical applications, are able to attenuate PD-related phenotypes in both models. Moreover, we found that they could exert their beneficial effect by increasing glycolysis through the activation of key glycolytic enzymes. Taken together, these results are consistent with the idea that increasing glycolysis could be a potential disease-modifying strategy for PD, as recently suggested. Besides, they also support further evaluation and potential repurposing of meclizine and dimethyl fumarate as modulators of energy metabolism for neuroprotection in PD.",

    "abstract": "Coherence among sensory and motor cortices is indicative of binding of critical functions in perception, motor planning, action and sleep. Evidence is emerging that the cerebellum can impose coherence between cortical areas, but how and when it does so is unclear. Here, we studied coherence between primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices during sensory stimulation of the whiskers in the presence and absence of optogenetic stimulation of cerebellar Purkinje cells in awake mice. Purkinje cell activation enhanced and reduced sensory-induced S1-M1 coherence in the theta and gamma bands, respectively. This impact only occurred when Purkinje cell stimulation was given simultaneously with sensory stimulation; a 20 ms delay was sufficient to alleviate its impact, suggesting the existence of a fast, cerebellar sensory pathway to S1 and M1. The suppression of gamma band coherence upon Purkinje cell stimulation was significantly stronger during trials with relatively large whisker movements, whereas the theta band changes did not show this correlation. In line with the anatomical distribution of the simple spike and complex spike responses to whisker stimulation, this suppression also occurred following focal stimulation of medial crus 2, but not of lateral crus 1. Granger causality analyses and computational modeling of the involved networks suggest that Purkinje cells control S1-M1 coherence most prominently via the ventrolateral thalamus and M1. Our results indicate that coherences between sensory and motor cortices in different frequency ranges can be dynamically modulated by cerebellar input, and that the modulation depends on the behavioral context and is site-specific.\n\nSignificance StatementCoherent activity between sensory and motor areas is essential in sensorimotor integration. We show here that the cerebellum can differentially affect cortical theta and gamma band coherences evoked by whisker stimulation via a fast ascending and predictive pathway. In line with the functional heterogeneity of its modular organization, the impact of the cerebellum is region-specific and tuned to ongoing motor responses. These data highlight site-specific and context-dependent interactions between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex that can come into play during a plethora of sensorimotor functions.",

    "abstract": "The integrated stress response (ISR) allows cells to rapidly shut down most of their protein synthesis in response to protein misfolding, amino acid deficiency, or virus infection. These stresses trigger the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha, which prevents the initiation of translation. Here we show that triggering the ISR drastically reduces the progression of DNA replication forks within one hour, thus flanking the shutdown of protein synthesis with immediate inhibition of DNA synthesis. DNA replication is restored by compounds that inhibit eIF2alpha kinases or re-activate eIF2alpha. Mechanistically, the translational shutdown blocks histone synthesis, promoting the formation of DNA:RNA hybrids (R-loops) which interfere with DNA replication. Histone depletion alone induces R-loops and compromises DNA replication. Conversely, histone overexpression or R-loop removal by RNaseH1 each restores DNA replication in the context of ISR and histone depletion. In conclusion, the ISR rapidly stalls DNA synthesis through histone deficiency and R-loop formation. We propose that this shutdown mechanism prevents potentially detrimental DNA replication in the face of cellular stresses.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe integrated stress response has long been explored regarding its immediate impact on protein synthesis. Translational shutdown represents an indispensable mechanism to prevent the toxicity of misfolded proteins and virus infections. Our results indicate that the shutdown mechanisms reach far beyond translation and immediately interfere with DNA synthesis as well. ISR depletes cells of new histones which induce accumulation of DNA:RNA hybrids. The impairment of DNA replication in this context supports cell survival during stress.\n\nOur work provides a link between the ISR and another subject of active research, i. e. the regulatory network of DNA replication forks.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=177 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/987131v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e65182org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f157cforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bc0c59org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ceb234_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical AbstractC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The testis has the most diverse and complex transcriptome of all organs due to bursts in expression of thousands of germline-specific genes. Much of this unique gene expression takes place when mitotic germ cells differentiate and enter into meiotic prophase. Here, we demonstrate that the genome-wide reorganization of super-enhancers (SEs) drives bursts of germline genes after the mitosis-to-meiosis transition. At the mitosis-to-meiosis transition, mitotic SEs dissolve while meiotic SEs are established. Meiotic SEs are associated with the activation of key germline genes, defining the cellular identity of germ cells. This SE switching is regulated by the establishment of meiotic SEs via A-MYB (MYBL1), a key transcription factor for germline genes, and by the resolution of mitotic SEs via SCML2, a germline-specific Polycomb protein required for spermatogenesis-specific gene expression. Prior to the entry into meiosis, meiotic SEs are preprogrammed in mitotic spermatogonia, serving to direct the unidirectional differentiation of spermatogenesis. We identify key regulatory factors for both mitotic and meiotic enhancers, revealing a molecular logic for the concurrent activation of mitotic enhancers and suppression of meiotic enhancers in the somatic and/or mitotically proliferating phase.",

    "abstract": "The center of origin of the globally distributed wheat pathogen Parastagnospora nodorum has remained uncertain because only a small number of isolates from the Fertile Crescent, a region in the Middle East where wheat was domesticated from wild grasses, were included in earlier population genetic and phylogeographic studies. We isolated and genetically analyzed 193 P. nodorum strains from three naturally infected wheat fields distributed across Iran, a country located within the Fertile Crescent, using eleven neutral microsatellite loci. Compared to previous studies that included populations from North America, Europe, Africa, Australia and China, the populations from Iran had the highest genetic diversity globally and also exhibited greater population structure over smaller spatial scales, patterns typically associated with a species center of origin. Genes encoding the necrotrophic effectors SnToxA, SnTox1 and SnTox3 were found at a high frequency in the Iranian population. By sequencing 96 randomly chosen Iranian strains, we detected new alleles for all three effector genes. Analyses of allele diversity showed that all three effector genes had higher diversity in Iran than in any population included in previous studies, with Iran acting as a hub for the effector diversity that was found in other global populations. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that P. nodorum originated either within or nearby the Fertile Crescent with a genome that already encoded all three necrotrophic effectors during its emergence as a pathogen on wheat. Our findings also suggest that P. nodorum was the original source of the ToxA genes discovered in the wheat pathogens Phaeosphaeria avenaria f. sp. tritici 1, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis and Bipolaris sorokiniana.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWVariations of the animal body plan morphology and morphometry can be used as prognostic tools of their habitat quality. The potential of the moon jellyfish (Aurelia spp.) as a new model organism has been poorly tested. However, as a tetramerous symmetry organism, it exhibits some variations in radial symmetry number. A pertinent list of morphological - number of gonads - and morphometric characteristics - e.g. ratio of the gonads area on the umbrella area - has been established to describe the morphology of 19 specimens through an image analysis. The method uses for the first time the Hough transform to approximate the gonads and the umbrella by ellipses and automatically extracts the morphometric data. A statistical comparison has been done to compare the morphometric characteristics of tetramerous jellyfish and of jellyfish with 5 gonads: it is only provided as a first step for testing biological hypotheses, since the small size of the data set leads to relativize its conclusions. It suggests that two parameters are discriminant: distance between the center of the gonads and the center of the umbrella, and the individual variability of the gonad eccentricity, both higher in jellyfish with 5 gonads. Additionally, the relative size of the gonads does not seem to be different between tetramerous and non-tetramerous. Combined to ecotoxicological bioassays to better understand the causes of this developmental alteration, this optimizable method can become a powerful tool in the symmetry description of an in situ population.",

    "abstract": "The programmed cell death, apoptosis is a complex universal biological process in all types of eukaryotes ranging from single cell to multi-cellular organisms. The markers for apoptosis have been studied by assays based on both biochemical as well as microscopy however most assays are not affordable for many smaller labs. Acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide both induce apoptosis at higher concentrations in S. cerevisiae. Here we describe an assay system for the detection of apoptosis features based on DAPI staining followed by fluorescence microscopy in the cells treated with apoptosis inducing concentration of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide. In this assay both untreated and cells treated with acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide were stained with DAPI and observed for the late stage apoptosis feature, Nuclear DNA fragmentation based multi nuclei centers and increase in the nuclear region enlargement. Further the multi nuclei feature and enlarged nuclei region as nucleus to cytoplasm ratio was quantified using Image J software. We report that S. cerevisiae strain BY4741 cells when treated with apoptosis inducing doses of acetic acid (140mM) and hydrogen peroxide (10mM) for 200 minutes, showed apoptosis marker feature such as nuclear region enlargement with multi-nuclei feature due to nuclear DNA fragmentation and increased nucleus to cytoplasm ratio when compared with untreated cells. We propose that this assay can be utilized for scoring the quantitative apoptotic feature as increase in multi-nuclei centers due to DNA fragmentation and nucleus to cytoplasm ratio as an indicator of apoptosis in S. cerevisiae upon treatment with apoptosis inducing agents. The assay system described here is easy to perform and affordable for the smaller lab to analyze the apoptotic features in S. cerevisiae cells which can be applied to other system as well.",

    "abstract": "Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare cause of intellectual disability primarily caused by loss of function mutations in lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D), which normally adds methyl marks to lysine 4 on histone 3. Previous studies have shown that a mouse model of KS (Kmt2d+/{beta}Geo) demonstrates disruption of adult neurogenesis and hippocampal memory. Proof-of-principle studies have shown postnatal rescue of neurological dysfunction following treatments that promote chromatin opening, however, these strategies are non-specific and do not directly address the primary defect of histone methylation. Since lysine-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1/KDM1A) normally removes the H3K4 methyl marks added by KMT2D, we hypothesize that inhibition of KDM1A demethylase activity may ameliorate molecular and phenotypic defects stemming from KMT2D loss. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated a recently developed KDM1A inhibitor (TAK-418) in Kmt2d+/{beta}Geo mice. We find that orally administered TAK-418 increases the numbers of newly born Doublecortin (DCX)+ cells and processes in hippocampus in a dose dependent manner. We also observe TAK-418-dependent rescue of histone modification defects in hippocampus both by Western blot and ChIP-Seq. Treatment rescues gene expression abnormalities including those of immediate early genes such as FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (Fos) and FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene homolog B (Fosb). After 2 weeks of TAK-418, Kmt2d+/{beta}Geo mice demonstrate normalization of hippocampal memory defects. In summary, our data suggest that KDM1A inhibition is a plausible treatment strategy for KS and support the hypothesis that the epigenetic dysregulation secondary to KMT2D dysfunction plays a major role in the postnatal neurological disease phenotype in KS.",

    "abstract": "Theta-band ([~]6 Hz) rhythmic activity within and over the medial prefrontal cortex (\"midfrontal theta\") has been identified as a distinctive signature of \"response conflict,\" the competition between multiple actions when only one action is goal-relevant. Midfrontal theta is traditionally conceptualized and analyzed under the assumption that it is a unitary signature of conflict that can be uniquely identified at one electrode (typically FCz). Here we recorded simultaneous MEG and EEG (total of 328 sensors) in nine human subjects (7 female) and applied a feature-guided multivariate source-separation decomposition to determine whether conflict-related midfrontal theta is a unitary or multidimensional feature of the data. For each subject, a generalized eigendecomposition (GED) yielded spatial filters (components) that maximized the ratio between theta and broadband activity. Components were retained based on significance thresholding and midfrontal EEG topography. All of the subjects individually exhibited multiple (mean 5.89, SD 2.47) midfrontal components that contributed to sensor-level midfrontal theta power during the task. Component signals were temporally uncorrelated and asynchronous, suggesting that each midfrontal theta component was unique. Our findings call into question the dominant notion that midfrontal theta represents a unitary process. Instead, we suggest that midfrontal theta spans a multidimensional space, indicating multiple origins, but can manifest as a single feature at the sensor level due to signal mixing.\n\nSignificance statement\"Midfrontal theta\" is a rhythmic electrophysiological signature of the competition between multiple response options. Midfrontal theta is traditionally considered to reflect a single process. However, this assumption could be erroneous due to \"mixing\" (multiple sources contributing to the activity recorded at a single electrode). We investigated the dimensionality of midfrontal theta by applying advanced multivariate analysis methods to a multimodal M/EEG dataset. We identified multiple topographically overlapping neural sources that drove response conflict-related midfrontal theta. Midfrontal theta thus reflects multiple uncorrelated signals that manifest with similar EEG scalp projections. In addition to contributing to the cognitive control literature, we demonstrate both the feasibility and the necessity of signal de-mixing to understand the neural dynamics underlying cognitive processes.",

Random-slope variation implies that the proportion of between-individual variation varies across the range of a covariate (environment/context/time/age) and has thus been called  conditional repeatability. We propose to put conditional repeatabilities in perspective of the total phenotypic variance and suggest a way of standardization using the random-slope coefficient of determination [Formula]. Furthermore, we illustrate that the marginalized repeatability Rmar averaged across an environmental gradient offers a biologically relevant description of between-individual variation. We provide simple equations for calculating key descriptors of conditional repeatabilities, clarify the difference between random-intercept variation and average between-individual variation and make recommendations for comprehensive reporting. While we introduce the concept with individual variation in mind, the framework is equally applicable to other type of between-group/cluster variation that varies across some (environmental) gradient.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulation in the germline ensures the production of high-quality gametes, long-term maintenance of the species, and speciation. Germline transcriptomes undergo dynamic changes after the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in males and have been subject to evolutionary divergence among mammals. However, the mechanism that underlies germline regulatory divergence remains undetermined. Here, we show that endogenous retroviruses influence species-specific germline transcriptomes in mammals. We show that the expression of endogenous retroviruses, particularly the evolutionarily young K family (ERVK), is associated with gene activation after the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in male mice. We demonstrate that accessible chromatin and H3K27ac, a marker of active enhancers, are tightly associated with ERVK loci as well as with the activation of neighboring evolutionarily young germline genes. Thus, ERVKs serve as evolutionarily novel enhancers in mouse spermatogenesis. These ERVK loci bear binding motifs for critical regulators of spermatogenesis such as A-MYB. The genome-wide transposition of ERVKs might have rewired germline gene expression in a species-specific manner. Notably, these features are present in human spermatogenesis, but independently evolved ERVs are associated with expression of germline genes, demonstrating the prevalence of ERV-driven mechanisms in mammals. Together, we propose a model whereby species-specific transcriptomes are fine-tuned by endogenous retroviruses in the mammalian germline.",

    "abstract": "The penta-aza macrocyclic manganese compound GC4419 is in phase 3 clinical trials as a modifier of mucositis in H&N cancer treated by radio-chemotherapy based upon its properties as a superoxide dismutase mimetic. In studies to address the potential for tumor radioprotection, a significant anti-tumor effect was identified in tumors generated from the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line H1299, when GC4419 was combined with radiation. This effect was directly related to the size of the radiation dose as demonstrated by greater efficacy in tumor growth delay when biologically equivalent irradiation regimens using a limited number of dose fractions was substantially more effective compared to regimens where the fraction number was higher and dose per fraction decreased. Furthermore, a TCD50 assay using H1299 tumors that tested the combination of GC4419 with radiation revealed a Dose Enhancement Factor of 1.67. Based upon these results the hypothesis that GC4419 was generating cytotoxic levels of hydrogen peroxide during the superoxide dismutation process. Peroxide flux did increase in cells exposed to GC4419 as did the expression of the oxidative stress markers 4-HNE and 3-NT. H1299 cells that overexpressed catalase were then challenged as tumors by the combination of radiation and GC4419 and the tumoricidal effect was nearly eliminated. The enhanced radiation response was not specific to NSCLC as similar findings were observed in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma xenografts. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that GC4419, in addition to generating high levels of hydrogen peroxide in irradiated cells, alters inflammatory and differentiation signaling in the tumor following irradiation. Together, these findings provide abundant evidence that the radioprotector GC4419 has dual functionality and will increase tumor response rates when combined with agents that generate high levels of superoxide like stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SAbR). Combining SAbR with GC4419 may be an effective strategy to enhance tumor response in general but may also allow for fully potent radiation doses to tumors that might not necessarily be able to tolerate such doses. The potential for protection of organs at risk may also be exploitable.",

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been widely used as a model system to understand human neurodevelopmental disorders and display translationally relevant behavioral and stress-regulating systems. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of moderate ELS by exposing young animals (six weeks post-fertilization), for three consecutive days, to three stressors, and analyzing the impact of this on adult zebrafish behavior (sixteen weeks post-fertilization). The ELS impact in adults was assessed though analysis of performance on tests of unconditioned memory (free movement pattern Y-maze test), exploratory and anxiety-related task (novel tank diving test) and social cohesion (shoaling test). Here, we show for the first time that moderate ELS increases the number of pure alternations compared to pure repetitions in the unconditioned Y-maze task, suggesting increased spatial short-term memory, but has no effect on shoal cohesion, locomotor profile or anxiety-like behavior. Overall, our data suggest that moderate ELS may be linked to adaptive flexibility which contributes to build  resilience in adult zebrafish by improving short-term spatial memory performance.",

However, relatively scarce data on profiling the inflammatory responses in pediatric TB are available. Here, we employed the molecular degree of perturbation (MDP) score adapted to plasma biomarkers in two distinct databanks from studies that examined either adults or children presenting with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. We used multidimensional statistical analyses to characterize the impact of age on the overall changes in the systemic inflammation profiles in subpopulation of TB patients. Our findings indicated that TB results in significant increases in MDP values, with the highest values being detected in adult patients. Furthermore, there were unique differences in the biomarker perturbation patterns and the overall degree of inflammation according to disease site and age. Importantly, the molecular degree of perturbation was not influenced by sex. Our results revealed that aging is an important determinant of the differences in quality and magnitude of systemic inflammatory perturbation in distinct clinical forms of TB.",

    "abstract": "Divalent cations are often required to fold RNA, which is a highly charged polyanion. Condensation of ions, such as Mg2+ or Ca2+, in the vicinity of RNA renormalizes the effective charges on the phosphate groups, thus minimizing the intra RNA electrostatic repulsion. The prevailing view is that divalent ions bind diffusively in a non-specific manner. In sharp contrast, we arrive at the exact opposite conclusion using a theory for the interaction of ions with the phosphate groups using RISM theory in conjunction with simulations based on an accurate Three Interaction Site RNA model. The divalent ions bind in a nucleotide-specific manner using either the inner (partially dehydrated) or outer (fully hydrated) shell coordination. The high charge density Mg2+ ion has a preference to bind to the outer shell whereas the opposite is the case for Ca2+. Surprisingly, we find that bridging interactions, involving ions that are coordinated to two or more phosphate groups, play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the folded state. Their importance could become increasingly prominent as the size of the RNA increases. Because the modes of interaction of divalent ions with DNA are likely to be similar, we propose that specific inner and outer shell coordination could play a role in DNA condensation, and perhaps genome organization as well.",

HT and HHP treatments differently affected these properties. HT120 led to maximum values of elastic and viscous moduli (G', G''), and gel strength of bean flours. HHP enhanced G', G'' and gel strength as the pressure and holding time increased. The viscoelastic properties of HT120 and HHP600/5-treated bean flours correlated with the increased viscosity of these samples. The pasting profiles and thermograms indicated a full, partial, and limited starch gelatinization in HT120, HHP600/5 and HHP [&le;] 450MPa samples, respectively. Enthalpy values showed that HT120 caused a higher degree of protein denaturation than HHP, with protein denaturation increasing as pressurization and time increased. This had an impact on protein solubility and emulsifying activity of flours which were significantly diminished by HT15/HT120, but maintained or slightly decreased by HHP. Nevertheless, HHP-treated samples showed enhanced emulsifying stability with increased pressure and holding time. These results demonstrate that HHP has the technological potential to manufacture bean flours with a range of functionalities into diverse food products.",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is a technique that uses the amplitude of fluorescence correlation data for improved resolution of fluorescence images. Here, we explore if also the amplitude of superresolution by polarisation demodulation (SPoD) data can be used to gain additional information about the underlying structures. Highly organized experimental as well a simulated actin filament data demonstrate a principle information gain from this approach. In addition, we explored theoretically the benefits of analyzing the entire 3D-polarization information instead of only 2D-projections thereof. Due to fundamental principles, the probability of finding parallel orientations is approaching zero in 3D-SPoD in contrast to 2D-approaches. Using the modulation-amplitude based analysis we explored systematically simulated 3D-single molecules data (for which the true structures are known) under different conditions that are typically observed in experiments. We found that this approach can significantly improve the distinction, reconstruction and localization. In addition, these approaches are less sensitive to uncertainties in the knowledge about the true experimental point-spread-function (PSF) used for reconstruction compared to approaches using non-modulated data. Finally, they can effectively remove higher levels of non-modulated back-ground intensity.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that has a significant impact on human health, especially in the immunocompromised. This parasite is also a useful genetic model for intracellular parasitism given its ease of culture in the laboratory and relevant animal models. However, as for many other eukaryotes, the T. gondii genome is incomplete, containing hundreds of sequence gaps due to the presence of repetitive and/or uncloneable sequences that prevent complete telomere-to-telomere de novo chromosome assembly. Here, we report the first use of single molecule DNA sequencing to generate near complete de novo genome assemblies for T. gondii and its near relative, N. caninum. Using the Oxford Nanopore Minion platform, we dramatically improved the contiguity of the T. gondii genome (N50 of [~]6.6Mb) and increased overall assembled sequence compared to current reference sequences by [~]2 Mb. Multiple complete chromosomes were fully assembled as evidenced by clear telomeric repeats on the end of each contig. Interestingly, for all of the Toxoplasma gondii strains that we sequenced (RH, CTG, IIxIII F1 progeny clones CL13, S27, S21, and S26), the largest contig ranged in size between 11.9 and 12.1 Mb in size, which is larger than any previously reported T. gondii chromosome. This was due to a repeatable and consistent fusion of chromosomes VIIb and VIII. These data were further validated by mapping existing T. gondii ME49 Hi-C data to our assembly, providing parallel lines of evidence that the T. gondii karyotype consists of 13, rather than 14, chromosomes. In addition revising the molecular karyotype we were also able to resolve hundreds of repeats derived from both coding and non-coding tandem sequence expansions. For well-known host-targeting effector loci like rhoptry protein 5 (ROP5) and ROP38, we were also able to accurately determine the precise gene count, order and orientation using established assembly approaches and the most likely primary sequence of each using our own assembly correction scripts tailored to correcting homopolymeric run errors in tandem sequence arrays. Finally, when we compared the T. gondii and N. caninum assemblies we found that while the 13 chromosome karyotype was conserved, we determined that previously unidentified large scale translocation events occurred in T. gondii and N. caninum since their most recent common ancestry.",

    "abstract": "In solid organ transplantation, donor derived immune cells are assumed to decline with time after surgery. Whether donor leukocytes persist within kidney transplants or play any role in rejection is unknown, however, in part because of limited techniques for distinguishing recipient and donor cells. To address this question, we performed paired whole exome sequencing of donor and recipient DNA and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 5 human kidney transplant biopsy cores. Exome sequences were used to define single nucleotide variations (SNV) across all samples. By analyzing expressed SNVs in the scRNA-seq dataset we could define recipient vs. donor cell origin for all 81,139 cells. The leukocyte donor to recipient ratio varied with rejection status for macrophages and with time post-transplant for lymphocytes. Recipient macrophages were characterized by inflammatory activation and donor macrophages by antigen presentation and complement signaling. Recipient origin T cells expressed cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory genes consistent with an effector cell phenotype whereas donor origin T cells are likely quiescent expressing oxidative phosphorylation genes relative to recipient T cells. Finally, both donor and recipient T cell clones were present within the rejecting kidney, suggesting lymphoid aggregation. Our results indicate that donor origin macrophages and T cells have distinct transcriptional profiles compared to their recipient counterparts and donor macrophages can persist for years post transplantation. This study demonstrates the power of this approach to accurately define leukocyte chimerism in a complex tissue such as the kidney transplant coupled with the ability to examine transcriptional profiles at single cell resolution.",

    "abstract": "Memory reconsolidation is a fundamental plasticity process in the brain that allows established memories to be changed or erased. However, certain boundary conditions limit the parameters under which memories can be made plastic. Strong memories do not destabilize, for instance, although why they are resilient is mostly unknown. Here, we extend the understanding of the mechanisms implicated in reconsolidation-resistant memories by investigating the hypothesis that specific modulatory signals shape memory formation into a state that lacks lability. We find that the activation of the noradrenaline-locus coeruleus system (NOR-LC) during strong fear memory encoding increases molecular mechanisms of stability at the expense of lability in the amygdala. Preventing the NOR-LC from modulating strong fear encoding results in the formation of memories that can undergo reconsolidation within the amygdala and thus are vulnerable to post-reactivation interference. Thus, the memory strength boundary condition on reconsolidation is set at the time of encoding by the action of the NOR-LC.",

Little is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms behind the specification of axial and hypaxial motor neurons controlling postural and respiratory functions respectively. Here we show that the Groucho/TLE (TLE) transcriptional corepressor is a multi-step regulator of axial and hypaxial motor neuron diversification in the developing spinal cord. TLE first promotes axial motor neuron specification at the expense of hypaxial identity by cooperating with non-canonical WNT5A signalling within the motor neuron progenitor domain. TLE further acts during post-mitotic motor neuron diversification to promote axial motor neuron topology and axonal connectivity whilst suppressing hypaxial traits. These findings provide evidence for essential and sequential roles of TLE in the spatial and temporal coordination of events regulating the development of motor neurons influencing posture and controlling respiration.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIGroucho/TLE mediates non-canonical WNT signalling in developing motor neurons\nC_LIO_LINon canonical WNT:TLE pathway regulates thoracic motor neuron diversification\nC_LIO_LITLE promotes axial while inhibiting hypaxial motor neuron development\nC_LIO_LITLE influences developing motor neuron topology and muscle innervation\nC_LI\n\nIN BRIEFSalin-Cantegrel et al use in ovo engineered approaches to show that a non-canonical WNT:TLE pathway coordinates temporally and spatially separated elements of motor neuron diversification, repressing hypaxial motor neuron development to promote the axial fate.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=116 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/986323v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e2d96dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@130baf4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@41fa32org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@190ebd3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG TLE contribution to the development of thoracic somatic motor columns\n\nProgenitor cells in the ventral pMN domain are exposed to higher concentrations of non-canonical WNTs and express more TLE.

    "abstract": "Gamma oscillations are a prominent activity pattern in the cerebral cortex. While gamma rhythms have been extensively studied in the adult prefrontal cortex in the context of cognitive (dys)functions, little is known about their development. We addressed this issue by using extracellular recordings and optogenetic stimulations in mice across postnatal development. We show that fast rhythmic activity in the prefrontal cortex becomes prominent during the second postnatal week. While initially at about 15 Hz, fast oscillatory activity progressively accelerates with age and stabilizes within gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz) during the fourth postnatal week. Activation of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons drives fast oscillations throughout development, yet the acceleration of their frequency follows similar temporal dynamics as the maturation of fast-spiking interneurons. These findings uncover the development of prefrontal gamma activity and provide a framework to examine the origin of abnormal gamma activity in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

We show that conditionally deleting the IR reduces adult NSCs of the subventricular zone by [~]70% accompanied by a corresponding increase in progenitors. IR deletion produced hyposmia due to aberrant olfactory bulb neurogenesis. Interestingly, hippocampal neurogenesis was not perturbed nor were hippocampal dependent behaviors. Highly aggressive proneural and mesenchymal glioblastomas (GBMs) had high IR/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway gene expression, and isolated glioma stem cells had an aberrantly high ratio of IR:IGF1R receptors. Moreover, IR knockdown inhibited proneural and mesenchymal GBM tumorsphere growth.

Optogenetic excitation of VTA dopamine neurons quantitatively determines impulse in the forward direction, and optogenetic inhibition produces impulse in the backward direction. At the same time, these neurons also regulate the initiation and execution of anticipatory licking.

    "abstract": "Amacrine cells (ACs) are a diverse class of interneurons that modulate input from photoreceptors to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), rendering each RGC type selectively sensitive to particular visual features, which are then relayed to the brain. While many AC types have been identified morphologically and physiologically, they have not been comprehensively classified or molecularly characterized. We used high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile >32,000 ACs from mouse retina, and applied computational methods to identify 63 AC types. We identified molecular markers for each type, and used them to characterize the morphology of multiple types. We show that they include nearly all previously known AC types as well as many that had not been described. Consistent with previous studies, most of the AC types express markers for the canonical inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA or glycine, but several express neither or both. In addition, many express one or more neuropeptides, and two express glutamatergic markers. We also explored transcriptomic relationships among AC types and identified transcription factors expressed by individual or multiple closely related types. Noteworthy among these were Meis2 and Tcf4, expressed by most GABAergic and most glycinergic types, respectively. Together, these results provide a foundation for developmental and functional studies of ACs, as well as means for genetically accessing them. Along with previous molecular, physiological and morphological analyses, they establish the existence of at least 130 neuronal types and nearly 140 cell types in mouse retina.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe mouse retina is a leading model for analyzing the development, structure, function and pathology of neural circuits. A complete molecular atlas of retinal cell types provides an important foundation for these studies. We used high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the most heterogeneous class of retinal interneurons, amacrine cells, identifying 63 distinct types. The atlas includes types identified previously as well as many novel types. We provide evidence for use of multiple neurotransmitters and neuropeptides and identify transcription factors expressed by groups of closely related types. Combining these results with those obtained previously, we proposed that the mouse retina contains 130 neuronal types, and is therefore comparable in complexity to other regions of the brain.",

    "abstract": "AimsHeart valve disease attributed to serotonin (5HT) has been observed with 5HT-secreting carcinoid tumors and in association with medications, such as the diet drug, Dexfenfluoramine, a serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) inhibitor and 5HT receptor (HTR) 2B agonist. HTR2B signaling upregulates TGF{beta}-1 resulting in increased production of extracellular matrix proteins. SLC6A4 internalizes 5HT, limiting HTR signaling. Selective 5HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), widely used antidepressants, target SLC6A4, thus enhancing HTR signaling. However, 5HT and SLC6A4 mechanisms have not been previously associated with degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR). The present studies investigated the hypothesis that both dysregulation of SLC6A4 and inhibition of SLC6A4 contribute to the pathophysiology of MR.\n\nMethods and ResultsHere we report SLC6A4 related studies of 225 patients with MR requiring surgery. A multivariate analysis showed that SSRI use in MR patients was associated with surgery at a younger age, indicating more rapidly progressive MR (p=0.0183); this was confirmed in a national dataset (p<0.001). Aspirin use by MR patients was associated with surgery at an older age (p=0.0055). Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR of MR leaflet RNA from 44 patients, and 20 normal mitral leaflets from heart transplant recipients, demonstrated down regulation in MR of both SLC6A4 and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (SLC18A2), that packages 5HT (p<0.001). Human mitral valve interstitial cells cultivated with Fluoxetine, a SSRI, demonstrated down regulation of SLC6A4 and upregulation of HTR2B, compared to untreated, in cells from both normal and MR leaflets. Platelet 5HT studies in healthy subjects without heart disease used ADP-induced activation to model MR-associated activation. Fluoxetine significantly increased platelet activation and plasma 5HT levels, while Aspirin inhibited ADP platelet activation.\n\nConclusionsDown regulation and inhibition of SLC6A4 influences MR through enhanced HTR signaling. SSRI may further influence MR through inhibition and down regulation of SLC6A4, upregulation of HTR2B, and increased platelet release of 5HT.\n\nTranslational PerspectiveDegenerative mitral valve regurgitation (MR) affects millions, and there is no medical therapy for this disease. MR becomes progressively worse, and for severe MR, the only option is cardiac surgery. Serotonin (5HT) is best known as a neurotransmitter. However, 5HT secreting carcinoid tumors cause a cardiac valve disorder in many cases, and 5HT related medications, such as the diet drug Fenfluoramine, have been associated with the development of cardiac valve disease. The present paper presents evidence that diminished serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) expression and inhibition, lead to increased 5HT receptor signaling, contributing to the progression of MR.",

Individually, the JNK, p38 and p53 stress and DNA-damage response networks are well understood and regulate critical cell-fate decisions, such as apoptosis, in response to many chemotherapeutical agents, such as doxorubicin. To better understand how interactions between these pathways determine the dynamic behaviour of the entire network, we constructed a data-driven mathematical model. This model contains mechanistic details about the kinase cascades that activate JNK, p38, AKT and p53, and free parameters that describe possible interactions between these pathways. Fitting this model to experimental time-course perturbation data (five time-courses with six time-points under five different conditions), identified specific network interactions that can explain the observed network responses. JNK emerged as an important control node. JNK exhibited a positive feedback loop, was tightly controlled by negative feedback and crosstalk from p38 and AKT, respectively, and was the strongest activator of p53. Compared to static network reconstruction methods, such as modular response analysis, the model-based approach identifies biochemical mechanisms and explains the dynamic control of cell signalling.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can promote tissue repair in regenerative medicine, and their therapeutic potential is further enhanced via spheroid formation. We demonstrated that intraspheroidal presentation of Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 (BMP-2) on hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles resulted in more spatially uniform MSC osteodifferentiation, providing a method to internally influence spheroid phenotype. Stress relaxation of hydrogels has emerged as a potent stimulus to enhance monodispersed MSC spreading and osteogenic differentiation, but the effect of hydrogel viscoelasticity on MSC spheroids has not been reported. Herein, we describe a materials-based approach to augment the osteogenic potential of entrapped MSC spheroids by leveraging the mechanical properties of alginate hydrogels. Compared to spheroids entrapped in covalently crosslinked, elastic alginate, calcium deposition of MSC spheroids was consistently increased in ionically crosslinked, viscoelastic alginate. We observed significant increases in calcium deposition by MSC spheroids loaded with BMP-2-HA in viscoelastic gels compared to soluble BMP-2, which was higher than all elastic alginate gels. Upon implantation in critically sized calvarial bone defects, we observed enhanced bone formation in all animals treated with viscoelastic hydrogels. Increases in bone formation were evident in viscoelastic gels, regardless of the mode of presentation of BMP-2 (i.e., soluble delivery or HA nanoparticles). These studies demonstrate that the dynamic mechanical properties of viscoelastic alginate are an effective strategy to enhance the therapeutic potential of MSC spheroids for bone formation and repair.",

    "abstract": "Egyptians are at a crossroad between Africa and Eurasia, providing useful genomic resources for analyzing both genetic and environmental factors for future personalized medicine. Two personal Egyptian whole genomes have been published previously and here nine female whole genome sequences with clinical information have been added to expand the genomic resource of Egyptian personal genomes. Here we report the analysis of whole genomes of nine Egyptian females from different regions using Illumina short-read sequencers. At 30x sequencing coverage, we identified 12 SNPs that were shared in most of the subjects associated with obesity which are concordant with their clinical diagnosis. Also, we found mtDNA mutation A4282G is common in all the samples and this is associated with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO). Haplogroup and Admixture analyses revealed that most Egyptian samples are close to the other north Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and European, respectively, possibly reflecting the into-Africa influx of human migration. In conclusion, we present whole-genome sequences of nine Egyptian females with personal clinical information that cover the diverse regions of Egypt. Although limited in sample size, the whole genomes data provides possible geno-phenotype candidate markers that are relevant to the regions diseases.",

    "abstract": "Extinction has increased as human activities impact ecosystems. Conservation assessments for the IUCN red list are a fundamental tool in aiding the prevention of further extinction, yet, relatively few species have been thoroughly assessed. To increase the efficiency of assessments, novel approaches are needed to highlight threatened species that are currently data deficient. Many Madagascan plant species currently have extremely narrow ranges, but this may not have always been the case. To assess this, we used high-throughput DNA sequencing for 2-5 individuals of each species - reflecting the paucity of samples available for rare species. We estimated effective population size (Ne) for each species and compared this to census population (Nc) sizes when known. In each case, Ne was an order of magnitude larger than Nc - a signature of rapid, recent population decline. We then estimated the demographic history of each species, tracking changes in Ne over time. Five out of ten species displayed significant population declines towards the present (68-90% decreases). Our results for palm trees indicate that it is possible to predict extinction risk, particularly in the most threatened species. We performed simulations to show that our approach has the power to detect population decline during the Anthropocene, but performs less well when less data is used. Similar declines to those in palms were observed in data deficient species or those assessed as of least concern. These analyses reveal that Madagascars narrow endemics were not always rare, having experienced rapid decline in their recent history. Our approach offers the opportunity to target species in need of conservation assessment with little prior information, particularly in regions where human modification of the environment has been rapid.\n\nSummaryCurrent IUCN conservation assessment methods are reliant on observed declines in species population and range sizes over the last one hundred years, but for the majority of species this information is not available. We used a population genetic approach to reveal historical demographic decline in the rare endemic flora of Madagascar. These results show that it is possible to predict extinction risk from demographic patterns inferred from genetic data and that destructive human influence is likely to have resulted in the very high frequency of narrow endemics present on the island. Our approach will act as an important tool for rapidly assessing the threatened status of poorly known species in need of further study and conservation, particularly for tropical flora and fauna.",

    "abstract": "Using live microbes as therapeutic candidates is a strategy that has gained traction across multiple therapeutic areas. In the skin, commensal microorganisms play a crucial role in maintaining skin barrier function, homeostasis, and cutaneous immunity. Alterations of the homeostatic skin microbiome are associated with a number of skin diseases. Here, we present the design of an engineered commensal organism, Staphylococcus epidermidis, for use as a live biotherapeutic product (LBP) candidate for skin diseases. The development of novel bacterial strains whose growth can be controlled without the use of antibiotics, or genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance, enables modulation of therapeutic exposure and improves safety. We therefore constructed an auxotrophic strain of S. epidermidis that requires exogenously supplied D-alanine. The S. epidermidis strain, NRRL B-4268 {Delta}alr1{Delta}alr2{Delta}dat (SE{Delta}{Delta}{Delta}) contains deletions of three biosynthetic genes: two alanine racemase genes, alr1 and alr2 (SE1674 and SE1079), and the D-alanine aminotransferase gene, dat (SE1423). These three deletions restricted growth in D-alanine deficient media, pooled human blood, and skin. In the presence of D-alanine, SE{Delta}{Delta}{Delta} colonized and increased expression of human {beta}-defensin 2 in cultured human skin models in vitro. SE{Delta}{Delta}{Delta}, showed a low propensity to revert to D-alanine prototrophy, and did not form biofilms on plastic in vitro. These studies support the potential safety and utility of SE{Delta}{Delta}{Delta} as a live biotherapeutic strain whose growth can be controlled by D-alanine.",

Polypeptide chains comprised of an alpha helical linker flanked by a Tb(III) complex, GFP and two binding domains exhibit large differences in long-lifetime, Tb(III)-to-GFP LRET-sensitized emission between open (unbound) and closed (bound) states. We used TGL microscopy to image ca. 500% increases in Tb(III)-to-GFP LRET following rapamycin addition to NIH 3T3 cells that expressed biosensors bearing FKBP12 and the rapamycin binding domain of m-Tor (FRB) at each terminus. Much larger signal changes, up to ca. 2500%, were observed when cells were grown in 96-well or 384-well plates and analyzed using a TGL plate reader. We also measured the interaction of p53 and HDM2 and its inhibition within intact HeLa cells grown in 96-well plates and estimated a z-factor of 0.5 for the assay. The modular design and high dynamic range of Tb(III)-based LRET biosensors will facilitate versatile imaging and cell-based screening of PPIs.",

    "abstract": "A key question in genome research is whether biologically active proteins are restricted to the [~]20,000 canonical, well-annotated genes, or rather extend to the many non-canonical open reading frames (ORFs) predicted by genomic analyses. To address this, we experimentally interrogated 553 ORFs nominated in ribosome profiling datasets. Of these 553 ORFs, 57 (10%) induced a viability defect when the endogenous ORF was knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9 in 8 human cancer cell lines, 257 (46%) showed evidence of protein translation when ectopically expressed in HEK293T cells, and 401 (73%) induced gene expression changes measured by transcriptional profiling following ectopic expression across 4 cell types. CRISPR tiling and start codon mutagenesis indicated that the biological effects of these non-canonical ORFs required their translation as opposed to RNA-mediated effects. We selected one of these ORFs, G029442--renamed GREP1 (Glycine-Rich Extracellular Protein-1)--for further characterization. We found that GREP1 encodes a secreted protein highly expressed in breast cancer, and its knock-out in 263 cancer cell lines showed preferential essentiality in breast cancer derived lines. Analysis of the secretome of GREP1-expressing cells showed increased abundance of the oncogenic cytokine GDF15, and GDF15 supplementation mitigated the growth inhibitory effect of GREP1 knock-out. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the non-canonical ORFeome is surprisingly rich in biologically active proteins and potential cancer therapeutic targets deserving of further study.",

    "abstract": "Amazonian rainforest is undergoing increasing rates of deforestation, driven primarily by cattle pasture expansion. Forest-to-pasture conversion has been associated with changes to ecosystem processes, including substantial increases in soil methane (CH4) emission. The drivers of this change in CH4 flux are not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we measured soil CH4 flux, environmental conditions, and belowground microbial community attributes across a land use change gradient (old growth primary forest, cattle pasture, and secondary forest regrowth) in two Amazon Basin regions. Primary forest soils exhibited CH4 uptake at modest rates, while pasture soils exhibited CH4 emission at high but variable rates. Secondary forest soils exhibited low rates of CH4 uptake, suggesting that forest regrowth following pasture abandonment could reverse the CH4 sink-to-source trend. While few environmental variables were significantly associated with CH4 flux, we identified numerous microbial community attributes in the surface soil that explained substantial variation in CH4 flux with land use change. Among the strongest predictors were the relative abundance and diversity of methanogens, which both increased in pasture relative to forests. We further identified individual taxa that were associated with CH4 fluxes and which collectively explained ~50% of flux variance. These taxa included methanogens and methanotrophs, as well as taxa that may indirectly influence CH4 flux through acetate production, iron reduction, and nitrogen transformations. Each land type had a unique subset of taxa associated with CH4 fluxes, suggesting that land use change alters CH4 cycling through shifts in microbial community composition. Taken together, our results suggest that changes in CH4 flux from agricultural conversion could be driven by microbial responses to land use change in the surface soil, with both direct and indirect effects on CH4 cycling. This demonstrates the central role of microorganisms in mediating ecosystem responses to land use change in the Amazon Basin.",

    "abstract": "Analyses of Y chromosome variations of extant people have resulted in two models for the paternal phylogenetic tree of modern humans with roots either in Africa or East Asia. These two trees are differentiated mainly by when and where their mega-haplogroups branched apart. This paper examines previously published Y chromosome sequencing data of 17 ancient samples to compare these two competing models. As ancient samples have had less time to evolve, they are expected to have mutated in some, but not all, of the sites that define present day haplogroups to which they belong. Indeed, most of the ancient DNAs here showed that expected pattern for both the terminal and the basal haplogroups to which they belong, all of the ones which are non-controversial or considered real by both of the two competing models followed that pattern. However, for basal haplogroups not shared by the two models, such expected pattern could be observed only if the haplogroups specific to the Asia rather than the Africa model are real, including ABCDE, ABDE, AB, A00-A1b. Another important point is that, if the mega-haplogroups of the Africa model were real, including BT, CT, CF and F, it would mean that numerous alleles would be shared between these haplogroups and several ancient A1b1b2 samples, which is unexpected and unseen in present day samples. Sharing alleles like this would also violate the infinite site assumption that makes the Africa rooting possible in the first place. Therefore, the data from ancient Y chromosomes confirm the actual existence of the haplogroups specific to the Asia model.",

To explore the distinct pattern of genetic robustness between these evolutionary scenarios, we formulated a probabilistic model with some biologically reasonable assumptions for analyzing a set of duplicate pairs with three possible states: double-dispensable (DD), semi-dispensable (one dispensable one essential, DE) or double-essential (EE). A computational pipeline is then developed to predict the distribution of three states (DD, DE and EE) conditional of ancestral dispensability or essentiality, respectively. This model was applied to yeast duplicate pairs from a whole-genome duplication, revealing that the process of essentiality of those duplicated from essential genes could be significantly higher than that of those duplicated from dispensable genes. We thus proposed a hypothesis that the process of sub-functionalization may be faster than neo-functionalization. Our analysis may provide some new insights about the role of duplicate compensation on genetic robustness.",

    "abstract": "Accurate chromosome segregation requires chromosome compaction with concordant disentanglement of the two sister chromatids. This process has been studied extensively by microscopy but has remained a challenge for genomic methods, such as Hi-C, because sister chromatids have identical DNA sequences. Here we describe SisterC, a chromosome conformation capture assay that can distinguish interactions between and within sister chromatids. The assay is based on BrdU incorporation during S-phase, which labels the newly replicated strands of the sister chromatids. This is followed by Hi-C, e.g. during different stages of mitosis, and the selective destruction of BrdU containing strands by UV/Hoechst treatment. After PCR amplification and sequencing of the remaining intact strands, this allows for the assignment of Hi-C products as inter- and intra-sister interactions by read orientation. We performed SisterC on mitotically arrested S. cerevisiae cells. As expected, we find prominent interactions and alignment of sister chromatids at their centromeres. Along the arms, sister chromatids are less precisely aligned with inter-sister connections every ~35kb. In many instances, inter-sister interactions do not involve the interaction of two identical loci but occur between cohesin binding sites that can be offset by 5 to 25kb. Along sister chromatids, extruding cohesin forms loops up to 50kb. Combined, SisterC allows the observation of the complex interplay between sister chromatid compaction and sister chromatid segregation as the cell transitions from late S-phase to mitosis. SisterC should be applicable to study mitotic events in a wide range of organisms and cell types.",

SCENITH allows for the study of metabolic responses in multiple cell types in parallel by flow cytometry. SCENITH is designed to perform metabolic studies ex vivo, particularly for rare cells in whole blood samples, avoiding metabolic biases introduced by culture media. We analyzed myeloid cells in solid tumors from patients and identified variable metabolic profiles, in ways that are not linked to their lineage nor their activation phenotype. SCENITH ability to reveal global metabolic functions and determine complex and linked immune-phenotypes in rare cell subpopulations will contribute to the information needed for evaluating therapeutic responses or patient stratification.",

    "abstract": "We have identified a novel role for filamentous bacteriophage in the delayed healing associated with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) wound infections. Pf phage delays wound re-epithelialization in the absence of live Pa, indicative that Pf effects on wound healing are independent of Pa pathogenesis. Pf phage directly inhibits autocrine signaling of CXCL1 (KC) to impede keratinocyte migration and wound re-epithelization. In agreement with these studies, a prospective cohort study of 36 human patients with chronic Pa wound infections revealed that wounds infected with Pf positive strains of Pa took longer to heal and were more likely to increase in size compared to wounds infected with Pf negative strains. Together, these data implicate Pf phage in the delayed wound healing associated with Pa infection through direct manipulation of mammalian target cells. We propose that Pf phage may have potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in delayed wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Current methodologies for targeting the mitochondrial genome for basic research and/or therapeutic strategy development in mitochondrial diseases are restricted by practical limitations and technical inflexibility. The development of a functional molecular toolbox for CRISPR-mediated mitochondrial genome editing is therefore desirable, as this could enable precise targeting of mtDNA haplotypes using the precision and tuneability of CRISPR enzymes; however, published reports of \"MitoCRISPR\" systems have, to date, lacked reproducibility and independent corroboration. Here, we have explored the requirements for a functional MitoCRISPR system in human cells by engineering several versions of CRISPR nucleases, including the use of alternative mitochondrial protein targeting sequences and smaller paralogues, and the application of gRNA modifications that reportedly induce mitochondrial import. We demonstrate varied mitochondrial targeting efficiencies and influences on mitochondrial dynamics/function of different CRISPR nucleases, with Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 (Lb) Cas12a being better targeted and tolerated than Cas9 variants. We also provide evidence of Cas9 gRNA association with mitochondria in HeLa cells and isolated yeast mitochondria, even in the absence of a targeting RNA aptamer. Finally, we present evidence linking mitochondrial-targeted LbCas12a/crRNA with increased mtDNA copy number dependent upon DNA binding and cleavage activity. We discuss reproducibility issues and the future steps necessary if MitoCRISPR is to be realised.",

    "abstract": "Microglia are heterogeneous and ubiquitous CNS-resident macrophages that maintain homeostasis of neural tissues and protect them from pathogen attacks. Yet, their differentiation in different compartments remains elusive. We performed single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis to compare the transcriptomes of microglia in adult mouse (C57/Bl) brains and spinal cords to identify microglial subtypes in these CNS compartments. Cortical microglia from 2-month mice consisted of a predominant population of the homeostatic subtype (HOM-M) and a small population (4%) of the inflammatory subtype (IFLAM-M), while spinal microglia consisted of 55% HOM-M and 45% IFLAM-M subtype. Comparison of cortical and spinal microglia at 2, 4 and 8 months revealed consistently a higher composition of the IFLAM-M subtype in the spinal cord. At 8-month, cortical microglia differentiated a small new subtype with interferon response phenotypes (INF-M), while spinal microglia polarized toward a proinflammatory phenotype, as indicated by the increase of microglia expressing IL-1{beta}. To further characterize the differential plasticity of cortical and spinal microglial heterogeneity, we determined the microglial transcriptomes from HIV-1 gp 120 transgenic (Tg) mice, a model of HIV-associated neurological disorders. Compared with wild-type (Wt) cortical microglia, the gp120Tg cortical microglia had three new subtypes, with signatures of interferon I response (INF-M), cell proliferation (PLF-M), and myelination or demyelination (MYE-M) respectively; while INF-M and PLF-M subtypes presented at all ages, the MYE-M only at 4-month. In contrast, only the INF-M subtype was observed in the spinal microglia from 2- and 4-month gp120tg mice. Bioinformatic analysis of regulated molecular pathways of individual microglial subtypes indicated that gp120 more severely impaired the biological function of microglia in cortices than in the spinal cord. The results collectively reveal differential heterogeneity and plasticity of cortical and spinal microglia, and suggest functional differentiation of microglia in different CNS compartments.",

    "abstract": "Selective attention is necessary to sift through, form a coherent percept of, and make behavioral decisions on the vast amount of information present in most sensory environments. How and where selective attention is employed in cortex and how this perceptual information then informs the relevant behavioral decisions is still not well understood. Studies probing selective attention and decision making in visual cortex have been enlightening as to how sensory attention might work in that modality; whether or not similar mechanisms are employed in auditory attention is not yet clear. Therefore, we trained rhesus macaques on a feature selective attention task, where they switched between reporting changes in temporal (amplitude modulation, AM) and spectral (carrier bandwidth) features of a broadband noise stimulus. We investigated how the encoding of these features by single neurons in primary (A1) and secondary (lateral belt, ML) auditory cortex were affected by the different attention conditions. We found that neurons in A1 and ML showed mixed-selectivity to the sound and task features. We found no difference in AM encoding between the attention conditions. We found that choice-related activity in both A1 and ML neurons shifts between attentional conditions. This finding suggests that choice-related activity in auditory cortex does not simply reflect motor preparation or action, and supports the relationship between reported choice-related activity and the decision and perceptual process.\n\nNew & NoteworthyWe recorded from primary and secondary auditory cortex while monkeys performed a non-spatial feature attention task. Both areas exhibited rate-based choice-related activity. The manifestation of choice-related activity was attention-dependent, suggesting that choice-related activity in auditory cortex does not simply reflect arousal or motor influences, but relates to the specific perceptual choice. The lack of temporal-based choice activity is consistent with growing evidence that subcortical, but not cortical, single neurons inform decisions through temporal envelope following.",

    "abstract": "Commercial and customized microarrays are valuable tools for the analysis of holistic expression patterns, but require the integration of the latest genomic information. This study provides a comprehensive workflow implemented in an R package (rePROBE) to assign the entire probes and to annotate the probe sets based on up-to-date genomic and transcriptomic information. The rePROBE R package is freely available at https://github.com/friederhadlich/rePROBE. It can be applied to available gene expression microarray platforms and addresses both public and custom databases. The revised probe assignment and updated probe-set annotation were applied to commercial microarrays available for different livestock species, i.e. ChiGene-1_0-st (Gallus gallus, 443,579 probes; 18,530 probe sets), PorGene-1_1-st (Sus scrofa, 592,005; 25,779) and BovGene-1_0-st (Bos taurus, 530,717; 24,759) as well as human (Homo sapiens, HuGene-1_0-st) and mouse (Mus musculus, HT_MG-430_PM) microarrays. Using current specie-specific transcriptomic information (RefSeq, Ensembl and partially non-redundant nucleotide sequences) and genomic information, the applied workflow revealed 297,574 probes for chickens (pig: 384,715; cattle: 363,077; human: 481,168; mouse: 324,942) assigned to 15,689 probe sets (pig: 21,673; cattle: 21,238; human: 23,495; mouse: 32,494). These are representative of 12,641 unique genes that were both annotated and positioned (pig: 15,758; cattle: 18,046; human: 20,167; mouse: 16,335). Additionally, the workflow collects information on the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within respective targeted genomic regions and thus provides a detailed basis for comprehensive analyses such as quantitative trait locus (eQTL) expression studies to identify quantitative and functional traits.",

Frequently applied pipelines involve the alignment of sequence reads against a reference sequence and the identification of sequence variants. Since most benchmarking studies of bioinformatics tools for this purpose have been conducted on human datasets, there is a lack of benchmarking studies in plant sciences. In this study, we evaluated the performance of 50 different variant calling pipelines, including five read mappers and ten variant callers, on six real plant datasets of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Sets of variants were evaluated based on various parameters including sensitivity and specificity. We found that all investigated tools are suitable for analysis of NGS data in plant research. When looking at different performance metrices, BWA-MEM and Novoalign were the best mappers and GATK returned the best results in the variant calling step.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial and stromal tissue are components of the tumor microenvironment and play a major role in tumor initiation and progression. Distinguishing stroma from epithelial tissues is critically important for spatial characterization of the tumor microenvironment. We propose an image analysis pipeline based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify epithelial and stromal regions in whole-slide images. The CNN model was trained using well-annotated breast cancer tissue microarrays and validated with images from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Our model achieves a classification accuracy of 91.02%, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Using this model, we generated pixel-level epithelial/stromal tissue maps for 1,000 TCGA breast cancer slide images that are paired with gene expression data. We subsequently estimated the epithelial and stromal ratios and performed correlation analysis to model the relationship between gene expression and tissue ratios. Gene Ontology enrichment analyses of genes that were highly correlated with tissue ratios suggest the same tissue was associated with similar biological processes in different breast cancer subtypes, whereas each subtype had its own idiosyncratic biological processes governing the development of these tissues. Taken all together, our approach can lead to new insights in exploring relationships between image-based phenotypes and their underlying genomic data and biological processes for all types of solid tumors.",

New cultivars are released based on the identification of interesting traits, and for sugarcane, brown rust resistance is a desirable characteristic due to the large economic impact of the disease. Although marker-assisted selection for rust resistance has been successful, the genes involved are still unknown, and the associated regions vary among cultivars, thus restricting methodological generalization. We used genotyping by sequencing of full-sib progeny to relate genomic regions with brown rust phenotypes. We established a pipeline to identify reliable SNPs in complex polyploid data, which were used for phenotypic prediction via machine learning. We identified 14,540 SNPs, which led to a mean prediction accuracy of 50% by using different models. We also tested feature selection algorithms to increase predictive accuracy, resulting in a reduced dataset with more explanatory power for rust phenotypes. Using different feature selection techniques, we achieved accuracy of up to 95% with a dataset of 131 SNPs related to brown rust QTL regions and auxiliary genes. Therefore, our novel strategy has the potential to assist studies of the genomic organization of brown rust resistance in sugarcane.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages (M{Phi}s) display remarkable plasticity and the ability to activate diverse responses to a host of intracellular and external stimuli. Despite extensive characterization of M1 M{Phi}s and a broad set of M2 M{Phi}s, comprehensive characterization of metabolic shifts driving M{Phi} activation remains. Herein, we utilized an ex vivo model to produce six M{Phi} functional phenotypes. Isolated CD14+ PBMCs were differentiated into resting M0 M{Phi}s, and then polarized into M1 (IFN-{gamma}/LPS), M2a (IL-4/IL-13), M2b (IC/LPS), M2c (IL-10), and M2d (IL-6/LIF) M{Phi}s. The M{Phi}s were profiled using a bioanalyte matrix of four cell surface markers, [~]50 secreted proteins, [~]800 expressed myeloid genes, and [~]450 identified metabolites relative to M0 M{Phi}s. Signal protein and expressed gene profiles grouped the M{Phi}s into inflammatory (M1 and M2b) and wound resolution (M2a, M2c, and M2d) phenotypes; however, each had a unique metabolic profile. While both M1 and M2b M{Phi}s shared metabotype profiles consistent with an inflammatory signature; key differences were observed in the TCA cycle, FAO and OXPHOS. Additionally, M2a, M2c and M2d M{Phi}s all profiled as tissue repair M{Phi}s; however, metabotype differences were observed in multiple pathways including hexosamine, polyamine, and fatty acid metabolism. These metabolic and other key functional distinctions suggest phagocytic and proliferative functions for M2a M{Phi}s, and angiogenesis and ECM assembly capabilities for M2b, M2c and M2d M{Phi}s. By integrating metabolomics into a systems analysis of M{Phi} phenotypes, we provide the most comprehensive map of M{Phi} diversity to date, along with the global metabolic shifts driving M{Phi} functional plasticity in these phenotypes.\n\nSummary SentenceMacrophage functional plasticity of six macrophage phenotypes correlates with unique distinctions in cell-surface marker expression, signal protein secretion, transcriptomics profiles, and metabolic processes.",

    "abstract": "Programmed death of infected cells is used by multicellular organisms to counter viral infections. Sheeppoxvirus encodes for SPPV14, a potent inhibitor of Bcl-2 mediated apoptosis. We reveal the structural basis of apoptosis inhibition by determining crystal structures of SPPV14 bound to BH3 motifs of proapoptotic Bax and Hrk. The structures show that SPPV14 engages BH3 peptides using the canonical ligand binding groove. Unexpectedly, Arg84 from SPPV14 forms an ionic interaction with the conserved Asp in the BH3 motif in a manner that replaces the canonical ionic interaction seen in almost all host Bcl-2:BH3 motif complexes. These results reveal the flexibility of virus encoded Bcl-2 proteins to mimic key interactions from endogenous host signalling pathways to retain BH3-binding and pro-survival functionality.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are linked to each other by direct reciprocal connections and by numerous pathways that traverse other areas. The nature of the functional coordination mediated by the interconnecting pathways is not well understood. To cast light on this issue, we simultaneously monitored neuronal activity in DLPFC (areas FEF and 8a) and PPC (areas LIP and 7a) while monkeys performed a memory guided saccade task. On measuring the spike-count correlation, a measure of the tendency for firing rates to covary across trials, we found that the DLPFC-PPC correlation became negative at the time of the saccade if and only if the neurons had matching spatial preferences and the target was at their mutually preferred location. The push-pull coordination underlying the negative spike-count correlation may help to ensure that saccadic commands emanating from DLPFC and PPC sum a constant value.\n\nSO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOWAnatomical pathways linking cortical areas that mediate executive control are thought to mediate coordination between them. We know very little, however, about the principles that govern this coordination. In the present study, we addressed this issue by recording simultaneously from neuronal populations in prefrontal and parietal cortex while monkeys performed memory guided saccades. We found a clear sign of coordination. Prefrontal and parietal neurons encoding a given saccade engage in a push-pull interaction during its execution. If parietal neurons are more active, prefrontal neurons are less active and vice versa. We suggest that this is a manifestation of a general principle whereby commands emanating from DLPFC and PPC are coordinated so as to sum a constant value.",

The EV71 virus poses serious threats to human health, particularly in regions of Southeast Asia, and no FDA approved drugs or vaccines are available. We first screened an RNA-biased small molecule library using a peptide-displacement assay to identify ligands for the stem loop II structure of the EV71 internal ribosomal entry site, which was previously shown to impact viral translation and replication. One ligand, DMA-135, decreased viral translation and replication in cell-based studies in a dose-dependent manner with no significant toxicity. Structural, biophysical, and biochemical characterization support an allosteric mechanism in which DMA-135 induces a conformational change in the RNA structure that stabilizes a ternary complex with the AUF1 protein that then represses translation. This mechanism was further supported by pull-down experiments in cell culture. These detailed studies establish enterovirus RNA structures as promising drug targets while revealing an approach and mechanism of action that should be broadly applicable to functional RNA targeting.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, which fosters a dysfunctional neuron-microglia-astrocyte crosstalk that, in turn, maintains microglial cells into a perniciously reactive state that often enhance neuronal damage. The molecular components that mediate this critical communication are however not fully explored. Here, we have asked whether Secreted-Frizzled-Related-Protein-1 (SFRP1), a multifunctional regulator of cell-to-cell communication, is part of the cellular crosstalk underlying neuroinflammation. We show that in mouse models of acute and chronic neuroinflammation, astrocyte-derived SFRP1 is sufficient to promote and sustain microglial activation, and thus a chronic inflammatory state. SFRP1 allows the upregulation of components of Hypoxia Induced Factors-dependent inflammatory pathway and, to a lower extent, of those downstream of the Nuclear Factor-kappaB. We thus propose that SFRP1 acts as a critical astrocyte to microglia amplifier of neuroinflammation, representing a potential valuable therapeutic target for counteracting the harmful effect of chronic inflammation present in several neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "While gene or genome duplications have provided raw genetic materials for evolutionary innovations, these events have also generated massive duplicate genes, resulting in a tremendous increase to the genetic robustness of organism. Duplicate compensation indicate functional redundancies generated by gene duplications, which are widespread in all known genomes. However, the fitness trade-offs of their mutational compensation (genetic robustness) and their role in evolutionary innovation remains largely obscure. In this paper, we discuss how we can utilize the mathematical modeling approach to predicting under which condition duplicate compensation may occur. After a critical review for the models about expression dosage, compensation, and long-term survival of duplicate genes, we highlight the importance to distinguish between Function (F)-triggered and Expression (E)-triggered mechanism of duplicate compensation. Moreover, we address three fundamental questions: (i) Why a backup duplicate can be effectively activated by any silence mutation of the dominant duplicate, but hardly by any coding mutation resulting in impaired protein function? (ii) Why a dispensable duplicate gene, i.e., knockout leads to virtually no phenotype, still remains a great deal of selective constraints in the coding region? And (iii) under which condition expression subfunctionalization between duplicates is reversible (dosage-sharing) or irreversible (long-term survival)?",

Here we present a probabilistic-graphical-model framework, CRF_ID, based on Conditional Random Fields, for unbiased and automated cell identification. CRF_ID focuses on maximizing intrinsic similarity between shapes. Compared to existing methods, CRF_ID achieves higher accuracy on simulated and ground-truth experimental datasets, and better robustness against challenging noise conditions common in experimental data. CRF_ID can further boost accuracy by building atlases from annotated data in highly computationally efficient manner, and by easily adding new features (e.g. from new strains). We demonstrate cell annotation in C. elegans images across strains, animal orientations, and tasks including gene-expression localization, multi-cellular and whole-brain functional imaging experiments. Together, these successes demonstrate that unbiased cell annotation can facilitate biological discovery, and this approach may be valuable to annotation tasks for other systems.",

    "abstract": "Music-based interventions have become increasingly widely adopted for dementia and related disorders. Previous research shows that music engages reward-related regions through functional connectivity with the auditory system. Here we characterize intrinsic connectivity of the auditory and reward systems in healthy aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) - a predementia phase of cognitive dysfunction, and Alzheimers disease (AD). Using resting-state fMRI data from the Alzheimers Database Neuroimaging Initiative, we tested functional connectivity within and between auditory and reward systems in older adults with MCI, AD, and age-matched healthy controls (N=105). Seed-based correlations were assessed from regions of interest (ROIs) in the auditory network, i.e. anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG), posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), Heschls Gyrus, and reward network (i.e., nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, and orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]). AD individuals were lower in both within-network and between-network functional connectivity in the auditory network and reward networks compared to MCI and healthy controls. Furthermore, graph theory analyses showed that MCI individuals had higher clustering, local efficiency, degrees, and strengths than both AD individuals and healthy controls. Together, the auditory and reward systems show preserved within- and between-network connectivity in MCI relative to AD. These results suggest that music-based interventions have the potential to make an early difference in individuals with MCI, due to the preservation of functional connectivity in reward-related regions and between auditory and reward networks at that initial stage of neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Many details of glucose-stimulated intracellular calcium changes in beta cells during activation, activity and deactivation, as well as their concentration-dependence, remain to be described. Classical physiological experiments indicated that in islets functional differences between individual cells are largely attenuated, but recent findings suggest considerable intercellular heterogeneity, with some cells possibly coordinating the collective responses. To address the above with an emphasis on heterogeneity and describing the relations between classical physiological and functional network properties, we performed functional multicellular calcium imaging in mouse pancreas tissue slices over a wide range of glucose concentrations. During activation, delays to activation of cells and first responder-any cell delays shortened, and the sizes of simultaneously responding clusters increased with increasing glucose. Exactly the opposite characterized deactivation. The frequency of fast calcium oscillations during activity increased with increasing glucose up to 12 mM glucose, beyond which oscillation duration became longer, resulting in a homogenous increase in active time. In terms of functional connectivity, islets progressed from a very segregated network to a single large functional unit with increasing glucose. A comparison between classical physiological and network parameters revealed that the first-responders during activation had longer active times during plateau and the most active cells during the plateau tended to deactivate later. Cells with the most functional connections tended to activate sooner, have longer active times, and deactivate later. Our findings provide a common ground for recent differing views on beta cell heterogeneity and an important baseline for future studies of stimulus-secretion and intercellular coupling.",

    "abstract": "GMCSF is an immunomodulatory cytokine that is harnessed as a therapeutic. GMCSF is known to interact with other clinically important molecules, such as heparin, suggesting that endogenous and administered GMCSF has the potential to modulate orthogonal treatment outcomes. Thus, molecular level characterization of GMCSF and its interactions with other biologically active compounds is critical to understanding these mechanisms and predicting clinical outcomes. Here, we dissect the molecular motions and structural contributions that facilitate the GMCSF-heparin interaction, previously shown to be pH-dependent, using NMR spectroscopy, SPR, and molecular docking. We find that GMCSF and heparin binding is related to a change in flexibility reflected in the dynamic profile of GMCSF at acidic pH. The molecular motions driving this interaction largely occur on the ms-{micro}s timescale. Interestingly, we find that GMCSF and heparin binding is not only pH-dependent but is also heparin chain length dependent. We propose a mechanism where a positive binding pocket that is not fully solvent accessible at neutral pH becomes more accessible at acidic pH, allowing heparin to dock with the protein.",

An important mechano-chemical-transducer is the actin cytoskeleton. In fact, previous studies have shown that actin cross-linkers, such as -actinin-4, exhibit mechanosensitive properties in its binding dynamics to actin polymers. However, to date, a quantitative analysis of tension-dependent binding dynamics in live cells is lacking. Here, we present a new technique that allows to quantitatively characterize the dependence of cross-linking lifetime of actin cross-linkers on mechanical tension in the actin cortex of live cells. We use an approach that combines parallel plate confinement of round cells, fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching, and a mathematical mean-field model of cross-linker binding. We apply our approach to the actin cross-linker -actinin-4 and show that the cross-linking time of -actinin-4 homodimers increases approximately twofold within the cellular range of cortical mechanical tension rendering -actinin-4 a catch bond in physiological tension ranges.",

    "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a eukaryotic subcellular organelle composed of tubules and sheet-like areas of membrane connected at junctions. The tubule network is highly dynamic and undergoes rapid and continual rearrangement. There are currently few tools to evaluate network organisation and dynamics. We quantified ER network organisation in Vero and MRC5 cells, and developed a classification system for ER dynamics in live cells. The persistence length, tubule length, junction coordination number and angles of the network were quantified. Hallmarks of imbalances in ER tension, indications of interactions with microtubules and other subcellular organelles, and active reorganisation and dynamics were observed. Live cell ER tubule dynamics were classified using a Gaussian mixture model, defining tubule motion as active or thermal and conformational phase space analysis allowed this classification to be refined by tubule curvature states.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a subcellular organelle, is an underexplored real-world example of active matter. Many processes essential to cell survival are performed by the ER, the efficacy of which may depend on its organisation and dynamics. Abnormal ER morphology is linked to diseases such as hereditary spastic paraplegias and it is possible that the dynamics are also implicated. Therefore, analysing the ER network in normal cells is important for the understanding of disease-related alterations. In this work, we outline the first thorough quantification methods for determining ER organisation and dynamics, deducing that tubule motion has a binary classification as active or thermal. Active reorganisation and dynamics along with indications of tension imbalances and membrane contact sites were observed.",

    "abstract": "Only little is known about the effect of stress (both short-term and long-term) on wildlife species. To get an idea of stress in wildlife, we investigated the cortisol level of wild boar during drive hunts in Lower Saxony, Germany. Cortisol as one of the main stress hormone in mammals is considered to have negative impacts on the animals well-being if expressed excessively (repeatedly over a longer period). We analysed serum cortisol levels of 115 samples using a radioimmunoassay and compared sampling month, hunting grounds, age classes and sexes, as well as possible correlations between cortisol level and weight and pregnancy status of female wild boar. We found that cortisol levels during these drive hunts exhibit wide variation. The mean cortisol level was 411.16 nmol/L with levels ranging from 30.60 nmol/L (minimum) to 1,457.92 nmol/L (maximum). Comparing age groups and sexes, we found significant differences between the sexes, with females having a higher cortisol levels than males. After grouping age groups and sexes together, we also found significant differences based on the age-sex group. We found no correlation between cortisol levels and weight, but significantly higher cortisol levels in pregnant females compared to non-pregnant females. No differences were found between sampling months and locations, respectively. These results show the impact of drive hunts on stress in wild boar; nevertheless, this impact of drive hunts as performed in most parts of Central Europe seems to be not as high as imagined. Still, we need more information about cortisol levels and stress in (hunted) wildlife species.",

    "abstract": "Ischaemic Hepatitis (IH) or Hypoxic Hepatitis (HH) also known as centrilobular liver cell necrosis is an acute liver injury characterized by a rapid increase in serum aminotransferase. The liver injury typically results from another underlying medical conditions like cardiac failure, respiratory failure and septic shock in which the liver becomes damaged due to deprivation of either blood or oxygen. IH is a potentially lethal condition which is often preventable if diagnosed properly. Unfortunately, mechanism that causes IH are often not well understood, making it difficult to diagnose or accurately quantify the patterns of related biomakers. In most cases, currently the only way to determine a case of IH (i.e., to diagnose it) is to rule out all other possible conditions for other liver injuries. A better understanding of the livers response to IH is necessary to aid in its diagnosis, measurement and improve outcomes. The goal of this study, is to identify mechanisms that can alter a few associated biomarkers for reducing density of damaged hepatocytes, and thus reduce chances of IH. To this end, we develop a mathematical model capturing dynamics of hepatocytes in the liver through the rise and fall of associated liver enzymes aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) related to condition of IH. The model analysis provides a novel approach to predict the level of biomarkers given variations in the systemic oxygen in the body. Using IH patient data in US, novel model parameters are described and then estimated for the first time to capture real time dynamics of hepatocytes in the presence and absence of IH condition. Different scenarios of patient conditions were also analyzed and validated using empirical information. This study and its results may allow physicians to estimate the extent of liver damage in a IH patient based on their enzyme levels and receive faster treatment on real time basis.",

    "abstract": "The use of chimeric antigen receptor modified-T (CAR-T) cells in adoptive immunotherapy has been popularized through recent success in the field of cancer treatment research. CD4{zeta} CAR, which targets HIV-1-infected cells, has been developed and evaluated in patients. Though well-tolerated for over a decade, efficacy was disappointingly limited. This result encourages us to develop a novel CAR more effective than CD4{zeta} CAR. To quantitatively compare anti-HIV-1 activity of different CAR constructs in a highly sensitive and reproducible manner, we developed a multicolor flow cytometry method for assessing anti-HIV-1 effector T-cell activity. \"Target\" Jurkat cells inducibly expressing an HIV-1HXBC2 envelope protein and \"Non-target\" control cells were genetically labeled with red and blue fluorescent protein, respectively, and co-incubated with human primary T cells transduced with anti-HIV-1 \"Effector\" CARs at various Effector vs Target cell ratios. Absolute cell numbers of each population were collected by MACSQuant Analyzer and used for calculation of relative cytotoxicity. We successfully ranked the cytotoxicity of three previously reported single chain-antibody CARs and six newly developed single-domain antibody CARs in comparison to CD4{zeta} CAR. Interestingly, three CARs--10E8, 2E7, and 2H10--which demonstrate high cytotoxic activity were all known to target the membrane-proximal external region. Use of this novel assay will simplify assessment of new CAR constructs and in turn accelerate the development of new effective CARs against HIV-1.\n\nAuthor SummaryAdoptive immunotherapies that utilize autologous T cells expressing a desired antigen-specific CAR aim to elicit directed immune responses. In recent years, CAR immunotherapies have been promoted extensively in B cell malignancy treatments. The HIV-1-targeting CAR, known as CD4{zeta}, was developed over 20 years ago and has been widely and longitudinally tested in patients. However, its effectiveness was hindered by poor survival and functionality of the transduced cells. To conduct quantitative evaluation of newly designed anti-HIV-1 CARs, we developed a novel multicolor flow-based assay for HIV-1-specific cytotoxicity, enabling sensitive and quantitative assessment in a high-throughput fashion. This assay would be also useful in screening HIV-1-targeting immune receptors--including CARs and T cell receptors--and other immunotherapeutic drugs such as anti-HIV-1 antibodies.",

    "abstract": "The detection of erythropoietin (Epo) protein by Western blotting has required pre-purification of the sample. We developed a new Western blot method to detect plasma and urinary Epo using deglycosylation. Epo in urine and tissue and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in urine were directly detected by our Western blotting. Plasma Epo and ESAs were detected by our Western blotting after deglycosylation. The broad bands of Epo and ESAs were shifted to 22 kDa by deglycosylation except PEG-bound epoetin {beta} pegol. The 22 kDa band from anemic patient urine was confirmed by Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) to contain human Epo.\n\nSever hypoxia (7% O2, 4 hr) caused a 400-fold increase in deglycosylated Epo expression in rat kidneys, which is consistent with the increases in both Epo gene expression and plasma Epo concentration. Immunohistochemistry showed Epo expression in nephrons but not in interstitial cells under control conditions, and hypoxia increased Epo expression in interstitial cells but not in tubules.\n\nThese data show that intrinsic Epo and all ESAs can be detected by Western blot either directly in urine or after deglycosylation in blood, and that the kidney is the main and sole site of Epo production in control and severe hypoxia. Our method will completely change Epo doping and detection.",

    "abstract": "Syndecan-1 (Sdc-1) is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that can bind cytokines and chemokines via its heparan sulfate side chains, and has immunomodulatory properties in experimental models. Sdc-1 expression has been reported on dendritic cells (DC) and T cells. The potential role of Sdc-1 in DC - T cell interaction has not been investigated yet. We postulate that Sdc-1 is involved in DC - T cell interaction and may influence graft survival in an allogeneic transplant model.\n\nSdc-1 expression on bone marrow-derived DC and T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Unstimulated and LPS stimulated Sdc-1 deficient DC were evaluated in vitro for phenotype and stimulatory capacity in mixed lymphocyte reaction. Sdc-1 deficient T cells were evaluated for proliferative capacity and differentiation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction and a proliferation assay. Allograft survival was evaluated in a fully MHC mismatched heterotopic heart transplant model, with either Sdc-1 deficient donors or recipients.\n\nSdc-1 is expressed on the cell surface of unstimulated and LPS matured DC. Sdc-1 deficiency had no effect on expression of co-stimulatory molecules, cytokine production or T cell stimulatory capacity as compared to WT DC. Sdc-1 expression was not detectable on WT T cells, although intracellular Sdc-1 expression could be demonstrated after ConA activation. Sdc-1 deficient T cells showed reduced proliferation upon DC or ConA stimulation and reduced IL-17 production upon ConA stimulation, compared to WT T cells. Sdc-1 deficiency of either allograft or recipient did not prolong allograft survival.\n\nIn conclusion, Sdc-1 is expressed on the cell surface of DC, where its absence does not affect DC phenotype or T cell stimulatory capacity. Sdc-1 is intracellularly expressed in ConA activated T cells. Sdc-1 deficiency in T cells results in a reduced proliferative response in vitro, as induced by DC and ConA. Sdc-1 deficiency in donor or recipient does not affect allograft survival.",

    "abstract": "Striatin, a subunit of the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A, is a core member of the conserved striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. The protein is expressed in the cell junctions between epithelial cells, which play a role in maintaining cell-cell junctional integrity. Since adhesion is crucial for the function of the mammalian inner ear, we examined the localization and function of striatin in the mouse cochlea. Our results show that in neonatal mice, striatin is specifically expressed in the cell-cell junctions of the inner hair cells, the receptor cells in the mammalian cochlea. Auditory brainstem response measurements of striatin-deficient mice indicated a progressive, high-frequency hearing loss, suggesting that striatin is essential for normal hearing. Moreover, scanning electron micrographs of the organ of Corti revealed a moderate degeneration of the outer hair cells in the middle and basal regions, concordant with the high-frequency hearing loss. Importantly, striatin-deficient mice show aberrant ribbon synapse maturation that may lead to the observed auditory impairment. Together, these results suggest a novel function for striatin in the mammalian auditory system.",

    "abstract": "Neocortical heterotopia consist of ectopic neuronal clusters that are frequently found in individuals with cognitive disability and epilepsy. However, their pathogenesis remains poorly understood due in part to a lack of tractable animal models. We have developed an inducible model of focal heterotopia that enables their precise spatiotemporal control and high-resolution optical imaging in live mice. Here we report that heterotopia are associated with striking patterns of hypermyelinated and circumferentially projecting axons around neuronal clusters. Despite their aberrant axonal patterns, in vivo calcium imaging revealed that heterotopic neurons remain functionally connected to other brain regions, highlighting their potential to influence global neural networks. These aberrant patterns only form when heterotopia are induced during a critical embryonic temporal window, but not in early postnatal development. Our model provides a new way to investigate heterotopia formation in vivo and revealed features suggesting the existence of developmentally-modulated, neuron-derived axon guidance and myelination factors.",
