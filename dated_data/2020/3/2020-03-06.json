    "abstract": "The epidemiological importance of bacteria from the genus Mycobacterium is indisputable and the necessity to find new molecules that can inhibit their growth is urgent. The shikimate pathway, required for the synthesis of important metabolites in bacteria, represents a target for inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth. The aroA-encoded 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) enzyme catalyzes the sixth step of the shikimate pathway. In this study, we combined gene knockout, gene knockdown and kinetic assays to evaluate aroA gene essentiality and the vulnerability of its protein product, EPSPS synthase from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsEPSPS), under different nutritional conditions. We demonstrate by an allelic exchange-based gene knockout approach the essentiality of MsEPSPS under rich and poor nutritional conditions. By performing gene complementation experiments with wild-type (WT) and point mutant versions of aroA gene, together with kinetic assays using WT and mutant recombinant proteins, we show that aroA gene essentiality depends on MsEPSPS activity. To evaluate MsEPSPS vulnerability, we performed gene knockdown experiments using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats interference (CRISPRi) system. The experiments were performed in both rich and defined (poor) media, using three different repression forces for aroA gene. We only observed growth impairment when bacteria were grown in defined medium without supplementation of aromatic amino acids, thereby indicating that MsEPSPS vulnerability depends on the environment conditions.\n\nImportanceWe evaluated both gene essentiality and target vulnerability of the enzyme that catalyzes the sixth step of the shikimate pathway, the aroA-encoded 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsEPSPS). Combining gene knockout experiments and kinetic assays, we established a causal link between aroA gene essentiality and the biological function of EPSPS protein, which we advocate is an indispensable step for target validation. Moreover, we characterized MsEPSPS vulnerability under different nutritional conditions and found it is a vulnerable target only when M. smegmatis is grown under poor nutritional conditions without supplementation with aromatic amino acids. Based on our findings, we suggest that gene essentiality information should be obtained from gene knockout experiments and not knockdown approaches, as even low levels of a protein after gene silencing can lead to a different growth phenotype when compared to that under its complete absence, as was the case with aroA and MsEPSPS in our study.",

    "abstract": "Gain-of-function (GOF) variants in K+ channels cause severe childhood epilepsies, but there are no mechanisms to explain how increased K+ currents lead to network hyperexcitability. Here, we introduced a human Na+-activated K+ (KNa) channel variant (KCNT1-Y796H) into mice and, using a multiplatform approach, found motor cortex hyperexcitability and early-onset seizures, phenotypes strikingly similar to those of human patients. Although the variant increased KNa currents in cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons, there was a selective increase in the KNa current across subthreshold voltages in inhibitory neurons, particularly in those with non-fast spiking properties, resulting in impaired excitability and AP generation. We further observed evidence of synaptic rewiring associated with hyperexcitable networks, including increases in homotypic synaptic connectivity and the ratio of excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic input. These findings support inhibitory neuron-specific mechanisms in mediating the epileptogenic effects of K+ channel GOF, offering cell-type-specific currents and effects as promising targets for therapeutic intervention.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/978841v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@110d6e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8b63ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14972a9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@106be1c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain with the capacity to autonomously self-renew. Under basal conditions, microglial self-renewal appears to be slow and stochastic, although microglia have the ability to proliferate very rapidly following depletion or in response to injury. Because microglial self-renewal has largely been studied using static tools, the mechanisms and kinetics by which microglia renew and acquire mature characteristics in the adult brain are not well understood. Using chronic in vivo two-photon imaging in awake mice and PLX5622 (Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor) to deplete microglia, we set out to understand the dynamic self-organization and maturation of microglia following depletion in the visual cortex. We confirm that under basal conditions, cortical microglia show limited turnover and migration. Following depletion, however, microglial repopulation is remarkably rapid and is sustained by the dynamic division of the remaining microglia in a manner that is largely independent of signaling through the P2Y12 receptor. Mathematical modeling of microglial division demonstrates that the observed division rates can account for the rapid repopulation observed in vivo. Additionally, newly-born microglia resemble mature microglia, in terms of their morphology, dynamics and ability to respond to injury, within days of repopulation. Our work suggests that microglia rapidly self-renew locally, without the involvement of a special progenitor cell, and that newly born microglia do not recapitulate a slow developmental maturation but instead quickly take on mature roles in the nervous system.\n\nGraphical Abstract(a) Microglial dynamics during control condition. Cartoon depiction of the heterogenous microglia in the visual cortex equally spaced. (b) During the early stages of repopulation, microglia are irregularly spaced and sparse. (c) During the later stages of repopulation, the number of microglia and the spatial distribution return to baseline. (d-f) We then created and ran a mathematical model that sampled the number of microglia, (d) the persistent doublets, (e) the rapid divisions of microglia and (f) the secondary divisions of microglia during the peak of repopulation day 2-day 3. The mathematical model suggested that residual microglia can account for the rapid repopulation we observed in vivo.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=165 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/977553v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e198cborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f6484aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1041083org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d8499a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "We analyzed all four Pex23 family proteins of the yeast Hansenula polymorpha, which localize to the ER. Of these Pex24 and Pex32, but not Pex23 and Pex29, accumulate at peroxisome-ER contacts, where they are important for normal peroxisome biogenesis and proliferation and contribute to organelle positioning and segregation.\n\nUpon deletion of PEX24 and PEX32 - and to a lesser extent of PEX23 and PEX29 - peroxisome-ER contacts are disrupted, concomitant with peroxisomal defects. These defects are suppressed upon introduction of an artificial peroxisome-ER tether.\n\nAccumulation of Pex32 at peroxisomes-ER contacts is lost in the absence of the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex11. At the same time peroxisome-ER contacts are disrupted, indicating that Pex11 contributes to Pex32-dependent peroxisome-ER contact formation.\n\nSummarizing, our data indicate that H. polymorpha Pex24 and Pex32 are tethers at peroxisome-ER contacts that are important for normal peroxisome biogenesis and dynamics.\n\nSummaryTwo Hansenula polymorpha ER proteins, Pex24 and Pex32, are tethers at peroxisome-ER contacts and function together with the peroxisomal protein Pex11. Their absence disturbs these contacts leading to multiple peroxisomal defects, which can be restored by an artificial tether.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols often include a manual search of an optimal location and orientation of the coil or peak stimulating electric field to elicit motor responses in a target muscle. This target search is laborious, and the result is user-dependent. Here, we present a closed-loop search method that utilizes automatic electronic adjustment of the stimulation based on the previous responses. The electronic adjustment is achieved by multi-locus TMS, and the adaptive guiding of the stimulation is based on the principles of Bayesian optimization to minimize the number of stimuli (and time) needed in the search. We compared our target-search method with other methods, such as systematic sampling in a predefined cortical grid. Validation experiments on five healthy volunteers and further offline simulations showed that our adaptively guided search method needs only a relatively small number of stimuli to provide outcomes with good accuracy and precision. The automated method enables fast and user-independent optimization of stimulation parameters in research and clinical applications of TMS.Competing Interest StatementRJI is an advisor and a minority shareholder of Nexstim Plc.

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a pathogen with a unique cell envelope including very long fatty acids, implicated in bacterial resistance and host immune modulation. FasR is a two-domain transcriptional activator that belongs to the TetR family of regulators, and plays a central role in mycobacterial long-chain fatty acyl-CoA sensing and lipid biosynthesis regulation. We now disclose crystal structures of M. tuberculosis FasR in complex with acyl effector ligands and with DNA, uncovering its sensory and switching mechanisms. A long tunnel traverses the entire effector-binding domain, enabling long fatty acyl effectors to bind. Only when the tunnel is entirely occupied, the protein dimer adopts a rigid configuration, with its DNA-binding domains in an open state that leads to DNA dissociation. Structure-guided point-mutations further support this effector-dependent mechanism. The protein-folding hydrophobic core, connecting the two domains, is completed by the effector ligand into a continuous spine, explaining the allosteric flexible-to-ordered transition. The transmission spine is conserved in all TetR-like transcription factors, offering new opportunities for anti-tuberculosis drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Genomic regions subject to purifying selection are more likely to carry disease causing mutations. Cross species conservation is often used to identify such regions but has limited resolution to detect selection on short evolutionary timescales such as that occurring in only one species. In contrast, intolerance looks for depletion of variation relative to expectation within a species, allowing species specific features to be identified. When estimating the intolerance of noncoding sequence methods strongly leverage variant frequency distributions. As the expected distributions depend on demography, if not properly controlled for, ancestral population source may obfuscate signals of selection. We demonstrate that properly incorporating demography in intolerance estimation greatly improved variant classification (13% increase in AUC relative to comparison constraint test, CDTS; and 9% relative to conservation). We provide a genome-wide intolerance map that is conditional on demographic history that is likely to be particularly valuable for variant prioritization.",

We discovered that PML/RAR mediates extensive chromatin interactions genome-wide. Globally, it redefines the chromatin topology of the myeloid genome toward a more condensed configuration in APL cells; locally, it intrudes RNAPII-associated interaction domains, interrupts myeloid-specific transcription factors binding at enhancers and super-enhancers, and leads to transcriptional repression of genes critical for myeloid differentiation and maturation.\n\nConclusionsOur results not only provide novel topological insights for the roles of PML/RAR in transforming myeloid cells into leukemia cells, but further uncover a topological framework of a molecular mechanism for oncogenic fusion proteins in cancers.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been widely used to integrate gene expression and genetic data for studying complex traits. Due to the computational burden, existing TWAS methods do not assess distant trans- expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that are known to explain important expression variation for most genes. We propose a Bayesian Genome-wide TWAS (BGW-TWAS) method which leverages both cis- and trans- eQTL information for TWAS. Our BGW-TWAS method is based on Bayesian variable selection regression, which not only accounts for cis- and trans- eQTL of the target gene but also enables efficient computation by using summary statistics from standard eQTL analyses. Our simulation studies illustrated that BGW-TWAS achieved higher power compared to existing TWAS methods that do not assess trans-eQTL information. We further applied BWG-TWAS to individual-level GWAS data (N=[~]3.3K), which identified significant associations between the genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) of gene ZC3H12B and Alzheimers dementia (AD) (p-value= 5.42 x 10-13), neurofibrillary tangle density (p-value= 1.89 x10-6 ), and global measure of AD pathology (p-value=9.59 x 10-7). These associations for gene ZC3H12B were completely driven by trans-eQTL. Additionally, the GReX of gene KCTD12 was found to be significantly associated with {beta}-amyloid (p-value= 3.44 x10 -8) which was driven by both cis- and trans- eQTL. Four of the top driven trans-eQTL of ZC3H12B are located within gene APOC1, a known major risk gene of AD and blood lipids. Additionally, by applying BGW-TWAS with summary-level GWAS data of AD (N=[~]54K), we identified 13 significant genes including known GWAS risk genes HLA-DRB1 and APOC1, as well as ZC3H12B.",

    "abstract": "Viral infections of bacterial hosts range from highly lytic to lysogenic, where highly lytic viruses undergo viral replication and immediately lyse their hosts, and lysogenic viruses have a latency period before replication and host lysis. While both types of infections are routinely observed in the environment, the ecological and evolutionary processes that regulate these different viral dynamics are still not well understood. In this study, we identify and characterize the long-term dynamics of uncultivated viruses infecting green sulfur bacteria (GSB) in a model freshwater lake sampled from 2005-2018. Because of the additional requirements for the laboratory cultivation of anaerobes like GSB, viruses infecting GSB have yet to be formally identified, leaving their diversity and impact on natural populations of GSB virtually unknown. In this study, we used two approaches to identify viruses infecting GSB; one in vitro based on flow cytometry cell sorting, the other in silico based on CRISPR spacer sequences. We then took advantage of existing bulk metagenomes derived from Trout Bog Lake covering the 2005-2018 period to examine the interactions between GSB hosts and their viruses across multiple years and seasons. From our data, GSB populations in Trout Bog Lake were found to be concurrently infected with at least 2-8 viruses each, many of which were lysogenic viruses; one GSB host population in particular was consistently associated with two lysogens with a nearly 100% infection rate for over 10 years. We illustrate with a theoretical infection model that such an interaction can be stable over multiple years given a low, but persistent level of lysogen induction in host populations with already high infection rates. Overall, our data suggest that single GSB populations are typically infected by multiple viruses at the same time, that lytic and lysogenic viruses can readily co-infect the same host population in the same ecosystem, and that host strain-level diversity might be an important factor controlling the lytic/lysogeny switch.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAbscess formation is a host defense mechanism to contain the spread of infection. Abscesses can affect any part of the body and are common sequelae to complications of trauma, surgery, systemic infections and other disease states. Most models for abscesses are in small animals. Pursuant to the goal of developing more advanced treatments for abscesses, we sought to develop a large animal model which would reasonably mimic a fluid-filled human abscess.\n\nMethodsDomestic swine were inoculated with a bimicrobial mixture of Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) supplemented with an irritant (dextran). Inoculations were performed under ultrasound guidance in the muscle, subcutaneously or intradermally within the same animal. Fourteen days after inoculation, lesions were imaged with ultrasound, resected and prepared for histological evaluation.\n\nResultsInjection of bimicrobial (aerobic and anaerobic) bacterial mixtures at multiple sites in a pig produced multiple lesions with histological features similar to encapsulated and multiloculated/multichamber abscesses often observed clinically in humans. Important salient features include the formation of a connective tissue capsule surrounding histologically nearly amorphous pus.\n\nConclusionsThis paper provides the first description of a pig model for multiloculated abscesses. This animal model could potentially enable the evaluation of new technologies to replace or augment the current standard of care (image-guided percutaneous abscess drainage with antibiotics).",

The molecular events responsible for the relentless growth of cysts are not defined. Thus, identification of novel drivers of ADPKD may lead to new therapies. Ankyrin Repeat and Single KH domain-1 (ANKHD1) controls cancer cell proliferation, yet its role in ADPKD is unexplored. Here, we present the first data that identify ANKHD1 as a driver of proliferative growth in cellular and mouse models of ADPKD. Using the first Ankhd1-deficient mice, we demonstrate that Ankhd1 heterozygosity potently reduces cystic growth and fibrosis, in a genetically orthologous mouse model of ADPKD. We performed transcriptome-wide profiling of patient-derived ADPKD cells with and without ANKHD1 siRNA silencing, revealing a major role for ANKHD1 in the control of cell proliferation and matrix remodelling. We validated the role of ANKHD1 in enhancing proliferation in patient-derived cells. Mechanistically ANKHD1 promotes STAT5 signalling in ADPKD mice. Hence, ANKHD1 is a novel driver of ADPKD, and its inhibition may be of therapeutic benefit.",

    "abstract": "In macaques, the middle lateral auditory cortex (ML) is a belt region adjacent to primary auditory cortex (A1) and believed to be at a hierarchically higher level. Although ML single-unit responses have been studied for several auditory stimuli, the ability of ML cells to encode amplitude modulation (AM) - an ability which has been widely studied in A1 - has not yet been characterized. Here we compare the responses of A1 and ML neurons to amplitude modulated (AM) noise in awake macaques. While several of the basic properties of A1 and ML responses to AM noise are similar, we found several key differences. ML neurons do not phase lock as strongly, are less likely to phase lock, and are more likely to respond in a non-synchronized fashion than A1 cells, consistent with a temporal-to-rate transformation as information ascends the auditory hierarchy. ML neurons tend to have lower temporally (phase-locking) based best modulation frequencies than A1. At the level of ML, neurons that decrease firing rate with increasing modulation depth become more common than in A1. In both A1 and ML we find a prevalent class of neurons with excitatory rate responses at lower modulation frequencies and suppressed rate responses relative to the unmodulated carrier at middle modulation frequencies.",

    "abstract": "Feeding is at once both a basic biological need and a function set in a complex system of competing motivational drivers. Orexin/hypocretin neurons are located exclusively within the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and are commonly implicated in feeding, arousal, and motivated behavior, although largely based on studies employing long-term systemic manipulations. Here we show how orexin neurons in freely behaving mice respond in real time to food presentations, and how this response is modulated by differences in metabolic state and salience. Orexin neurons increased activity during approach to food, and this activity declined to baseline at the start of consummatory behavior. Furthermore, the activity of orexin neurons on approach was enhanced by manipulations of metabolic state, and increased food salience. We investigated the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) as a candidate afferent region to inhibit LH orexin neurons following approach, and using projection and cell type-specific electrophysiology, demonstrated that the NAcSh forms both direct and indirect inhibitory projections to LH orexin cells. Together these findings reveal that the activity of orexin neurons is associated with food approach rather than consumption, is modulated by motivationally relevant factors, and that the NAcSh-LH pathway is capable of suppressing orexin cell recruitment.",

    "abstract": "The nervous activity of the brain takes place in higher-dimensional functional spaces. Indeed, recent claims advocate that the brain might be equipped with a phase space displaying four spatial dimensions plus time, instead of the classical three plus time. This suggests the possibility to investigate global visualization methods for exploiting four-dimensional maps of real experimental data sets. Here we asked whether, starting from the conventional neuro-data available in three dimensions plus time, it is feasible to find an operational procedure to describe the corresponding four-dimensional trajectories. In particular, we used quaternion orthographic projections for the assessment of electroencephalographic traces (EEG) from scalp locations. This approach makes it possible to map three-dimensional EEG traces to the surface of a four-dimensional hypersphere, which has an important advantage, since quaternionic networks make it feasible to enlighten temporally far apart nervous trajectories equipped with the same features, such as the same frequency or amplitude of electric oscillations. This leads to an incisive operational assessment of symmetries, dualities and matching descriptions hidden in the very structure of complex neuro-data signals.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMedial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy is an important morphological marker of many dementias and is closely related to cognitive decline. In this study we aimed to characterize longitudinal progression of MTL atrophy in 93 individuals with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment followed up over six years, and to assess if clinical rating scales are able to detect these changes. All MRI images were visually rated according to Scheltens scale of medial temporal atrophy (MTA) by two neuroradiologists and AVRA, a software for automated MTA ratings. The images were also segmented using FreeSurfers longitudinal pipeline in order to compare the MTA ratings to volumes of the hippocampi and inferior lateral ventricles. We found that MTL atrophy rates increased with CSF biomarker abnormality, used to define preclinical stages of Alzheimers Disease. Both AVRAs and the radiologists MTA ratings showed a similar longitudinal trajectory as the subcortical volumes, suggesting that visual rating scales provide a valid alternative to automatic segmentations. While the MTA scores from each radiologist showed strong correlations to subcortical volumes, the inter-rater agreement was low. We conclude that the main limitation of quantifying MTL atrophy with visual ratings in clinics is the subjectiveness of the assessment.",

Although a role of TRPA1 in mammalian mechanosensory transduction in vivo seems likely, it remains to be shown that TRPA1 has the inherent capability to respond to mechanical stimuli. Here we have used the patch-clamp technique to study the response of human purified TRPA1 (hTRPA1), reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayers, to changes in bilayer pressure. We report that hTRPA1 responded with increased single-channel open probability (Po) within the applied pressure interval of 7.5 to 60 mmHg with a half maximum Po (P50) value of 38.0 {+/-} 2.3 mmHg. The Po value reached a maximum close to 1 (0.87 {+/-} 0.02) at 60 mmHg. Within the same pressure interval, hTRPA1 without its N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain ({Delta}1-688 hTRPA1) responded fully opened (0.99 {+/-} 0.01) at 60 mmHg and with a P50 value of 39.0 {+/-} 1.1 mmHg. The pressure-evoked responses of hTRPA1 and {Delta}1-688 hTRPA1 at 45 mmHg were inhibited by the TRPA1 antagonist HC030031, and the activity of purified hTRPA1 at 45 mmHg was abolished by the thiol reducing agent tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). In conclusion, hTRPA1 is an inherent mechanosensitive ion channel gated by force-from-lipids. The hTRPA1 mechanosensitivity is dependent on the redox environment, and it is suggested that oxidative stress shifts hTRPA1 into a protein conformation sensitive to mechanical stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Pneumonia is the leading cause of infectious related death costing 12 billion dollars annually in the United States alone. Despite improvements in clinical care, total mortality remains around 4%, with inpatient mortality reaching 5-10%. For unknown reasons, mortality risk remains high even after hospital discharge and there is a need to identify those patients most at risk. Also of importance, clinical symptoms alone do not distinguish viral from bacterial infection which may delay appropriate treatment and may contribute to short-term and long-term mortality. Biomarkers have the potential to provide point of care diagnosis, identify high-risk patients, and increase our understanding of the biology of disease. However, there have been mixed results on the diagnostic performance of many of the analytes tested to date. Urine represents a largely untapped source for biomarker discovery and is highly accessible. To test this hypothesis, we collected urine from hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and performed a comprehensive screen for urinary tract microbiota signatures, metabolite, and cytokine profiles. CAP patients were diagnosed with influenza or bacterial (S. aureus and S. pneumoniae) etiologies and compared with healthy volunteers. Microbiome signatures showed marked shifts in taxonomic levels in patients with bacterial etiology versus influenza and CAP versus normal. Predictive modeling of 291 microbial and metabolite values achieved a +90% accuracy with LASSO in predicting specific pneumonia etiology. This study demonstrates that urine from patients hospitalized with pneumonia may serve as a reliable and accessible sample to evaluate biomarkers that may diagnose etiology and predict clinical outcomes.\n\nAuthor SummaryUrine has been classically considered sterile since most microorganisms are not readily culturable under healthy circumstances. Further, many pneumonia patients are immediately placed on antibiotics rendering culture-based techniques useless. However, the advent of next generation sequencing has enabled unprecedented analysis of the microbial communities - living or detected as free DNA - found in many niches of the human body. Here, we describe a urine microbiome as well as metabolites and cytokines measured in patients newly admitted to the hospital diagnosed with influenza or bacterial (S. aureus and S. pneumoniae) infection pneumonia, compared with healthy controls. Using these parameters alone, we were able to achieve high success in predicting patient pneumonia. This study provides a proof of concept that urine samples, which are easily accessible in outpatient and inpatient settings, could provide additional diagnostic insights to patient infectious status and future risk factor for complication.",

However, it remains unclear if age-related changes in progenitors persist across a differentiation trajectory or if new age-related changes manifest in differentiated cells. To investigate this possibility, we performed single cell RNA-seq on muscle mononuclear cells from young and aged mice and profiled muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and fibro/adipose progenitors (FAPs) after differentiation. Differentiation increased the magnitude of age-related change in MuSCs and FAPs, but also masked a subset of age-related changes present in progenitors. Using a dynamical systems approach and RNA velocity, we found that aged MuSCs follow the same differentiation trajectory as young cells, but stall in differentiation near a commitment decision. Our results suggest that age-related changes are plastic across differentiation trajectories and that fate commitment decisions are delayed in aged myogenic cells.",

    "abstract": "Multi-component systems often exhibit dynamics of a high degree of complexity, rendering it difficult to assess whether a proposed models description is adequate. For the multitude of systems that allow for a symbolic encoding, we provide a symbolic-dynamics based entropy measure that quantifies the degree of deviation obtained by a systemss internal dynamics from random dynamics using identical average symbol probabilities. We apply this measure to several well-studied theoretical models and show its ability to characterize differences in internal dynamics, thus providing a means to accurately compare model and experiment. Data from neuronal cultures on a multi-electrode array chip validate the usefulness of our approach, revealing inadequacies of existing models and providing guidelines for their improvement. We propose our measure to be systematically used to develop future models and simulations.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir populations of wild or domestic animals is essential for the effective deployment of interventions such as wildlife vaccination or culling. Due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust, spatially explicit, predictions is challenging. Recent efforts have begun to make progress in this direction by capitalizing on machine learning methodologies. An important weakness of existing approaches, however, is that they generally rely on combining human and reservoir infection data during the training process and thus conflate risk attributable to the prevalence of the pathogen in the reservoir population with the risk attributed to the realized rate of spillover into the human population. Because effective planning of interventions requires that these components of risk be disentangled, we developed a multi-layer machine learning framework that separates these processes. Our approach begins by training models to predict the geographic range of the primary reservoir and the subset of this range in which the pathogen occurs. The spillover risk predicted by the product of these reservoir specific models is then fit to data on realized patterns of historical spillover into the human population. The result is a geographically specific spillover risk forecast that can be easily decomposed and used to guide effective intervention. Applying our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that regularly spills over into the human population across West Africa, results in a model that explains a modest but statistically significant portion of geographic variation in historical patterns of spillover. When combined with a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics, our spillover risk model predicts that 897,700 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year across West Africa, with Nigeria accounting for more than half of these human infections.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe 2019 emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is a grim reminder of the threat animal-borne pathogens pose to human health. Even prior to SARS-CoV-2, the spillover of pathogens from animal reservoirs was a persistent problem, with pathogens such as Ebola, Nipah, and Lassa regularly but unpredictably causing outbreaks. Machine-learning models that anticipate when and where pathogen transmission from animals to humans is likely to occur would help guide surveillance efforts and preemptive countermeasures like information campaigns or vaccination programs. We develop a novel machine learning framework that uses datasets describing the distribution of a virus within its host and the range of its animal host, along with data on spatial patterns of human immunity, to infer rates of animal-to-human transmission across a region. By training the model on data from the animal host alone, our framework allows rigorous validation of spillover predictions using human data. We apply our framework to Lassa fever, a viral disease of West Africa that is spread to humans by rodents, and use the predictions to update estimates of Lassa virus infections in humans. Our results suggest that Nigeria is most at risk for the emergence of Lassa virus, and should be prioritized for outbreak-surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomics facilitates the study of the genetic information from uncultured microbes and complex microbial communities. Assembling complete microbial genomes (i.e., circular with no misassemblies) from metagenomics data is difficult because most samples have high organismal complexity and strain diversity. Less than 100 circularized bacterial and archaeal genomes have been assembled from metagenomics data despite the thousands of datasets that are available. Circularized genomes are important for (1) building a reference collection as scaffolds for future assemblies, (2) providing complete gene content of a genome, (3) confirming little or no contamination of a genome, (4) studying the genomic context and synteny of genes, and (5) linking protein coding genes to ribosomal RNA genes to aid metabolic inference in 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies. We developed a method to achieve circularized genomes using iterative assembly, binning, and read mapping. In addition, this method exposes potential misassemblies from k-mer based assemblies. We chose species of the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) to focus our initial efforts because they have small genomes and are only known to have one ribosomal RNA operon. We present 34 circular CPR genomes, one circular Margulisbacteria genome, and two circular megaphage genomes from 19 public and published datasets. We demonstrate findings that would likely be difficult without circularizing genomes, including that ribosomal genes are likely not operonic in the majority of CPR, and that some CPR harbor diverged forms of RNase P RNA.

    "abstract": "Hybrid assemblies are highly valuable for studies of Enterobacteriaceae due to their ability to fully resolve the structure of mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids, which are involved in the carriage of clinically important genes (e.g. those involved in AMR/virulence). The widespread application of this technique is currently primarily limited by cost. Recent data has suggested that non-inferior, and even superior, hybrid assemblies can be produced using a fraction of the total output from a multiplexed nanopore (Oxford Nanopore Technologies [ONT]) flowcell run. In this study we sought to determine the optimal minimal running time for flowcells when acquiring reads for hybrid assembly. We then evaluated whether the ONT wash kit might allow users to exploit shorter running times by sequencing multiple libraries per flowcell. After 24 hours of sequencing, most chromosomes and plasmids had circularised and there was no benefit associated with longer running times. Quality was similar at 12 hours suggesting shorter running times are likely to be acceptable for certain applications (e.g. plasmid genomics). The ONT wash kit was highly effective in removing DNA between libraries. Contamination between libraries did not appear to affect subsequent hybrid assemblies, even when the same barcodes were used successively on a single flowcell. Utilising shorter run-times in combination with between-library nuclease washes allows at least 36 Enterobacteriaceae isolates to be sequenced per flowcell, significantly reducing the per isolate sequencing cost. Ultimately this will facilitate large-scale studies utilising hybrid assembly advancing our understanding of the genomics of key human pathogens.\n\nData SummaryO_LIRaw sequencing data is available via NCBI under project accession number PRJNA604975. Sample accession numbers are provided in table S1.\nC_LIO_LIAssemblies are available via Figshare https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11816532.v1.\nC_LI\n\nImpact StatementMost existing sequencing data has been acquired from short-read platforms (eg. Illumina). For some species of bacteria, clinically important genes, such as those involved in antibiotic resistance and/or virulence, are carried on plasmids. Whilst Illumina sequencing is highly accurate, it is generally unable to resolve complete genomic structures due to repetitive regions. Hybrid assembly uses long reads to scaffold together short-read contigs, maximising the benefits of both technologies. A major limiting factor to using hybrid assemblies at scale is the cost of sequencing the same isolate with two different technologies. Here we show that high-quality hybrid assemblies can be created for most isolates using significantly shorter run-times than are currently standard. We demonstrate that a simple washing step allows several libraries to be run on the same flowcell, facilitating the ability to take advantage of shorter running times. Adding nuclease means that contamination between libraries is minimal and has no significant effect on the quality of subsequent hybrid assemblies. This approach reduces the cost of acquiring long reads by >30%, paving the way for large-scale studies utilising hybrid assemblies which will likely significantly enhance our understanding of the genomics of important human pathogens.",

The specific primers of 16S rDNA and cagA for PCR amplification were used. For investigation of HER2 status in GC tissues, immunohistochemistry and PCR amplification were performed. In silico study was performed for the investigation of interactive potential of HER2 with CagA protein.\n\nResultsPCR amplified the 54 (63.52 %) of 85 GC tissues for HP that showed 34 (62.96 %) cagA+ HP. Immunohistochemistry of tissues revealed 57 (67.05 %) diffuse and 28 (32.94 %) intestinal type cancer. Of 85 cases, 21 GC tissues scored (2 + or 3 +) for positive HER2 expression and score (0 or 1 +) of 64 (75.29 %) showed negative. Of 21 HER2 + GC tissue, 15 biopsies had cagA+ HP and 2 were negative.

Remarkably, a single renal cell could give rise to up to 3.3*10(6) cells. Phenotypically, two types of clonal cultures were apparent; a stably proliferating cuboidal epithelial-like appearing (EL) and a rapidly proliferating fibroblast-like appearing (FL). RNA sequencing of all clonal cultures separated FL from EL cultures according to proximal-distal/collecting renal epithelial tubular identity, respectively. Moreover, distinct molecular features in respect to cell-cycle, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, oxidative phosphorylation, BMP signaling pathway and cell surface markers were observed for each clone type. Surprisingly, clonal expansion (>3 months) was sustained in EL clones harboring markers of mature kidney epithelia (high CD24, CDH1, EpCAM, EMA) in contrast to de-differentiated FL clones (high NCAM1, serpine1), which showed fast lineage amplification and exhausted in a few weeks.\n\nThus, the human adult kidney harbors progenitor cell function in which segment identity and the level of epithelial differentiation dictate clonal characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Small isolated populations are vulnerable to both stochastic events and the negative consequences of genetic drift. For threatened species, the genetic management of such populations has therefore become a crucial aspect of conservation. Flying foxes (Pteropus spp, Chiroptera) are keystone species with essential roles in pollination and seed dispersal in tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Yet many flying fox species are also of conservation concern, having experienced dramatic population declines driven by habitat loss and hunting. The Ryukyu flying fox (Pteropus dasymallus) ranges from Japan and Taiwan to the northern Philippines, and has undergone precipitous population crashes on several islands in recent decades. To assess population genetic structure and diversity in P. dasymallus, and its likely causes, we analyzed mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA. Both markers showed significant genetic differentiation among most island populations with patterns of isolation-by-distance. However, while mitochondrial haplotypes showed some mixing across the region, likely reflecting historical colonization and/or dispersal events, microsatellites markers showed clear subdivisions corresponding to the position of deep ocean trenches. The current distribution of P. dasymallus and its subspecific diversity therefore appears to have arisen through vicariance coupled with a long history of restricted gene flow across oceanic barriers. We conclude that isolated island subgroups should be managed separately, with efforts directed at reducing further declines.",

In such studies, the impact of body temperature has not been sufficiently addressed despite the well-established fact that the rates of most physiological processes are manifestly temperature-dependent. Hence, the role of body temperature in modulating the number of neurons and body size is investigated in this work by means of a simple quantitative model. It is determined that modest deviations in the body temperature (i.e., by a few degrees Celsius) might bring about substantive changes in brain and body parameters. In particular, a higher body temperature might prove amenable to an increase in the number of neurons, a higher brain-to-body mass ratio and fewer hours expended on feeding activities, while the converse applies when the temperature is lowered. It is therefore argued that future studies must endeavour to explore and incorporate the effects of body temperature in metabolic theories of hominin evolution, while also accounting for other factors such as foraging efficiency, diet and fire control in tandem.",

    "abstract": "Type I interferons (IFN) initiate an antiviral state through a signal transduction cascade that leads to the induction of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to restrict viral infection. Recently, RNA modifications on both host and viral RNAs have been described as regulators of infection. However, the impact of host mRNA cap modifications on the IFN response and how this regulates viral infection is unknown. Here, we reveal that CMTR1, an ISG that catalyzes 2O methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide in cellular mRNA (Cap 1), promotes the protein expression of specific ISGs that contribute to the antiviral response. Depletion of CMTR1 reduces the IFN-induced protein levels of ISG15, MX1, and IFITM1, without affecting their transcript abundance. However, CMTR1 depletion does not significantly affect the IFN-induced protein or transcript abundance of IFIT1 and IFIT3. Importantly, knockdown of IFIT1, which acts with IFIT3 to inhibit the translation of RNAs lacking Cap 1 2O methylation, restores protein expression of ISG15, MX1, and IFITM1 in cells depleted of CMTR1. Finally, we found that CMTR1 plays a role in restricting RNA virus replication, likely by ensuring the expression of specific antiviral ISGs. Taken together, these data reveal that CMTR1 is required to establish an antiviral state by ensuring the protein expression of a subset of ISGs during the type I IFN response.\n\nImportanceInduction of an efficient type I IFN response is important to control viral infection. We show that the host 2O methyltransferase CMTR1 facilitates the protein expression of ISGs in human cells by preventing IFIT1 from inhibiting the translation of these mRNAs lacking cap 2O methylation. Thus, CMTR1 promotes the IFN-mediated antiviral response.",

To accurately predict the social interactions, we formulate a set of unstructured kinetic models to quantitatively capture the dynamic interactions of multiple microbial species. By introducing an interaction coefficient, we analytically derived the steady state solutions for the interacting species and the substrate profile in the chemostat. We analyzed the stability of the possible co-existing states defined by competition, parasitism, amensalism, commensalism and cooperation. Our model predicts that only parasitism, commensalism and cooperation could lead to stable co-existing state. We also determined the optimal social interaction criteria of microbial coculture with sequential metabolic reactions compartmentalized into two distinct species. Coupled with Luedeking-Piret and Michaelis-Menten equations, accumulation of metabolic intermediates in one species and formation of end-product in another species could be derived and assessed. We discovered that parasitism consortia disfavor the bioconversion of intermediate to final product; and commensalism consortia could efficiently convert metabolic intermediates to final product and maintain metabolic homeostasis with a broad range of operational conditions (i.e., dilution rates); whereas cooperative consortia leads to highly nonlinear pattern of precursor accumulation and end-product formation.

    "abstract": "Treatment of bacterial infections are the great challenge of our era due to the evolved resistance mechanisms against antibiotics. The Achilles heel of bacteria is the cell wall especially during the needs of its synthesis and cell division. Here lipid II is an essential cell wall precursor component synthesized in the cytosol and flipped into the outer leaflet of the membrane prior to its incorporation into the cell wall.\n\nCompounds targeting the cell wall or its biosynthesis precursors have been around for decades and have been used as antibiotics against bacterial infections like meningitis, pneumonia and endocarditis. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have proven to be a promising weapon against multiresistant bacteria. However, the Bacitracin efflux (BceAB)-type ATP binding cassette transporters expressed in the membrane of human pathogenic bacteria have been shown to confer resistance to these alternative antibiotics, thereby hampering their medical development.\n\nIn Streptococcus agalactiae COH1 the BceAB-type transporter NsrFP (SaNsrFP) confers high-level resistance against the antimicrobial peptide nisin, a member of the lantibiotic subfamily. We showed that SaNsrFP provides a novel resistance mechanism by flipping lipid II back into the cytosol, thereby preventing the binding of nisin as well as other lipid II targeting compounds. This is intriguing since a relatively simple reaction mediates resistance to human pathogenic bacteria to lipid II targeting antibiotics, regardless of their structure.\n\nSignificance StatementThe ABC-transporter NsrFP from Streptococcus agalactiae (SaNsrFP) belongs to the BceAB-type transporters. Several BceAB-type transporters are known to confer resistance against multiple antimicrobial peptides. In this study a new resistance mechanism was identified, which is based on the reduction of the number of cell wall precursor lipid II molecules on the cell surface mediated by SaNsrFP. SaNsrFP flips lipid II, which are considered to be the target for many antibiotics, back into the cytoplasm. With this newly gained knowledge about the resistance mechanism of BceAB-type transporters, novel strategies can be established to overcome or bypass this resistance in human pathogenic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Current deep learning methods for structure-based virtual screening take the structures of both the protein and the ligand as input but make little or no use of the protein structure when predicting ligand binding. Here we show how a relatively simple method of dataset augmentation forces such deep learning methods to take into account information from the protein. Models trained in this way are more generalisable (make better predictions on protein-ligand complexes from a different distribution to the training data). They also assign more meaningful importance to the protein and ligand atoms involved in binding. Overall, our results show that dataset augmentation can help deep learning based virtual screening to learn physical interactions rather than dataset biases.\n\nGraphical TOC Entry\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/979625v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (14K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@609f5forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17f2cbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@51e854org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16c111f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Parkinsons disease present with a complex clinical phenotype, encompassing sleep, motor, cognitive, and affective disturbances. However, characterizations of PD are typically made for the \"average\" patient, ignoring patient heterogeneity and obscuring important individual differences. Modern large-scale data sharing efforts provide a unique opportunity to precisely investigate individual patient characteristics, but there exists no analytic framework for comprehensively integrating data modalities. Here we apply an unsupervised learning method--similarity network fusion--to objectively integrate MRI morphometry, dopamine active transporter binding, protein assays, and clinical measurements from n = 186 individuals with de novo Parkinsons disease from the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative. We show that multimodal fusion captures inter-dependencies among data modalities that would otherwise be overlooked by field standard techniques like data concatenation. We then examine how patient subgroups derived from fused data map onto clinical phenotypes, and how neuroimaging data is critical to this delineation. Finally, we identify a compact set of phenotypic axes that span the patient population, demonstrating that this continuous, low-dimensional projection of individual patients presents a more parsimonious representation of heterogeneity in the sample compared to discrete biotypes. Altogether, these findings showcase the potential of similarity network fusion for combining multimodal data in heterogeneous patient populations.",

    "abstract": "Decisions do not occur in isolation, but are embedded in sequences of other decisions, often pertaining to the same source of evidence. Here, we characterized the impact of intermittent choices on the accumulation of a protracted stream of decision-relevant evidence towards a final decision. Human participants performed two versions, based on perceptual or numerical evidence, of a decision task that required two successive judgments at different times during the evidence stream: an intermittent response consisting of a binary choice, and a continuous estimation at the end of the evidence stream. In a control condition, subjects executed a choice-independent motor response instead of binary choice as the intermittent response. In both, perceptual and numerical tasks, the intermittent choice reduced the sensitivity of subsequent evidence, and flipped the relative temporal weighting of early and late evidence in the final estimation judgment. The individual extent of the choice-induced overall (non-selective) sensitivity reduction predicted the extent of the selective down-weighting of subsequent evidence inconsistent with the initial choice, a form of confirmation bias. In sum, active decisions about a protracted evidence stream profoundly alter the dynamics of evidence accumulation, consistent with an active, modulatory mechanism triggered by the choice.",

Here, we provide new evidence showing an involvement of increased lamin B1 levels in the pathophysiology of Huntingtons disease (HD), a CAG repeat-associated neurodegenerative disorder. Through fluorescence-activated nuclear suspension imaging we demonstrate that nucleus from striatal medium-sized spiny and CA1 hippocampal neurons display increased lamin B1 levels, in correlation with altered nuclear morphology and nucleocytoplasmic transport disruption. Moreover, ChIP-sequencing analysis shows an alteration of lamin-associated chromatin domains in hippocampal nuclei, which could contribute to transcriptional alterations we determined by RNA sequencing. Supporting lamin B1 alterations as a causal role in mutant-huntingtin mediated neurodegeneration, pharmacological normalization of lamin B1 levels by betulinic acid administration in the R6/1 mouse model of HD restored nuclear homeostasis and prevented motor and cognitive dysfunction. Collectively, our work point out increased lamin B1 levels as a new pathogenic mechanism in HD and provides a novel target for its intervention.",

    "abstract": "The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) has been linked to approach-avoidance behavior and decision-making under conflict, key neural computations thought to be altered in anxiety disorders. However, the heterogeneity of efferent prefrontal projections has obscured identification of the specific top-down neural pathways regulating these anxiety-related behaviors. While the dmPFC-amygdala circuit has long been implicated in controlling reflexive fear responses, recent work suggests that this circuit is less important for avoidance behavior. We hypothesized that dmPFC neurons projecting to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) represent a subset of prefrontal neurons that robustly encode and drive approach-avoidance behavior. Using fiber photometry recording during the elevated zero maze (EZM) task, we show heightened neural activity in prefrontal and fronto-striatal projection neurons, but not fronto-amydalar projection neurons, during exploration of the anxiogenic open arms of the maze. Additionally, through pathway-specific optogenetics we demonstrate that this fronto-striatal projection preferentially excites postsynaptic D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons in the DMS and bidirectionally controls avoidance behavior. We conclude that this striatal-projecting subpopulation of prefrontal neurons regulates approach-avoidance conflict, supporting a model for prefrontal control of defensive behavior in which the dmPFC-amygdala projection controls reflexive fear behavior and the dmPFC-striatum projection controls anxious avoidance behavior. Our findings identify this fronto-striatal circuit as a valuable therapeutic target for developing interventions to alleviate excessive avoidance behavior in anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "There is a real need for biomarkers that can indicate glioma disease burden and inform clinical management, particularly in the recurrent glioblastoma (GBM; grade IV glioma) setting where treatment-associated brain changes can confound current and expensive tumour surveillance methods. In this regard, extracellular vesicles (EVs; 30-1000 nm membranous particles) hold major promise as robust tumour biomarkers. GBM-EVs encapsulate molecules that reflect the identity and molecular state of their cell-of-origin and cross the blood-brain-barrier into the periphery where they are readily accessible. Despite the suitability of circulating-EVs for GBM biomarker discovery, sample complexity has hindered comprehensive quantitative proteomic studies. Here, sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) was used in conjunction with a targeted data extraction strategy to comprehensively profile circulating-EVs isolated from plasma. Plasma-EVs sourced from pre-operative glioma II-IV patients (n=41) and controls (n=11) were sequenced by SWATH-MS, and the identities and absolute quantities of the proteins were extracted by aligning the SWATH-MS data against a custom glioma spectral library comprised of 8662 high confidence protein species. Overall, 4054 plasma-EV proteins were quantified across the cohorts, and putative circulating-EV biomarker proteins identified (adjusted p-value<0.05) included previously reported GBM-EV proteins identified in vitro and in neurosurgical aspirates. Principle component analyses showed that plasma-EV protein profiles clustered according to glioma subtype and WHO-grade, and plasma-EV proteins reflected the extent of glioma aggression. Using SWATH-MS, we describe the most comprehensive proteomic plasma-EV profiles for glioma and highlight the promise of this approach as an accurate and sensitive tumour monitoring method. Objective blood-based measurements of glioma tumour activity will support the implementation of next-generation, patient-centred therapies and are ideal surrogate endpoints for recurrent progression that would allow clinical trial protocols to be more dynamic and adapt to the individual patient and their cancer.",

Results showed that BALB/c mice yielded optimal psoriasis-like phenotype with IMQ+AcOH topical treatment, C57BL/6J moderate, ApoE mild, while the ApoE/SKH-hr2 mice due to Munro abscess absence in histopathology analysis left doubts about the psoriasis-like acquisition. The locomotor activity of BALB/c mice treated with IMQ, IMQ+AcOH topically and IMQ+AcOH systemically, showed with all treatments, a decreased covered distance and rearing and an increased immobility.

    "abstract": "Organisms possess photoperiodic timing mechanisms to anticipate variations in day length and temperature as the seasons progress. The nature of the molecular mechanisms interpreting and signaling these environmental changes to elicit downstream neuroendocrine and physiological responses are just starting to emerge. Here, we demonstrate that in Drosophila melanogaster, EYES ABSENT (EYA) acts as a seasonal sensor by interpreting photoperiodic and temperature changes to trigger appropriate physiological responses. We observed that tissue-specific genetic manipulation of eya expression is sufficient to disrupt the ability of flies to sense seasonal cues, thereby altering the extent of female reproductive dormancy. Specifically we observed that EYA proteins, which peak at night in short photoperiod and accumulate at higher levels in the cold, promote reproductive dormancy in female D. melanogaster. Furthermore, we provide evidence indicating that the role of EYA in photoperiodism and temperature sensing is aided by the stabilizing action of the light-sensitive circadian clock protein TIMELESS (TIM). We postulate that increased stability and level of TIM at night under short photoperiod together with the production of cold-induced and light-insensitive TIM isoforms facilitate EYA accumulation in winter conditions. This is supported by our observations that tim null mutants exhibit reduced incidence of reproductive dormancy in simulated winter conditions, while flies overexpressing tim show an increased incidence of reproductive dormancy even in long photoperiod.\n\nSignificance StatementExtracting information on calendar time from seasonal changes in photoperiod and temperature is critical for organisms to maintain circannual cycles in physiology and behavior. Here we found that in flies, EYES ABSENT (EYA) protein act as a seasonal sensor by adjusting its abundance and circadian phase in response to changes in photoperiod and temperature. We show that the manipulation of EYA levels is sufficient to impair the ability of female Drosophila to regulate seasonal variation in reproductive dormancy. Finally, our results suggest an important role of the circadian clock protein TIMELESS (TIM) in modulating EYA level through its ability to measure night length, linking the circadian clock to seasonal timing.",

Here we describe the identification and phylogenetic analysis of the Ptr1 gene. A single recombinant among 585 F2 plants segregating for the Ptr1 locus was discovered that narrowed the Ptr1 candidates to eight nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein (NLR)-encoding genes. From analysis of the gene models in the S. lycopersicoides genome sequence and RNA-Seq data, two of the eight genes emerged as the strongest candidates for Ptr1. One of these two candidates was found to encode Ptr1 based on its ability to mediate recognition of AvrRpt2 and RipBN when it was transiently expressed with these effectors in leaves of Nicotiana glutinosa. The ortholog of Ptr1 in tomato and in Solanum pennellii is a pseudogene. However, a functional Ptr1 ortholog exists in N. benthamiana and potato and both mediate recognition of AvrRpt2 and RipBN. In apple and Arabidopsis, recognition of AvrRpt2 is mediated by the Mr5 and RPS2 proteins, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis places Ptr1 in a distinct clade compared to Mr5 and RPS2 and it therefore appears to have arisen by convergent evolution for recognition of AvrRpt2.",

    "abstract": "Styrene is an important petroleum-derived molecule that is polymerized to make versatile plastics, including disposable silverware and foamed packaging materials. Finding more sustainable methods, such as biosynthesis, for producing styrene is essential due to the increasing severity of climate change as well as the limited supply of fossil fuels. Recent metabolic engineering efforts have enabled the biological production of styrene in Escherichia coli, but styrene toxicity and volatility limit biosynthesis in cells. To address these limitations, we have developed a cell-free styrene biosynthesis platform. The cell-free system provides an open reaction environment without cell viability constraints, which allows exquisite control over reaction conditions and greater carbon flux toward product formation rather than cell growth. The two biosynthetic enzymes required for styrene production were generated via cell-free protein synthesis and mixed in defined ratios with supplemented L-phenylalanine and buffer. By altering the time, temperature, pH, and enzyme concentrations in the reaction, this approach increased the cell-free titer of styrene from 5.36 {+/-} 0.63 mM to 40.33 {+/-} 1.03 mM, an order of magnitude greater than cellular synthesis methods. Cell-free systems offer a complimentary approach to cellular synthesis of small molecules, which can provide particular benefits for producing toxic molecules.\n\nHighlightsA cell-free system for styrene biosynthesis was established. This in vitro system achieved styrene titers an order of magnitude greater than the highest reported concentration in vivo.",

Wnt agonism stimulated singular axial extensions in a dose-dependent manner, and elongated organoids displayed regionalized rostral-caudal HOX gene expression, with spatially distinct hindbrain (HOXB1) expression from brachial (HOXC6) and thoracic (HOXB9) regions. CRISPR-interference-mediated silencing of the TBXT, a downstream Wnt target, increased neuroepithelial compartmentalization and resulted in multiple extensions per aggregate. Further, knock-down of BMP inhibitors, Noggin and Chordin, induced elongation phenotypes that mimicked murine knockout models. These results indicate the potent morphogenic capacity of caudalized hPSC organoids to undergo axial elongation in a manner that can be used to dissect the cellular organization and patterning decisions that dictate early nervous system development in humans.",

    "abstract": "Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising treatment for high mortality cancers1. Non-invasive imaging of the underlying molecular processes is an essential tool for therapy optimization and assessment of viral spread, innate immunity, and therapeutic response2, 3. However, previous methods for imaging oncolytic viruses did not correlate with late viral activity4 or had poor sensitivity and specificity5. Similarly, methods developed to image treatment response, such as apoptosis, proved to be slow, nonspecific, or require the use of radioactive or metal-based contrast agents6-8. To date, no method has been widely adopted for clinical use. We describe here a new method for fast magnetic resonance molecular imaging with quantitative proton chemical-exchange specificity to monitor oncolytic virotherapy treatment response. A deep neural network enabled the computation of quantitative biomarker maps of protein and lipid/macromolecule concentrations as well as intracellular pH in a glioblastoma multiforme mouse brain tumor model. Early detection of apoptotic response to oncolytic virotherapy, characterized by decreased cytosolic pH and protein synthesis, was observed in agreement with histology. Clinical translation was demonstrated in a normal human subject, yielding molecular parameters in good agreement with literature values9. The developed method is directly applicable to a wide range of pathologies, including stroke10, cancer11-13, and neurological disorders14, 15.",

    "abstract": "A remarkable feature of the microtubule cytoskeleton is co-existence of sub-populations having different dynamic properties. A prominent example is the anaphase spindle, where stable antiparallel bundles exist alongside dynamic microtubules and provide spatial cues for cytokinesis. How are dynamics of spatially proximal arrays differentially regulated? We reconstitute a minimal system of three midzone proteins: microtubule-crosslinker PRC1, and its interactors CLASP1 and Kif4A, proteins that promote and suppress microtubule elongation, respectively. We find their collective activity promotes elongation of single microtubules, while simultaneously stalling polymerization of crosslinked bundles. This differentiation arises from (i) Strong rescue activity of CLASP1, which overcomes weaker effects of Kif4A on single microtubules, (ii) Lower microtubule and PRC1-binding affinity of CLASP1, which permit dominance of Kif4A at overlaps. In addition to canonical mechanisms where antagonistic regulators set microtubule lengths, our findings illuminate design principles by which collective regulator activity creates microenvironments of arrays with distinct dynamic properties.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveCellular senescence is a phenotypic state characterized by stable cell-cycle arrest, enhanced lysosomal activity, and the secretion of inflammatory molecules and matrix degrading enzymes. Senescence has been implicated in osteoarthritis (OA) pathophysiology; however, the mechanisms that drive senescence induction in cartilage and other joint tissues are unknown. While numerous physiological signals are capable of initiating the senescence phenotype, one emerging theme is that growth-arrested cells convert to senescence in response to sustained mitogenic stimulation. The goal of this study was to develop an in vitro articular cartilage explant model to investigate the mechanisms of senescence induction.\n\nDesignThis study utilized healthy articular cartilage derived from cadaveric equine stifles and human ankles. Explants were irradiated or treated with palbociclib to initiate cell cycle arrest, and mitogenic stimulation was provided by serum-containing medium (horse) and the inclusion of growth factors (human). The primary readout of senescence was a quantitative flow cytometry assay to detect senescence-associated {beta} galactosidase activity (SA-{beta}-gal).\n\nResultsIrradiation of equine explants caused 25.39% of cells to express high levels of SA-{beta}-gal, as compared to 3.82% in control explants (p=0.0031). For human cartilage, explants that received both mitogenic stimulation and cell cycle arrest showed increased rates of senescence induction as compared to baseline control (7.16% vs. 2.34% SA-{beta}-gal high, p=0.0007).\n\nConclusionsTreatment of cartilage explants with mitogenic stimuli in the context of cell-cycle arrest reliably induces high levels of SA-{beta} gal activity, which provides a physiologically relevant model system to investigate the mechanisms of senescence induction.",

Hh distributes in concentration gradients in the wing disc anterior compartment, ASP, and myoblasts and activates different sets of genes in each tissue. Some transcriptional targets of Hh signal transduction are common to the disc, ASP, and myoblasts, whereas others are tissue-specific. Signaling in the three tissues is cytoneme-mediated and cytoneme-dependent.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been an increasing interest in model-based approaches for the statistical modelling of the joint distribution of multi-species abundances. The Dirichlet-multinomial distribution has been proposed as a suitable candidate distribution for the joint species distribution of pin-point plant cover data and is here applied in a model-based ordination framework. Unlike most model-based ordination methods, both fixed and random effects are in our proposed model structured as p-dimensional vectors and added to the latent variables before the inner product with the species-specific coefficients. This changes the interpretation of the parameters, so that the fixed and random effects now measure the relative displacement of the vegetation by the fixed and random factors in the p-dimensional latent variable space. This parameterization allows statistical inference of the effect of fixed and random factors in vector space, and makes it easier for practitioners to perform inferences on species composition in a multivariate setting. The method was applied on plant pin-point cover data from dry heathlands that had received different management treatments (burned, grazed, harvested, unmanaged), and it was found that treatment have a significant effect on heathland vegetation both when considering plant functional groups or when the taxonomic resolution was at the species level.",

So far, the molecular mechanisms underlying tail absence in this breed have remained unclear. We employed comprehensive comparative transcriptomic and genomic analyses to unravel potential genetic underpinnings of rumplessness in the Piao chicken. Our results reveal many biological factors involved in tail development and several genomic regions under strong positive selection in this breed. These regions contain candidate genes associated with rumplessness, including IRX4, IL-18, HSPB2, and CRYAB. Retrieval of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and gene functions implied that rumplessness might be consciously or unconsciously selected along with the high-yield traits in Piao chicken. We hypothesize that strong selection pressures on regulatory elements might lead to gene activity changes in mesenchymal stem cells of the tail bud and eventually result in tail truncation by impeding differentiation and proliferation of the stem cells. Our study provides fundamental insights into early initiation and genetic bases of the rumpless phenotype in Piao chicken.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing paradigm in obstetrics has been the sterile womb hypothesis. However, some are asserting that the placenta, intra-amniotic environment, and fetus harbor microbial communities. The objective of this study was to determine if the fetal and placental tissues of rhesus macaques harbor viable bacterial communities. Fetal, placental, and uterine wall samples were obtained from cesarean deliveries without labor ([~]130/166 days gestation). The presence of viable bacteria in the fetal intestine and placenta was investigated through culture. The bacterial burden and profile of the placenta, umbilical cord, and fetal brain, heart, liver, and colon were determined through quantitative real-time PCR and DNA sequencing. These data were compared with those of the uterine wall, as well as to negative and positive technical controls. Bacterial cultures of fetal and placental tissues yielded only a single colony of Cutibacterium acnes. This bacterium was detected at a low relative abundance (0.02%) in the 16S rRNA gene profile of the villous tree sample from which it was cultured, yet it was also identified in 12/29 background technical controls. The bacterial burden and profile of fetal and placental tissues did not exceed or differ from those of background technical controls. In contrast, the bacterial burden and profiles of positive controls exceeded and differed from those of background controls. Among the macaque samples, distinct microbial signals were limited to the uterine wall. Therefore, using multiple modes of microbiologic inquiry, there was not consistent evidence of viable bacterial communities in the fetal and placental tissues of rhesus macaques.\n\nIMPORTANCEMicrobial invasion of the amniotic cavity (i.e. intra-amniotic infection) has been causally linked to pregnancy complications, especially preterm birth. Therefore, if the placenta and the fetus are typically populated by low biomass yet viable microbial communities, current understanding of the role of microbes in reproduction and pregnancy outcomes will need to be fundamentally reconsidered. Could these communities be of benefit by competitively excluding potential pathogens or priming the fetal immune system for the microbial bombardment it will experience upon delivery? If so, what properties (e.g. microbial load, community membership) of these microbial communities preclude versus promote intra-amniotic infection? Given the ramifications of the in utero colonization hypothesis, critical evaluation is required. In this study, using multiple modes of microbiologic inquiry (i.e. culture, qPCR, DNA sequencing) and controlling for potential background DNA contamination, we did not find consistent evidence for microbial communities in the placenta and fetal tissues of rhesus macaques.",

Although proliferative quiescence in {beta}-cells is required to maintain functional competence, exemplified by glucose stimulated insulin secretion, the molecular underpinnings of this reciprocal relationship remain enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that Tead1, the transcription effector of the mammalian-Hippo pathway drives developmental stage-specific {beta}-cell proliferative capacity in conjunction with its functional maturation. Tead1 promotes adult {beta}-cell mature identity by direct transcriptional control of a network of critical {beta}-cell transcription factors, including, Pdx1, Nkx6.1 and MafA, while its regulation of Cdkn2a maintains proliferative quiescence. Consequently, mice with either constitutive or inducible genetic deletion of Tead1 in {beta}-cells developed overt diabetes due to a severe loss of secretory function despite induction of proliferation. Furthermore, we show that Tead1 has a similar regulatory role in human {beta}-cells. We propose that Tead1 is an essential intrinsic molecular switch coordinating adult {beta}-cell proliferative quiescence with mature identity and functional competence to maintain glucose homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdolescents frequently consume caffeine with unknown consequences on sleep and circadian rhythms. In adults, the evidence indicates that caffeine acutely reduces homeostatic sleep pressure and delays the circadian timing system.\n\nObjectiveHere, we investigated the acute effects of caffeine intake on the developing sleep-wake regulatory system of teenagers.\n\nDesignIn a double-blind randomized crossover laboratory study, 18 teenagers (16.1 {+/-} 1 years old, pubertal development scale [PDS]: 2.76 {+/-} 0.35) ingested 80 mg caffeine (vs placebo) four hours prior to bedtime. Until bedtime, participants regularly filled in the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and gave saliva samples to measure melatonin secretion. During nighttime, we quantified homeostatic sleep need by the electroencephalographically derived amount of slow wave sleep duration (SWS). After sleep, participants rated sleep quality by the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire.\n\nResultsWhile participants felt less sleepy after caffeine vs. placebo (P=0.038), their ratings of sleep quality were not strongly affected by the treatment. However, objectively, SWS was on average reduced by [~]20 min after caffeine vs. placebo (P=0.026). This caffeine-induced reduction was more pronounced in those individuals with more SWS under placebo (regression: P=0.042; standardized beta=0.622, P=0.011), even if controlling for habitual caffeine intake or pubertal stage (PDS). In melatonin onsets we observed both delays and advances in response to caffeine. This variance could partly be explained by differences in relative dose (i.e., mg caffeine/kg of bodyweight): the higher the relative dose, the more likely were delays (regression: P=0.01; standardized beta=0.592, P=0.01).\n\nConclusionsIn teenagers, evening caffeine intake of already 80 mg (i.e. [~]8fl oz of common energy drinks) is sufficient to promote alertness at the costs of subsequent sleep. These costs might be more pronounced in adolescents with a higher need for SWS. Moreover, caffeine might disturb the circadian timing system, consequently hampering the balanced interplay of sleep-wake regulatory components.\n\nSources of SupportMarie-Heim-Voegtlin Grant of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) PMPDP1_171364",

    "abstract": "With massive possible synthetic routes in chemistry, retrosynthesis prediction is still a challenge for researchers. Recently, retrosynthesis prediction is formulated as a Machine Translation (MT) task. Namely, since each molecule can be represented as a Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) string, the process of retrosynthesis is analogized to a process of language translation from the product to reactants. However, the MT models that applied on SMILES data usually ignore the information of natural atomic connections and the topology of molecules. To make more chemically plausible constrains on the atom representation learning for better performance, in this paper, we propose a Graph Enhanced Transformer (GET) framework, which adopts both the sequential and graphical information of molecules. Four different GET designs are proposed, which fuse the SMILES representations with atom embeddings learned from our improved Graph Neural Network (GNN). Empirical results show that our model significantly outperforms the vanilla Transformer model in test accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Microtubule (MT) nucleation is essential for cellular activities, but its mechanism is not known because of the difficulty involved in capturing rare stochastic events in the early stage of polymerization. In cells, MTs are nucleated at tubulin concentrations significantly lower than those required for spontaneous nucleation in vitro. The high efficiency of nucleation is due to the synergistic effects of various cellular factors, but the underlying mechanism has not been clarified yet. Here, combining negative stain electron microscopy and kinetic analysis, we demonstrate that the formation of single-stranded straight oligomers with critical size is essential for nucleation in vitro. While the single-stranded oligomers of GTP-tubulin that form prior to MT nucleation show variable curvatures including a few straight oligomers, only curved oligomers are observed among the GDP-bound counterparts. The Y222F mutation in {beta}-tubulin increases the proportion of straight oligomers and drastically accelerates MT nucleation. Our results support a model in which GTP binding causes a small shift in the distribution of oligomer curvature, generating a minor population of straight oligomers compatible with lateral association and further growth to MTs. Our study suggests that cellular factors involved in nucleation promote it via stabilization of straight oligomers.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading threat to human lives with high incidence and mortality. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) were reported to play important roles in human cancers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of circ_0005962 and explore the underlying functional mechanisms. The expression of circ_0005962, miR-382-5p and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation and cell apoptosis were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry assay, respectively. The protein levels of Beclin 1, light chain3 (LC3-II/LC3-I), PDK4, Cleaved Caspase 3 (C-caspase 3) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were examined using western blot analysis. Glycolysis was determined according to the levels of glucose consumption and lactate production. The interaction between miR-382-5p and circ_0005962 or PDK4 was predicted by the online tool CircInteractome or starbase and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Xenograft model was constructed to investigate the role of circ_0005962 in vivo. circ_0005962 expressed with a high level in NSCLC tissues and cells. Circ_0005962 knockdown inhibited proliferation, autophagy, and glycolysis but promoted apoptosis in NSCLC cells. MiR-382-5p was targeted by circ_0005962, and its inhibition reversed the role of circ_0005962 knockdown. Besides, PDK4, a target of miR-382-5p, was regulated by circ_0005962 through miR-382-5p, and its overexpression abolished the effects of miR-382-5p reintroduction. Circ_0005962 knockdown suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Circ_0005962 knockdown restrained cell proliferation, autophagy, and glycolysis but stimulated apoptosis through modulating the circ_0005962/miR-382-5p/PDK4 axis.

    "abstract": "Enteric viruses, such as human norovirus (NoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), are the major causes of foodborne illnesses worldwide. These viruses are shed in high numbers, have low infectious dose, and may remain infectious for weeks in the environment and food. While numerous viral survival studies have been conducted in fresh fruits and produce, limited information is available regarding viral survival and transmission in low moisture foods (LMF). LMFs are generally considered as ready-to-eat products, which undergo no or minimal pathogen reduction steps. However, numerous foodborne outbreaks associated with LMFs have been reported in recent years. The objective of this study was to examine the survival of foodborne viruses in LMFs during long-term storage at ambient temperature and to evaluate the efficacy of advanced oxidative process (AOP) treatment in the inactivation of these viruses. For this purpose, select LMFs such as pistachios, chocolate, and cereal were inoculated with HAV and the norovirus surrogates, murine norovirus (MNV) and feline calicivirus (FCV), then viral survival on these food matrices was measured over a four-week incubation at ambient temperature, by both plaque assay and droplet-digital RT-PCR (ddRT-PCR). We observed an approximately 0.5 log reduction in viral genome copies, and 1 log reduction in viral infectivity for all three tested viruses following storage of select inoculated LMFs for 4 weeks. Therefore, the present study shows that foodborne viruses can persist for long-time in LMFs. Next, we examined the inactivation efficacy of AOP treatment, which combines UV-C, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide vapor, and observed that while approximately 100% inactivation can be achieved for FCV, MNV, and HAV in chocolate, the inactivation efficiency diminishes to approximately 90% in pistachios and 70% in cereal. AOP treatment could therefore be a good candidate for the elimination of foodborne viruses from certain LMFs depending on the food matrix and surface of treatment.\n\nImportanceLow moisture foods have been increasingly recognized as important vehicles of foodborne pathogens. In the present study, we demonstrated that foodborne viruses remain infectious during long-term storage on select low moisture foods. In addition, we evaluated the efficacy of an advanced oxidative process in the inactivation of foodborne viruses in low moisture foods. This research will help increase the safety of low moisture foods and reduce the number of foodborne illnesses due to contaminated products.",

However, generating the stimuli needed to evoke activity in the visual system still represents a non-negligible difficulty for experimentalists.

Primarily, the hardware needed to effectively display such stimuli comes at a significant financial cost, and secondly, triggering and/or timing the stimuli such that it can be accurately synchronized with other devices requires the use of legacy hardware, further hardware, or bespoke solutions.\n\nHere we present RPG, a Python package written for the Raspberry Pi, which overcomes these issues. Specifically, the Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, credit card sized computer with general purpose input/output pins, allowing RPG to be triggered to deliver stimuli and to provide real-time feedback on stimulus timing. RPG delivers stimuli at >60 frames per second and the feedback of frame timings is accurate to 10s of microseconds.\n\nWe provide a simple to use Python interface that is capable of generating drifting sine wave gratings, Gabor patches and displaying raw images/video.",

    "abstract": "Functional connectivity analysis of resting state fMRI data has recently become one of the most common approaches to characterizing individual brain function. It has been widely suggested that the functional connectivity matrix, calculated by correlating signals from regions of interest, is a useful approximate representation of the brains connectivity, potentially providing behaviorally or clinically relevant markers. However, functional connectivity estimates are known to be detrimentally affected by various artifacts, including those due to in-scanner head motion. Treatment of such artifacts poses a standing challenge because of their high variability. Moreover, as individual functional connections generally covary only very weakly with head motion estimates, motion influence is difficult to quantify robustly, and prone to be neglected in practice. Although the use of individual estimates of head motion, or group-level correlation of motion and functional connectivity has been suggested, a sufficiently sensitive measure of individual functional connectivity quality has not yet been established. We propose a new intuitive summary index, the Typicality of Functional Connectivity, to capture deviations from normal brain functional connectivity pattern. Based on results of resting state fMRI for 245 healthy subjects we show that this measure is significantly correlated with individual head motion metrics. The results were further robustly reproduced across atlas granularity and preprocessing options, as well as other datasets including 1081 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. The Typicality of Functional Connectivity provides individual proxy measure of motion effect on functional connectivity and is more sensitive to inter-individual variation of motion than individual functional connections. In principle it should be sensitive also to other types of artifacts, processing errors and possibly also brain pathology, allowing wide use in data quality screening and quantification in functional connectivity studies as well as methodological investigations.",

Recent genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies started to reveal a broad spectrum of phenotypes associated with genetic variants. However, the phenome or spectrum of all phenotypes associated with genetic variants in extracellular matrix genes is unknown. Here, we analyzed over two million recorded genotype-to-phenotype relationships across hundreds of species to define their extracellular matrix phenomes. By using previously defined matrisomes of humans, mice, zebrafish, Drosophila, and C. elegans, we found that the extracellular matrix phenome comprises of 3-10% of the entire phenome. Collagens (COL1A1, COL2A1) and fibrillin (FBN1) are each associated with more than 150 distinct phenotypes in humans, whereas collagen COL4A1, Wnt- and sonic hedgehog (shh) signaling are predominantly associated in other species. We determined the phenotypic fingerprints of matrisome genes and found that MSTN, CTSD, LAMB2, HSPG2, and COL11A2 and their corresponding orthologues have the most phenotypes across species. Out of the 42558 unique matrisome genotype-to-phenotype relationships across the five species with defined matrisomes, we have constructed interaction networks to identify the underlying molecular components connecting with orthologues phenotypes and with novel phenotypes. Thus, our networks provide a framework to predict unassessed phenotypes and their potential underlying molecular interactions.

The data generated using these approaches also provide interesting new means to examine DNA repair, recombination, and replication to better understand sources of genomic instability. To better utilize this data, we developed SCARR (Systematic Combination of Alignments to Recreate Rearrangements) to identify DNA rearrangements, and used it to examine the occurrence of orientation-reversing events in human and budding yeast genomes. SCARR exceeds the sensitivity of previous genome sequencing approaches, and identifies rearrangements genome-wide with base-pair resolution, which helps provide insights into the mechanisms involved in their formation. We find that short-range orientation-reversing events occur at high rates in both human and yeast genomes. We quantified these rearrangements in yeast strains lacking various DNA repair factors, and propose that these short-range events often occur through template-switching events within a replication fork. We hypothesize that this mechanism may act as an error-prone alternative to fork reversal to restart stalled replication forks.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite, is capable of invading virtually any nucleated cell. Ca2+ signaling is universal and both T. gondii and its mammalian host cell will utilize Ca2+ signaling to stimulate diverse cellular functions. Egress of T. gondii from the host cell is an essential step for the infection cycle of T. gondii and a cytosolic Ca2+ increase initiates the Ca2+ signaling cascade that culminates in stimulation of motility and egress. In this work we demonstrate that intracellular T. gondii is capable of taking up Ca2+ from the host cytoplasm when this concentration is increased during host signaling events. Both intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ sources are important to reach a threshold of cytosolic Ca2+ needed for a successful egress. Two peaks of Ca2+ were observed in single parasites that egressed with the second peak resulting from Ca2+ influx. We patched infected host cells to allow a precise delivery of exact concentrations of Ca2+ for stimulating motility and egress. Using this approach, we found that low potassium concentration modulates but do not trigger host cell egress. This is the first study using whole-cell patches to study the role of ions such as K+ and Ca2+ in T. gondii egress.",

    "abstract": "The births of domestic dogs with pigment deletion and associated congenital hearing and/or vision impairments are increasing, as a result of mutations of certain genes expressing popular coat colour patterns (Merle, piebald, Irish spotting). The future of these dogs is often pessimistic (early euthanasia or placement in rescues/fosters, lack of interactions and activities for adults). These pessimistic scenarios result from popular assumptions predicting that dogs with congenital hearing/vision impairments exhibit severe Merle-related health troubles (cardiac, skeletal, neurological), impairment-related behavioural troubles (aggressiveness, anxiety), and poor capacities to communicate, to be trained, and to be engaged in leisure or work activities. However, there is no direct scientific testing, and hence no evidence or refutation, of these assumptions. We therefore addressed an online questionnaire to owners of 223 congenitally sensory impaired (23 vision impaired, 63 hearing impaired, 137 hearing and vision impaired) and 217 sensory normal dogs from various countries. The sensory normal cohort was matched in age, lifetime with owner, breed and sex with the sensory impaired cohort, and was used as a baseline. The questionnaire assessed demographics, morphology, sensory impairments, health and behavioural troubles, activities, and dog-owner communication. Most hearing and vision impaired dogs exhibited abnormal pigment deletion in their coat and irises. Vision impaired dogs additionally exhibited ophthalmic abnormalities related to Merle. The results refute all above-listed assumptions, except for neurological troubles. We however suggest that reports of neurological troubles could be partially accounted for by lacks of diagnosis of breed-related drug sensitivity and impairment-related compulsive behaviours. Results about communication and activities are particularly optimistic. The need for future studies of numerous dogs from various breeds tested for Merle, piebald and medical-drug-resistance genes, and the beneficial effects that present and future research may have on the future of sensory impaired dogs, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBackground Allograft vasculopathy (AV) remains a major obstacle to long-term allograft survival. While the mouse aortic transplantation model has been proven as a useful tool for study of the pathogenesis of AV, simultaneous transplantation of the aorta alongside the transplantation of another organ may reveal more clinically relevant mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic allograft rejection. Therefore, we developed a combined abdominal heart and aorta transplantation model in mice which benefits from reducing animal and drug utilization, while providing an improved model to study the progressive nature of AV.Methods The middle of the infrarenal aorta of the recipient mouse was ligatured between the renal artery and its bifurcation. Proximal and distal aortotomies were performed at this site above and below the ligature, respectively, for the subsequent anastomoses of the donor aorta and heart grafts to the recipient infrarenal aorta in an end-to-side fashion. The distal anastomotic site of the recipient infrarenal aorta was connected with the outlet of the donor aorta. Uniquely, the proximal anastomotic site on the recipient infrarenal aorta was shared to connect with both the inlet of the donor aorta and the inflow tract to the donor heart. The outflow tract from the donor heart was connected to the recipient inferior vena cava (IVC).Results The median times for harvesting the heart graft, aorta graft, recipient preparation and anastomosis were 11.5, 8.0, 9.0 and 40.5 min, respectively, resulting in a total median ischemic time of 70 min. The surgery survival rate was more than 96% (29/30). Both the syngeneic C57Bl/6 aorta and heart grafts survived more than 90 days in 29 C57Bl/6 recipients. Further, Balb/c to C57Bl/6 allografts treated with anti-CD40L and CTLA4.Ig survived more than 90 days with a 100% (3/3) survival rate. (3/3).Conclusions This model is presented as a new tool for researchers to investigate transplant immunology and assess immunosuppressive strategies. It is possible to share a common anastomotic stoma on the recipient abdominal aorta to reconstruct both the aorta graft entrance and heart graft inflow tract. This allows for the study of allogeneic effects on both the aorta and heart from the same animal in a single survival surgery.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsAVallograft vasculopathyCAVcardiac allograft vasculopathyIVCinferior vena cavaMHCmajor histocompatibility complexSVCsuperior vena cavaView Full Text",

    "abstract": "Currently, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant growth is a topic of interest. In this study, we discuss the role of ROS in cell division. We analyzed ROS impact on the stiffness of plant cell walls and whether ROS play an important role in Brassica napus ability to adapt to cold stress. Cultivated sterile seedlings and calli of cold-tolerant cultivar 16NTS309 were subjected to cold stress at 25{degrees}C and 4{degrees}C, respectively. Under normal conditions, O2.- mainly accumulated in the leaf edges, shoot apical meristem, leaf primordia, root tips, lateral root primordia, calli of meristematic nodular tissues, cambia, vascular bundles and root primordia, which are characterized by high division rates. After exposure to cold stress, the malondialdehyde and ROS (O2.-) contents in roots, stems and leaves of cultivar 16NTS309 were significantly higher than under non-cold conditions (P < 0.05). ROS (O2.-) were not only distributed in these zones, but also in other cells, at higher levels than under normal conditions. A strong ROS-based staining appeared in the cell wall. The results support a dual role for apoplastic ROS, in which they have direct effects on the stiffness of the cell wall, because ROS cleave cell-wall, and act as wall loosening agents, thereby either promoting or restricting cellular division. This promotes the appearance of new shoots and a strong root system, allowing plants to adapt to cold stress.",
