    "abstract": "The geographic pattern of cropland is an important risk factor for invasion and saturation by crop-specific pathogens and arthropods. Understanding cropland networks supports smart pest sampling and mitigation strategies. We evaluate global networks of cropland connectivity for key vegetatively-propagated crops (banana and plantain, cassava, potato, sweetpotato, and yam) important for food security in the tropics. For each crop, potential movement between geographic location pairs was evaluated using a gravity model, with associated uncertainty quantification. The highly-linked hub and bridge locations in cropland connectivity risk maps are likely priorities for surveillance and management, and for tracing intra-region movement of pathogens and pests. Important locations are identified beyond those locations that simply have high crop density. Cropland connectivity risk maps provide a new risk component for integration with other factors - such as climatic suitability, genetic resistance, and trade routes - to inform Pest Risk Assessment and mitigation.",

Early odor-exposure increases adult chemo-attraction to the same cues.

Naive worms fed on tRNAAla (UGC) purified from odor-experienced worms, acquire odor-specific imprints.\n\nChemo-attractive responses require the tRNA-modifying Elongator complex sub-units 1 (elpc-1) and 3 (elpc-3) genes. elpc-3 deletions impair chemo-attraction, which is fully restored by wild-type tRNAAla (UGC) feeding. A stably inherited decrease of odor-specific responses ensues from early odor-exposition of elpc-1 deletion mutants.\n\ntRNAAla (UGC) may adopt various chemical forms to mediate the cross-talk between innately-programmed and environment-directed chemo-attractive behavior.",

    "abstract": "Ecological communities are jointly structured by dispersal, density-independent responses to environmental conditions and density-dependent biotic interactions. Metacommunity ecology provides a framework for understanding how these processes combine to determine community composition among local sites that are regionally connected through dispersal. In 17 temperate seagrass meadows along the British Columbia coast, we tested the hypothesis that eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) epifaunal invertebrate assemblages are influenced by local environmental conditions, but that high dispersal rates at larger spatial scales dampen effects of environmental differences. We used hierarchical joint species distribution modelling to understand the contribution of environmental conditions, spatial distance between meadows, and species co-occurrences to epifaunal invertebrate abundance and distribution across the region. We found that patterns of taxonomic compositional similarity among meadows were inconsistent with dispersal limitation and meadows in the same region were often no more similar to each other than meadows over 1000 km away. Abiotic environmental conditions (temperature, dissolved oxygen) explained a small fraction of variation in taxonomic abundances patterns across the region. We found novel co-occurrence patterns among taxa that could not be explained by shared responses to environmental gradients, suggesting the possibility that interspecific interactions influence seagrass invertebrate abundance and distribution. Our results add to mounting evidence that suggests that the biodiversity and ecosystem functions provided by seagrass meadows reflect ecological processes occurring both within meadows and across seascapes, and suggest that management of eelgrass habitat for biodiversity may be most effective when both local and regional processes are considered.",

    "abstract": "Severity of motion sickness varies across individuals. While some experience immediate symptoms, others seem relatively immune. We explored a potential explanation for such individual variability based on cue conflict theory. According to cue conflict theory, sensory signals that lead to mutually incompatible perceptual interpretations will produce physical discomfort. A direct consequence of such theory is that individuals with greater sensitivity to visual (or vestibular) sensory cues should show greater susceptibility, because they would be more likely to detect a conflict. Using virtual reality (VR), we first assessed individual sensitivity to a number of visual cues and subsequently induced moderate levels of motion sickness using stereoscopic movies presented in the VR headset. We found that an observers sensitivity to motion parallax cues predicted severity of motion sickness symptoms. We also evaluated evidence for another reported source of variability in motion sickness severity in VR, namely sex, but found little support. We speculate that previously-reported sex differences might have been due to poor personalization of VR displays, which default to male settings and introduce cue conflicts for the majority of females. Our results identify a sensory sensitivity-based predictor of motion sickness, which can be used to personalize VR experiences and mitigate discomfort.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancers display phenotypic and functional heterogeneity and several lines of evidence support the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in certain breast cancers, a minor population of cells capable of tumor initiation and metastatic dissemination. Identifying factors that regulate the CSC phenotype is therefore important for developing strategies to treat metastatic disease. The Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1 (Id1) and its closely related family member Inhibitor of Differentiation 3 (Id3) (collectively termed Id) are expressed by a diversity of stem cells and are required for metastatic dissemination in experimental models of breast cancer. In this study, we show that ID1 is expressed in rare neoplastic cells within ER-negative breast cancers. To address the function of Id1 expressing cells within tumors, we developed two independent murine models of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) in which a genetic reporter permitted the prospective isolation of Id1+ cells. Id1+ cells are enriched for self-renewal in tumorsphere assays in vitro and for tumor initiation in vivo. Conversely, depletion of Id1 and Id3 in the 4T1 murine model of TNBC demonstrates that Id1/3 are required for cell proliferation and self-renewal in vitro, as well as primary tumor growth and metastatic colonization of the lung in vivo. Using combined bioinformatic analysis, we have defined a novel mechanism of Id protein function via negative regulation of the Roundabout Axon Guidance Receptor Homolog 1 (Robo1) leading to activation of a Myc transcriptional programme.",

Here, we quantified PFAS to examine their effects, during pregnancy, on lipid and immune-related markers of T1D risk in children. In a mother-infant cohort (264 dyads), high PFAS exposure during pregnancy associated with decreased cord serum phospholipids and progression to T1D-associated islet autoantibodies in the offspring. This PFAS-lipid association appears exacerbated by increased human leukocyte antigen-conferred risk of T1D in infants. Exposure to a single PFAS compound or a mixture of organic pollutants in non-obese diabetic mice resulted in a lipid profile characterized by a similar decrease in phospholipids, a marked increase of lithocholic acid, and accelerated insulitis. Our findings suggest that PFAS exposure during pregnancy contributes to risk and pathogenesis of T1D in offspring.",

    "abstract": "The coexistence of many competing species is a long-standing puzzle in ecology. Classic niche theory explains coexistence by trade-offs between a few essential species traits. Here we study an unexplored frontier of this theory: we assume that coexistence is intrinsically high-dimensional, arising from many traits and trade-offs at once. Species interactions then appear almost random, but their disorder hides a diffuse statistical structure: competitors that become successful start by subtly favoring each other, and partitioning their impacts on other species. We validate our quantitative predictions using data from grassland biodiversity experiments. We conclude that a high biodiversity can be attained through a pattern of collective organization that cannot be understood at the species level, but exhibits the fingerprint of high-dimensional interactions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe causal role of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in coronary artery disease (CAD) has been questioned. Our aim was to analyze whether genetically determined quantitative and qualitative HDL characteristics were independently associated with CAD.\n\nMethodsWe designed a two-sample multivariate Mendelian randomization study with available genome-wide association summary data. We identified genetic variants associated with HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I quantity, HDL size, particle levels, and lipid content to define our genetic instrumental variables in one sample (Kettunen et al study, N=24,925) and analyzed their association with CAD risk in a different study (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D, N=184,305). We validated these results by defining our genetic variables in another database (METSIM, N=8,372) and studied their relationship with CAD in the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D dataset. To estimate the effect size of the associations of interest adjusted for other lipoprotein traits (potential pleiotropy) we used the Multi-trait-based Conditional & Joint analysis.\n\nResultsGenetically determined HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels were not associated with CAD. HDL mean diameter ({beta}=0.27 [95%CI=0.19; 0.35]), cholesterol levels in very large HDLs ({beta}=0.29 [95%CI=0.17; 0.40]), and triglyceride content in very large HDLs ({beta}=0.14 [95%CI=0.040; 0.25]) were directly associated with CAD risk, whereas the cholesterol content in medium-sized HDLs ({beta}=-0.076 [95%CI=-0.10; -0.052]) was inversely related to this risk. These results were validated in the METSIM-CARDIoGRAMplusC4D data. Genetic variants linked to both HDL qualitative traits and CAD risk were located within LIPC, the APOE/C1/C4/C2 cluster, APOB, PCIF1-PLTP, and TTC39B.\n\nConclusionsSome HDL characteristics related to size, particle distribution, and triglyceride content are related to CAD risk whilst HDL cholesterol levels are not. This relationship could be mediated by the hepatic lipase; the apolipoproteins E, C-I, and B; the phospholipid transfer protein; and the tetratricopeptide repeat domain protein 39B, which arise as potential therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "While drug resistant mutations in HIV-1 is largely credited to its error prone HIV-1 RT, host proteins such as deaminases may also play a role generating mutations. Many HIV-1 RT mutational in vitro studies utilize reporter genes (LacZ) as template, leaving out the possible contribution of HIV codon usage and gene-specific effects. To address this gap, we studied HIV-1 RT mutation rates and bias on its own Gag, protease, and RT p66 genes in an in-vitro selection pressure free system. We found rare clinical mutations with a general avoidance of crucial functional sites in the background mutations rates for Gag, protease and RT p66 at 4.71 x 10-5, 6.03 x 10-5, and 7.09 x 10-5 mutations/bp respectively. Gag and p66 genes showed a large number of  A to G hypermutations likely due to cellular adenosine deaminases. Comparisons with silently mutated p66 sequences showed an increase in mutation rates (1.88 x 10-4 mutations/bp) and that  A to G mutations occurred in regions reminiscent of ADAR neighbour preferences. Mutational free energies by the  A to G mutations revealed an avoidance of destabilizing effects with the natural p66 gene codon usage providing barriers to ADAR effects. Our study demonstrates the importance of studying mutation emergence in HIV genes to understand how fast drug resistance can emerge, sometimes with contributions of host deaminases, providing transferable applications to how new viral diseases and drug resistances can emerge.",

    "abstract": "Nestin, an intermediate filament protein widely used as a marker of neural progenitors, was recently found to be expressed transiently in developing cortical neurons in culture and in developing mouse cortex. In young cortical cultures, nestin regulates axonal growth cone morphology. In addition, nestin, which is known to bind the neuronal cdk5/p35 kinase, affects responses to axon guidance cues upstream of cdk5, specifically, to Sema3a. Changes in growth cone morphology require rearrangements of cytoskeletal networks, and changes in microtubules and actin filaments are well studied. In contrast, the roles of intermediate filament proteins in this process are poorly understood, even in cultured neurons. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism by which nestin affects growth cone morphology and Sema3a sensitivity. We find that nestin selectively facilitates the phosphorylation of the lissencephaly-linked protein doublecortin (DCX) by cdk5/p35, but the phosphorylation of other cdk5 substrates is not affected by nestin. We uncover that this substrate selectivity is based on the ability of nestin to interact with DCX, but not with other cdk5 substrates. Nestin thus creates a selective scaffold for DCX with activated cdk5/p35. Lastly, we use cortical cultures derived from DCX knockout mice to show that the effects of nestin on growth cone morphology and on Sema3a sensitivity are DCX-dependent, thus suggesting a functional role for the DCX-nestin complex in neurons. We propose that nestin changes growth cone behavior by regulating the intracellular kinase signaling environment in developing neurons. The sex of animal subjects is unknown.\n\nSignificance StatementNestin, an intermediate filament protein highly expressed in neural progenitors, was recently identified in developing neurons where it regulates growth cone morphology and responsiveness to the guidance cue Sema3a. Changes in growth cone morphology require rearrangements of cytoskeletal networks, but the roles of intermediate filaments in this process are poorly understood. We now report that nestin selectively facilitates phosphorylation of the lissencephaly-linked doublecortin (DCX) by cdk5/p35, but the phosphorylation of other cdk5 substrates is not affected. This substrate selectivity is based on preferential scaffolding of DCX, cdk5, and p35 by nestin. Additionally, we demonstrate a functional role for the DCX-nestin complex in neurons. We propose that nestin changes growth cone behavior by regulating intracellular kinase signaling in developing neurons.",

    "abstract": "Protein kinases direct polarized growth by regulating the cytoskeleton in time and space, and could play similar roles in cell division. We found that the Cdc42-activated polarity kinase Pak1 colocalizes with the assembling contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and remains at the division site during septation. Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes. Our work defines a new signaling mechanism driven by a cell polarity kinase that promotes CAR assembly in the correct time and place.\n\nSummaryMagliozzi et al. show that fission yeast cell polarity kinase Pak1 regulates cytokinesis.

    "abstract": "Human microbiota plays a key role in human health and growing evidence supports the potential use of microbiome as a predictor of various diseases. However, the high-dimensionality of microbiome data, often in the order of hundreds of thousands, yet low sample sizes, poses great challenge for machine learning-based prediction algorithms. This imbalance induces the data to be highly sparse, preventing from learning a better prediction model. Also, there has been little work on deep learning applications to microbiome data with a rigorous evaluation scheme. To address these challenges, we propose DeepMicro, a deep representation learning framework allowing for an effective representation of microbiome profiles. DeepMicro successfully transforms high-dimensional microbiome data into a robust low-dimensional representation using various autoencoders and applies machine learning classification algorithms on the learned representation. In disease prediction, DeepMicro outperforms the current best approaches based on the strain-level marker profile in five different datasets. In addition, by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the marker profile, DeepMicro accelerates the model training and hyperparameter optimization procedure with 8X-30X speedup over the basic approach.

    "abstract": "Since perceptual and neural face sensitivity is associated with a foveal bias, and neural place sensitivity is associated with a peripheral bias (integration over space), we hypothesized that face perception ability will decline more with eccentricity than place perception ability. We also hypothesized that face perception ability may show an upper visual field (UVF) bias due to the proximity of face-related regions to UVF retinotopic representations, and a left visual field (LeVF) bias due to earlier reports suggesting right hemisphere dominance for faces. Participants performed foveal and parafoveal face and house discrimination tasks for upright or inverted stimuli ([&le;] 4{degrees}) while their eye movements were monitored. Low-level visual tasks were also measured. The eccentricity-related accuracy reductions were evident for all categories. Through detailed analyses we found (i) a robust face inversion effect across the parafovea, while for houses an opposite effect was found, (ii) higher eccentricity-related sensitivity for face performance than for house performance (via inverted vs. upright within-category eccentricity-driven reductions), (iii) within-category but not across-category performance associations across eccentricities, and (iv) no hemifield biases. Our central to parafoveal investigations suggest that high-level vision processing may be reflected in behavioural performance.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria fulfill essential roles in ATP production, metabolic regulation, calcium signaling, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and additional determinants of cellular health. Recent studies have highlighted a role for mitochondria during cell differentiation, including in skin epidermis. The observation of oxidative stress in keratinocytes from Krt16 null mouse skin, a model for pachyonychia congenita (PC)-associated palmoplantar keratoderma, prompted us to examine the role of Keratin (K) 16 protein and its partner K6 in regulating the structure and function of mitochondria. Electron microscopy revealed major anomalies in mitochondrial ultrastructure in late stage, E18.5, Krt6a/Krt6b null embryonic mouse skin. Follow-up studies utilizing biochemical, metabolic, and live imaging readouts showed that, relative to controls, skin keratinocytes null for Krt6a/Krt6b or Krt16 exhibit elevated ROS, reduced mitochondrial respiration, intracellular distribution differences and altered movement of mitochondria within the cell. These findings highlight a novel role for K6 and K16 in regulating mitochondrial morphology, dynamics and function and shed new light on the causes of oxidative stress observed in PC and related keratin-based skin disorders.",

Here we introduce methods for gene-association and variant-interpretation that utilise this powerful signal.\n\nMethodsWe present a case-control rare-variant association test, ClusterBurden, that combines information on both variant-burden and variant-clustering. We then introduce a data-driven modelling framework to estimate mutational hotspots in genes with missense variant-clustering and integrate further in-silico predictors into the models.\n\nResultsWe show that ClusterBurden can increase statistical power to scan for putative disease-genes, driven by missense variants, in simulated data and a 34-gene panel dataset of 5,338 cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We demonstrate that data-driven models can allow quantitative application of the ACMG criteria PM1 and PP3, to resolve a wide range of pathogenicity potential amongst variants of uncertain significance. A web application (Pathogenicity_by_Position) is accessible for missense variant risk prediction of six sarcomeric genes and an R package is available for association testing using ClusterBurden.\n\nConclusionThe inclusion of missense residue position enhances the power of disease-gene association and improves rare-variant pathogenicity interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Growing industrial utilization of enzymes, and the increasing availability of metagenomic data highlights the demand for effective methods of targeted identification and verification of novel enzymes from various environmental microbiota. Xylanases are a class of enzymes with numerous industrial applications and are involved in the degradation of xylose, a component of lignocellulose. Optimum temperature of enzymes are essential factors to be considered when choosing appropriate biocatalysts for a particular purpose. Therefore, in-silico prediction of this attribute is a significant cost and time-effective step in the effort to characterize novel enzymes. The objective of this study was to develop a computational method to predict the thermal dependence of xylanases. This tool was then implemented for targeted screening of putative xylanases with specific thermal dependencies from metagenomic data and resulted in identification of three novel xylanases from sheep and cow rumen microbiota. Here we present TAXyl (Thermal Activity Prediction for Xylanase), a new sequence-based machine learning method that has been trained using a selected combination of various protein features. This random forest classifier discriminates non-thermophilic, thermophilic, and hyper-thermophilic xylanases. Models performance was evaluated through multiple iterations of six-fold cross-validations, and it exhibited a mean accuracy of [~]0.79. TAXyl is freely accessible as a web-service.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic and extrinsic factors that regulate vertebrate photoreceptor specification and differentiation are complex, and our understanding of all the players is far from complete. Her9, the zebrafish ortholog of human HES4, is a basic helix-loop-helix-orange (bHLH-O) transcriptional repressor that regulates neurogenesis in several developmental contexts. We have previously shown that her9 is upregulated during chronic rod photoreceptor degeneration and regeneration in adult zebrafish, but little is known about the role of her9 during retinal development. To better understand the function of Her9 in the retina, we generated zebrafish her9 CRISPR mutants. Her9 homozygous mutants displayed striking retinal phenotypes, including decreased numbers of rods and red/green cones, whereas blue and UV cones were relatively unaffected. The reduction in rods and red/green cones correlated with defects in photoreceptor subtype lineage specification. The remaining rods and double cones displayed abnormally truncated outer segments, and elevated levels of apoptosis. In addition to the photoreceptor defects, her9 mutants also possessed a reduced proliferative ciliary marginal zone, and decreased and disorganized Muller glia. Mutation of her9 was larval lethal, with no mutants surviving past 13 days post fertilization. Our results reveal a previously undescribed role for Her9/Hes4 in photoreceptor differentiation, maintenance, and survival.",

    "abstract": "A frequent assumption in value-based decision-making tasks is that agents make decisions based on the feature dimension that reward probabilities vary on. However, in complex, multidimensional environments, stimuli can vary on multiple dimensions at once, meaning that the feature deserving the most credit for outcomes is not always obvious. As a result, individuals may vary in the strategies used to sample stimuli across dimensions, and these strategies may have an unrecognized influence on decision-making. Sex is a proxy for multiple genetic and endocrine influences that can influence decision-making strategies, including how environments are sampled. In this study, we examined the strategies adopted by female and male mice as they learned the value of stimuli that varied in both image and location in a visually-cued two-armed bandit, allowing two possible dimensions to learn about. Female mice acquired the correct image-value associations more quickly than male mice, and they used a fundamentally different strategy to do so. Female mice constrained their decision-space early in learning by preferentially sampling one location over which images varied. Conversely, male strategies were inconsistent, changing frequently and strongly influenced by the immediate experience of stochastic rewards. Individual strategies were related to sex-gated changes in neuronal activation in early learning. Together, we find that in mice, sex is linked with divergent strategies for sampling and learning about the world, revealing substantial unrecognized variability in the approaches implemented during value-based decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Locomotion control in mammals has been hypothesized to be governed by a central pattern generator (CPG) located in the circuitry of the spinal cord. The most common model of the CPG is the half center model, where two pools of neurons generate alternating, oscillatory activity. In this model, the pools reciprocally inhibit each other ensuring alternating activity. There is experimental support for reciprocal inhibition. However another crucial part of the half center model is a self inhibitory mechanism which prevents the neurons of each individual pool from infinite firing. Self-inhibition is hence necessary to obtain alternating activity. But critical parts of the experimental bases for the proposed mechanisms for self-inhibition were obtained in vitro, in preparations of juvenile animals. The commonly used adaptation of spike firing does not appear to be present in adult animals in vivo. We therefore modeled several possible self inhibitory mechanisms for locomotor control. Based on currently published data, previously proposed hypotheses of the self inhibitory mechanism, necessary to support the CPG hypothesis, seems to be put into question by functional evaluation tests or by in vivo data. This opens for alternative explanations of how locomotion activity patterns in the adult mammal could be generated.\n\nAuthor summaryLocomotion control in animals is hypothesized to be controlled through an intrinsic central pattern generator in the spinal cord. This was proposed over a hundred years ago and has subsequently been formed into a consistent theory, through experimentation and computer modeling. However, critical data that support the neuronal circuitry mechanisms underpinning this theory has been obtained in experiments that greatly differ from intact animals. We propose, after trying to fill in this critical part, that new ideas are required to explain locomotion of intact animals.",

    "abstract": "While rare pathogenic copy-number variants (CNVs) are associated with both neuronal and non-neuronal phenotypes, functional studies evaluating these regions have focused on the molecular basis of neuronal defects. We report a systematic functional analysis of non-neuronal defects for homologs of 59 genes within ten pathogenic CNVs and 20 neurodevelopmental genes in Drosophila melanogaster. Using wing-specific knockdown of 136 RNA interference lines, we identified qualitative and quantitative phenotypes in 72/79 homologs, including 21 lines with severe wing defects and six lines with lethality. In fact, we found that 10/31 homologs of CNV genes also showed complete or partial lethality at larval or pupal stages with ubiquitous knockdown. Comparisons between eye and wing-specific knockdown of 37/45 homologs showed both neuronal and non-neuronal defects, but with no correlation in the severity of defects. We further observed disruptions in cell proliferation and apoptosis in larval wing discs for 23/27 homologs, and altered Wnt, Hedgehog and Notch signaling for 9/14 homologs, including AATF/Aatf, PPP4C/Pp4-19C, and KIF11/Klp61F. These findings were further supported by tissue-specific differences in expression patterns of human CNV genes, as well as connectivity of CNV genes to signaling pathway genes in brain, heart and kidney-specific networks. Our findings suggest that multiple genes within each CNV differentially affect both global and tissue-specific developmental processes within conserved pathways, and that their roles are not restricted to neuronal functions.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYRare copy-number variants (CNVs), or large deletions and duplications in the genome, are associated with both neuronal and non-neuronal clinical features. Previous functional studies for these disorders have primarily focused on understanding the cellular mechanisms for neurological and behavioral phenotypes. To understand how genes within these CNVs contribute to developmental defects in non-neuronal tissues, we assessed 79 homologs of CNV and known neurodevelopmental genes in Drosophila models. We found that most homologs showed developmental defects when knocked down in the adult fly wing, ranging from mild size changes to severe wrinkled wings or lethality. Although a majority of homologs tested showed defects when knocked down specifically in wings and eyes, we found no correlation in the severity of the observed defects in these two tissues. A subset of the homologs showed disruptions in cellular processes in the developing fly wing, including alterations in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cellular signaling pathways. Furthermore, human CNV genes also showed differences in gene expression patterns and interactions with signaling pathway genes across multiple human tissues. Our findings suggest that genes within CNV disorders affect global developmental processes in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues.",

    "abstract": "Living cells segregate molecules and reactions in various subcellular compartments known as organelles. Spatial organization is likely essential for expanding the biochemical functions of synthetic reaction systems, including artificial cells. Many studies have attempted to mimic organelle functions using lamellar membrane-bound vesicles. However, vesicles typically suffer from highly limited transport across the membranes and an inability to mimic the dense membrane networks typically found in organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we describe programmable synthetic organelles based on highly stable nonlamellar sponge phase droplets that spontaneously assemble from a single-chain galactolipid and non-ionic detergents. Due to their nanoporous structure, lipid sponge droplets readily exchange materials with the surrounding environment. In addition, the sponge phase contains a dense network of lipid bilayers and nanometric aqueous channels, which allows different classes of molecules to partition based on their size, polarity, and specific binding motifs. The sequestration of biologically relevant macromolecules can be programmed by the addition of suitably functionalized amphiphiles to the droplets. We demonstrate that droplets can harbor functional soluble and transmembrane proteins, allowing for the co-localization and concentration of enzymes and substrates to enhance reaction rates. Droplets protect bound proteins from proteases, and these interactions can be engineered to be reversible and optically controlled. Our results show that lipid sponge droplets permit the facile integration of membrane-rich environments and self-assembling spatial organization with biochemical reaction systems.\n\nSignificance statementOrganelles spatially and temporally orchestrate biochemical reactions in a cell to a degree of precision that is still unattainable in synthetic reaction systems. Additionally, organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contain highly interconnected and dense membrane networks that provide large reaction spaces for both transmembrane and soluble enzymes. We present lipid sponge droplets to emulate the functions of organelles such as the ER. We demonstrate that lipid sponge droplets can be programmed to internally concentrate specific proteins, host and accelerate biochemical transformations, and to rapidly and reversibly sequester and release proteins to control enzymatic reactions. The self-assembled and programmable nature of lipid sponge droplets will facilitate the integration of complex functions for bottom up synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "Challenging the paradigm of the maximum tolerated dose, recent studies have shown that a strategy aiming for containment, not elimination, can control tumor burden more effectively in vitro, in mouse models, and in the clinic. These outcomes are consistent with the hypothesis that emergence of resistance to cancer therapy may be prevented or delayed by exploiting competitive ecological interactions between drug-sensitive and resistant tumor cell subpopulations. However, although various mathematical and computational models have been proposed to explain the superiority of particular containment strategies, this evolutionary approach to cancer therapy lacks a rigorous theoretical foundation. Here we combine extensive mathematical analysis and numerical simulations to establish general conditions under which a containment strategy is expected to control tumor burden more effectively than applying the maximum tolerated dose. We show that when resistant cells are present, an idealized strategy of containing a tumor at a maximum tolerable size maximizes time to treatment failure (that is, the time at which tumor burden becomes intolerable). These results are very general and do not depend on any fitness cost of resistance. We further provide formulas for predicting the clinical benefits attributable to containment strategies in a wide range of scenarios, and we compare outcomes of theoretically optimal treatments with those of more practical protocols. Our results strengthen the rationale for clinical trials of evolutionarily-informed cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Yellow fever virus (YFV) is an RNA virus primarily targeting the liver. Severe YF cases are responsible for hemorrhagic fever, plausibly precipitated by excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), such as the cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and the viral RNA sensor PKR are known to initiate a pro-inflammatory response upon recognition of viral genomes. Here, we sought to reveal the main determinants responsible for the acute cytokine expression occurring in human hepatocytes following YFV infection. Using a RIG-I-defective human hepatoma cell line, we found that RIG-I largely contributes to cytokine secretion upon YFV infection. In infected RIG-I-proficient hepatoma cells, RIG-I was localized in stress granules. These granules are large aggregates of stalled translation preinitiation complexes known to concentrate RLRs and PKR, and are so far recognized as hubs orchestrating RNA virus sensing. Using PKR-deficient hepatoma cells, we found that PKR contributes to both stress granule formation and cytokine induction upon YFV infection. However, stress granules disruption did not affect the cytokine response to YFV infection, as assessed by siRNA-knockdown-mediated inhibition of stress granule assembly. Finally, no viral RNA was detected in stress granules using a fluorescence in situ hybridization approach coupled with immunofluorescence. Our findings suggest that both RIG-I and PKR mediate pro-inflammatory cytokine induction in YFV-infected hepatocytes, in a stress granule-independent manner. Therefore, by showing the uncoupling of the early cytokine response from the stress granules formation, our model challenges the current view by which stress granules are required for the mounting of the acute antiviral response.\n\nImportanceYellow fever is a mosquito-borne acute hemorrhagic disease caused by yellow fever virus (YFV). The mechanisms responsible for its pathogenesis remain largely unknown, although increased inflammation has been linked to worsened outcome. YFV targets the liver, where it primarily infects hepatocytes. We found that two RNA-sensing proteins, RIG-I and PKR, participate in the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators in human hepatocytes infected with YFV. We show that YFV infection promotes the formation of cytoplasmic structures, termed stress granules, in a PKR-, but not RIG-I-dependent manner. Whilst stress granules were previously postulated to be essential platforms for immune activation, we found that they are not required for pro-inflammatory mediators production upon YFV infection. Collectively, our work uncovered molecular events triggered by the replication of YFV, which could prove instrumental in clarifying the pathogenesis of the disease, with possible repercussions on disease management.",

We previously developed an approach to identify novel Numt polymorphisms from next generation sequence data and applied it to thousands of human genomes. Here, we extend this analysis to 79 individuals of other great ape species including chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orang-utan and also an old world monkey, macaque. We show that recent Numt insertions are prevalent in each species though at different apparent rates, with chimpanzees exhibiting a significant increase in both polymorphic and fixed Numt sequences as compared to other great apes. We further assessed positional effects in each species in terms of evolutionary time and rate of insertion and identified putative hotspots on chromosome 5 for Numt integration, providing insight into both recent polymorphic and older fixed reference NumtS in great apes in comparison to human events.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is associated with persistent structural and functional changes throughout the neuroaxis, including in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The PFC is important in the integration of sensory, cognitive and emotional information and in conditioned pain modulation. We previously reported wide-spread epigenetic reprogramming in the PFC many months following nerve injury in rodents. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, can drive changes in gene expression without modifying DNA sequences. To date, little is known about epigenetic dysregulation at the onset of acute pain or how it progresses as pain transitions from acute to chronic. We hypothesize that acute pain following injury results in rapid and persistent epigenetic remodelling in the PFC that evolves as pain becomes chronic. We further propose that understanding epigenetic remodelling will provide insights into the mechanisms driving pain-related changes in the brain. Epigenome-wide analysis was performed in the mouse PFC 1 day, 2 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year following peripheral injury using the spared nerve injury (SNI) in mice. SNI resulted in rapid and persistent changes in DNA methylation, with robust differential methylation observed between SNI and sham-operated control mice at all time points. Hundreds of differentially methylated genes were identified, including many with known function in pain. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment in genes related to stimulus response at early time points, immune function at later time points and actin and cytoskeletal regulation throughout the time course. Increased attention to pain chronicity as a factor is recommended for both pain research and management.",

    "abstract": "A new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID-19 virus is the etiological agent responsible for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan1-4. Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus5,6. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 M. Ebselen also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria closely control gene expression to ensure optimal physiological responses to their environment. Such careful gene expression can minimize the fitness cost associated with antibiotic resistance. We previously described a novel regulatory logic in Bacillus subtilis enabling the cell to directly monitor its need for detoxification. This cost-effective strategy is achieved via a two-component regulatory system (BceRS) working in a sensory complex with an ABC-transporter (BceAB), together acting as a flux-sensor where signaling is proportional to transport activity. How this is realized at the molecular level has remained unknown. Using experimentation and computation we here show that the histidine kinase is activated by piston-like displacements in the membrane, which are converted to helical rotations in the catalytic core via an intervening HAMP-like domain. Intriguingly, the transporter was not only required for kinase activation, but also to actively maintain the kinase in its inactive state in the absence of antibiotics. Such coupling of kinase activity to that of the transporter ensures the complete control required for transport flux-dependent signaling. Moreover, we show that the transporter likely conserves energy by signaling with sub-maximal sensitivity. These results provide the first mechanistic insights into transport flux-dependent signaling, a unique strategy for energy-efficient decision making.",

    "abstract": "Distinct patterns of dinucleotide representation, such as CpG and UpA suppression, are characteristic of certain viral genomes. Recent research has uncovered vertebrate immune mechanisms that select against specific dinucleotides in targeted viruses. This evidence highlights the importance of systematically examining the dinucleotide composition of viral genomes. We have developed a novel metric, called Synonymous Dinucleotide Usage (SDU), for quantifying dinucleotide representation in coding sequences. Our method compares the abundance of a given dinucleotide to the null hypothesis of equal synonymous codon usage in the sequence. We present a Python3 package, DinuQ, for calculating SDU and other relevant metrics. We have applied this method on two sets of invertebrate- and vertebrate-specific flaviviruses and rhabdoviruses. The SDU shows that the vertebrate viruses exhibit consistently greater under-representation of CpG dinucleotides in all three codon positions in both datasets. In comparison to existing metrics for dinucleotide quantification, the SDU allows for a statistical interpretation of its values by comparing it to a null expectation based on the codon table. Here we apply the method to viruses, but coding sequences of other living organisms can be analysed in the same way.",

Yet, it remains unclear how C4A interacts with other SCZ risk genes and whether the complement system is more broadly implicated in SCZ pathogenesis. Here, we integrate several existing, large-scale genetic and transcriptomic datasets to interrogate the functional role of the complement system and C4A in the human brain. Surprisingly, we find no significant genetic enrichment among known complement system genes for SCZ. Conversely, brain co-expression network analyses using C4A as a seed gene revealed that genes down-regulated when C4A expression increased exhibit strong and specific genetic enrichment for SCZ risk. This convergent genomic signal reflected neuronal, synaptic processes and was sexually dimorphic and most prominent in frontal cortical brain regions. Overall, these results indicate that synaptic pathways--rather than the complement system--are the driving force conferring SCZ risk.",

Here we only consider the molecular level, which can also have effects on the macroscopic level. It is known that the proteinogenic amino acids differ in their modification susceptibilities and this can affect the function of proteins. For this it is important to know the distribution of amino acids between the protein surface/shell and the core. This was investigated in this study for all known structural data of peptides and proteins. As a result it is shown that the surface contains less susceptible amino acids than the core with the exception of thermophilic organisms. Furthermore, proteins could be classified according to their susceptibility. This can then be used in applications such as phylogeny, aging research, molecular medicine and synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "The actin cytoskeleton assembles into diverse load-bearing networks including stress fibers, muscle sarcomeres, and the cytokinetic ring to both generate and sense mechanical forces. The LIM (Lin11, Isl-1 & Mec-3) domain family is functionally diverse, but most members can associate with the actin cytoskeleton with apparent force-sensitivity. Zyxin rapidly localizes via its LIM domains to failing stress fibers in cells, known as strain sites, to initiate stress fiber repair and maintain mechanical homeostasis. The mechanism by which these LIM domains associate with stress fiber strain sites is not known. Additionally, it is unknown how widespread strain sensing is within the LIM protein family. We observe that many, but not all, LIM domains from functionally diverse proteins localize to spontaneous or induced stress fiber strain sites in mammalian cells. Additionally, the LIM domain region from the fission yeast protein paxillin like 1 (Pxl1) also localizes to stress fiber strain sites in mammalian cells, suggesting that the strain sensing mechanism is ancient and highly conserved. Sequence analysis and mutagenesis of the LIM domain region of zyxin indicate a requirement of tandem LIM domains, which contribute additively, for sensing stress fiber strain sites. In vitro, purified LIM domains from mammalian zyxin and fission yeast Pxl1 bind to mechanically stressed F-actin networks but do not associate with relaxed actin filaments. We propose that tandem LIM domains recognize an F-actin conformation that is rare in the relaxed state but is enriched in the presence of mechanical stress.",

    "abstract": "Human red blood cells (RBCs) have a circulatory lifespan of about four months. Under constant oxidative and mechanical stress, but devoid of organelles and deprived of biosynthetic capacity for protein renewal, RBCs undergo substantial homeostatic changes, progressive densification followed by late density reversal among others, changes assumed to have been harnessed by evolution to sustain the rheological competence of the RBCs for as long as possible. The unknown mechanisms by which this is achieved are the subject of this investigation. Each RBC traverses capillaries between 1000 and 2000 times per day, roughly one transit per minute, a total of about 2*105 transits during their lifespan. A dedicated Lifespan model of RBC homeostasis was developed as an extension of the RCM introduced in the first paper of this series to explore the cumulative patterns predicted for repetitive capillary transits over a standardized lifespan period of 120 days, using experimental data to constrain the parameter space. Capillary transits were simulated by periods of elevated cell/medium volume ratios and by transient deformation-induced permeability changes attributed to PIEZO1 channel mediation as outlined in the second paper of this series. The first unexpected finding was that quantal changes generated during single capillary transits cease accumulating after a few days and cannot account for the observed progressive densification of RBCs on their own, thus ruling out the quantal hypothesis. The second unexpected finding was that the documented patterns of RBC densification and late reversal could only be emulated by the implementation of a strict time-course of decay in the activities of the calcium and Na/K pumps, but only in addition to the quantal changes. These results showed that both quantal changes and pump-decay regimes were necessary to account for the documented lifespan pattern, neither sufficient on their own. They also suggested a strong selective component in the pump decay sequence. A third finding was that RBCs exposed to levels of calcium permeation above certain thresholds in the circulation could develop a pattern of late or early hyperdense collapse followed by delayed density reversal. When tested over much reduced lifespan periods the results emulated the known circulatory fate of irreversible sickle cells, the cell subpopulation responsible for vaso-occlusion and for most of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease. Analysis of the results provided an insightful new understanding of the mechanisms driving the changes in RBC homeostasis during circulatory aging in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "In this and the next paper of this series we apply the red cell model introduced in the previous paper to investigate the changes in RBC homeostasis during capillary transits and over the full circulatory lifespan of the cells. These are topics inaccessible to direct experimentation but rendered mature for a modelling approach by recent findings and by a large body of apparently unrelated early results which robustly constrain the parameter space offering the opportunity for an in depth study of the mechanisms involved. Capillary transit times vary between 0.5 and 1.5s during which the red blood cells squeeze and deform in the capillary stream transiently opening stress-gated PIEZO1 channels, creating minuscule quantal changes in RBC ion contents and volume. Widely accepted early views originally based on results from experimentally shear-stressed red cells suggested that quantal changes generated during capillary transits add up over time to generate the documented changes in RBC density during their long circulatory lifespan, the quantal hypothesis. Applying the new PIEZO1 extension of the RBC model (RCM) introduced in the previous paper we investigated in detail the changes in homeostatic variables that may be expected during single capillary transits resulting from transient PIEZO1 channel activation. The predicted quantal volume changes were infinitesimal in magnitude, biphasic in nature, and essentially irreversible within inter-transit periods. A sub-second transient PIEZO1 activation triggered a sharp swelling peak followed by a much slower recovery period towards lower-than-baseline volumes. The peak response was caused by net CaCl2 and fluid gain via PIEZO1 channels driven by the steep electrochemical inward Ca2+ gradient. The ensuing dehydration followed a complex time-course with sequential, but partially overlapping contributions by KCl loss via Ca2+-activated Gardos channels, PMCA mediated calcium extrusion and chloride efflux by the Jacobs-Steward mechanism. The change in relative cell volume predicted for single capillary transits was below 10-4, an infinitesimal volume change incompatible with a functional role in capillary flow. The biphasic response predicted by the RCM appears to conform to the quantal hypothesis, but whether its cumulative effects could account for the documented changes in density during RBC senescence required an investigation of the effects of myriad transits over the full period of circulatory lifespan, the subject of the next paper of this series.",

The emergence of the cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype represents a major challenge to disease management and durable treatment response. The extrinsic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that result in CSC enrichment are not well understood. The CSC state endows cells with a fluid metabolic profile, enabling the utilization of multiple nutrient sources. Therefore, to test the impact of diet on CSC enrichment, we evaluated disease progression in tumor-bearing mice fed an obesity-inducing high-fat diet (HFD) versus an energy-balanced, low-fat control diet. HFD consumption resulted in hyper-aggressive disease that was accompanied by CSC enrichment and shortened survival. HFD consumption also drove intracerebral accumulation of saturated fats, which in turn inhibited the production and signaling of the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S). H2S is an endogenously produced bio-active metabolite derived from sulfur amino acid catabolism. It functions principally through protein S-sulfhydration and regulates a variety of programs including mitochondrial bioenergetics and cellular metabolism. Inhibition of H2S synthesis resulted in increased proliferation and chemotherapy resistance, whereas treatment with H2S donors led to cytotoxicity and death of cultured GBM cells. Compared to non-cancerous controls, patient GBM specimens were reduced in overall protein S-sulfhydration, which was primarily lost from proteins regulating cellular metabolism. These findings support the hypothesis that diet-regulated H2S signaling serves to suppress GBM by restricting metabolic adaptability, while its loss triggers CSC enrichment and disease acceleration. Interventions augmenting H2S bioavailability concurrent with GBM standard of care may improve outcomes for GBM patients.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryConsumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) accelerates glioblastoma (GBM) by inhibiting the production and signaling of the tumor-suppressive metabolite hydrogen sulfide (H2S).",

Among these, isobutanol, which is derived from valine degradation, has received substantial attention due to its promise as an advanced biofuel. While Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the preferred organism for isobutanol production, the lack of isobutanol biosensors in this organism has limited the ability to screen strains at high throughput. Here, we use a transcriptional regulator of BCAA biosynthesis, Leu3p, to develop the first genetically encoded biosensor for isobutanol production in yeast. Small modifications allowed us to redeploy Leu3p in a second biosensor for isopentanol, another BCAA-derived product of interest. Each biosensor is highly specific to isobutanol or isopentanol, respectively, and was used to engineer metabolic enzymes to increase titers. The isobutanol biosensor was additionally employed to isolate high-producing strains, and guide the construction and enhancement of mitochondrial and cytosolic isobutanol biosynthetic pathways, including in combination with optogenetic actuators to enhance metabolic flux. These biosensors promise to accelerate the development of enzymes and strains for branched-chain higher alcohol production, and offer a blueprint to develop biosensors for other products derived from BCAA metabolism.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOrgans precisely regulate their size and shape to ensure proper function1-6. The contribution of organ initiation timing to final organ size and shape is often masked by compensatory adjustments to growth later in development7-9. Here we show that DEVELOPMENT RELATED MYB-LIKE1 (DRMY1) is required for both proper organ initiation timing and growth leading to robust sepal size in Arabidopsis. Within each drmy1 flower, the initiation of some sepals is variably delayed. Late-initiating sepals in drmy1 mutants remain smaller throughout development resulting in variability in sepal size. DRMY1 focuses the spatiotemporal signaling patterns of the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin, which jointly control the timing of sepal initiation. Contrary to expectation, our findings demonstrate that timing of organ initiation contributes to robust organ size throughout development.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the Trypanosoma brucei aquaporin AQP2 are associated with resistance to pentamidine and melarsoprol. We show that TbAQP2 but not TbAQP3 was positively selected for increased pore size from a common ancestor aquaporin. We demonstrate that TbAQP2s unique architecture permits pentamidine permeation through its central pore and show how specific mutations in highly conserved motifs affect drug permeation. Introduction of key TbAQP2 amino acids into TbAQP3 renders the latter permeable to pentamidine. Molecular dynamics demonstrates that permeation by dicationic pentamidine is energetically favourable in TbAQP2, driven by the membrane potential, although aquaporins are normally strictly impermeable for ionic species. We also identify the structural determinants that make pentamidine a permeant but exclude most other diamidine drugs. Our results have wide-ranging implications for optimising antitrypanosomal drugs and averting cross-resistance. Moreover, these new insights in aquaporin permeation may allow the pharmacological exploitation of other members of this ubiquitous gene family.",

    "abstract": "Initiation and progression of cancers reflect the underlying process of somatic evolution, which follows a Darwinian logic, i.e., diversification of heritable phenotypes provides a substrate for natural selection, resulting in the outgrowth of the most fit subpopulations. Although somatic evolution can tap into multiple sources of diversification, it is assumed to lack access to (para)sexual recombination - a key diversification mechanism throughout all strata of life. Based on observations of spontaneous fusions involving cancer cells, reported genetic instability of polypoid cells, and precedence of fusion-mediated parasexual recombination in fungi, we asked whether cell fusions could serve as a source of parasexual recombination in cancer cell populations. Using differentially labelled tumor cells, we found evidence of low-frequency, spontaneous cell fusions between carcinoma cells in multiple cell line models of breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. While some hybrids remained polyploid, many displayed partial ploidy reduction, generating diverse progeny with heterogeneous inheritance of parental alleles, indicative of partial recombination. Hybrid cells also displayed elevated levels of phenotypic plasticity, which may further amplify the impact of cell fusions on the diversification of phenotypic traits. Using mathematical modeling, we demonstrated that the observed rates of spontaneous somatic cell fusions may enable populations of tumor cells to amplify clonal heterogeneity, thus facilitating the exploration of larger areas of the adaptive landscape, relative to strictly asexual populations, which may substantially accelerate a tumors ability to adapt to new selective pressures.",

New genomic mapping methods can reveal chromosome positioning relative to specific nuclear structures. However, computational methods that integrate their results to identify overall intranuclear chromo-some positioning have not yet been developed. We report SPIN, a new method to identify genome-wide nuclear spatial localization patterns. As a proof-of-principle, we use SPIN to integrate nuclear compartment mapping (TSA-seq and DamID) and chromatin interaction data (Hi-C) from K562 cells to identify 10 spatial compartmentalization states genome-wide relative to nuclear speckles, lamina, and nucleoli. These SPIN states show novel patterns of genome spatial organization and their relation to genome function (transcription and replication timing). Comparisons of SPIN states with Hi-C sub-compartments and lamina-associated domains (LADs) from multiple cell types suggest constitutive compartmentalization patterns. By integrating different readouts of higher-order genome organization, SPIN provides critical insights into nuclear spatial and functional compartmentalization.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) were recognized as an important class of proteins in all domains of life for their functional importance. However, how nature has shaped the disorder potential of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins is still not clearly known. Randomly generated sequences are free of any selective constraints thus these sequences are commonly used as null models. Considering different types of random protein models here we seek to understand how disorder potential of natural eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins differs from random sequences. Comparing proteome-wide disorder content between real and random sequences of 12 model organisms we noticed that while in eukaryotes natural sequences tend to be more disordered than random sequences prokaryotes follow an opposite trend. By analyzing position-wise disorder profile, here we showed that there is a general trend of higher disorder near the N and C-terminal regions of eukaryotic proteins as compared to the random models; however, either no or a weak such trend was found in prokaryotic proteins. Moreover here we showed that this preference is not due to the biases either in the amino acid or nucleotide composition or other factors at the respective sites. Instead, these regions were found to be endowed with a higher fraction of protein-protein binding sites suggesting their functional importance. Here, we proposed various explanations for this pattern such as improving the efficiency of protein-protein interaction, ribosome movement, and post-translational modification, etc. However, further studies are needed to clearly understand the biophysical mechanisms causing the trend.",

    "abstract": "We describe a method for rapid in silico selection of diagnostic peptides from newly described viral pathogens and applied this approach to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. This approach is multi-tiered, beginning with compiling the theoretical protein sequences from genomic derived data. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 we begin with 496 peptides that would be produced by proteolytic digestion of the viral proteins. To eliminate peptides that would cause cross-reactivity and false positives we remove peptides from consideration that have sequence homology or similar chemical characteristics using a progressively larger database of background peptides. Using this pipeline, we can remove 47 peptides from consideration as diagnostic due to the presence of peptides derived from the human proteome. To address the complexity of the human microbiome, we describe a method to create a database of all proteins of relevant abundance in the saliva microbiome. By utilizing a protein-based approach to the microbiome we can more accurately identify peptides that will be problematic in COVID-19 studies which removes 12 peptides from consideration. To identify diagnostic peptides, another 7 peptides are flagged for removal following comparison to the proteome backgrounds of viral and bacterial pathogens of similar clinical presentation. By aligning the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 field isolates deposited to date we can identify peptides for removal due to their presence in highly variable regions that may lead to false negatives as the pathogen evolves. We provide maps of these regions and highlight 3 peptides that should be avoided as potential diagnostic or vaccine targets. Finally, we leverage publicly deposited proteomics data from human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as a second study with the closely related MERS-CoV to identify the two proteins of highest abundance in human infections. The resulting final list contains the 24 peptides most unique and diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These peptides represent the best targets for the development of antibodies are clinical diagnostics. To demonstrate one application of this we model peptide fragmentation using a deep learning tool to rapidly generate targeted LCMS assays and data processing method for detecting CoVID-19 infected patient samples.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/980383v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7fd4borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@136563borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57641dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16de9a4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Decision-making is a complex process essential to daily adaptation in many species. Risk is an inherent aspect of decision-making and it is influenced by gonadal hormones. Testosterone and 17{beta}-estradiol may modulate decision making and impact the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway. Here, we explored sex differences, the effect of gonadal hormones and the dopamine agonist amphetamine on risk-based decision making. Intact or gonadectomised (GDX) male and female rats underwent to a probabilistic discounting task. High and low doses of testosterone propionate (1.0 or 0.2 mg) and 17{beta}-estradiol benzoate (0.3 g) were administered to assess acute effects on risk-based decision making. After 3-days of washout period, intact and GDX rats received high or low (0.5 or 0.125 mg/kg) doses of amphetamine and re-tested in the probabilistic discounting task. Under baseline conditions, males made more risky choices during probability discounting compared to female rats, particularly in the lower probability blocks, but GDX did not influence risky choice. The high, but not the low dose, of testosterone modestly reduced risky decision making in GDX male rats. Conversely, 17{beta}-estradiol had no significant effect on risky choice regardless of GDX status in either sex. Lastly, a higher dose of amphetamine increased risky decision making in both intact males and females, but had no effect in GDX rats. These findings demonstrated sex differences in risk-based decision making, with males showing a stronger bias towards larger, uncertain rewards. GDX status influenced the effects of amphetamine, suggesting different dopaminergic regulation in risk-based choices among males and females.",

Most metacaspases require Ca2+ for their activation and substrate processing 6-8. However, the Ca2+-dependent activation mechanism remains elusive 9-11. Here we report the crystal structure of Metacaspase 4 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtMC4) that modulates Ca2+-dependent, damage-induced plant immune defense. The AtMC4 structure exhibits an inhibitory conformation in which a large linker domain blocks activation and substrate access. In addition, the side chain of Lys225 in the linker domain blocks the active site by sitting directly between two catalytic residues. We show that the activation of AtMC4 and cleavage of its physiological substrate involve multiple cleavages in the linker domain upon activation by Ca2+. Our analysis provides insight into the Ca2+-dependent activation of AtMC4 and lays the basis for tuning its activity in response to stresses that may help engineer more sustainable crops for production of food and biofuel.",

Through large scale analysis of 1594 patients with GI cancers coupled with in vitro models we find KCNQ family genes are mutated in ~30% of patients, and play therapeutically targetable roles in GI cancer growth. KCNQ1 and KCNQ3 mediate the WNT pathway and MYC to increase proliferation, and its resultant effects on cadherins junctions. This also highlights novel roles for KCNQ3 in non-excitable tissues. We additionally discover that activity of KCNQ3 sensitises cancer cells to existing potassium channel inhibitors, and that inhibition of KCNQ activity reduces proliferation of GI cancer. These findings reveal a novel and exploitable role for potassium channels in the advancement of human cancer, and highlight that supplemental treatments for GI cancers may exist through KCNQ inhibitors.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEKCNQ channels modulate the WNT pathway and MYC signalling, and drive growth of gastrointestinal cancers.

Analyzing trial-to-trial noise-correlations between neural units in the presence of rewarding (R) and non-rewarding (NR) stimuli adds to our understanding of cortical network dynamics. We utilized Pearsons correlation coefficient to measure shared variability between simultaneously recorded units (32 - 112) and found significantly higher noise-correlation and positive correlation between the populations signal- and noise-correlation during NR trials as compared to R trials. This pattern is evident in data from two non-human primates (NHPs) during single-target center out reaching tasks, both manual and action observation versions. We conducted mean matched noise-correlation analysis in order to decouple known interactions between event triggered firing rate changes and neural correlations. Isolated reward discriminatory units demonstrated stronger correlational changes than units unresponsive to reward firing rate modulation, however the qualitative response was similar, indicating correlational changes within the network as a whole can serve as another information channel to be exploited by BCIs that track the underlying cortical state, such as reward expectation, or attentional modulation. Reward expectation and attention in return can be utilized with reinforcement learning towards autonomous BCI updating.",

The first phase generates pre-sacral structures (the so-called primary body) through the activity of the primitive streak (PS) on axial progenitors within the epiblast. The embryo then switches to generate the secondary body (post-sacral structures), which depends on axial progenitors in the tail bud. Here we show that the mammalian tail bud is generated through an independent developmental module, concurrent but functionally different to that generating the primary body. This module is triggered by convergent Tgf{beta}RI and Snai1 activities that promote an incomplete epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) on a subset of epiblast axial progenitors. This EMT is functionally different to that coordinated by the PS, as it does not lead to mesodermal differentiation but brings axial progenitors into a transitory state, keeping their progenitor activity to drive further axial body extension.",

    "abstract": "Cocaine addiction is a chronic illness characterized by maladaptive drug-induced neuroplastic changes that confer lasting vulnerability to relapse. Over several weeks we observed the effects of the M1 receptor-selective agonist VU0364572 in adult male rats that self-administer cocaine in a cocaine vs. natural reinforcer choice procedure. The drug showed unusual long-lasting effects, as rats gradually stopped self-administering cocaine, reallocating behavior towards the food reinforcer. The effect lasted as long as tested and at least four weeks. To begin to elucidate how VU0364572 modulates cocaine self-administration, we then examined its long-term effects using dual-probe in vivo dopamine and glutamate microdialysis in nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex, and ex vivo striatal dopamine reuptake. Microdialysis revealed dramatic decreases in cocaine-induced dopamine and glutamate outflow four weeks after VU0364572 treatment, without significant changes in dopamine uptake function. These lasting and dramatic effects of M1 receptor stimulation reinforce our interest in this target as potential treatment of cocaine addiction. M1 receptors are known to modulate medium spiny neuron responses to corticostriatal glutamatergic signaling acutely, and we hypothesize that VU0364572 may oppose the addiction-related effects of cocaine by causing lasting changes in this system.",

    "abstract": "The daily changes of light and dark exemplify a prominent cue for the synchronization of internal circadian clocks to external time. The match between external and internal time is crucial for the fitness of organisms and desynchronization has been linked to numerous physical and mental health problems in humans. Organisms therefore developed complex and not fully understood mechanisms to synchronize their circadian clock to light. In mammals and in Drosophila both the visual system and dedicated non-image forming photoreceptors contribute to light resetting of the circadian clock. In the fruit fly, light-dependent degradation of the clock protein TIMELESS (TIM) by the blue light photoreceptor Cryptochrome is considered the main mechanism for clock synchronization, although the visual system also contributes. In order to understand the nature of the visual system contribution, we generated a genetic variant exhibiting extremely slow phototransduction kinetics, yet normal sensitivity. We show that in this variant the visual system is able to contribute its full share to circadian clock entrainment, both with regard to behavioral and molecular synchronization to light:dark cycles. This function depends on an alternative Phospholipase C-{beta} enzyme, encoded by PLC21C, presumably playing a dedicated role in clock resetting by light. We show that this pathway requires the ubiquitin ligase CULLIN-3, presumably mediating CRY-independent degradation of TIM during light:dark cycles. Our results suggest that visual system contribution to circadian clock entrainment operates on a drastically slower time scale compared with fast, visual and image forming phototransduction. Our findings are therefore consistent with the general idea that the visual system samples light over prolonged periods of time (hours) in order to reliably synchronize their internal clocks with the external time.",

    "abstract": "Shifting interactions between MADS-box transcription factors may have been critical in the emergence of the flower, and in floral diversification. However, how evolutionary variation in MADS-box interactions affects the development and evolution of floral form remains unknown. Interactions between B-class MADS-box proteins are variable across the grass family. Here, we test the functional consequences of this evolutionary variability using maize as an experimental system. We found that differential B-class dimerization was associated with subtle, quantitative differences in stamen shape. In contrast, differential dimerization resulted in large-scale changes to protein complex composition and downstream gene expression. Differential dimerization also affected B-class complex abundance, independent of RNA levels. Thus, differential dimerization may affect protein stability. This reveals an important consequence for evolutionary variability in MADS-box interactions, adding complexity to the evolution of developmental gene networks. Our results show that floral development is robust to molecular change, even coding change in a master regulator of development. This robustness may contribute to the evolvability of floral form.",

    "abstract": "Identifying protein-protein interactions (PPI) is crucial for understanding biological processes. Many PPI tools are available, yet only some function within the context of a plant cell. Narrowing down even further, only a few tools allow complex multi-protein interactions to be visualized. Here, we present a conditional in vivo PPI tool for plant research that meets these criteria. Knocksideways in plants (KSP) is based on the ability of rapamycin to alter the localization of a bait protein and its interactors via the heterodimerization of FKBP and FRB domains. KSP is inherently free from many limitations of other PPI systems. This in vivo tool does not require spatial proximity of the bait and prey fluorophores and it is compatible with a broad range of fluorophores. KSP is also a conditional tool and therefore the visualization of the proteins in the absence of rapamycin acts as an internal control. We used KSP to confirm previously identified interactions in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells. Furthermore, the scripts that we generated allow the interactions to be quantified at high throughput. Finally, we demonstrate that KSP can easily be used to visualize complex multi-protein interactions. KSP is therefore a versatile tool with unique characteristics and applications that complements other plant PPI methods.",

    "abstract": "NCoR-1 and NCoR-2 are transcriptional corepressors encoded in vertebrates by two interrelated loci and play distinct, though overlapping, roles in development, differentiation, and homeostasis. In contrast NCoR is encoded by a single locus in cephalochordates, urochordates, hemichordates, and echinoderms, with vertebrate NCoR-1 and NCoR-2 thought to be the products of a gene duplication originating near the beginning of vertebrate evolution. The structures, molecular properties, and functions of extant NCoR-1 and NCoR-2 are each substantially further diversified by alternative mRNA splicing; however it is unresolved as to whether the alternative-splicing observed in current day vertebrates reflects patterns present in the ancestral common gene or instead arose after the NCoR duplication event. This manuscript reports that Amphioxus, a cephalochordate considered representative of the organisms that gave rise to the vertebrate lineage, lacks the alternative NCoR splicing events characteristic of vertebrates. This, together with prior taxonomic comparisons, suggests that the patterns of corepressor splicing found in existing vertebrates arose exclusively after the NCoR duplication event. Further, given that alternative-splicing of NCoR-1 and NCoR-2 appears to have arisen by a mix of convergent and divergent evolution, it is likely that both common and distinct selective pressures were operative on these corepressor paralogs after their divergence.",

We performed a high dimensional single cell analysis of systemic immunity in pediatric cancer patients and age-matched healthy children. In young children with cancer (age < 8years) NK cells were decreased in frequency, maturity, expression of perforin and granzyme-B, and were less cytotoxic in ex vivo assays. NK cell activity was restored after in vitro culture with interleukin-2. In contrast, older children with cancer (>8 years old) had decreased naive CD4 and CD8 T-cells with concomitant increases in effector memory and T effector memory RA-revertant (TEMRA) T-cells. These immunological changes in pediatric cancer patients are relevant to the better understanding of how cancers diagnosed in childhood interact with systemic immunity and could inform the development and application of effective immune-modulating therapies in the pediatric population.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryHigh dimensional analysis of systemic immunity in pediatric cancer patients reveals clinically relevant immune changes in NK and T-cells that vary with patient age.",

    "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy with distributed hippocampal seizure foci is often intractable and its secondary generalization might lead to sudden death. Early termination through spatially extensive hippocampal intervention is not feasible directly, due to its large size and irregular shape. In contrast, the medial septum (MS) is a promising target to govern hippocampal oscillations through its divergent connections to both hippocampi. Combining this  proxy intervention concept and precisely timed stimulation, we report here that closed-loop MS electrical stimulation can quickly terminate intrahippocampal seizures and suppress secondary generalization in a rat kindling model. Precise stimulus timing governed by internal seizure rhythms was essential. Cell-type-specific stimulation revealed that precisely timed activation of MS GABAergic neurons underlay the effects. Our concept of phase-targeted proxy stimulation for intervening pathological oscillations can be extrapolated to other neurological and psychiatric disorders, and its current embodiment can be directly translated into clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Engagement with scientific manuscripts is frequently facilitated by Twitter and other social media platforms. As such, the demographics of a papers social media audience provide a wealth of information about how scholarly research is transmitted, consumed, and interpreted by online communities. By paying attention to public perceptions of their publications, scientists can learn whether their research is stimulating positive scholarly and public thought. They can also become aware of potentially negative patterns of interest from groups that misinterpret their work in harmful ways, either willfully or unintentionally, and devise strategies for altering their messaging to mitigate these impacts. In this study, we collected 331,696 Twitter posts referencing 1,800 highly tweeted bioRxiv preprints and leveraged topic modeling to infer the characteristics of various communities engaging with each preprint on Twitter. We agnostically learned the characteristics of these audience sectors from keywords each users followers provide in their Twitter biographies. We estimate that 96% of the preprints analyzed are dominated by academic audiences on Twitter, suggesting that social media attention does not always correspond to greater public exposure. We further demonstrate how our audience segmentation method can quantify the level of interest from non-specialist audience sectors such as mental health advocates, dog lovers, video game developers, vegans, bitcoin investors, conspiracy theorists, journalists, religious groups, and political constituencies. Surprisingly, we also found that 10% of the highly tweeted preprints analyzed have sizable (>5%) audience sectors that are associated with right-wing white nationalist communities. Although none of these preprints intentionally espouse any right-wing extremist messages, cases exist where extremist appropriation comprises more than 50% of the tweets referencing a given preprint. These results present unique opportunities for improving and contextualizing research evaluation as well as shedding light on the unavoidable challenges of scientific discourse afforded by social media.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common primary lung cancer, and increasing evidence indicates the clinical importance of the microenvironment in LUAD. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells play an important role in promoting or inhibiting tumor growth. This study aimed to identify immune-related prognostic genes that were associated with the LUAD microenvironment.\n\nMethodsWe used the \"estimate\" R package to calculate the immune/stromal scores of each sample of GSE72094 based on the ESTIMATE algorithm. Then we looked up relationships between patients characteristics and immune/stromal scores. After that, we divided the samples into two groups: high and low scores, identified the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) on the common DEGs. After conducting the overall survival analysis of the common DEGs, prognostic genes were harvested. Then we constructed the protein-protein interaction network and performed the enrichment of GO and KEGG for the prognostic genes. Crucial prognostic genes were obtained after validating in two independent data sources (GSE68465 and TIMER). Finally, we investigated the immune correlates of the crucial prognostic genes based on the TIMER.\n\nResultsImmune scores did not vary with gender, age, smoking history, tumor stage, and EGFR status, but vary with the status of KRAS, STK11, and TP53. For the stromal scores, only the status of STK11 and TP53 mattered. Reduced immune score predicted poor prognosis of LUAD. 357 common DEGs were found, of which 108 were identified as prognostic genes after overall survival analysis. GO and KEGG analysis found that common DEGs and prognostic genes were both mainly involved in immune-related items. After validation in two independent data sources, 12 genes were validated to be crucial prognostic genes linked to prognosis. After investigated the TIMER, all 12 genes were correlated with the main immune cell types.\n\nConclusion12 immune-related prognostic genes were discovered relating to the microenvironment in LUAD. These findings suggest that the composition of the tumor microenvironment affects the clinical outcomes of LUAD, and it may provide a basis for the development of novel prognostic biomarkers and immunotherapy for LUAD.",

Here, we repeated that experiment, then re-imaged the same ganglion using serial blockface electron microscopy and traced all of DE-3s processes. Further, we traced back the processes of all of DE-3s presynaptic partners to their respective somata. This allowed us to analyze the relationship between circuit anatomy and the activity patterns it sustains. We found that input synapses important for all of the behaviors were widely distributed over DE-3s branches, yet that functional clusters were different during (fictive) swimming vs. crawling.",

    "abstract": "L-Dopa induced dyskinesia (LID) is a debilitating side effect of dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinsons Disease. The mechanistic underpinnings of LID remain obscure. Here we report that diminshed sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in the basal ganglia caused by the degeneration of midbrain dopamine neurons (DANs) facilitates the formation and expression of LID. We demonstrate that augmenting Shh signaling with agonists of the Shh effector Smoothened attenuates LID in mouse and macaque models of PD. Employing conditional genetic loss-of-function approaches, we show that reducing Shh secretion from DANs or Smo activity in cholinergic interneurons (CINs) promotes LID. Conversely, the selective expression of constitutively active Smo (SmoM2) in CINs is sufficient to render the sensitized aphakia model of PD resistant to LID. Furthermore, acute depletion of Shh from DANs through prolonged optogenetic stimulation in otherwise intact mice and in the absence of L-Dopa produces LID-like involuntary movements. These findings indicate that augmenting Shh signaling in the L-Dopa treated brain may be a promising and unexpected novel therapeutic approach for mitigating the dyskinetic side effects of long-term treatment with L-Dopa",

    "abstract": "Textbook descriptions of primary sensory cortex (PSC) revolve around single neurons representation of low-dimensional sensory features, such as visual object orientation in V1, location of somatic touch in S1, and sound frequency in A1. Typically, studies of PSC measure neurons responses along few (1 or 2) stimulus and/or behavioral dimensions. However, real-world stimuli usually vary along many feature dimensions and behavioral demands change constantly. In order to illuminate how A1 supports flexible perception in rich acoustic environments, we recorded from A1 neurons while rhesus macaques performed a feature-selective attention task. We presented sounds that varied along spectral and temporal feature dimensions (carrier bandwidth and temporal envelope, respectively). Within a block, subjects attended to one feature of the sound in a selective change detection task. We find that single neurons tend to be high-dimensional, in that they exhibit substantial mixed selectivity for both sound features, as well as task context. Contrary to common findings in many previous experiments, attention does not enhance the single-neuron representation of attended features in our data. However, a population-level analysis reveals that ensembles of neurons exhibit enhanced encoding of attended sound features, and this population code tracks subjects performance. Importantly, surrogate neural populations with intact single-neuron tuning but shuffled higher-order correlations among neurons failed to yield attention-related effects observed in the intact data. These results suggest that an emergent population code not measurable at the single-neuron level might constitute the functional unit of sensory representation in PSC.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe ability to adapt to a dynamic sensory environment promotes a range of important natural behaviors. We recorded from single neurons in monkey primary auditory cortex while subjects attended to either the spectral or temporal features of complex sounds. Surprisingly, we find no average increase in responsiveness to, or encoding of, the attended feature across single neurons. However, when we pool the activity of the sampled neurons via targeted dimensionality reduction, we find enhanced population-level representation of the attended feature and suppression of the distractor feature. This dissociation of the effects of attention at the level of single neurons vs. the population highlights the synergistic nature of cortical sound encoding and enriches our understanding of sensory cortical function.",

However, it remains unclear how hippocampal oscillations are involved, and how their functional organization is influenced by connectivity gradients.

We find that odor sequence processing epochs were characterized by increased power in the 4-8 Hz and 20-40 Hz range, with 20-40 Hz oscillations showing a power gradient increasing toward proximal CA1. Running epochs were characterized by increased power in the 8-12 Hz range and across higher frequency ranges (>24 Hz), with power gradients increasing toward proximal and distal CA1, respectively. Importantly, 20-40 Hz power increased with knowledge of the sequence and carried trial-type-specific information.

    "abstract": "Memory formation involves the synchronous firing of neurons in task-relevant networks, with recent models postulating that a decrease in low frequency oscillatory activity underlies successful memory encoding and retrieval. However, to date, this relationship has been investigated primarily with face and image stimuli; considerably less is known about the oscillatory correlates of complex rule learning, as in language. Further, recent work has shown that non-oscillatory (1/f) activity is functionally relevant to cognition, yet its interaction with oscillatory activity during complex rule learning remains unknown. Using spectral decomposition and power-law exponent estimation of human EEG data (17 females, 18 males), we show for the first time that 1/f and oscillatory activity jointly influence the learning of word order rules of a miniature artificial language system. Flexible word order rules were associated with a steeper 1/f slope, while fixed word order rules were associated with a shallower slope. We also show that increased theta and alpha power predicts fixed relative to flexible word order rule learning and behavioural performance. Together, these results suggest that 1/f activity plays an important role in higher-order cognition, including language processing, and that grammar learning is modulated by different word order permutations, which manifest in distinct oscillatory profiles.",

Here we showed that MINs form non-classical scale-free supernetworks in colonic ganglia both from healthy controls and PD patients, however, altered topological patterns are observed in PD patients. These patterns highly correlate with PD clinical scores and a machine-learning approach based on the MIN features accurately distinguish between patients and controls with an area-under-curve value of 0.989. The MINs of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (mDANs) derived from several genetic PD patients also display specific changes.

    "abstract": "BackgroundElectrophysiological recordings contain mixtures of signals from distinct neural sources, impeding a straightforward interpretation of the sensor-level data. This mixing is particularly detrimental when distinct sources resonate in overlapping frequencies. Fortunately, the mixing is linear and instantaneous. Multivariate source separation methods may therefore successfully separate statistical sources, even with overlapping spatial distributions.\n\nNew MethodWe demonstrate a feature-guided multivariate source separation method that is tuned to narrowband frequency content as well as binary condition differences. This method -- comparison scanning generalized eigendecomposition, csGED -- harnesses the covariance structure of multichannel data to find directions (i.e., eigenvectors) that maximally separate two subsets of data. To drive condition specificity and frequency specificity, our data subsets were taken from different task conditions and narrowband-filtered prior to applying GED.\n\nResultsTo validate the method, we simulated MEG data in two conditions with shared noise characteristics and unique signal. csGED outperformed the best sensor at reconstructing the ground truth signals, even in the presence of large amounts of noise. We next applied csGED to a published empirical MEG dataset on visual perception vs. imagery. csGED identified sources in alpha, beta, and gamma bands, and successfully separated distinct networks in the same frequency band.\n\nComparison with Existing Method(s)GED is a flexible feature-guided decomposition method that has previously successfully been applied. Our combined frequency- and condition-tuning is a novel adaptation that extends the power of GED in cognitive electrophysiology.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate successful condition-specific source separation by applying csGED to simulated and empirical data.",

    "abstract": "The division of labor between the dorsal and ventral visual pathways is an influential model of parallel information processing in the cerebral cortex. However, direct comparison of the two pathways at the single-neuron resolution has been scarce. Here we compare how MT and V4, mid-tier areas of the two pathways in the monkey, process binocular disparity, a powerful cue for depth perception and visually guided actions. We report a novel tradeoff where MT neurons transmit disparity signals quickly and robustly, whereas V4 neurons markedly transform the nature of the signals with extra time to solve the stereo correspondence problem. Therefore, signaling speed and robustness are traded for computational complexity. The key factor in this tradeoff was the shape of disparity tuning: V4 neurons had more even-symmetric tuning than MT neurons. Moreover, this correlation between tuning shape and signal transformation was present across individual neurons within both MT and V4. Overall, our results reveal both distinct signaling advantages and common tuning-curve features of the dorsal and ventral pathways in stereoscopic processing.",

While EFR is thought to originate from the subcortex, recent research illustrated a right-hemispheric cortical contribution to EFR. However, it is unclear whether this contribution is causal. This study aimed to establish this causality by combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and measurement of EFR (pre- and post-tDCS) via scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG). We applied tDCS over the left and right auditory cortices in right-handed normal-hearing participants and examined whether altering cortical excitability via tDCS causes changes in EFR during monaural listening to speech syllables. We showed significant changes in EFR magnitude when tDCS was applied over the right auditory cortex compared to sham stimulation for the listening ear contralateral to the stimulation site. No such effect was found when tDCS was applied over the left auditory cortex. Crucially, we further observed a hemispheric laterality where after-effect was significantly greater for tDCS applied over the right than the left auditory cortex in the contralateral ear condition. Our finding thus provides the first evidence that validates the causal relationship between the right auditory cortex and EFR.",

    "abstract": "Chromatic adaptation is a major contributory mechanism to constancy, yet its extent depends on many factors - spectral, spatial and temporal - which vary between studies and hence may contribute to differences in reported constancy indices. Here, we use the achromatic adjustment method to characterise the temporal progression of chromatic adaptation under a wide range of illuminations in an immersive environment. We control both the spectral properties of the illumination at the eye and the spatial context of the adjusted surface, to disentangle global adaptation from local contrast effects. We measure the timecourse of chromatic adaptation by assessing achromatic adjustments in 6 discrete time slots over 340 seconds. We find that the change over time of the adaptation state, proximally indicated by colour constancy indices (quantified by the relative closeness of the perceptual whitepoint to the test illumination chromaticity), (a) can be modelled by a proportional rate growth function, typically requiring more than 5 minutes to stabilise; (b) depends on the contrast between the test surface and its background, specifically increasing with decreasing test-background contrast; and (c) is generally similar in both extent and rate for different test illumination chromaticities. Adaptation progression does not differ significantly between illuminations on or off the daylight locus. Our results highlight the importance of considering exposure duration and stimulus configuration, as well as the distance between the pre-adaptation (reference) and test illumination chromaticities, when using achromatic adjustment as a measure of colour constancy.",

Indeed, when agents make decisions, neurons in orbitofrontal cortex encode the values of offered and chosen goods. Moreover, neuronal activity in this area suggests the formation of a decision. However, it is unclear whether these neural processes are causally related to choices. More generally, the evidence linking economic choices to value signals in the brain remains correlational. We address this fundamental issue using electrical stimulation in rhesus monkeys. We show that suitable currents bias choices by increasing the value of individual offers. Furthermore, high-current stimulation disrupts both the computation and the comparison of subjective values.

Among them, Erufosine (EPC3) is a promising drug for the treatment of several types of tumors. While EPC3 is supposed to exert its function by interacting with lipid membranes, the exact molecular mechanisms involved are not known yet. In this work, we applied a combination of several fluorescence microscopy and analytical chemistry approaches (i.e., scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, line-scan fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, generalized polarization imaging, as well as thin layer and gas chromatography) to quantify the effect of EPC3 in biophysical models of the plasma membrane, as well as in cancer cell lines. Our results indicate that EPC3 affects lipid-lipid interactions in cellular membranes by decreasing lipid packing and increasing membrane disorder and fluidity. As a consequence of these alterations in the lateral organization of lipid bilayers, the diffusive dynamics of membrane proteins are also significantly increased. Taken together, these findings suggest that the mechanism of action of EPC3 might be linked to its effects on fundamental biophysical properties of lipid membranes, as well as lipid metabolism in cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "MotivationPrediction of patient survival from tumor molecular  omics data is a key step toward personalized medicine. With this aim, the databases available are growing, with the collection of various  omics characterizations of patient tumors, together with their associated clinical outcomes for weeks to years of follow-up. Cox models with variable selection used with RNA profiling datasets are popular for identification of prognostic biomarkers and for clinical predictions. However, these models are confronted with the  curse of dimensionality, as the number p of covariates (genes) can greatly exceed the number n of patients. To tackle this problem, variance-based pre-filtering and penalization methods are popular for dimension reduction. In the present paper, we study the impact of a pre-filtering step based on gene variability, and we evaluate the performance of the lasso penalization of the Cox model and four variants (i.e., elastic net, adaptive elastic net, ridge, univariate Cox) in terms of prediction, selection and stability.\n\nResultsFirst, we show that the prediction capacity with the Cox penalties method is cancer dependent. Second, we develop a methodology to fix a threshold to filter out genes with low variability without losing prediction capacity. Third, we show that it is best not to use the Cox model to select prognostic biomarkers, as its false discovery proportion is always [&ge;] 50%. Finally, to predict overall survival, we can suggest the use of the ridge penalty, or the elastic net if a more parsimonious model is needed, after the pre-filtering step.\n\nAvailabilityWe provide the R script generated to reproduce all of the figures presented in this article.\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary Figures and R scripts are available.",

Although caloric restriction (CR) and the ketogenic diet (KD) are often thought to inhibit tumor growth through lowering blood glucose and insulin levels7-12, only CR inhibits the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma allografts in mice, demonstrating that this diet can limit tumor growth in other ways. A change in nutrient availability observed with CR, but not the KD, that can contribute to tumor growth inhibition is lower lipid levels in the plasma and in tumor interstitial fluid. Limiting exogenous lipid availability to cultured cancer cells results in up-regulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), an enzyme that converts saturated fatty acids to monounsaturated fatty acids. Fatty acid desaturation is required to dispose of toxic saturated fatty acids, and not because monounsaturated fatty acids are specifically needed for proliferation. Surprisingly, CR also inhibits tumor SCD activity, and enforced SCD expression confers resistance to the effects of CR. Therefore, CR both limits lipid availability and impairs tumor SCD activity, thereby limiting cancer cell adaptation to a diet-induced change in the tumor microenvironment that results in tumor growth inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Body orientation of gesture entails social-communicative intention, and may thus influence how gestures are perceived and comprehended together with auditory speech during face-to-face communication. To date, despite the emergence of neuroscientific literature on the role of body orientation on hand action perception, limited studies have directly investigated the role of body orientation in the interaction between gesture and language. To address this research question, we carried out an EEG experiment presenting to participants (n=21) videos of frontal and lateral hand gestures of five-seconds (e.g., raising a hand), followed by visually presented sentences that are either congruent or incongruent with the hand gesture (e.g.,  the mountain is high/low...). All participants underwent a semantic-probe task, judging whether a target word is related or unrelated to the gesture-speech event. EEG results suggest that, during the perception phase of hand-gestures, while both frontal and lateral gestures elicited power decrease in both the alpha (8-12Hz) and the beta (16-24Hz) bands, lateral gestures elicited reduced power decrease in the beta band when compared with frontal gestures. For sentence comprehension, at the critical word whose meaning is congruent/incongruent with the gesture, frontal gestures elicited an N400 effect for gesture-sentence incongruency. More importantly, this incongruency effect was significantly reduced for lateral gestures. The findings suggest that body orientation plays a crucial role in gesture perception, and that its inferred social-communicative intention influences gesture-sentence semantic integration in an interactive manner.",

    "abstract": "The theory of communication through coherence (CTC) posits the synchronization of brain oscillations as a key mechanism for information sharing and perceptual binding. In a parallel literature, hippocampal theta activity (4 - 10 Hz) has been shown to modulate the appearance of neocortical fast gamma oscillations (100 - 150 Hz), a phenomenon known as cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Even though CFC has also been previously associated with information routing, it remains to be determined whether it directly relates to CTC. In particular, for the theta-fast gamma example at hand, a critical question is to know if the phase of the theta cycle influences gamma synchronization across the neocortex. To answer this question, we designed a new screening method for detecting the modulation of the cross-regional high-frequency synchronization by the phase of slower oscillations. Upon applying the method, we found that the long-distance synchronization of neocortical fast gamma during REM sleep depends on the instantaneous phase of the theta rhythm. These results show that CFC is likely to aid long-range information transfer by facilitating the cross-regional synchronization of faster rhythms, thus consistent with classical CTC views.",

    "abstract": "Visual scene perception is mediated by a set of cortical regions that respond preferentially to images of scenes, including the occipital place area (OPA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA). However, the differential contribution of OPA and PPA to scene perception remains an open research question. In this study, we take a deep neural network (DNN)-based computational approach to investigate the differences in OPA and PPA function. In a first step we search for a computational model that predicts fMRI responses to scenes in OPA and PPA well. We find that DNNs trained to predict scene components (e.g., wall, ceiling, floor) explain higher variance uniquely in OPA and PPA than a DNN trained to predict scene category (e.g., bathroom, kitchen, office). This result is robust across several DNN architectures. On this basis, we then determine whether particular scene components predicted by DNNs differentially account for unique variance in OPA and PPA. We find that variance in OPA responses uniquely explained by the navigation-related floor component is higher compared to the variance explained by the wall and ceiling components. In contrast, PPA responses are better explained by the combination of wall and floor, that is scene components that together contain the structure and texture of the scene. This differential sensitivity to scene components suggests differential functions of OPA and PPA in scene processing. Moreover, our results further highlight the potential of the proposed computational approach as a general tool in the investigation of the neural basis of human scene perception.",

    "abstract": "There is broad consensus that adults solve single-digit multiplication problems almost exclusively by fact retrieval (i.e., retrieval of the solution from an arithmetic fact network). In contrast, there has been a long-standing debate on the cognitive processes involved in solving single-digit addition problems. This debate has evolved around two theoretical accounts. The fact-retrieval account postulates that these are solved through fact retrieval, just like multiplications, whereas the compacted-procedure account proposes that solving very small additions (i.e., problems with operands between 1 and 4) involves highly automatized and unconscious compacted procedures. In the present electroencephalography (EEG) study, we put these two accounts to the test by comparing neurophysiological correlates of solving very small additions and multiplications. A sample of 40 adults worked on an arithmetic production task involving all (non-tie) single-digit additions and multiplications. Afterwards, participants completed trial-by-trial strategy self-reports. In our EEG analyses, we focused on induced activity (event-related synchronization/desynchronization, ERS/ERD) in three frequency bands (theta, lower alpha, upper alpha). Across all frequency bands, we found higher evidential strength for similar rather than different neurophysiological processes accompanying the solution of very small addition and multiplication problems. This was also true when n + 1 and n x 1 problems were excluded from the analyses. In two additional analyses, we showed that ERS/ERD can differentiate between self-reported problem-solving strategies (retrieval vs. procedure) and even between n + 1 and n + m problems in very small additions, demonstrating its high sensitivity to cognitive processes in arithmetic. The present findings clearly support the fact-retrieval account, suggesting that both very small additions and multiplications are solved through fact retrieval.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LINeurophysiological test of fact retrieval and compacted procedures account\nC_LIO_LIInduced EEG data are sensitive to cognitive processes in arithmetic problem solving\nC_LIO_LIBoth very small additions and multiplications are solved through fact retrieval\nC_LI",

Here, we combine experiments and mathematical modeling to elaborate the minimal autonomous biochemical machinery necessary and sufficient for this dynamic coordination and cell movement. RhoA activates Rac1 via DIA and inhibits Rac1 via ROCK, while Rac1 inhibits RhoA through PAK. Our data suggest that in motile, polarized cells, RhoA-ROCK interactions prevail at the rear whereas RhoA-DIA interactions dominate at the front where Rac1/Rho oscillations drive protrusions and retractions. At the rear, high RhoA and low Rac1 activities are maintained until a wave of oscillatory GTPase activities from the cell front reaches the rear, inducing transient GTPase oscillations and RhoA activity spikes. After the rear retracts, the initial GTPase pattern resumes. Our findings show how periodic, propagating GTPase waves coordinate distinct GTPase patterns at the leading and trailing edge dynamics in moving cells.",

Dissecting functional metabolic differences between various cell types within a mixed population can be limited by the rapid turnover of metabolites relative to the time needed to isolate cells. To overcome this challenge, we traced isotope-labeled nutrients into macromolecules that turn over more slowly than metabolites. This approach was used to assess differences between cancer cell and fibroblast metabolism in pancreatic cancer organoid-fibroblast co-cultures and in pancreatic tumors. In these contexts, we find pancreatic cancer cells exhibit increased pyruvate carboxylation relative to fibroblasts, and that this flux depends on both pyruvate carboxylase and malic enzyme 1 activity. Consequently, expression of both enzymes in cancer cells is necessary for organoid and tumor growth, demonstrating that dissecting the metabolism of specific cell populations within heterogeneous systems can identify dependencies that may not be evident from studying isolated cells in culture or bulk tumor tissue.",

    "abstract": "Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are in decline in the western United States and are encountering a range of anthropogenic stressors. Pesticides are among the factors that likely contribute to this decline, though the concentrations of these chemicals in non-crop plants is not well documented, especially in complex landscapes with a diversity of crop types and land uses. In this study, we collected 227 milkweed (Asclepias spp.) leaf samples from 19 sites representing different land use types across the Central Valley of California. We also sampled plants purchased from two stores that sell to home gardeners. We found 64 pesticides (25 insecticides, 27 fungicides, and 11 herbicides, as well as 1 adjuvant) out of a possible 262 in our screen. Pesticides were detected in every sample, even at sites with little or no pesticide use based on information from landowners. On average, approximately 9 compounds were detected per plant across all sites, with a range of 1 to 25 compounds in any one sample. For the vast majority of pesticides detected, we do not know the biological effects on monarch caterpillars that consume these plants, however we did detect a few compounds for which effects on monarchs have been experimentally investigated. Chlorantraniliprole in particular was identified in 91% of our samples and found to exceed a tested LD50 for monarchs in 58 out of 227 samples. Our primary conclusion is the ubiquity of pesticide presence in milkweeds in an early-summer window of time that monarch larvae are likely to be present in the area. Thus, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that pesticide exposure could be a contributing factor to monarch declines in the western United States. This both highlights the need for a greater understanding of the lethal and sublethal effects of these compounds (individually, additively, and synergistically) and suggests the urgent need for strategies that reduce pesticide use and movement on the landscape.\n\nContribution to the FieldInsects are facing multifaceted stressors in the Anthropocene and are in decline in many parts of the world. The widespread use of pesticides is believed to be an important part of the problem. In particular, the monarch butterfly is in sharp decline in the western United States. Here we show that milkweeds in the Central Valley of California, a large urban and agricultural landscape that is part of the monarch breeding and migration route, are contaminated with a diverse array of pesticides. We found a few in high concentrations and many in trace amounts. We do not know how these compounds act together and with other large-scale stressors to cause declines, but it is clear that monarchs and other non-target insects are encountering these pesticides. These results provide critical insight into the growing literature on the impact of pesticides on butterflies specifically and non-target insects more broadly. We hope these field realistic concentrations will aid in the design of further experiments in the field and the lab.",

    "abstract": "The patterns and outcomes of coevolution are expected to depend on intraspecific trait variation. Various evolutionary factors can change this variation in time. As a result, modeling coevolutionary processes solely in terms of mean trait values may not be sufficient; one may need to study the dynamics of the whole trait distribution. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for studying the effects of evolving intraspecific variation in two-species coevolutionary systems. In particular, we build and study mathematical models of competition, exploiter-victim interactions, and mutualism in which the strength of within- and between-species interactions depends on the difference in continuously varying traits. We use analytical approximations based on the invasion analysis and supplement it with a numerical method. We find that intraspecific variation can be maintained if stabilizing selection is weak in at least one species. When intraspecific variation is maintained, stable coexistence is promoted by small ranges of interspecific interaction in two-species competition and mutualism, and large ranges in exploiter-victim interactions. We show that trait distributions can become multimodal. Our approach and results contribute to the understanding of the ecological consequences of intraspecific variation in coevolutionary systems by exploring its effects on population densities and trait distributions.",

We found significantly higher frequencies of Mtb-specific effector and memory CD4 and CD8 T cells producing IFN-{gamma} in the airways compared to peripheral blood, which were maintained throughout the study period. Moreover, Mtb-specific IL-17+ and IL-17/IFN-{gamma} double-positive T cells were present in the airways but were largely absent in the periphery, suggesting that balanced mucosal Th1/Th17 responses are associated with LTBI. The majority of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells that homed to the airways expressed the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and co-expressed CCR6. Notably, CXCR3+CD4+ cells were found in granulomatous and non-granulomatous regions of the lung and inversely correlated with Mtb burden.

    "abstract": "Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread to almost every nation in the world. Soon after the pandemic was recognized by epidemiologists, a group of biologists comprising the ARTIC Network, has devised a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol and primer set for targeted whole-genome amplification of SARS-CoV-2. The ARTIC primer set amplifies 98 amplicons, which are separated only in two PCRs, across a nearly entire viral genome. The original primer set and protocol showed a fairly small amplification bias when clinical samples with relatively high viral loads were used. However, when samples viral load was low, several amplicons, especially amplicons 18 and 76, exhibited low coverage or complete dropout. We have determined that these dropouts were due to a dimer formation between the forward primer for amplicon 18, 18_LEFT, and the reverse primer for amplicon 76, 76_RIGHT. Replacement of 76_RIGHT with an alternatively designed primer was sufficient to produce a drastic improvement in coverage of both amplicons. Based on this result, we replaced 12 primers in total in the ARTIC primer set that were predicted to be involved in 14 primer interactions. The resulting primer set, version N1 (NIID-1), exhibits improved overall coverage compared to the ARTIC Networks original (V1) and modified (V3) primer set.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied.\n\nMethodsThirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration.\n\nResultsThe ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow.\n\nConclusionsRoom ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The induction of an interferon-mediated response is the first line of defense against pathogens such as viruses. Yet, the dynamics and extent of interferon alpha (IFN)-induced antiviral genes vary remarkably and comprise three expression clusters: early, intermediate and late. By mathematical modeling based on time-resolved quantitative data, we identified mRNA stability as well as a negative regulatory loop as key mechanisms endogenously controlling the expression dynamics of IFN-induced antiviral genes in hepatocytes. Guided by the mathematical model, we uncovered that this regulatory loop is mediated by the transcription factor IRF2 and showed that knock-down of IRF2 results in enhanced expression of early, intermediate and late IFN-induced antiviral genes. Co-stimulation experiments with different pro-inflammatory cytokines revealed that this amplified expression dynamics of the early, intermediate and late IFN-induced antiviral genes can be mimicked by co-application of IFN and interleukin1 beta (IL1{beta}). Consistently, we found that IL1{beta} enhances IFN-mediated repression of viral replication. Conversely, we observed that in IL1{beta} receptor knock-out mice replication of viruses sensitive to IFN is increased. Thus, IL1{beta} is capable to potentiate IFN-induced antiviral responses and could be exploited to improve antiviral therapies.\n\nAuthor SummaryInnate immune responses contribute to the control of viral infections and the induction of interferon alpha (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses is an important component. However, IFN induces a multitude of antiviral response genes and the expression dynamics of these genes can be classified as early, intermediate and late. Here we show, based on a mathematical modeling approach, that mRNA stability as well as the negative regulator IRF2 control the expression dynamics of IFN-induced antiviral genes. Knock-down of IRF2 resulted in the amplified IFN-mediated induction of the antiviral genes and this amplified expression of antiviral genes could be mimicked by co-stimulation with IFN and IL1{beta}. We observed that co-stimulation with IFN and IL1{beta} enhanced the repression of virus replication and that knock-out of the IL1 receptor in mice resulted in increased replication of a virus sensitive to IFN. In sum, our studies identified IL1{beta} as an important amplifier of IFN-induced antiviral responses.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIdentification of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that bind to ribonucleic acid molecules, is an important problem in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. It becomes indispensable to identify RBPs as they play crucial roles in post-transcriptional control of RNAs and RNA metabolism as well as have diverse roles in various biological processes such as splicing, mRNA stabilization, mRNA localization, and translation, RNA synthesis, folding-unfolding, modification, processing, and degradation. The existing experimental techniques for identifying RBPs are time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, identifying RBPs directly from the sequence using computational methods can be useful to efficiently annotate RBPs and assist the experimental design. In this work, we present a method, called AIRBP, which is designed using an advanced machine learning technique, called stacking, to effectively predict RBPs by utilizing features extracted from evolutionary information, physiochemical properties, and disordered properties. Moreover, our method, AIRBP is trained on the useful feature-subset identified by the evolutionary algorithm (EA).\n\nResultsThe results show that AIRBP attains Accuracy (ACC), F1-score, and MCC of 95.38%, 0.917, and 0.885, respectively, based on the benchmark dataset, using 10-fold cross-validation (CV). Further evaluation of AIRBP on independent test set reveals that it achieves ACC, F1-score, and MCC of 93.04%, 0.943, and 0.855, for Human test set; 91.60%, 0.942 and 0.789 for S. cerevisiae test set; and 91.67%, 0.953 and 0.594 for A. thaliana test set, respectively. These results indicate that AIRBP outperforms the current state-of-the-art method. Therefore, the proposed top-performing AIRBP can be useful for accurate identification and annotation of RBPs directly from the sequence and help gain valuable insight to treat critical diseases.\n\nAvailabilityCode-data is available here: http://cs.uno.edu/~tamjid/Software/AIRBP/code_data.zip",

This is especially true for researchers using invertebrate models of disease due to the small size of the animals and the required precision and accuracy of the injection. The immobilization of the greater wax moth larvae (Galleria mellonella) is often achieved by grasping a larva firmly between finger and thumb. Needle resistant gloves or forceps can be used to reduce the risk of a needlestick but can result in animal injury, a loss of throughput, and inconsistencies in experimental data. Immobilization devices are commonly used for the manipulation of small mammals, and in this manuscript, we describe the construction of injection chambers that can be used to entrap and restrain G. mellonella larvae prior to injection with pathogenic microbes. These devices significantly reduce the manual handling of larvae and provide an engineering control to protection against accidental needlestick injury, while maintaining a high rate of injection.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to investigate whether the lipofuscin formed within cardiomyocytes can be excluded by the myocardial tissue. We have provided indicators that can be used for future studies on anti-aging interventions.\n\nIn the present study, the heart of a 5-month-old BALB/c mouse was obtained for resin embedding and ultra-thin sectioning. The specimens were observed under a Hitach 7500 transmission electron microscope, and the images were acquired using an XR401 side-insertion device.\n\nLipofuscin granules are found abundantly in myocardial cells. Cardiomyocytes can excrete lipofuscin granules into the myocardial interstitium using capsule-like protrusions that are formed on the sarcolemma. These granules enter the myocardial interstitium and can be de-aggregated to form \"membrane-like garbage\", which can pass from the myocardial stroma into the lumen of the vessel through its walls in the form of soluble fine particles through diffusion or endocytosis of capillaries. Smaller lipofuscin granules can pass through the walls of the vessels and enter the blood vessel lumen through the active transport function of the capillary endothelial cells. When the extended cytoplasmic end of macrophages and fibroblasts fuse with the endothelial cells, the lipofuscin granules or clumps found in the cells of the myocardial interstitium are transported to the capillary walls, and then, they are released into the lumen of the blood vessel by the endothelial cells.\n\nThe myocardial tissues of mice have the ability to eliminate the lipofuscin produced in the cardiomyocytes into the myocardial blood circulation. Although there are several mechanisms through which the myocardial tissues release lipofuscin into the bloodstream, it is mainly carried out in the form of small, fine, soluble, continuous transport.",

    "abstract": "Transplantation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) is an alternative reproductive method to achieve conservation and production of elite animals in livestock production. Creating a recipient animal without endogenous germ cells is important for effective SSC transplantation. However, natural mutants with depletion of SSCs are difficult to obtain, and drug ablation of endogenous germ cells is arduous to perform for practical use. In this study, we used mouse models to study the preparation of recipients with congenital germ cell ablation. We knocked out (KO) Ets-variant gene 5 (Etv5) in mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The testicular weight of Etv5-/- mice was significantly lower than that of wild-type (WT) mice. The germ cell layer of the seminiferous tubules gradually receded with age in Etv5-/- mice. At 12 weeks of age, the tubules of Etv5-/- mice lacked germ cells (Sertoli cell-only syndrome), and sperm were completely absent in the epididymis. We subsequently transplanted allogeneic SSCs with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) into 3-(immature) or 7-week-old (mature) Etv5-/- mice. Restoration of germ cell layers in the seminiferous tubules and spermatogenesis was observed in all immature testes but not in mature adult testes at 2 months post-transplantation. The presence of heterologous genes Etv5 and EGFP in recipient testicular tissue and epididymal sperm by PCR indicated that sperm originated from the transplanted donor cells. Our study demonstrates that, although Etv5-/- mice could accommodate and support foreign germ cell transplantation, this process occurs in a quite low efficiency to support a full spermatogenesis of transplanted SSCs. However, using Etv5-/- mice as a recipient model for SSC transplantation is feasible, and still needs further investigation to establish an optimized transplantation process.",

    "abstract": "The impact of a range of different threats has resulted in the listing of six out of seven sea turtle species on the IUCN Red List of endangered species. Disease risk analysis (DRA) tools are designed to provide objective, repeatable and documented assessment of the disease risks for a population and measures to reduce these risks through management options. To the best of our knowledge, DRAs have not previously been published for sea turtles, although disease is reported to contribute to sea turtle population decline. Here, a comprehensive list of health hazards is provided for all seven species of sea turtles. The possible risk these hazards pose to the health of sea turtles were assessed and \"One Health\" aspects of interacting with sea turtles were also investigated. The risk assessment was undertaken in collaboration with more than 30 experts in the field including veterinarians, microbiologists, social scientists, epidemiologists and stakeholders, in the form of two international workshops and one local workshop. The general finding of the DRA was the distinct lack of knowledge regarding a link between the presence of pathogens and diseases manifestation in sea turtles. A higher rate of disease in immunocompromised individuals was repeatedly reported and a possible link between immunosuppression and environmental contaminants as a result of anthropogenic influences was suggested. Society based conservation initiatives and as a result the cultural and social aspect of interacting with sea turtles appeared to need more attention and research. A risk management workshop was carried out to acquire the insights of local policy makers about management options for the risks relevant to Queensland and the options were evaluated considering their feasibility and effectiveness. The sea turtle DRA presented here, is a structured guide for future risk assessments to be used in specific scenarios such as translocation and head-starting programs.",

    "abstract": "The scalloped hammerhead shark Sphyrna lewini is an endangered species which expected to population declined worldwide including in Indonesia due to overexploited. However, there is a lack of information regarding recent population structure to promote proper management and conservation status in Indonesia. This study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity, population structure and connectivity of S. lewini population in Indonesia from three major sharks landing sites in Aceh (n= 41), Balikpapan (n= 30), Lombok (n= 29), and additional sequences retrieved from West Papua (n= 14) and Western Indian Ocean population (n= 65). Analyses of mitochondrial CO1 gene successfully identified a total of 179 sequences of S. lewini with an average 594 bp nucleotide with 40 polymorphic loci in 4 haplotypes for Indonesian population and 8 haplotypes for Western Indian Ocean. The overall values of genetic diversity in Indonesia was high (Hd= 0.7171; {pi}= 0.0126), with the highest was in Aceh (Hd= 0.6683; {pi}= 0.0198), and the lowest was in Papua (Hd= 0.1429; {pi}= 0.0005), while in Western Indian Ocean the overall value was fairly low (Hd= 0.2322; {pi}= 0.0010). The AMOVA and FST revealed three significant population subdivisions in Indonesia (FST= 0.4415; p < 0.001) with separated population for Aceh and West Papua, and a mixing population between Balikpapan and Lombok (FST= 0.044; p = 0.089), whereas relatively no significant differentiation within population in Western Indian Ocean (FST= -0.0131; p = 0.6011), and significant different level showed by Indonesian population compared with Western Indian Ocean population (FST= 0.7403; p < 0.001). The construction of haplotype network exhibited evidence of gene flow and haplotype sharing between populations. This result indicated a complex and limited connectivity population of S. lewini in Indonesia, and between Western Indian Ocean in regional scale which need co-management action across region.",

People can also track through feature space after occlusion. For instance, they can estimate the current number on a hidden stopwatch. Previous work has suggest that a common rate control module paces mental updating in both physical space and number-space. We tested this by comparing single and dual task conditions. On every trial, participants observed a moving target-counter travel clockwise round a circular track. In the then disappeared for 2, 4, 6 or 8 seconds, and beep sounded. In the single task blocks, participants either estimated the final position or the final number. In the dual task block, they estimated final position and final number. Performance was very similar in single and dual task blocks. This suggests people can extrapolate through physical space and number space simultaneously. This is a challenge to the common rate control model, which implies there should be some dual task interference. We conclude that if a common rate controller exists, it is capable of pacing simultaneous mental simulations in different dimensions.",

R. chensinensis is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAS). However, information regarding the genes of R. chensinensis related to the synthesis of PUFAs is limited. To identify these genes, we performed Illumina sequencing of R. chensinensis RNA from the skin and Oviductus Ranae. The Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform was used for sequencing, and the I-Sanger cloud platform was used for transcriptome de novo sequencing and information analysis to generate a database. Through the database generated by the transcriptome and the pathway map, we found the pathway for the biosynthesis of R. chensinensis PUFAs. The Pearson coefficient method was used to analyze the correlation of gene expression levels between samples, and the similarity of gene expression in different tissues and the characteristics in their respective tissues were found. Twelve differentially expressed genes of PUFA in skin and Oviductus Ranae were screened by gene differential expression analysis. The 12 unigenes expression levels of qRT-PCR were used to verify the results of gene expression levels consistent with transcriptome analysis. Based on the sequencing, key genes involved in biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids were isolated, which established a biotechnological platform for further research on R. chensinensis.",

    "abstract": "Relationships between environmental factors and oscillations in jellyfish abundance, especially in the early life stages, could help to interpret past increases and also predict scenarios in a changing future. For the first time, we present cubozoan spatial and temporal distributions in the earliest stages and their relationships with different factors. Abundances of Carybdea marsupialis medusae showed high interannual variability from 2008 to 2014 along the Denia coast (SE Spain, W Mediterranean). During 2015, samples were collected from 11 beaches along 17 km of coastline, 8 times from January to November in order to determine the effects of environmental factors on the distribution of juvenile C. marsupialis. Juveniles ([&le;] 15 mm diagonal bell width) were present from May to July, with more sampled near shore (0 - 15 m). Most of them occurred in June when their numbers were unequal among beaches (average 0.05 ind m-3, maximum 6.71 ind m-3). We tested distributions of juveniles over time and space versus temperature, salinity, nutrients (N, P and Si), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and zooplankton abundance. Temperature and cladocerans (zooplankton group) were significantly positively correlated with juvenile distribution, whereas Chl-a concentration was weakly negative. By contrast, in 2014, high productivity areas (Chl-a and zooplankton) overlapped the maximum adult abundance (5.2 ind m-3). The distribution of juveniles during 2015 did not spatially coincide with the areas where ripe adults were located the previous year, suggesting that juveniles drift with the currents upon release from the cubopolyps. Our results yield important insights into the complexity of cubozoan distributions.",

    "abstract": "Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) is a pathovar linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), especially Crohns disease, and colorectal cancer. AIEC are genetically diverse, and in the absence of a universal molecular signature, are defined by in vitro functional attributes. The relative ability of difference AIEC strains to colonize, persist, and induce inflammation in an IBD-susceptible host is unresolved. To evaluate strain-level variation among tissue-associated E. coli in the intestines, we develop a long-read sequencing approach to identify AIEC by strain that excludes host DNA. We use this approach to distinguish genetically similar strains and assess their fitness in colonizing the intestine. Here we have assembled complete genomes using long-read nanopore sequencing for a model AIEC strain, NC101, and seven strains isolated from the intestinal mucosa of Crohns disease and non-Crohns tissues. We show these strains can colonize the intestine of IBD susceptible mice and induce inflammatory cytokines from cultured macrophages. We demonstrate that these strains can be quantified and distinguished in the presence of 99.5% mammalian DNA and from within a fecal population. Analysis of global genomic structure and specific sequence variation within the ribosomal RNA operon provides a framework for efficiently tracking strain-level variation of closely-related E. coli and likely other commensal/pathogenic bacteria impacting intestinal inflammation in experimental settings and IBD patients.",

The ability of the selected epitopes to induce interferon-gamma was evaluate using IFNepitope web server. One final vaccine was constructed which composed of 398 amino acids and attached to 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 as adjuvant. Physicochemical properties, as well as antigenicity in the proposed vaccines, were checked for defining the vaccine stability and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses. Three-dimensional structure of the mentioned vaccine was subjected to the molecular docking studies with MHC-I and MHC-II molecules. The results proposed that the multi-epitope vaccine with 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 was a stable construct with high aliphatic content and high antigenicity.",

    "abstract": "Illegal capture and trade of wild birds has long been a threat to biodiversity. Translocation\u2014the release of individuals from one location into another\u2014is a useful conservation tool in the management of species. However, both health (such as different pathogens) and adaptive (such as local adaptation), differences among populations must be taken into account, as both can impact the recipient population negatively. Here, we provide health and genetic information to support release planning for two of the most trafficked Brazilian wild bird species (Paroaria coronata and Saltator similis). We focused on two fundamental questions: Are there significant differences in pathogen load between wild and captive populations? Is there significant genetic structure among populations? In total, 223 free-living birds were captured, sampled, and released at the same site. Devices and live decoys characteristics were top factors influencing captures. We tested blood, feces, and oropharyngeal swabs from free-ranging (n=101) and confiscated (n=92) birds for Newcastle disease virus, Salmonella spp., and Mycoplasma gallisepticum. Genetic structure among populations was investigated using mtDNA in a subsample of these birds. We found no evidence for Newcastle disease virus and Salmonella spp. in seized and free-living birds from both species. However, seized P. coronata and S. similis may be potential sources of M. gallisepticum. We found significant but low genetic structure among populations occurring in different Biomes (\u03a6CT=0.26 for P. coronata; \u03a6CT=0.13 for S. similis) and no significant structure among populations occurring in the Pampa Biome. These results suggest that while it may be important to screen seized birds for avian pathogens, genetic structure among populations seems to be of lesser concern when planning the release of seized songbirds in the wild.View Full Text",
