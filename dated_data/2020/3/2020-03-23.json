    "abstract": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is amenable to studying membrane traffic by live-cell fluorescence microscopy. We used this system to explore two aspects of cargo protein traffic through prevacuolar endosome (PVE) compartments to the vacuole. First, at what point during Golgi maturation does a biosynthetic vacuolar cargo depart from the maturing cisternae? To address this question, we modified a regulatable fluorescent secretory cargo by adding a vacuolar targeting signal. Traffic of the vacuolar cargo requires the GGA clathrin adaptors, which arrive during the early-to-late Golgi transition. Accordingly, the vacuolar cargo begins to exit the Golgi near the midpoint of maturation, significantly before exit of a secretory cargo. Second, how are cargoes delivered from PVE compartments to the vacuole? To address this question, we tracked biosynthetic and endocytic cargoes after they had accumulated in PVE compartments. The results imply that stable PVE compartments repeatedly deliver material to the vacuole by a kiss-and-run mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The control of protein abundance is a fundamental regulatory mechanism during mitosis. The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is the main protein ubiquitin ligase responsible for the temporal regulation of mitotic progression. It has long been speculated that the APC/C might fulfil other functions including assembly of the mitotic spindle. Here, we show that the APC/C localizes to centrosomes, the organizers of the eukaryotic microtubule cytoskeleton, specifically during mitosis. The APC/C is recruited to spindle poles by the centrosomal protein Cep152, and we identified Cep152 as both a novel APC/C interaction partner, and as an APC/C substrate. Importantly, this revealed a mitotic function of Cep152 that is reciprocally regulated by the APC/C. A destruction-defective mutant of Cep152 showed that the timely regulation of Cep152 levels at the centrosome controls spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. The APC/C-mediated degradation of Cep152 at the centrosome releases Cep57 from an inhibitory complex to enable its interaction with pericentrin, a critical step in promoting microtubule nucleation. Thus, our study extends the function of the APC/C from being a regulator of mitosis to also acting as a positive governor of spindle assembly. The APC/C thereby integrates control of these two important processes in a temporal manner.",

    "abstract": "Meal ingestion triggers secretion of a variety of gut and endocrine peptides, several of which are routinely measured in research studies by commercial immunoassays. We developed an LC-MS/MS based assay for parallel monitoring of multiple peptides in small volumes of human plasma, providing the benefit of analysing exact peptide sequences rather than immuno-reactivity, and potential advantages of cost and sample volumes for measuring multiple peptide hormones. The method involves acetonitrile precipitation of larger proteins, followed by solid phase extraction and nano-LC-MS/MS using an untargeted approach on an orbitrap mass spectrometer. Analysis of plasma from control subjects and patients who have undergone gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction, revealed elevated levels of a number of peptides following glucose ingestion. These included GLP-1(7-36), GLP-1(9-36), glicentin, oxyntomodulin, GIP(1-42), GIP(3-42), PYY(1-36), PYY(3-36), neurotensin, insulin and C-peptide, as well as motilin, which decreased following glucose ingestion. Results showed good correlation with those peptides measured previously by immunoassay in the same samples. The gastrectomy group had higher, but non-glucose-dependent, circulating levels of peptides from PIGR and DMBT1.\n\nOverall, the method is fast, generic, reproducible and inexpensive, and requires only small plasma samples, making it potentially adaptable for multiplexed measurement of a variety of peptides.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease is a type of dementia denoted by progressive neuronal death due to the accumulation of proteinaceous aggregates of Tau. Post-translational modifications like hyperphosphorylation, truncation, glycation, etc. play a pivotal role in Tau pathogenesis. Glycation of Tau aids in paired helical filament formation and abates its microtubule-binding function. The chemical modulators of Tau PTMs, such as kinase inhibitors and antibody-based therapeutics, have been developed, but natural compounds, as modulators of Tau PTMs are not much explored.\n\nMethodsWe applied biophysical and biophysical techniques like fluorescence kinetics, SDS-PAGE, western blot analysis and transmission electron microscopy to investigate the impact of EGCG on Tau glycation in vitro. The effect of glycation on cytoskeleton instability and its EGCG-mediated rescue were studied by immunofluorescence in neuroblastoma cells.\n\nResultsEGCG inhibited methyl glyoxal (MG)-induced Tau glycation in vitro. EGCG potently inhibited MG-induced advanced glycation endproducts formation in neuroblastoma cells as well modulated the localization of AT100 phosphorylated Tau in the cells. In addition to preventing the glycation, EGCG enhanced actin-rich neuritic extensions and rescued actin and tubulin cytoskeleton severely disrupted by MG. EGCG maintained the integrity of the Microtubule Organizing Center (MTOC) stabilized microtubules by Microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member 1 (EB1).\n\nConclusionsWe report EGCG, a green tea polyphenol, as a modulator of in vitro methylglyoxal-induced Tau glycation and its impact on reducing advanced glycation end products in neuroblastoma cells.

For detecting cellular TOP3Bccs, we engineered a \"self-trapping\" mutant of TOP3B (R338W TOP3B) and to determine how human cells repair TOP3Bccs, we depleted tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases (TDP1 and TDP2).

Using recombinant human TDP2, we demonstrate that TDP2 cannot excise the native form of TOP3Bccs.

Using single cell RNA-Seq, we demonstrate that the single X and pair of 4th chromosomes are specifically inactivated in primary spermatocytes. In contrast, genes on the single Y chromosome become maximally active in primary spermatocytes.

    "abstract": "N-terminal acetylation is a prominent protein modification and inactivation of N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) cause protein homeostasis stress. Using multiplexed protein stability (MPS) profiling with linear ubiquitin fusions as reporters for the activity of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) we observed increased UPS activity in NatA, but not NatB or NatC mutants. We find several mechanisms contributing to this behavior. First, NatA-mediated acetylation of the N-terminal ubiquitin independent degron regulates the abundance of Rpn4, the master regulator of the expression of proteasomal genes. Second, the abundance of several E3 ligases involved in degradation of UFD substrates is increased in cells lacking NatA. Finally, we identify the E3 ligase Tom1 as a novel chain elongating enzyme (E4) involved in the degradation of linear ubiquitin fusions via the formation of branched K11 and K29 ubiquitin chains, independently of the known E4 ligases involved in UFD, leading to enhanced ubiquitination of the UFD substrates.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a potent tumor-suppressive program that prevents neoplastic events. Paradoxically, senescent cells develop an inflammatory secretome, termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and implicated in age-related pathologies including cancer. Here we report that senescent cells actively synthesize and release small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) with a distinctive size distribution. Mechanistically, SIRT1 loss supports accelerated sEV production despite enhanced proteome-wide ubiquitination, a process correlated with ATP6V1A downregulation and defective lysosomal acidification. Once released, senescent stromal sEVs significantly alter the expression profile of recipient cancer cells and enhance their aggressiveness, specifically drug resistance mediated by expression of ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 4 (ABCB4). Targeting SIRT1 with an agonist SRT2104 prevents development of cancer resistance through restraining sEV production by senescent stromal cells. In clinical oncology, sEVs in peripheral blood of posttreatment cancer patients are readily detectable by routine biotechniques, presenting a novel biomarker to monitor therapeutic efficacy and to predict long term outcome. Together, our study identifies a distinct mechanism supporting pathological activities of senescent cells, and provides a novel avenue to circumvent advanced human malignancies by co-targeting cancer cells and their surrounding microenvironment, which contributes to drug resistance via secretion of sEVs from senescent stromal cells.",

    "abstract": "Although the plan of the retina is well conserved in vertebrates, there are considerable variations in cell type diversity and number, as well as in the organization and properties of the tissue. The high ratios of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to cones in primate fovea and bird retinas favor neural circuits essential for high visual acuity and color vision. The role that cell metabolism could play in cell fate decision during embryonic development of the nervous system is still largely unknown. Here, we describe how subtle changes of mitochondrial activity along the pathway converting uncommitted progenitors into newborn RGCs increase the recruitment of RGC-fated progenitors. ATOH7, a proneural protein dedicated to the production of RGCs in vertebrates, activates transcription of the Hes5.3 gene in pre-committed progenitors. The HES5.3 protein, in turn, regulates a transient decrease in mitochondrial activity via the retinoic acid signaling pathway few hours before cell commitment. This metabolic shift lengthens the progression of the ultimate cell cycle and is a necessary step for upregulating Atoh7 and promoting RGC differentiation.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/002998v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@60b51aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@111be27org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1db19f8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1860da3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT C_FIG",

By in situ hybridization, expression of KIF9 mRNA was highest in the testis and was also strong in epithelia containing multi-ciliated cells such as the ependyma, bronchioles and oviduct. Deletion of the exon led to loss of KIF9 expression at the mRNA and protein level with no effect on viability. However, homozygous KIF9 knockout males were sterile. Although KIF9 knockout sperm were motile, they were unable to fertilize oocytes in an in vitro fertilization assay. Closer examination of sperm motility indicated a subtle difference in waveform.

    "abstract": "The intricacy of nuclear pore complex (NPC) biogenesis imposes risks of failure that can cause defects in nuclear transport and nuclear envelope morphology, however, cellular mechanisms utilized to alleviate NPC assembly stress are not well-defined. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that NVJ1- and MDM1-enriched nuclear envelope (NE)-vacuole contacts increase when NPC assembly is compromised in several nup mutants, including nup116{Delta}GLFG cells. These interorganelle nucleus-vacuole junctions (NVJs) cooperate with lipid droplets to maintain viability and enhance NPC formation in assembly mutants. Additionally, NVJs function with ATG1 to promote vacuole-dependent remodeling in nup116{Delta}GLFG cells, which also correlates with proper NPC formation. Importantly, NVJs significantly improve the physiology of NPC assembly mutants, despite having only negligible effects when NPC biogenesis is unperturbed. Collectively, these results define how NE-vacuole interorganelle contacts coordinate responses to mitigate deleterious cellular effects caused by disrupted NPC assembly.\n\nSummaryHow cells respond to deleterious effects imposed by disrupted nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly are not well-defined. The authors demonstrate nuclear envelope-vacuole interactions expand in response to perturbed NPC assembly to promote viability, nuclear envelope remodeling, and proper NPC biogenesis.",

Increasingly, engineers are researching ways in which synthetic compartmentalization could be used to address challenges in metabolic engineering. Here, we identified that norcoclaurine synthase (NCS), the enzyme which catalyzes the first committed reaction in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid (BIA) biosynthesis, is toxic when expressed cytosolically in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and, consequently, restricts (S)-reticuline production. We developed a compartmentalization strategy that alleviates NCS toxicity while promoting increased (S)-reticuline titer, achieved through efficient targeting of toxic NCS to the peroxisome while, crucially, taking advantage of the free flow of metabolite substrates and product across the peroxisome membrane. We identified that peroxisome protein capacity in S. cerevisiae becomes a limiting factor for further improvement of BIA production and demonstrate that expression of engineered transcription factors can mimic the oleate response for larger peroxisomes, further increasing BIA titer without the requirement for peroxisome induction with fatty acids. This work specifically addresses the challenges associated with toxic NCS expression and, more broadly, highlights the potential for engineering organelles with desired characteristics for metabolic engineering.",

    "abstract": "Stressors experienced by layer breeders during egg production can lead to changes in the egg hormone content, potentially impacting their offspring, the commercial layers. Genetic differences might also affect the offsprings susceptibility to maternal experiences. In this study, we tested if maternal stress affects measures of stress and fear in five strains of layer breeders: commercial brown 1 & 2, commercial white 1 & 2 and a pure line White Leghorn. Each strain was equally separated into two groups: \"Maternal Stress\" (MS), where hens were subjected to a series of 8 consecutive days of acute psychological stressors, and \"Control,\" which received routine husbandry. Additional eggs from Control were injected either with corticosterone diluted in a vehicle solution (\"CORT\") or just \"Vehicle.\" Stress- and fear-responses of the offspring were measured in a plasma corticosterone test and a combined human approach and novel object test. Both MS and CORT treatments failed to affect the measured endpoints in the offspring, but significant strain differences were found. The offspring of the white strains showed a higher physiological response compared to brown strains, but the White 2 offspring was consistently the least fearful strain in the behaviour tests. Our study found that the acute psychological stressors experienced by layer breeders did not affect the parameters tested in their offspring and that corticosterone does not seem to be the primary mediator of maternal stress in laying hens. This is highly important, as in poultry production, layer breeders are often subjected to short-term stressors. In addition, we successfully dissociated the physiological and behavioural parameters of stress response in laying hens, showing that increased concentrations of plasma corticosterone in response to stress is not directly associated with high levels of fear.",

    "abstract": "DNA topoisomerase II-{beta} (TOP2B) is fundamental to remove topological problems linked to DNA metabolism and 3D chromatin architecture, but its cut-and-reseal catalytic mechanism can accidentally cause DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that can seriously compromise genome integrity. Understanding the factors that determine the genome-wide distribution of TOP2B is therefore not only essential for a complete knowledge of genome dynamics and organization, but also for the implications of TOP2-induced DSBs in the origin of oncogenic translocations and other types of chromosomal rearrangements. Here, we conduct a machine-learning approach for the prediction of TOP2B binding sites using publicly available sequencing data. We achieve highly accurate predictions, with accessible chromatin and architectural factors being the most informative features. Strikingly, TOP2B is sufficiently explained by only three features: DNase I hypersensitivity, CTCF and cohesin binding, for which genome-wide data are widely available. Based on this, we develop a predictive model for TOP2B genome-wide binding that can be used across cell lines and species, and generate virtual probability tracks that accurately mirror experimental ChIP-seq data. Our results deepen our knowledge on how the accessibility and 3D organization of chromatin determine TOP2B function, and constitute a proof of principle regarding the in silico prediction of sequence-independent chromatin-binding factors.\n\nAuthor summaryType II DNA topoisomerases (TOP2) are a double-edged sword. They solve topological problems in the form of supercoiling, knots and tangles that inevitably accompany genome metabolism, but they do so at the cost of transiently cleaving DNA, with the risk that this entails for genome integrity, and the serious consequences for human health, such as neurodegeneration, developmental disorders or predisposition to cancer. A comprehensive analysis of TOP2 distribution throughout the genome is therefore essential for a deep understanding of its function and regulation, and how this can affect genome dynamics and stability. Here, we use machine learning to thoroughly explore genome-wide binding of TOP2B, a vertebrate TOP2 paralog that has been linked to genome organization and cancer-associated translocations. Our analysis shows that TOP2B-DNA binding can be accurately predicted exclusively using information on DNA accessibility and binding of genome-architecture factors. We show that such information is enough to generate virtual maps of TOP2B binding along the genome, which we validate with de novo experimental data. Our results highlight the importance of TOP2B for accessibility and 3D organization of chromatin, and show that computationally predicted TOP2 maps can be accurately obtained using minimal publicly available datasets, opening the door for their use in different organisms, cell types and conditions with experimental and/or clinical relevance.",

    "abstract": "An increasing body of evidence suggests that microbes are not only strongly associated with many human diseases but also responsible for the efficacy, resistance, and toxicity of drugs. Small-molecule drugs which can precisely fine-tune the microbial ecosystem on the basis of individual patients may revolutionize biomedicine. However, emerging endeavors in small-molecule microbiome drug discovery continue to follow a conventional \"one-drug-one-target-one-disease\" process. It is often insufficient and less successful in tackling complex systematic diseases. A systematic pharmacology approach that intervenes multiple interacting pathogenic species in the microbiome, could offer an attractive alternative solution. Advances in the Human Microbiome Project have provided numerous genomics data to study microbial interactions in the complex microbiome community. Integrating microbiome data with chemical genomics and other biological information enables us to delineate the landscape for the small molecule modulation of the human microbiome network. In this paper, we construct a disease-centric signed microbe-microbe interaction network using metabolite information of microbes and curated microbe effects on human health from published work. We develop a Signed Random Walk with Restart algorithm for the accurate prediction of pathogenic and commensal species. With a survey on the druggable and evolutionary space of microbe proteins, we find that 8-10% of them can be targeted by existing drugs or drug-like chemicals and that 25% of them have homologs to human proteins. We also demonstrate that drugs for diabetes are enriched in the potential inhibitors that target pathogenic microbe without affecting the commensal microbe, thus can be repurposed to modulate the microbiome ecosystem. We further show that periplasmic and cellular outer membrane proteins are overrepresented in the potential drug targets set in pathogenic microbe, but not in the commensal microbe. The systematic studies of polypharmacological landscape of the microbiome network may open a new avenue for the small-molecule drug discovery of microbiome.\n\nAuthor SummaryAs one of the most abundant components in human bodies, the microbiome has an extensive impact on human health. Pathogenic-microbes have become emerging potential therapeutic targets. Small-molecule drugs that only intervene in the growth of a specific pathogenic microbe without considering the interacting dynamics of the microbiome community may disrupt the ecosystem homeostasis, thus can cause drug side effect or prompt drug resistance. To discover novel drugs for safe and effective microbe-targeting therapeutics, a systematic approach is needed to fine-tune the microbiome ecosystem. To this end, we built a disease-centric signed microbe-microbe interaction network which accurately predicts the pathogenic or commensal effect of microbe on human health. Based on annotated and predicted pathogens and commensal species, we performed a systematic survey on therapeutic space and target landscape of existing drugs for modulating the microbiome ecosystem. Enrichment analysis on potential microbe-targeting drugs shows that drugs for diabetes could be repurposed to maintain the healthy state of microbiome. Furthermore, periplasmic and cellular outer membrane proteins are overrepresented in the potential drug targets of pathogenic-microbes, but not in proteins that perturb commensal-microbes. Our study may open a new avenue for the small molecule drug discovery of microbiome.",

    "abstract": "The X circular code is a set of 20 trinucleotides (codons) that has been identified in the protein-coding genes of most organisms (bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, plasmids, viruses). It has been shown previously that the X circular code has the important mathematical property of being an error-correcting code. Thus, motifs of the X circular code, i.e. a series of codons belonging to X, which are significantly enriched in the genes, allow identification and maintenance of the reading frame in genes. X motifs have also been identified in many transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and in important functional regions of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA), notably in the peptidyl transferase center and the decoding center. Here, we investigate the potential role of X motifs as functional elements in the regulation of gene expression. Surprisingly, the definition of a simple parameter identifies several relations between the X circular code and gene expression. First, we identify a correlation between the 20 codons of the X circular code and the optimal codons/dicodons that have been shown to influence translation efficiency. Using previously published experimental data, we then demonstrate that the presence of X motifs in genes can be used to predict the level of gene expression. Based on these observations, we propose the hypothesis that the X motifs represent a new genetic signal, contributing to the maintenance of the correct reading frame and the optimization and regulation of gene expression.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe standard genetic code is used by (quasi-) all organisms to translate information in genes into proteins. Recently, other codes have been identified in genomes that increase the versatility of gene decoding. Here, we focus on the circular codes, an important class of genome codes, that have the ability to detect and maintain the reading frame during translation. Motifs of the X circular code are enriched in protein-coding genes from most organisms from bacteria to eukaryotes, as well as in important molecules in the gene translation machinery, including transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that the X circular code represents an ancestor of the standard genetic code, that was used in primordial systems to simultaneously decode a smaller set of amino acids and synchronize the reading frame. Using previously published experimental data, we highlight several links between the presence of X motifs in genes and more efficient gene expression, supporting the hypothesis that the X circular code still contributes to the complex dynamics of gene regulation in extant genomes.",

    "abstract": "Collective behavior is an emergent property of numerous complex systems, from financial markets to cancer cells to predator-prey ecological systems. Characterizing modes of collective behavior is often done through human observation, training generative models, or other supervised learning techniques. Each of these cases requires knowledge of and a method for characterizing the macro-state(s) of the system. This presents a challenge for studying novel systems where there may be little prior knowledge. Here, we present a new unsupervised method of detecting emergent behavior in complex systems, and discerning between distinct collective behaviors. We require only metrics, d(1), d(2), defined on the set of agents, X, which measure agents nearness in variables of interest. We apply the method of diffusion maps to the systems (X, d(i)) to recover efficient embeddings of their interaction networks. Comparing these geometries, we formulate a measure of similarity between two networks, called the map alignment statistic (MAS). A large MAS is evidence that the two networks are codetermined in some fashion, indicating an emergent relationship between the metrics d(1) and d(2). Additionally, the form of the macro-scale organization is encoded in the covariances among the two sets of diffusion map components. Using these covariances we discern between different modes of collective behavior in a data-driven, unsupervised manner. This method is demonstrated on empirical fish schooling data. We show that our state classification subdivides the known behaviors of the school in a meaningful manner, leading to a finer description of the systems behavior.\n\nAuthor summaryMany complex systems in society and nature exhibit collective behavior where individuals local interactions lead to system-wide organization. One challenge we face today is to identify and characterize these emergent behaviors, and here we have developed a new method for analyzing data from individuals, to detect when a given complex system is exhibiting system-wide organization. Importantly, our approach requires no prior knowledge of the fashion in which the collective behavior arises, or the macro-scale variables in which it manifests. We apply the new method to an agent-based model and empirical observations of fish schooling. While we have demonstrated the utility of our approach to biological systems, it can be applied widely to financial, medical, and technological systems for example.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions are involved in a wide range of cellular processes. These interactions often involve intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and protein binding domains. However, the details of IDP binding pathways are hard to characterize using experimental approaches, which can rarely capture intermediate states present at low populations. SH3 domains are common protein interaction domains that typically bind proline-rich disordered segments and are involved in cell signaling, regulation, and assembly. We hypothesized, given the flexibility of SH3 binding peptides, that their binding pathways include multiple steps important for function. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to characterize the steps of binding between the yeast Abp1p SH3 domain (AbpSH3) and a proline-rich IDP, ArkA. Before binding, the N-terminal segment 1 of ArkA is pre-structured and adopts a polyproline II helix, while segment 2 of ArkA (C-terminal) adopts a 310 helix, but is far less structured than segment 1. As segment 2 interacts with AbpSH3, it becomes more structured, but retains flexibility even in the fully engaged state. Binding simulations reveal that ArkA enters a flexible encounter complex before forming the fully engaged bound complex. In the encounter complex, transient nonspecific hydrophobic and long-range electrostatic contacts form between ArkA and the binding surface of SH3. The encounter complex ensemble includes conformations with segment 1 in both the forward and reverse orientation, suggesting that segment 2 may play a role in stabilizing the correct binding orientation. While the encounter complex forms quickly, the slow step of binding is the transition from the disordered encounter ensemble to the fully engaged state. In this transition, ArkA makes specific contacts with AbpSH3 and buries more hydrophobic surface. Simulating the binding between ApbSH3 and ArkA provides insight into the role of encounter complex intermediates and nonnative hydrophobic interactions for other SH3 domains and IDPs in general.\n\nAuthor SummaryComplex cellular processes are mediated by interactions between proteins, and to determine how these interactions affect cellular function and binding kinetics we often must understand the protein binding pathway. Many protein interaction domains, such as the SH3 domain, bind to intrinsically disordered proteins in a coupled folding and binding process. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we find that the binding of the disordered ArkA peptide to the yeast Abp1p SH3 domain proceeds through a flexible, disordered encounter complex before reaching a stable fully bound state. The encounter complex is stabilized by nonspecific long-range electrostatic interactions and nonspecific hydrophobic interactions between the peptide and domain. Our simulations highlight the important role of hydrophobic interactions in the entire SH3 binding process: both nonspecific hydrophobic contacts in the encounter complex and specific hydrophobic contacts in the fully bound complex. The encounter complex could be key to understanding the functional behavior of SH3 domain interactions because the encounter complex forms very quickly and the transition to the fully bound state is slower. In cells, an SH3 domain may form an encounter complex quickly and nonspecifically with many potential binding partners, allowing it to search for the correct recognition sequence before completing the binding process.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of post-synaptic receptors plays an important role in determining synaptic strength and plasticity. The Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (nmj) has been used extensively as a model to understand some of these processes. In this context, we are interested in the role of Drosophila Monensin sensitive protein 1 (DMon1) in regulating glutamate receptor (GluRIIA) levels at the nmj. Dmon1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein which, in complex with CCZ1, regulates the conversion of early endosomes to late endosomes through recruitment of Rab7. C-terminal deletion mutants of Dmon1 (Dmon1{Delta}181) exhibit lethality. The escapers have a short life span and exhibit severe motor defects. At the nmj, these mutants show a defects in synaptic morphology and a strong increase in glutamate receptor GluRIIA levels. The mechanism by which Dmon1 regulates GluRIIA is unclear.\n\nIn this study, we have described the characterization the mutation in an EMS mutant referred to as pog1 and demonstrate this mutant to be an allele of Dmon1. Further, we have examined the role of rab7 in regulation the of GluRIIA. We show that similar to Dmon1, knock-down of rab7 using RNAi in neurons, and not muscles, leads to an increase in GluRIIA. Loss of one copy each of Dmon1 with rab7 leads to a synergistic increase in receptor expression. Further, overexpression of an activated Rab7 can rescue the GluRIIA phenotype observed in Dmon1{Delta}181 mutants. Together, these results highlight a neuronal role for Rab7 in GluRIIA regulation and underscores the important of the endo-lysosomal pathway in this process.",

    "abstract": "Sex-biased gene expression patterns in animals are generally controlled by the somatic sex-determination hierarchies. How the different tiers of these hierarchies act on sexually dimorphic gene regulation is still poorly understood. In the developing Drosophila biarmipes wing, the X-linked gene yellow is expressed in males in a specific distal spot pattern that prefigures a corresponding adult pigmentation pattern. This yellow expression pattern is controlled by the spot enhancer, but the origin of yellow sexually dimorphic expression is unknown. Here we find that the functional interaction between homologous yellow alleles silences specifically the spot enhancer, which is therefore active in males (XY) but not in females (XX). We show that inserting yellow at homologous positions on autosomes recapitulates, in either sex, the homologous-dependent silencing of the spot enhancer. We further find that this silencing requires the yellow intron as well as the architectural protein Mod(mdg4). Finally, we show that Mod(mdg4) is also necessary for the sex-biased expression of some X-linked genes in the brain. Our results demonstrate that regulatory interactions between X-linked homologous alleles promote their sex-biased expression, independently of the canonical sex-determination hierarchy. More generally, they illustrate the biological significance of homologous chromosome pairing and trans-homolog interactions for the sexually dimorphic regulation of X-linked genes.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax malaria is much less common in Africa than the rest of the world because the parasite relies primarily on the Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor (DARC) to invade human erythrocytes, and the majority of Africans are Duffy negative. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the reporting of P. vivax cases in Africa, with a high number of them being in Duffy negative individuals, potentially indicating P. vivax has evolved an alternative invasion mechanism that can overcome Duffy negativity. Here, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and copy number variation (CNV) in Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) data from 44 P. vivax samples isolated from symptomatic malaria patients in southwestern Ethiopia, where both Duffy positive and Duffy negative individuals are found. A total of 236,351 SNPs were detected, of which 21.9% was nonsynonymous and 78.1% was synonymous mutations. The largest number of SNPs were detected on chromosomes 9 (33,478 SNPs; 14% of total) and 10 (28,133 SNPs; 11.9%). There were particularly high levels of polymorphism in erythrocyte binding gene candidates including reticulocyte binding protein 2c (RBP2c), merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1), and merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3.5, MSP3.85 and MSP3.9). Thirteen genes related to immunogenicity and erythrocyte binding function were detected with significant signals of positive selection. Variation in gene copy number was also concentrated in genes involved in host-parasite interactions, including the expansion of the Duffy binding protein gene (PvDBP) on chromosome 6 and several PIR genes. Based on the phylogeny constructed from the whole genome sequences, the expansion of these genes was an independent process among the P. vivax lineages in Ethiopia. We further inferred transmission patterns of P. vivax infections among study sites and showed various levels of gene flow at a small geographical scale. The genomic features of P. vivax provided baseline data for future comparison with those in Duffy-negative individuals, and allowed us to develop a panel of informative Single Nucleotide Polymorphic markers diagnostic at a micro-geographical scale.",

    "abstract": "Topologically associating domains (TAD) and insulated neighborhoods (INs) have been proposed to constrain enhancer-promoter communications to enable cell-type specific transcription programs, but recent studies show that disruption of TADs and INs resulted in relatively mild changes in gene expression profiles. To better understand the role of chromatin architecture in dynamic enhancer-promoter contacts and lineage-specific gene expression, we have utilized the auxin-inducible degron system to acutely deplete CTCF, a key factor involved in TADs and IN formation, in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and examined chromatin architecture and gene regulation during neural differentiation. We find that while CTCF depletion leads to global weakening of TAD boundaries and loss of INs, only a minor fraction of enhancer-promoter contacts are lost, affecting a small subset of genes. The CTCF-dependent enhancer-promoter contacts tend to be long-range, spanning hundreds of kilobases, and are established directly by CTCF binding to promoters. Disruption of CTCF binding at the promoter reduces enhancer-promoter contacts and transcription, while artificial tethering of CTCF to the promoter restores the enhancer-promoter contacts and gene activation. Genome-wide analysis of CTCF binding and gene expression across multiple mouse tissues suggests that CTCF-dependent promoter-enhancer contacts may regulate expression of additional mouse genes, particularly those expressed in the brain. Our results uncover both CTCF-dependent and independent enhancer-promoter contacts, and highlight a distinct role for CTCF in promoting enhancer-promoter contacts and gene activation in addition to its insulator function.",

Five latent personality dimensions (The Heidelberg Five) were identified and interpreted as Emotional Lability (ELAB), Lack of Behavioral Control (LBCN), Type A Behavior (TYAB), Locus of Control over Disease (LOCC), and Psychoticism (PSYC). A subset of participants (n=3 268; after quality control) were genotyped on whole-genome arrays at follow-up. To further characterize The Heidelberg Five, we analyzed genomic underpinnings, their relations to the genetic basis of the Big Five trait Neuroticism, and longitudinal associations with lifetime psychiatric symptoms. SNP-based heritability was significant for ELAB (34%) and LBCN (29%). Five separate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using factor scores on personality dimensions as phenotypes were conducted, only the phenotype PSYC yielded a genome-wide significant finding (p<5x10-8, top SNP rs138223660). Gene-based analyses identified significant findings for ELAB (Integrin Subunit Beta 5), TYAB (Coiled-coil Domain Containing 83), and PSYC (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group H Member 4). Polygenic risk scores for Neuroticism, phenotypically related to ELAB, were associated with ELAB, but not with the remaining Heidelberg Five. Longitudinally, all personality dimensions were related to depressive symptoms at follow-up, with ELAB, LBCN, and PSYC also associated with lifetime anxiety symptoms. These results highlight the clinical importance of health-related personality traits, and identify LBCN as a heritable \"executive function\" personality trait.",

Genetic factors leading to HH have yet to be fully elucidated.\n\nMethodsHere, we report on genome and transcriptome data analyses from a male patient with HH and history of growth delay who has an inherited deletion of chromosome Xq28. Furthermore, expression analyses were done for this patient and his unaffected family members and compared to normal controls to identify dysregulated genes due to this deletion.\n\nResultsOur patients Xq28 deletion is 44,806bp and contains only two genes FUNDC2 and CMC4. Expression of both FUNDC2 and CMC4 are completely abolished in the patient. Gene ontology analyses of differentially expressed genes in the patient in comparison to controls show that significantly up-regulated genes in the patient are enriched in Sertoli cell barrier regulation, apoptosis, inflammatory response and gonadotropin-releasing regulation. Indeed, our patient has an elevated FSH level, which regulates Sertoli cell proliferation and spermatogenesis. In his mother and sister, who are heterozygous for this deletion, X-chromosome inactivation is skewed towards the deleted X, suggesting a mechanism to avoid FSH dysregulation.\n\nConclusionCompared to the previously reported men with variable sized Xq28 deletions, our study suggests that loss of function of FUNDC2 and/or CMC4 results in dysregulation of apoptosis, inflammation and FSH, and is sufficient to cause Xq28-associated HH.",

    "abstract": "After acute kidney injury (AKI), patients either recover or alternatively develop fibrosis and chronic kidney disease. Interactions between injured epithelia, stroma and inflammatory cells determine whether kidneys repair or undergo fibrosis, but the molecular events that drive these processes are poorly understood. Here, we use single nucleus RNA sequencing of a mouse model of AKI to characterize cell states during repair from acute injury. We identify a distinct proinflammatory and profibrotic proximal tubule cell state that fails to repair. Deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq datasets indicates that this \"failed-repair proximal tubule cell\" or FR-PTC, state can be detected in other models of kidney injury, increasing in the aging rat kidney and over time in human kidney allografts. We also describe dynamic intercellular communication networks and discern transcriptional pathways driving successful vs. failed repair. Our study provides a detailed description of cellular responses after injury and suggests that the FR-PTC state may represent a therapeutic target to improve repair.\n\nSignificance StatementSingle nucleus RNA sequencing revealed gene expression changes during repair after acute kidney injury. We describe a small population of proximal tubule cells that fail to repair (FR-PTC). Since this subpopulation expresses abundant pro-inflammatory and profibrotic genes, it may represent a new therapeutic target to improve repair and reduce fibrosis after AKI.",

    "abstract": "Ozonide antimalarials, OZ277 (arterolane) and OZ439 (artefenomel), are synthetic peroxide-based antimalarials with potent activity against the deadliest malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Here we used a \"multi-omics\" workflow, in combination with activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), to demonstrate that peroxide antimalarials initially target the haemoglobin (Hb) digestion pathway to kill malaria parasites.\n\nTime-dependent metabolomic profiling of ozonide-treated P. falciparum infected red blood cells revealed a rapid depletion of short Hb-derived peptides followed by subsequent alterations in lipid and nucleotide metabolism, while untargeted peptidomics showed accumulation of longer Hb-derived peptides. Quantitative proteomics and ABPP assays demonstrated that Hb-digesting proteases were increased in abundance and activity following treatment, respectively. The association between ozonide activity and Hb catabolism was also confirmed in a K13-mutant artemisinin resistant parasite line. To demonstrate that compromised Hb catabolism may be a primary mechanism involved in ozonide antimalarial activity, we showed that parasites forced to rely solely on Hb digestion for amino acids became hypersensitive to short ozonide exposures.\n\nQuantitative proteomics analysis also revealed parasite proteins involved in translation and the ubiquitin-proteasome system were enriched following drug treatment, suggestive of the parasite engaging a stress response to mitigate ozonide-induced damage. Taken together, these data point to a mechanism of action involving initial impairment of Hb catabolism, and indicate that the parasite regulates protein turnover to manage ozonide-induced damage.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe ozonides are a novel class of fully synthetic antimalarial drugs with potent activity against all parasite species that cause malaria, including the deadliest, Plasmodium falciparum. With the emergence of resistance to current frontline artemisinin-based antimalarials, new drugs are urgently needed and a clear understanding of their mechanism of action is essential so that they can be optimally deployed in the field. Here, we studied the biochemical effects of two ozonides, OZ277 (marketed in India in combination with piperaquine) and OZ439 (in Phase IIb clinical trials) in P. falciparum parasites using an untargeted multi-omics approach consisting of proteomics, peptidomics and time-dependent metabolomics, along with activity-based protease profiling. We found that the ozonides initially disrupt haemoglobin metabolism and that they likely engage the parasite proteostatic stress response. Furthermore, when the duration of ozonide exposure was extended beyond 3 hours to reflect clinically-relevant exposure periods, additional parasite biochemical pathways were perturbed. This comprehensive analysis provides new insight into the antimalarial mode of action of ozonides and provides new opportunities for interventions to enhance their antimalarial efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Environmental conditions shape entire communities by driving microbial interactions. These interactions then find their reflection in the evolutionary outcome of microbial competition. In static, homogeneous environments a robust, or evolutionary stable, outcome in microbial communities is reachable, if it exists. However, introducing heterogeneity and time-dependence in microbial ecology leads to stochastic evolutionary outcomes determined by specific environmental changes. We utilise evolutionary game theory to provide insight into phenotypic competition in dynamic environments. We capture these effects in a perturbed evolutionary game describing microbial interactions at a phenotypic level. We show that under regular periodic environmental fluctuations a stable state that preserves dominant phenotypes is reached. However, rapid environmental shifts, especially in a cyclic interactions, can lead to critical shifts in the evolutionary balance among phenotypes. Our analysis suggests that an understanding of the robustness of the systems current state is necessary to understand when system will shift to the new equilibrium. This can be done by understanding the systems overall margin of safety, that is, what level of perturbations it can take before its equilibrium changes. In particular, the extent to which an environmental shift affects the systems behaviour.",

Only AsCpf1 have been developed for insect genome editing, and the novel Cas12a orthologs nucleases and editing efficiency require more study in insect. We compared three Cas12a orthologs nucleases, AsCpf1, FnCpf1, and LbCpf1, for their editing efficiencies and antiviral abilities in vitro. The three Cpf1 efficiently edited the BmNPV genome and inhibited BmNPV replication in BmN-SWU1 cells. The antiviral ability of the FnCpf1 system was more efficient than the SpCas9 system after infection by BmNPV. We created FnCpf1xgIE1 and SpCas9xsgIE1 transgenic hybrid lines and evaluated the gene editing efficiency of different systems at the same target site. We improved the antiviral ability using the FnCpf1 system in transgenic silkworm. This study demonstrated use of the CRISPR/Cpf1 system to achieve high editing efficiencies in the silkworm, and illustrates the use of this technology for increasing disease resistance.\n\nAuthor SummaryGenome editing is a powerful tool that has been widely used in gene function, gene therapy, pest control, and disease-resistant engineering in most parts of pathogens research. Since the establishment of CRISPR/Cas9, powerful strategies for antiviral therapy of transgenic silkworm have emerged. Nevertheless, there is still room to expand the scope of genome editing tool for further application to improve antiviral research. Here, we demonstrate that three Cpf1 endonuclease can be used efficiency editing BmNPV genome in vitro and in vivo for the first time. More importantly, this Cpf1 system could improve the resistance of transgenic silkworms to BmNPV compare with Cas9 system, and no significant cocoons difference was observed between transgenic lines infected with BmNPV and control. These broaden the range of application of CRISPR for novel genome editing methods in silkworm and also enable sheds light on antiviral therapy.",

In this study, we show that visual information sampling is not just locked to the (overt) movement dynamics, but it is structured by the internal (covert) dynamics of cortico-motor control. We asked human participants to perform an isometric motor task - based on proprioceptive feedback - while detecting unrelated near-threshold visual stimuli. The motor output (Force) shows zero-lag coherence with brain activity (recorded via electroencephalography) in the beta-band, as previously reported. In contrast, cortical rhythms in the alpha-band systematically forerun the motor output by 200ms. Importantly, visual detection is facilitated when cortico-motor alpha (not beta) synchronization is enhanced immediately before stimulus onset, namely at the optimal phase relationship for sensorimotor communication. These findings demonstrate an automatic gating of visual inputs by the ongoing motor control processes, providing evidence of an internal and alpha-cycling visuomotor loop.",

    "abstract": "Eigenvector alignment, introduced herein to investigate human brain functional networks, is adapted from methods developed to detect influential nodes and communities in networked systems. It is used to identify differences in the brain networks of subjects with Alzheimers disease (AD), amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) and healthy controls (HC). Well-established methods exist for analysing connectivity networks composed of brain regions, including the widespread use of centrality metrics such as eigenvector centrality. However, these metrics provide only limited information on the relationship between regions, with this understanding often sought by comparing the strength of pairwise functional connectivity. Our holistic approach, eigenvector alignment, considers the impact of all functional connectivity changes before assessing the strength of the functional relationship, i.e. alignment, between any two regions. This is achieved by comparing the placement of regions in a Euclidean space defined by the networks dominant eigenvectors. Eigenvector alignment recognises the strength of bilateral connectivity in cortical areas of healthy control subjects, but also reveals degradation of this commissural system in those with AD. Surprisingly little structural change is detected for key regions in the Default Mode Network, despite significant declines in the functional connectivity of these regions. In contrast, regions in the auditory cortex display significant alignment changes that begin in aMCI and are the most prominent structural changes for those with AD. Alignment differences between aMCI and AD subjects are detected, including notable changes to the hippocampal regions. These findings suggest eigenvector alignment can play a complementary role, alongside established network analytic approaches, to capture how the brains functional networks develop and adapt when challenged by disease processes such as AD.",

    "abstract": "Mapping information from different brains gathered using different modalities into a common coordinate space corresponding to a reference brain is an aspirational goal in modern neuroscience, analogous in importance to mapping genomic data to a reference genome. While brain-atlas mapping workflows exist for single-modality data (3D MRI or STPT image volumes), generally speaking data sets need to be combined across modalities with different contrast mechanisms and scale, in the presence of missing data as well as signals not present in the reference. This has so far been an unsolved problem. We have solved this problem in its full generality by developing and implementing a rigorous, non-parametric generative framework, that learns unknown mappings between contrast mechanisms from data and infers missing data. Our methodology permits rigorous quantification of the local sale changes between different individual brains, which has so far been neglected. We are also able to quantitatively characterize the individual variation in shape. Our work establishes a quantitative, scalable and streamlined workflow for unifying a broad spectrum of multi-modal whole-brain light microscopic data volumes into a coordinate-based atlas framework, a step that is a prerequisite for large scale integration of whole brain data sets in modern neuroscience.\n\nSummaryA current focus of research in neuroscience is to enumerate, map and annotate neuronal cell types in whole vertebrate brains using different modalities of data acquisition. A key challenge remains: can the large multiplicities of molecular anatomical data sets from many different modalities, and at widely different scales, be all assembled into a common reference space? Solving this problem is as important for modern neuroscience as mapping to reference genomes was for molecular biology. While workable brain-to-atlas mapping workflows exist for single modalities (e.g. mapping serial two photon (STP) brains to STP references) and largely for clean data, this is generally not a solved problem for mapping across contrast modalities, where data sets can be partial, and often carry signal not present in the reference brain (e.g. tracer injections). Presenting these types of anatomical data into a common reference frame for all to use is an aspirational goal for the neuroscience community. However so far this goal has been elusive due to the difficulties pointed to above and real integration is lacking.\n\nWe have solved this problem in its full generality by developing and implementing a rigorous, generative framework, that learns unknown mappings between contrast mechanisms from data and infers missing data. The key idea in the framework is to minimize the difference between synthetic image volumes and real data over function classes of non-parametric mappings, including a diffeomorphic mapping, the contrast map and locations and types of missing data/non-reference signals. The non-parametric mappings are instantiated as regularized but over-parameterized functional forms over spatial grids. A final, manual refinement step is included to ensure scientific quality of the results.\n\nOur framework permits rigorous quantification of the local metric distortions between different individual brains, which is important for quantitative joint analysis of data gathered in multiple animals. Existing methods for atlas mapping do not provide metric quantifications and analyses of the resulting individual variations. We apply this pipeline to data modalities including various combinations of in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI, 3D STP and fMOST data sets, 2D serial histology sections including a 3D reassembly step, and brains processed for snRNAseq with tissue partially removed. Median local linear scale change with respect to a histologically processed Nissl reference brain, as measured using the Jacobian of the diffeomorphic transformations, was found to be 0.93 for STPT imaged brains (7% shrinkage) and 0.84 for fMOST imaged brains (16% shrinkage between reference brains and imaged volumes). Shrinkage between in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI for a mouse brain was found to be 0.96, and the distortion between the perfused brain and tape-cut digital sections was shown to be minimal (1.02 for Nissl histology sections). We were able to quantitatively characterize the individual variation in shape across individuals by studying variations in the tangent space of the diffeomorphic transformation around the reference brain. Based on this work we are able to establish co-variation patterns in metric distortions across the entire brain, across a large population set. We note that the magnitude of individual variation is often greater than differences between different sample preparation techniques. Our work establishes a quantitative, scalable and streamlined workflow for unifying a broad spectrum of multi-modal whole-brain light microscopic data volumes into a coordinate-based atlas framework, a step that is a prerequisite for large scale integration of whole brain data sets in modern neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Sustaining a robust metabolic network requires a balanced and fully functioning proteome. In addition to amino acids, many enzymes require cofactors (coenzymes and engrafted prosthetic groups) to function properly. Extensively validated genome-scale models of metabolism and gene expression (ME-models) have the unique ability to compute an optimal proteome composition underlying a metabolic phenotype, including the provision of all required cofactors. Here we use the ME-model for Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 to computationally examine how environmental conditions change the proteome and its accompanying cofactor usage. We found that: (1) The cofactor requirements computed by the ME model mostly agree with the standard biomass objective function used in models of metabolism alone (M models); (2) ME-model computations reveal non-intuitive variability in cofactor use under different growth conditions; (3) An analysis of ME-model predicted protein use in aerobic and anaerobic conditions suggests an enrichment in the use of prebiotic amino acids in the proteins used to sustain anaerobic growth (4) The ME-model could describe how limitation in key protein components affect the metabolic state of E. coli. Genome-scale models have thus reached a level of sophistication where they reveal intricate properties of functional proteomes and how they support different E. coli lifestyles.",

    "abstract": "The genus Synechococcus (also named Synechococcus collective, SC) is a major contributor to global primary productivity. It is found in a wide range of aquatic ecosystems. Synechococcus is metabolically diverse, with some lineages thriving in polar and nutrient-rich locations, and other in tropical riverine waters. Although many studies have discussed the ecology and evolution of Synechococcus, there is a paucity of knowledge on the taxonomic structure of SC. Only a few studies have addressed the taxonomy of SC, and this issue still remains largely ignored. Our aim was to establish a new classification system for SC. Our analyses included comparing GC% content, genome size, pairwise Average Amino acid Identity (AAI) values, phylogenomics and gene cluster profiles of 170 publicly available SC genomes. All analyses were consistent with the discrimination of 11 genera, from which 2 are newly proposed (Lacustricoccus and Synechospongium). The new classification is also consistent with the habitat distribution (seawater, freshwater and thermal environments) and reflects the ecological and evolutionary relationships of SC. We provide a practical and consistent classification scheme for the entire Synechococcus collective.",

    "abstract": "Across taxa, circadian control of physiology and behavior arises from cell-autonomous oscillations in gene expression, governed by a networks of so-called  clock genes, collectively forming transcription-translation feedback loops. In modern vertebrates, these networks contain multiple copies of clock gene family members, which arose through whole genome duplication (WGD) events during evolutionary history. It remains unclear to what extent multiple copies of clock gene family members are functionally redundant or have allowed for functional diversification. We addressed this problem through an analysis of clock gene expression in the Atlantic salmon, a representative of the salmonids, a group which has undergone at least 4 rounds of WGD since the base of the vertebrate lineage, giving an unusually large complement of clock genes. By comparing expression patterns across multiple tissues, and during development, we present evidence for gene- and tissue-specific divergence in expression patterns, consistent with functional diversification of clock gene duplicates. In contrast to mammals, we found no evidence for coupling between cortisol and circadian gene expression, but cortisol mediated non-circadian regulated expression of a subset of clock genes in the salmon gill was evident. This regulation is linked to changes in gill function necessary for the transition from fresh- to sea-water in anadromous fish. Overall, this analysis emphasises the potential for a richly diversified clock gene network to serve a mixture of circadian and non-circadian functions in vertebrate groups with complex genomes.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe generation of daily (circadian) rhythms in behaviour and physiology depends on the activities of networks of so-called clock genes. In vertebrates, these have become highly complex due to a process known as whole genome duplication, which has occurred repeatedly during evolutionary history, giving rise to additional copies of key elements of the clock gene network. It remains unclear whether this results in functional redundancy, or whether it has permitted new roles for clock genes to emerge. Here, based on studies in the Atlantic salmon, a species with an unusually large complement of clock genes, we present evidence in favour of the latter scenario. We observe marked tissue-specific, and developmentally-dependent differences in the expression patterns of duplicated copies of key clock genes, and we identify a subset of clock genes whose expression is associated with the physiological preparation to migrate to sea, but is independent of circadian regulation. Associated with this, cortisol secretion is uncoupled from circadian organisation, contrasting with the situation in mammals. Our results indicate that whole genome duplication has permitted clock genes to diversify into non-circadian functions, and raise interesting questions about the ubiquity of mammal-like coupling between circadian and endocrine function.",

    "abstract": "Microbial metabolic processes greatly impact ecosystem functioning and the physiology of multi-cellular host organisms. The inference of metabolic capabilities and phenotypes from genome sequences with the help of reference biomolecular knowledge stored in online databases remains a major challenge in systems biology. Here, we present gapseq: a novel tool for automated pathway prediction and metabolic network reconstruction from microbial genome sequences. gapseq combines databases of reference protein sequences (UniProt, TCDB), in tandem with pathway and reaction databases (MetaCyc, KEGG, ModelSEED). This enables the prediction of an organism\u2019s metabolic capabilities from sequence homology and pathway topology criteria. By incorporating a novel LP-based gap-filling algorithm, gapseq facilitates the construction of genome-scale metabolic models that are suitable for metabolic phenotype predictions by using constraint-based flux analysis. We validated gapseq by comparing predictions to experimental data for more than 3, 000 bacterial organisms comprising 14, 895 phenotypic traits that include enzyme activity, energy sources, fermentation products, and gene essentiality. This large-scale phenotypic trait prediction test showed, that gapseq yields an overall accuracy of 81% and thereby outperforms other commonly used reconstruction tools. Furthermore, we illustrate the application of gapseq-reconstructed models to simulate biochemical interactions between microorganisms in multi-species communities. Altogether, gapseq is a new method that improves the predictive potential of automated metabolic network reconstructions and further increases their applicability in biotechnological, ecological, and medical research. gapseq is available at https://github.com/jotech/gapseq.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Two measures of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) are Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) and bicoherence. The estimation of PAC with meaningful bandwidth for the high frequency amplitude is crucial in order to avoid misinterpretations. While recommendations on the bandwidth of PACs amplitude component exist, there is no consensus yet. Here, we show that the earlier recommendations on filter settings lead to estimates which are smeared in the frequency domain, which makes it difficult to distinguish higher harmonics from other types of CFC. We also show that smearing can be avoided with a different choice of filter settings by theoretically relating PAC to bicoherence. To illustrate this, PAC estimates of simulations and empirical data are compared to bispectral analyses. We used simulations replicated from an earlier study and empirical data from human electro-encephalography and rat local field potentials. PACs amplitude component was estimated using a bandwidth with a ratio of (1) 2:1, (2) 1:1, or (3) 0.5:1 relative to the frequency of the phase component. For both simulated and empirical data, PAC was smeared over a broad frequency range and not present when the estimates comprised a 2:1- and 0.5:1-ratio, respectively. In contrast, the 1:1-ratio accurately avoids smearing and results in clear signals of CFC. Bicoherence estimates, which do not smear across frequencies by construction, were found to be essentially identical to PAC calculated with the recommended frequency setting.",

We recommend that SeqSero2 users be mindful of the GC-related sequencing bias when analyzing Nextera XT-prepared genomes. Although it is unusual for such biases to compromise serotype prediction by SeqSero2 per our knowledge and analysis, it is unknown whether they could affect subtyping and characterization of other low-GC regions, such as Salmonella pathogenicity islands, when genome assembly is affected by such biases.",
