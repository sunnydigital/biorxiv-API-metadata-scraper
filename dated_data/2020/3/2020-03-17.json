    "abstract": "Bats provide key ecosystem services such as crop pest regulation, pollination, seed dispersal, and soil fertilization. Bats are also major hosts for biological agents responsible for zoonoses, such as coronaviruses (CoVs). The islands of the Western Indian Ocean are identified as a major biodiversity hotspot, with more than 50 bat species. In this study, we tested 1,013 bats belonging to 36 species from Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Island and Seychelles, based on molecular screening and partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. In total, 88 bats (8.7%) tested positive for coronaviruses, with higher prevalence in Mozambican bats (20.5% {+/-} 4.9%) as compared to those sampled on islands (4.5% {+/-} 1.5%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed a large diversity of - and {beta}-CoVs and a strong signal of co-evolution between CoVs and their bat host species, with limited evidence for host-switching, except for bat species sharing day roost sites.\n\nImportanceThis is the first study to report the presence of coronaviruses (CoVs) in bats in Mayotte, Mozambique and Reunion Island, and in insectivorous bats in Madagascar. Eight percent of the tested bats were positive for CoVs, with higher prevalence in continental Africa than on islands. A high genetic diversity of - and {beta}-CoVs was found, with strong association between bat host and virus phylogenies, supporting a long history of co-evolution between bats and their associated CoVs in the Western Indian Ocean. These results highlight that strong variation between islands does exist and is associated with the composition of the bat species community on each island. Future studies should investigate whether CoVs detected in these bats have a potential for spillover in other hosts.",

    "abstract": "Despite increasing numbers of effective anti-cancer therapies, successful treatment is limited by the development of drug resistance. While the contribution of genetic factors to drug resistance is undeniable, little is known about how drug-sensitive cells first evade drug action to proliferate in drug. Here we track the response of thousands of single melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitors and show that a subset escapes drug within the first 3 days of treatment. Cell-cycle re-entry occurs via a non-genetic mechanism involving activation of mTORC1 and ATF4, validated in cultures of patient biopsies. These escapees cycle periodically in drug, incur significant DNA damage, and out-proliferate non-escapees over extended treatment. Our work reveals a mutagenesis-prone, expanding subpopulation of early drug escapees that may seed development of permanent drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Neurons of the neocortex are generated by neural progenitors called radial glial cells. These polarized cells extend a short apical process towards the ventricular surface and a long basal fiber that acts as a scaffold for neuronal migration. How the microtubule cytoskeleton is organized in these cells to support long-range transport in unknown. Using subcellular live imaging within brain tissue, we show that microtubules in the apical process uniformly emanate for the pericentrosomal region, while microtubules in the basal fiber display a mixed polarity, reminiscent of the mammalian dendrite. We identify acentrosomal microtubule organizing centers localized in swellings of the basal fiber. We characterize their distribution and demonstrate that they accumulate the minus end stabilizing factor CAMSAP3 and TGN-related membranes, from which the majority of microtubules grow. Finally, using live imaging of human fetal cortex, we show that this organization is conserved in basal radial glial (bRG) cells, a highly abundant progenitor cell population associated with human brain size expansion.",

    "abstract": "Blebs, pressure driven protrusions of the plasma membrane, facilitate the movement of cells such as the soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and other eukaryotes such as white blood cells and cancer cells. Blebs initiate or nucleate when proteins connecting the membrane to the cortex detach, either as a result of a rupture of the cortex or as a direct consequence of a build up in hydrostatic pressure. While linker detachment resulting from excess hydrostatic pressure is well understood, the mechanism by which cells rupture their cortex in locations of bleb formation is not so clear. Consequently, existing predictive models of bleb site selection do not account for it. To resolve this, we propose a model for bleb initiation which combines the geometric forces on the cell cortex/membrane complex with the underlying activity of actin binding proteins. In our model gaps, resulting from a rupture of the cortex, form at locations of high membrane energy where an accumulation of myosin II helps to weaken the cortex. We validate this model in part through a membrane energy functional which combines stresses on the cell boundary from membrane tension, curvature, membrane-cortex linker tension with hydrostatic pressure. Application of this functional to microscopy images of chemotaxing Dictyostelium discoideum cells identifies bleb nucleation sites at the highest energy locations 96.7% of the time. Sensitivity analysis of the model components points to membrane tension and hydrostatic pressure, all of which are regulated by myosin II, as critical to model predictability. Furthermore, microscopy reveals discrete clusters of myosin II along the leading edge of the cell, with blebs emerging from 80% of these sites. Together, our findings suggest a critical role for myosin II in bleb initiation through the formation of gaps and provides a predictive mathematical model for quantitative studies of blebbing.\n\nAuthor summaryEukaryotic cells such as white blood cells and cancer cells have been observed to move by making spherical herniation of their plasma membrane, referred to as blebs. The precise mechanism by which cells select locations around their boundary to initiate blebs is unclear. We hypothesize that blebs initiate at locations of high membrane energy where an accumulation of myosin II helps to rupture the cortex and/or detach linker proteins. We test this hypothesis by formulating a free energy functional representation of membrane energy to predict where blebs will initiate. The functional accounts for geometric forces due to membrane tension, curvature and membrane-cortex linker tension as well as hydrostatic pressure. Application of the functional to data from the soil amoeba, Dictyostelium disodium, identifies blebs at the highest energy locations over 90% of the time. Sensitivity analysis of model components points to membrane tension and hydrostatic pressure, all influenced by myosin II, as major forces driving bleb initiation. Additionally, we observe clusters of myosin II at locations of bleb initiation, further supporting its role in the process.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the inferior olivary nuclei (IO neurons) send climbing fibers to Purkinje cells to elicit functions of the cerebellum. IO neurons and Purkinje cells are derived from neural progenitors expressing the proneural gene ptf1a. In this study, we found that the homeobox gene gsx2 was co-expressed with ptf1a in IO progenitors in zebrafish. Both gsx2 and ptf1a zebrafish mutants showed a strong reduction or loss of IO neurons. The expression of ptf1a was not affected in gsx2 mutants and vice versa. In IO progenitors, the ptf1a mutation increased apoptosis whereas the gsx2 mutation did not, suggesting that ptf1a and gsx2 are independently regulated and have distinct roles. The fibroblast growth factors (Fgf) 3/8a and retinoic acid signals negatively and positively, respectively, regulated gsx2 expression and thereby the development of IO neurons. mafba and hox genes are at least partly involved in the Fgf- and retinoic acid-dependent regulation of IO neuronal development. Our results indicate that gsx2 mediates the rostro-caudal positional signals to specify the identity of IO neurons from ptf1a-expressing neural progenitors.\n\nSummaryThe homeobox gene gsx2 mediates rostro-caudal positional signaling to specify the identify of neurons in the inferior olivary nuclei from neural progenitors expressing the proneural gene ptf1a.",

Our software provides advanced functions for importing DNA variants, computing mutation types, and extracting mutational signatures via non-negative matrix factorization. We applied mutSignatures to analyze somatic mutations found in smoking-related cancer datasets. We characterized mutational signatures that were consistent with those reported before in independent investigations. Our work demonstrates that selected mutational signatures correlated with specific clinical and molecular features across different cancer types, and revealed complementarity of specific mutational patterns that has not previously been identified.

Here, we investigate a paralog to spe-47: spe-50, which has a highly conserved sequence and expression, but which is not functionally redundant to spe-47. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the duplication event that produced the paralogs occurred prior to the radiation of the Caenorhabditis species included in the analysis, allowing a long period for the paralogs to diverge in function. Furthermore, we observed that knockout mutations in both genes, either alone or together, have little effect on sperm function. However, hermaphrodites harboring both knockout mutations combined with a third mutation in the him-8 gene are nearly self-sterile due to a sperm defect, even though they have numerous apparently normal sperm within their spermathecae. We suggest that the sperm in these triple mutants are defective in fusing with oocytes, and that the effect of the him-8 mutation is due to its role in chromatin remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Complete and accurate genome assemblies form the basis of most downstream genomic analyses and are of critical importance. Recent genome assembly projects have relied on a combination of noisy long-read sequencing and accurate short-read sequencing, with the former offering greater assembly continuity and the latter providing higher consensus accuracy. The recently introduced PacBio HiFi sequencing technology bridges this divide by delivering long reads (>10 kbp) with high per-base accuracy (>99.9%). Here we present HiCanu, a significant modification of the Canu assembler designed to leverage the full potential of HiFi reads via homopolymer compression, overlap-based error correction, and aggressive false overlap filtering. We benchmark HiCanu with a focus on the recovery of haplotype diversity, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) variants, satellite DNAs, and segmental duplications. For diploid human genomes sequenced to 30x HiFi coverage, HiCanu achieved superior accuracy and allele recovery compared to the current state of the art. On the effectively haploid CHM13 human cell line, HiCanu achieved an NG50 contig size of 77 Mbp with a per-base consensus accuracy of 99.999% (QV50), surpassing recent assemblies of high-coverage, ultra-long Oxford Nanopore reads in terms of both accuracy and continuity. This HiCanu assembly correctly resolves 337 out of 341 validation BACs sampled from known segmental duplications and provides the first preliminary assemblies of 9 complete human centromeric regions. Although gaps and errors still remain within the most challenging regions of the genome, these results represent a significant advance towards the complete assembly of human genomes.\n\nAvailabilityHiCanu is implemented within the Canu assembly framework and is available from https://github.com/marbl/canu.",

    "abstract": "Non-dividing cells of the myeloid lineage such as monocytes and macrophages are target cells of HIV that have low dNTP pool concentrations and elevated levels of dUTP, which leads to frequent incorporation of dUMP opposite to A during reverse transcription (\"uracilation\"). One factor determining the fate of dUMP in proviral DNA is the host cell uracil base excision repair (UBER) system. Here we explore the relative UBER capacity of monocytes (MC) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and the fate of integrated uracilated viruses in both cell types to understand the implications of viral dUMP on HIV diversification and infectivity. We find that monocytes are almost completely devoid of functional UBER, while macrophages are mainly deficient in the initial enzyme uracil DNA glycosylase (hUNG2). Accordingly, dUMP persists in viral DNA during the lifetime of a MC and can only be removed after differentiation of MC into MDM. Overexpression of human uracil DNA glycosylase in MDM prior to infection resulted in rapid removal of dUMP from HIV cDNA and near complete depletion of dUMP-containing viral copies. This finding establishes that the low hUNG2 expression level in these cells limits UBER but that hUNG2 is restrictive against uracilated viruses. In contrast, overexpression of hUNG2 after viral integration did not accelerate the excision of uracils, suggesting that they may poorly accessible in the context of chromatin. We found that viral DNA molecules with incorporated dUMP contained unique (+) strand transversion mutations that were not observed when dUMP was absent (G[-&gt;]T, T[-&gt;]A, T[-&gt;]G, A[-&gt;]C). These observations and other considerations suggest that dUMP introduces errors predominantly during (-) strand synthesis when the template is RNA. These mutations may arise from the increased mispairing and duplex destabilizing effects of dUMP relative to dTMP during reverse transcription. Overall, the likelihood of producing a functional virus from in vitro infection of MC is about 50-fold and 300-fold reduced as compared to MDM and activated T cells. The results implicate viral dUMP incorporation in MC and MDM as a potential viral diversification and restriction pathway during human HIV infection.",

    "abstract": "Brain networks can be defined and explored using different types of connectivity. Here, we studied P=48 healthy participants with neuroimaging state-of-the-art techniques and analyzed the relationship between the actual structural connectivity (SC) networks (between 2514 regions of interest covering the entire brain and brainstem) and the dynamical functional connectivity (DFC) among the same regions. To do so, we focused on a combination of two metrics: the first one measures the degree of SC-DFC similarity -i.e. how much functional correlations can be explained by structural pathways- and the second one, the intrinsic variability of DFC networks across time. Overall, we found that cerebellar networks have smaller DFC variability than other networks in the cerebrum. Moreover, our results clearly evidence the internal structure of the cerebellum, which is divided in two differentiated networks, the posterior and anterior parts, the latter also being connected to the brain stem. The mechanism for keeping the DFC variability low in the posterior part of the cerebellum is consistent with another finding, namely, it exhibits the highest SC-DFC similarity among all other sub-networks, i.e. its structure constrains very strongly its dynamics. On the other hand, the anterior part of the cerebellum, which also exhibits a low level of DFC variability, has the lowest SC-DFC similarity, suggesting very different dynamical mechanisms. It is likely that its connections with the brain stem -which regulates sleep cycles, cardiac and respiratory functioning- might have a critical role in DFC variations in the anterior part. A lot is known about cerebellar networks, such as having extremely rich and complex anatomy and functionality, connecting to the brainstem, and cerebral hemispheres, and participating in a large variety of cognitive functions, such as movement control and coordination, executive function, visual-spatial cognition, language processing, and emotional regulation. However, as far as we know, our findings of low variability in the dynamical functional connectivity of cerebellar networks and its possible relation with the above functions, have not been reported so far. Further research is still needed to shed light on these findings.",

    "abstract": "Spindle orientation is important in multiple developmental processes as it determines cell fate and function. The correct orientation of the mitotic spindle depends on the assembly of a proper astral microtubule network. Here, we report that the spindle assembly factor TPX2 regulates the astral microtubule network. TPX2 in the spindle pole area is activated by GM130 on mitotic Golgi membranes to promote astral microtubule growth. GM130 relieves TPX2 inhibition by competing for importin  binding. During mitosis, phosphorylation of importin  at Serine 62 by Cdk1 switches its substrate preference from TPX2 to GM130, thereby enabling competition-based activation. Importin  S62A impedes local TPX2 activation and compromises astral microtubule formation, ultimately resulting in misoriented spindles. Blocking the GM130-importin -TPX2 pathway impairs astral microtubule growth. Our results reveal a novel role for TPX2 in the organization of astral microtubules. Furthermore, we show that the substrate preference of the important mitotic modulator importin  is regulated by Cdk1 phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination dominates as the major form of DNA repair in Trypanosoma brucei, and is especially important for recombination of the subtelomeric variant surface glycoprotein during antigenic variation. RAD50, a component of the MRN complex (MRE11, RAD50, NBS1), is central to homologous recombination through facilitating resection and governing the DNA damage response. The function of RAD50 in trypanosomes is untested. Here we report that RAD50 is required for RAD51-dependent homologous recombination, phosphorylation of histone H2A and controlled resection following a DNA double strand break (DSB). Perhaps surprisingly, DSB resection in the rad50 nulls was not impaired and appeared to peak earlier than in the parental strains. Finally, we show that RAD50 suppresses DNA repair using donors with short stretches of homology at a subtelomeric locus, with null strains producing a greater diversity of expressed VSG variants following DSB repair. We conclude that RAD50 promotes stringent homologous recombination at subtelomeric loci and restrains antigenic variation.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization has recently declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge in the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question is concerning the antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by using plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and plasma obtained from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether these non-neutralizing antibody responses will lead to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding the antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, but also has important implications in vaccine development.",

Comparable to the first SARS-CoV, this novel coronaviruss surface Spike (S) glycoprotein mediates cell entry via the human ACE-2 receptor, and, thus, is the principal target for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Molecular information on the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein remains limited. Here we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at a the highest resolution to date, of 1.95 [A]. We identified a set of SARS-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and other betacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize with antibodies that target the ACE-2 binding site on the SARS-CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. We determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the \"closed\" prefusion S structure, but is accessible in \"open\" conformations. This first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSHigh resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD).\n\nRecognition of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by SARS-CoV antibodies.\n\nStructure of the SARS-COV-2 RBD in complex with antibody CR3022.\n\nIdentification of a cryptic site of vulnerability on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike.",

    "abstract": "The recent global outbreak of viral pneumonia designated as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has threatened global public health and urged to investigate its source. Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed ~96% genomic similarity with bat CoV (RaTG13) and clustered together in phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, RaTGl3 also showed 97.43% spike protein similarity with SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that RaTGl3 is the closest strain. However, RBD and key amino acid residues supposed to be crucial for human-to-human and cross-species transmission are homologues between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoVs. These results from our analysis suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant virus of bat and pangolin CoVs. Moreover, this study also reports mutations in coding regions of 125 SARS-CoV-2 genomes signifying its aptitude for evolution. In short, our findings propose that homologous recombination has been occurred between bat and pangolin CoVs that triggered cross-species transmission and emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and, during the ongoing outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is still evolving for its adaptability.",

The viral spike protein S binds ACE2 on host cells to initiate molecular events that release the viral genome intracellularly. Soluble ACE2 inhibits entry of both SARS and SARS-2 coronaviruses by acting as a decoy for S binding sites, and is a candidate for therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic development. Using deep mutagenesis, variants of ACE2 are identified with increased binding to the receptor binding domain of S. Mutations are found across the interface, in the N90-glycosylation motif, and at buried sites where they are predicted to enhance local folding and presentation of the interaction epitope. When single substitutions are combined, large increases in binding can be achieved. The mutational landscape offers a blueprint for engineering high affinity proteins and peptides that block receptor binding sites on S to meet this unprecedented challenge.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that have been found in more than 200 diverse organisms. Although it is still not fully established if RNA viruses could generate miRNAs that would target their own genes or alter the host gene expression, there are examples of miRNAs functioning as an antiviral defense mechanism. In the case of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are several mechanisms that would make miRNAs impact the virus, like interfering with replication, translation and even modulating the host expression. In this study, we performed a machine learning based miRNA prediction analysis for the SARS-CoV-2 genome to identify miRNA-like hairpins and searched for potential miRNA - based interactions between the viral miRNAs and human genes and human miRNAs and viral genes. Our PANTHER gene function analysis results indicate that viral derived miRNA candidates could target various human genes involved in crucial cellular processes including transcription. For instance, a transcriptional regulator, STAT1 and transcription machinery might be targeted by virus-derived miRNAs. In addition, many known human miRNAs appear to be able to target viral genes. Considering the fact that miRNA-based therapies have been successful before, comprehending mode of actions of miRNAs and their possible roles during SARS-CoV-2 infections could create new opportunities for the development and improvement of new therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The newly emerged pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has posed a significant public health threat worldwide. However, the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients. Our findings also provide an application of human organoids in investigating the tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which would facilitate novel drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "An inverse relationship between egg and clutch size has been found repeatedly across animal groups, including birds, reptiles and amphibians, and is considered to be a result of resource limitations and physical constraints on the reproducing female. However, few studies have contextualised this relationship with respect to various environmental selecting pressures and life history traits that have also likely influenced the selection of an optimal egg/clutch size combination, while even fewer have tested these interrelationships using robust natural history datasets. In this study, we aimed to test current hypothesises regarding these relationships on both egg and clutch sizes among the Australian Anurans, which to date have not received this kind of investigation. Specifically, we looked at the influence of environmental selecting pressures (egg laying location, environment persistence and bioregion) and life history traits (adult female body size, egg development type, parental care level, breeding period and temporal breeding pattern). As expected, a clear inverse relationship was found between egg and clutch size, while female body size was positively related to both. Generally speaking, smaller clutches of larger eggs tended to be produced by species that i) oviposit terrestrially, ii) showcase direct development and iii) possess high levels of parental care. Temporal breeding pattern was strongly related to clutch size only, with large clutches occurring in explosive breeding species, while breeding habitat was strongly related to egg size only, with large eggs sizes occurring in terrestrial species. Altogether, these findings indicate that numerous factors have likely influenced the evolution of an optimal clutch type in this group, highlighting the importance of incorporating such variables into animal studies on egg and clutch sizes.",

Analyses that included all the terminals resulted in one most parsimonious tree with a clade comprised of Alophosia azorica and the fossil Meantoinea alophosioides representing the basal-most lineage. Analyses with different outgroup sampling produced the same topology for most ingroup relationships. An analysis excluding morphological characters and the four terminals for which only morphological characters were scored (the two fossil and two extant terminals) resulted in one optimal tree with identical topology to the one obtained when including all terminals. These results are largely congruent with those obtained in the recent analyses based exclusively on sequence level data of a larger number of terminals. Our results indicate that large size and complexity of the gametophyte have evolved independently in several lineages. Notably, the nodes of the backbone of the most parsimonious tree have very low support values, thus these inferred relationships could change if new additional information conflicts with the current data. Future studies should be aimed at incorporating all terminals into phylogenetic analyses, which is not an unrealistic goal for a group with less than 200 species. Also, additional fossils, some of which await detailed examination and description, need to be included. Whether these will affect the overall pattern of phylogeny presented here remains to be seen. In a group that is obviously very ancient, we cannot assume, a priori, that currently known fossil taxa, which go back in time less than 140 Ma, represent the oldest lineages of the group.",

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation is driven by sensory prediction errors, the difference between the predicted and actual feedback. When the position of the feedback is made uncertain, adaptation is attenuated. This effect, in the context of optimal sensory integration models, has been attributed to a weakening of the error signal driving adaptation. Here we consider an alternative hypothesis, namely that uncertainty alters the perceived location of the feedback. We present two visuomotor adaptation experiments to compare these hypotheses, varying the size and uncertainty of a visual error signal. Uncertainty attenuated learning when the error size was small but had no effect when the error size was large. This pattern of results favors the hypothesis that uncertainty does not impact the strength of the error signal, but rather, leads to mis-localization of the error. We formalize these ideas to offer a novel perspective on the effect of visual uncertainty on implicit sensorimotor adaptation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCurrent models of sensorimotor adaptation assume that the rate of learning will be related to properties of the error signal (e.g., size, consistency, relevance). Recent evidence has challenged this view, pointing to a rigid, modular system, one that automatically recalibrates the sensorimotor map in response to movement errors, with minimal constraint. In light of these developments, this study revisits the influence of feedback uncertainty on sensorimotor adaptation. Adaptation was attenuated in response to a noisy feedback signal, but the effect was only manifest for small errors and not for large errors. This interaction suggests that uncertainty does not weaken the error signal. Rather, it may influence the perceived location of the feedback and thus the change in the sensorimotor map induced by that error. These ideas are formalized to show how the motor system remains exquisitely calibrated, even if adaptation is largely insensitive to the statistics of error signals.",

    "abstract": "Recovering species is one of the main goals of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). In the face of limited budgets, diverse tools are needed to find efficient solutions. Recovery units may be one such tool - designated portions of a species range that must be recovered individually before an entire species can be considered recovered. Recovery units allow for spatial flexibility in recovery goals and may be used in regulatory decisions such as section 7 consultation. Despite their availability, there is very little information on how recovery units have been developed and used. We mined available public data to determine the number and types of species for which recovery units have been designated; evaluated species and geographic characteristics associated with recovery unit designation; and examined how recovery units have been used in the implementation of the ESA, such as during consultation. We found 49 listed species have designated recovery units through 2017, and that these species had similar characteristics. Namely, they had relatively large ranges and were well-studied. We found taxonomic biases in recovery unit designation as well, with fish species being disproportionately likely to have recovery units and plants disproportionately less. Improvements in recovery priority numbers among species with recovery units indicate that the theoretical benefits of this tool may have translated to improved status. These data indicate that recovery units could be applied to more wide-ranging species to improve recovery under the ESA.",

However, mechanisms constraining phase timing and cell-type specific phase preference are unknown. Here, we employ computational models tuned with evolutionary algorithms to evaluate phase preference of individual CA1 pyramidal cells recorded in mice and rats not engaged in any particular memory task. We applied unbiased and hypothesis-free approaches to identify effects of intrinsic and synaptic factors, as well as cell morphology, in determining phase preference. We found that perisomatic inhibition delivered by complementary populations of basket cells interacts with input pathways to shape phase-locked specificity of deep and superficial pyramidal cells. Somatodendritic integration of fluctuating glutamatergic inputs defined cycle-by-cycle by unsupervised methods demonstrated that firing selection is tuneable across sublayers.

    "abstract": "In modern society, work stress is highly prevalent. Problematically, work stress can cause disease. To help understand the causal relationship between work stress and disease, we present a computational model of this relationship. That is, drawing from allostatic load theory, we captured the link between work stress and disease in a set of mathematical formulas. With simulation studies, we then examined our models ability to reproduce key findings from previous empirical research. Specifically, results from Study 1 suggested that our model could accurately reproduce established findings on daily fluctuations in cortisol levels (both on the group level and the individual level). Results from Study 2 suggested that our model could accurately reproduce established findings on the relationship between work stress and cardiovascular disease. Finally, results from Study 3 yielded new predictions about the relationship between workweek configurations (i.e., how working hours are distributed over days) and the subsequent development of disease. Together, our studies suggest a new, computational approach to studying the causal link between work stress and disease. We suggest that this approach is fruitful, as it aids the development of falsifiable theory, and as it opens up new ways of generating predictions about why and when work stress is (un)healthy.",

    "abstract": "Confidence in a perceptual decision is a subjective estimate of the accuracy of ones choice. As such, confidence is thought to be an important computation for a variety of cognitive and perceptual processes, and it features heavily in theorizing about conscious access to perceptual states. Recent experiments have revealed a \"positive evidence bias\" (PEB) in the computations underlying confidence reports. A PEB occurs when confidence, unlike objective choice, over-weights the evidence for the chosen option, relative to evidence against the chosen option. Accordingly, in a perceptual task, appropriate stimulus conditions can be arranged that produce selective changes in confidence reports but no changes in accuracy. Although the PEB is generally assumed to reflect the observers perceptual and/or decision processes, post-decisional accounts have not been ruled out. We therefore asked whether the PEB persisted under novel conditions that eliminated two possible post-decisional accounts: 1) post-decision evidence accumulation that contributes to a confidence report solicited after the perceptual choice, and 2) a memory bias that emerges in the delay between the stimulus offset and the confidence report. We found that even when the stimulus remained on the screen until observers responded, and when observers reported their choice and confidence simultaneously, the PEB still emerged. Signal detection-based modeling also showed that the PEB was not associated with changes to metacognitive efficiency, but rather to confidence criteria. We conclude that once-plausible post-decisional accounts of the PEB do not explain the bias, bolstering the idea that it is perceptual or decisional in nature.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWHoney bees are social insects that forage for flower nectar cooperatively. When an individual forager discovers a flower patch rich in nectar, it returns to the hive and performs a \"waggle dance\" in the vicinity of other bees that consists of movements communicating the direction and distance to the nectar source. The dance recruits \"witnessing\" bees to fly to the location of the nectar to retrieve it, thus cooperatively exploiting the environment. Replicating such complex animal behavior is a step forward on the path to artificial intelligence. This project simulates the bee foraging behavior in a cellular automaton using the Morphognosis machine learning model. The model features hierarchical spatial and temporal contexts that output motor responses from sensory inputs. Given a set of bee foraging and dancing exemplars, and exposing only the external input-output of these behaviors to the Morphognosis learning algorithm, a hive of artificial bees can be generated that forage as their biological counterparts do. A comparison of Morphognosis foraging performance with that of an artificial recurrent neural network is also presented.",

    "abstract": "Reactions performed in uniform microscale volumes have enabled numerous applications in the analysis of rare entities (e.g. cells and molecules), however, sophisticated instruments are usually required to form large numbers of uniform compartments. Here, uniform aqueous droplets are formed by simply mixing microscale multi-material particles, consisting of concentric hydrophobic outer and hydrophilic inner layers, with oil and water. The particles are manufactured in batch using a 3D printed device to co-flow four concentric streams of polymer precursors which are polymerized with UV light. The size of the particles is readily controlled by adjusting the fluid flow rate ratios and mask design; whereas the cross-sectional shapes are altered by microfluidic nozzle design in the 3D printed device. Once a particle encapsulates an aqueous volume, each \"dropicle\" provides uniform compartmentalization and customizable shape-coding for each sample volume to enable multiplexing of uniform reactions in a scalable manner. We implement an enzymatically-amplified affinity assay using the dropicle system, yielding a detection limit of <1 pM with a dynamic range of at least 3 orders of magnitude. Moreover, multiplexing using two types of shape-coded particles was demonstrated without cross talk, laying a foundation for democratized single-entity assays.",

External biomechanics, muscle-tendon unit kinematics, and muscle activation patterns were used to model lower limb muscle and ACL forces. Peak ACL force (2.3{+/-}0.5 BW) was observed at 13% of the stance phase during the drop-land-lateral jump task. The ACL force was primarily developed through the sagittal plane, and muscle was the dominant source of ACL loading. The gastrocnemii and quadriceps were main ACL antagonists (i.e., loaders), while hamstrings were the main ACL agonists (i.e., supporters).",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in Western countries and Japan. Currently, a few % of CRCs can be attributed to recognizable hereditary germline variants of known CRC susceptibility genes, predominantly the DNA mismatch repair genes. To establish a universal screening strategy for hereditary CRCs, it is necessary to explore the prevalence of hereditary CRC and pathogenic variants of multiple cancer-predisposing genes in non-European populations.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed the coding regions of 27 cancer-predisposing genes, including mismatch repair genes, APC, and BRCA1/2, in 12,503 unselected Japanese CRC patients and 23,705 controls aged [&ge;] 60 years without any personal or family history of cancer by target sequencing and genome-wide SNP chip data. Their clinical significance was assessed using ClinVar and the guidelines by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP).\n\nResultsWe identified 4,804 variants in the 27 genes and annotated them as 397 pathogenic variants, 941 benign variants, and 3,466 variants of uncertain significance, of which 43.6% were registered in neither ClinVar nor dbSNP. In total, 3.3% of the unselected CRC patients and 1.5% of the controls had a pathogenic variant of the 27 genes. The pathogenic variants of MSH2 (odds ratio (OR) =18.1), MLH1 (OR=8.6), MSH6 (OR=4.9), APC (OR=49.4), BRIP1 (OR=3.6), BRCA1 (OR=2.6), BRCA2 (OR=1.9), and TP53 (OR=1.7) were significantly associated with CRC development in the Japanese population (P-values < 0.01, FDR<0.05). Furthermore, we confirmed copy number variants (CNVs) of MSH2/EPCAM, MLH1, and APC by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and quantitative PCR in this cohort (n = 23), including whole gene duplications of MSH2 and APC. These pathogenic variants were significantly associated with the diagnostic age and personal/family history of other types of cancer. In total, at least 3.5% of the Japanese CRC population had a pathogenic variant or CNV of the 27 cancer-predisposing genes.\n\nConclusionsThis is the largest study of CRC heredity in the Asian population and would contribute to the development of guidelines for genetic testing and variant interpretation for heritable CRCs. Universal screening for CRC risk should be assessed in multiple genes, including BRCA1/2 and BRIP1. These data would facilitate risk assessment of cancer and optimize the screening strategy.",

    "abstract": "Lysine lactoylation is a recently described protein post-translational modification (PTM). However, the biochemical pathways responsible for this acylation remain unclear. Two metabolite-dependent mechanisms have been proposed: enzymatic histone lysine lactoylation derived from lactoyl-coenzyme A (lactoyl-CoA, also termed lactyl-CoA), and non-enzymatic lysine lactoylation resulting from acyl-transfer via lactoyl-glutathione. While the former has precedent in the form of enzyme-catalyzed lysine acylation, the lactoyl-CoA metabolite has not been previously quantified in mammalian systems. Here we use liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) together with a synthetic standard to detect and validate the presence of lactoyl-CoA in cell and tissue samples. Conducting a retrospective analysis of data from previously analyzed samples revealed the presence of lactoyl-CoA in diverse cell and tissue contexts. In addition, we describe a biosynthetic route to generate 13C3 15N1 -isotopically-labeled lactoyl-CoA, providing a co-eluting internal standard for analysis of this metabolite. We estimate lactoyl-CoA concentrations of 1.14x10-8 pmol/cell in cell culture and 0.0172 pmol/mg tissue wet weight in mouse heart. These levels are similar to crotonyl-CoA, but between 20-350 times lower than predominant acyl-CoAs such as acetyl-, propionyl-, and succinyl-CoA. Overall our studies provide the first quantitative measurements of lactoyl-CoA and provide a methodological foundation for the interrogation of this novel metabolite in biology and disease.\n\nHighlights- Detection of lactoyl-CoA at picomole concentrations across tissues and cells\n- Lactoyl-CoA was detected at concentrations similar to crontonyl-CoA within HepG2 cells\n- Isotopically labeled 13C315N1-lactoyl-CoA can be prepared by SILEC",

    "abstract": "Every human somatic cell inherits a maternal and a paternal genome, which work together to give rise to cellular phenotypes. However, the allele-specific relationship between gene expression and genome structure through the cell cycle is largely unknown. By integrating haplotype-resolved genome-wide chromosome conformation capture, mature and nascent mRNA, and protein binding data, we investigate this relationship both globally and locally. We introduce the maternal and paternal 4D Nucleome, enabling detailed analysis of the mechanisms and dynamics of genome structure and gene function for diploid organisms. Our analyses find significant coordination between allelic expression biases and local genome conformation, and notably absent expression bias in universally essential cell cycle and glycolysis genes. We propose a model in which coordinated biallelic expression reflects prioritized preservation of essential gene sets.",

    "abstract": "One aspect of goal-directed behavior, which is known to be impaired in patients with schizophrenia (SZ), is balancing between exploiting a familiar choice with known reward value and exploring a lesser known but potentially more rewarding option. Despite its relevance to several symptom domains of SZ, this has received little attention in SZ research. In addition, while there is increasing evidence that SZ is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, few studies have investigated how this relates to specific behaviors, such as balancing exploration and exploitation. We therefore assessed behaviors underlying the exploration-exploitation trade-off using a three-armed bandit task in 45 patients with SZ and 19 healthy controls (HC). This task allowed us to dissociate goal-unrelated (random) from goal-related (directed) exploration and correlate them with psychopathological symptoms. Moreover, we assessed a broad range of inflammatory proteins in the blood and related them to bandit task behavior. We found that, compared to HC, patients with SZ showed reduced task performance. This impairment was due to a shift from exploitation to random exploration, which was associated with symptoms of disorganization. Relative to HC, patients with SZ showed a pro-inflammatory blood profile. Furthermore, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) positively correlated with random exploration, but not with directed exploration or exploitation. In conclusion, we show that low-grade inflammation in patients with SZ is associated with random exploration, which can be considered a behavioral marker for disorganization. CRP may constitute a marker for severity of, and a potential treatment target for maladaptive exploratory behaviors.",

We expressed three versions of spike (S) proteins--receptor binding domain (RBD), S1 subunit and S ectodomain--in insect cells. RBD appears monomer in solutions, whereas S1 and S associate into homotrimer with substantial glycosylation. The three proteins confer excellent antigenicity with six convalescent COVID-19 patient sera. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer dominate in a unique conformation distinguished from the classic prefusion conformation of coronaviruses by the upper S1 region at lower position ~15 [A] proximal to viral membrane. Such conformation is proposed as an early prefusion state for the SARS-CoV-2 spike that may broaden the knowledge of coronavirus and facilitate vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "The current global pandemic of COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. To investigate whether naturally occurring mutations in the RBD during the early transmission phase have altered the receptor binding affinity and infectivity, firstly we analyzed in silico the binding dynamics between mutated SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and the human ACE2 receptor. Among 32,123 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates (January through March, 2020), 302 non-synonymous RBD mutants were identified and clustered into 96 mutant types. The six dominant mutations were analyzed applying molecular dynamics simulations. The mutant type V367F continuously circulating worldwide displayed higher binding affinity to human ACE2 due to the enhanced structural stabilization of the RBD beta-sheet scaffold. The increased infectivity of V367 mutants was further validated by performing receptor-ligand binding ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and pseudotyped virus assays. Genome phylogenetic analysis of V367F mutants showed that during the early transmission phase, most V367F mutants clustered more closely with the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain than the dual-mutation variants (V367F + D614G) which emerged later and formed a distinct sub-cluster. The analysis of critical RBD mutations provides further insights into the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 under negative selection pressure and supports the continuing surveillance of spike mutations to aid in the development of new COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.\n\nImportanceA novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused the pandemic of COVID-19. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with zoonotic infections. The spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is identified as the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. Thus, whether the mutations in the RBD of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates have altered the receptor binding affinity and caused them more infectious, should be paid more attentions to. Given that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, the significance of our research is in identifying and validating the RBD mutant types emerging during the early transmission phase that have increased human ACE2 receptor binding affinity and infectivity. The RBD mutation analysis provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The continuous surveillance of RBD mutations with increased human ACE2 affinity in human or other animals is important and necessary, particularly when the direct correlation between the virus variations and vaccine effectiveness is underdetermined during the sustained COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Anthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, a spore-forming pathogen that displays a chaining phenotype. It has been reported that in a mouse infection model, systemic inoculation with longer bacterial chains caused blockade in lung capillaries. The blockade resulted in increased pathophysiological consequences viz, hypoxia and lung tissue injury. Hence, chaining acts as a virulence factor and molecules that regulate the chaining phenotype can be the potential drug targets. In this study, we have identified the serine/threonine protein kinase of B. anthracis, PrkC, localized at the bacteria-host interface, as a determinant of bacterial chain length. In vitro, prkC disruption strain (BAS {Delta}prkC) grew as shorter chains throughout the bacterial growth cycle as observed through phase-contrast and scanning electron microscopy. Since molecules such as BslO, a septal murein hydrolase, that catalyzes daughter cell separation and Sap, an S-layer structural protein required for the septal localization of BslO, are known to influence chain length, a comparative analysis to determine their levels was done through western-blot analysis. Both BslO and Sap were found to be upregulated in BAS {Delta}prkC at the majority of the time points. Additionally, PrkC disruption was observed to have a significant effect on bacterial growth and cell wall thickness. In BAS {Delta}prkC strain, a decrease in the cell wall thickness and an increase in the multi-septa formation was observed through transmission electron and confocal microscopy respectively. Altogether, we show that PrkC disruption affected chaining phenotype, cell growth and cell wall thickness and also report that the associated molecules were de-regulated. Through this work, we show for the first time that the chaining phenotype is regulated by PrkC, a transmembrane kinase with a sensor domain. During infection, PrkC may regulate the chaining phenotype through the identified signaling mechanism.\n\nAuthors summaryB. anthracis, a spore-forming pathogen is the causative agent of anthrax, a zoonotic disease that primarily affects livestock and wildlife. Humans are at risk of contracting this disease through exposure to spores generated by infected animals. In the past, B. anthracis spores have been used as a bioterror agent. Hence, there has been a continuous effort to understand the biology of this pathogen to develop both therapeutic and prophylactic treatment. Various virulence factors that are essential for B. anthracis pathogenesis have been identified. The ability of B. anthracis to grow in chains acts as a virulence factor. Longer bacterial chains are reported to cause blockade of lung capillaries in the mouse infection model. In this study, we have shown that the disruption of the lone serine/threonine protein kinase, PrkC, localized at the bacteria-host interface leads to the shortening of the bacterial chains. We have seen that the depletion of PrkC results in an increase in the levels of the proteins responsible for de-chaining. Also, we have analyzed the effect of the disruption on cell growth, bacterial cell wall and septa formation. Since PrkC is a surface localized kinase with an extracellular domain that lacks homology to human proteins, it can be a target for new drugs. Disruption of PrkC activity and hence the longer chains in vivo may prevent pathophysiological consequences associated with the capillary blockade.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccurate and robust pathological image analysis for colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis is time-consuming and knowledge-intensive, but is essential for CRC patients treatment. The current heavy workload of pathologists in clinics/hospitals may easily lead to unconscious misdiagnosis of CRC based on their daily image analyses.\n\nMethodsBased on a state-of-the-art transfer-learned deep convolutional neural network in artificial intelligence (AI), we proposed a novel patch aggregation strategy for clinic CRC prediction/diagnosis using weakly labeled pathological whole slide image (WSI) patches. This approach was trained and validated using an unprecedented and enormously large number of 170,099 patches, >14,680 WSIs, from >9,631 subjects that covered diverse and representative clinical cases from multi-independent-sources across China, U.S., and Germany.\n\nResultsOur innovative AI tool was consistently nearly perfectly agreed with (average Kappa-statistic 0.896) and even often better than most of the experienced expert pathologists when tested in diagnosing CRC WSIs from multi-centers. The average area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of AI was greater than that of the pathologists (0.981 vs 0.970) and achieved the best performance among the application of other AI methods to CRC diagnosis. Our AI-generated heatmap highlights the image regions of cancer tissue/cells.\n\nConclusionsThis first-ever generalizable AI system can handle large amounts of WSIs consistently and robustly without potential bias due to fatigue commonly experienced by clinical pathologists. Hence, it will drastically alleviate the heavy clinical burden of daily pathology diagnosis, and improve the treatment for CRC patients. This tool is generalizable to other cancer diagnosis based on image recognition.",

    "abstract": "Like many forms of long-term synaptic plasticity, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) depends on intracellular Ca2+ signaling for its induction. Yet, all in vitro studies devoted to STDP used abnormally high external Ca2+ concentration. We measured STDP at the CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapses under different extracellular Ca2+ concentrations and found that the sign, shape and magnitude of plasticity strongly depend on Ca2+. A pre-post protocol that results in robust LTP in high Ca2+, yielded only LTD or no plasticity in the physiological Ca2+ range. LTP could be restored by either increasing the number of post-synaptic spikes or increasing the pairing frequency. A calcium-based plasticity model in which depression and potentiation depend on post-synaptic Ca2+ transients was found to fit quantitatively all the data, provided NMDA receptor-mediated non-linearities were implemented. In conclusion, STDP rule is profoundly altered in physiological Ca2+ but specific activity regimes restore a classical STDP profile.",

Normal and TSG-6 gene-modified DPSCs were cultured in a mineralization-inducing fluid containing 0 and 50 ng/mL TNF- separately. The real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the expression of TSG-6 and odonto/osteogenic differentiation makers at the mRNA level. Western blot analysis and cellular immunofluorescence were used to observe the odonto/osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs and the variation of BMP-4/Smad signaling pathway at the protein level. Moreover, normal and modified DPSCs combined with hydrogel were used for subcutaneous implantation in nude mice. The expression of odonto/osteogenic markers and BMP-4/Smad-related proteins was lower in Ad-TSG-6 DPSCs than in normal DPSCs after mineralization induction, and was higher in TSG-6-RNAi DPSCs than in normal DPSCs after culturing with mineralization-inducing fluid containing 50 ng/mL TNF-. The subcutaneous transplantation of normal and modified DPSCs combined with hydrogel in nude mice demonstrated that normal DPSCs were formed in the tissue containing collagen. The tissue formed by Ad-TSG-6 DPSCs was highly variable, and the cells were very dense. The expression of odonto/osteogenic markers of Ad-TSG-6 DPSCs were lower in Ad-TSG-6 DPSCs than in normal DPSCs. We can know that TNF- regulates the expression of TSG-6, thereby inhibiting the BMP-4/Smad signaling pathway and the odonto/osteogenic differentiation ability of DPSCs.",

    "abstract": "The spinal cord is a fascinating structure responsible for coordinating all movement in vertebrates. Spinal motor neurons control the activity of virtually every organ and muscle throughout the body by transmitting signals that originate in the spinal cord. These neurons are remarkably heterogeneous in their activity and innervation targets. However, because motor neurons represent only a small fraction of cells within the spinal cord and are difficult to isolate, the full complement of motor neuron subtypes remains unknown. Here we comprehensively describe the molecular heterogeneity of motor neurons within the adult spinal cord. We profiled 43,890 single-nucleus transcriptomes using fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting to enrich for spinal motor neuron nuclei. These data reveal a transcriptional map of the adult mammalian spinal cord and the first unbiased characterization of all transcriptionally distinct autonomic and somatic spinal motor neuron subpopulations. We identify 16 sympathetic motor neuron subtypes that segregate spatially along the spinal cord. Many of these subtypes selectively express specific hormones and receptors, suggesting neuromodulatory signaling within the autonomic nervous system. We describe skeletal motor neuron heterogeneity in the adult spinal cord, revealing numerous novel markers that distinguish alpha and gamma motor neurons--cell populations that are specifically affected in neurodegenerative disease. We also provide evidence for a novel transcriptional subpopulation of skeletal motor neurons. Collectively, these data provide a single-cell transcriptional atlas for investigating motor neuron diversity as well as the cellular and molecular basis of motor neuron function in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring the presence and spread of pathogens in the environment is of critical importance. Rapid detection of infectious disease outbreaks and prediction of their spread can facilitate early responses of health agencies and reduce the severity of outbreaks. Current sampling methods are sorely limited by available personnel and throughput. For instance, xenosurveillance utilizes captured arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes, as sampling tools to access blood from a wide variety of vertebrate hosts. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of nucleic acid from individual blooded mosquitoes can be used to identify mosquito and host species, and microorganisms including pathogens circulating within either host. However, there are practical challenges to collecting and processing mosquitoes for xenosurveillance, such as the rapid metabolization or decay of microorganisms within the mosquito midgut. This particularly affects pathogens that do not replicate in mosquitoes, preventing their detection by NGS or other methods. Accordingly, we performed a series of experiments to establish the windows of detection for DNA or RNA from human blood and/or viruses present in mosquito blood meals. Our results will contribute to trap design for mosquito-based xenosurveillance, including sample stabilization and ideal time spent from collection to NGS processing.",

Effects of land use were localized and most pronounced in areas around Baltimore, Maryland, Washington, D.C. and Richmond, Virginia, USA. Results indicate the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers appear to be areas of lesser concern while the upper James and York rivers are ideal for follow-up studies, since these area rank poorly in both eel density and barriers to fish passage. Because these rivers have high eel density downstream, the dams appear to be the limiting factor. Sampling methods have been inconsistent over time, making it is difficult to determine where eel densities are low vs. the area having had little sampling effort. This is partially resolved with catch per sampling event (CPSE), which appears to show a relationship between eels sampled and the number caught per sample. Potential strategies for improving watersheds include dam removal, fish passage and habitat restoration.",

    "abstract": "The protein hormone insulin exists in various oligomeric forms, and a key step in binding its cellular receptor is dissociation of the dimer. This dissociation process and its corresponding association process have come to serve as a paradigms of coupled (un)folding and (un)binding more generally. Despite its fundamental and practical importance, the mechanism of insulin dimer dissociation remains poorly understood. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations, leveraging recent developments in umbrella sampling, to characterize the energetic and structural features of dissociation in unprecedented detail. We find that the dissociation is inherently multipathway with limiting behaviors corresponding to conformational selection and induced fit, the two prototypical mechanisms of coupled folding and binding. Along one limiting path, the dissociation leads to detachment of the C-terminal segment of the insulin B chain from the protein core, a feature believed to be essential for receptor binding. We simulate IR spectroscopy experiments to aid in interpreting current experiments and identify sites where isotopic labeling can be most effective for distinguishing the contributions of the limiting mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) consists of seven major lineages with three of them reported to circulate within West Africa: lineage 5 (West African 1) and lineage 6 (West African 2) which are geographically restricted to West Africa and lineage 4 (Euro-American lineage) which is found globally. It is unclear why the West African lineages are not found elsewhere; some hypotheses suggest that it could either be harboured by an animal reservoir which is restricted to West Africa, or strain preference for hosts of West African ethnicity, or inability to compete with other lineages in other locations.\n\nWe tested the hypothesis that M. africanum (MAF) might have emigrated out of West Africa but was outcompeted by more virulent strains of M. tuberculosis (MTB).\n\nWhole genome sequences of MTB from Nigeria (n=21), China (n=21) and MAF from Mali (n=24) were retrieved, and a pan-genome analysis was performed after fully annotating these genomes. The outcome of this analysis shows that Lineages 4, 5 and 6 have relatively close pan-genomes whilst lineage 2 has an open pan-genome. We also see a correlation in numbers of some multiple copy core genes and amino acid substitution with lineage specificity that may have contributed to geographical distribution of these lineages.\n\nThe findings in this study provides a perspective to one of the hypotheses that M. africanum might find it difficult to compete against the more modern lineages outside West Africa hence its localization to the geographical region.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate how the inclusion of a blend of essential oils in milk replacer (MR) affects different outcomes of dairy heifers. The outcomes evaluated: feed intake, performance, body development, blood cells and metabolites, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), rumen fermentation, fecal scores and respiratory scores. All outcomes were evaluated during pre-weaning (4 - 60 d of age), and carryover effects on post-weaning (61 - 90 d of age) periods. The experimental units utilized were 29 newborn Holstein x Gyr crossbred dairy heifers, with genetic composition of 5/8 or more Holstein and 3/8 or less Gyr and body weight (BW) at birth of 32.2 {+/-} 5.2 kg. Experimental units were randomly assigned to either a control group (CON, n = 15) or a treatment group, consisting of supplementation of a blend of essential oils (BEO, n = 14) with1 g/d/calf (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China). During the pre-weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted at 15% (dry matter basis), divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided ad libitum. During the post-weaning, animals received a maximum 3 kg of starter/d, and ad libitum corn silage, divided into two meals. The outcomes feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were evaluated daily. BW was measured every three days, while body development was recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected on 0, 30 and 60 d of age for total blood cell count, weekly to determinate {beta}-hydroxybutyrate, urea and glucose, and biweekly for IGF-1. Ruminal parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N and acetate:proprionate proportion - C2:C3) were measured each 14 days. A randomized complete block design with an interaction between treatment and week was the experimental method of choice to test the hypothesis of effect of BEO on all outcomes. An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes and a non-parametric test was used for the ordered categorical outcomes both adopting a C.I. = 95%. Results indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of effect of BEO in MR on: feed intake, performance, body development and blood metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. However, results indicated that the inclusion of BEO in MR significantly affects the proportion of C2:C3 during pre and post-weaning (P [&le;] 0.05). Similarly, the effect is significant for basophil (P [&le;] 0.001) and platelet (P [&le;] 0.05) counts in pre-weaning. The interaction between week and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes (P [&le;] 0.001), revealing a long-term treatment immunological effect. Lastly, the effect on fecal scores was also significant (P [&le;] 0.05) during pre-weaning, with lower values for BEO. BEO contributed for ruminal manipulation on pre-weaning and carry over effect on post-weaning; immunity improvement and a decrease morbidity of neonatal diarrhea in pre-weaning phase.",

    "abstract": "Potassium channels generally have a selectivity filter that includes the sequence threonine-threonine-valine-glycine-tyrosine-glycine (TTVGYG). The last five amino acids are conserved over practically the entire range of evolution, so the sequence obviously is necessary to the function of the channel. Here we show by quantum calculations on the upper part of the channel \"cavity\" (aqueous compartment between the gate and selectivity filter) and lower part of the selectivity filter (SF) how the channel with two sets of four threonines (the channel is fourfold symmetric) effects rectification and selectivity. The threonines are at the location in which the ion transfers from the cavity into the SF; in this calculation they play a key role in selectivity. The channel is also a rectifier. The wild type channel with K+ and three other cases are considered: 1) the upper set of four threonines is replaced by serines. 2) and 3) Related computations with the Na+ and NH4+ ions help to clarify the important factors in moving the ion from the cavity to the SF. In particular, one set of angles (not bond angles, O(T373-C=O) - O(T374-OH) - H(T374-OH)) flips a hydrogen into and out of the ion path, allowing the K+ to go forward but not back. This is essentially a ratchet and pawl mechanism, with the ratchet driven by electrostatics. This also allows a clear path forward for K+ but not for Na+ or NH4+, nor for K+ in a T[-&gt;]S mutant. Atomic charges in the lowest positions in the SF are the driving force moving the ion forward, but the O - O - H angle just specified is key to making the \"knock-on\" mechanism move the ions forward only, using the ratchet with the pawl formed by the hydrogen in the bonds that flip. A water interacts with threonine hydroxyls to allow ion passage, and another water moves together with the K+.",

    "abstract": "Wheat is one of the most important cereal crop in the world. Heat stress is an important abiotic stress limiting wheat production and productivity in the world including south-east Asia. The importance of miRNAs in gene expression under various biotic and abiotic stresses is well documented. Molecular markers, especially SSR markers, plays an important role for the success in molecular plant breeding programs. The discovery of SSRs from non-coding regions has been a challenging task. Therefore, development of novel miRNA-based SSRs from the conserved portions of the genome will prove useful for the study of genetic diversity of heat-responsive miRNA-genes in wheat. In the present study, efforts are made to mine SSR markers from 96 members of heat-responsive miRNA-genes of wheat followed by their validation using 37 contrasting (heat tolerance/susceptible) wheat genotypes. Among a set of 13 miRNA-SSRs used,7 SSRs were found polymorphic. Among these polymorphic SSR markers, three found to be very informative SSRs (HT-169j, HT-160a and HT-160b) and could largely discriminate heat tolerant genotypes from the heat susceptible ones. Further analysis based on Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) revealed that miRNA genes were more diverse in susceptible genotypes compared to tolerant genotypes. Ours is the first report that the genic/miRNA markers could be successfully used to study wheat diversity, population structure and characterization of trait specific germplasm. The important and useful miRNA-based SSRs, therefore, would serve as best markers in the marker-assisted breeding programs aimed at enhancing heat tolerance of Indian wheat.",

In SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques, virus was excreted from nose and throat in absence of clinical signs, and detected in type I and II pneumocytes in foci of diffuse alveolar damage and mucous glands of the nasal cavity. In SARS-CoV-infection, lung lesions were typically more severe, while they were milder in MERS-CoV infection, where virus was detected mainly in type II pneumocytes.

The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with the Bioconductor affy package in R. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were built with the DAVID program followed by construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network performed with Cytoscape. WebGestalt was performed to construct transcriptional regulatory network and microRNAs-target regulatory networks. RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining were performed to testify the expression of hub genes, transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs.\n\nResultsA total of 230 DEGs were identified. PPI networks were constructed by mapping DEGs into STRING, in which 20 hub proteins were identified. KEGG pathway analyses revealed that the chemokine, NOD-like receptor, IL-17, and TNF signalling pathways were altered. GO analyses revealed that DEGs were extensively involved in the regulation of cytokine production, the immune response, the external side of the plasma membrane, and G-protein coupled chemoattractant receptor activity. The results of RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the expression of DEGs, TFs and microRNAs in our experiment were basically consistent with the predictions.\n\nConclusionsThe results of this study offer insight into the pathomechanisms of r-axSpA and provide potential research directions.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the aging population. Evidence implicates elevated soluble oligomeric A{beta} as one of the primary triggers during the prodromic phase leading to AD, effected largely via hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. At low, physiological levels (pM-nM), however, oligomeric A{beta} has been found to regulate synaptic plasticity as a neuromodulator. Through mutational analysis, we found a core hexapeptide sequence within the N-terminal domain of A{beta} (N-A{beta}core) accounting for its physiological activity, and subsequently found that the N-A{beta}core peptide is neuroprotective. Here, we characterized the neuroprotective potential of the N-A{beta}core against dysfunction of synaptic plasticity assessed in ex vivo hippocampal slices from 5xFAD APP/PS1 mice, specifically hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). The N-A{beta}core was shown to reverse impairment in synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices from 5xFAD APP/PS1 model mice, both for LTP and LTD. The reversal by the N-A{beta}core correlated with alleviation of downregulation of hippocampal AMPA-type glutamate receptors in preparations from 5xFAD mice. The action of the N-A{beta}core depended upon a critical di-histidine sequence and involved the PI3 kinase pathway via mTOR. Together, the present findings indicate that the non-toxic N-A{beta}core hexapeptide is not only neuroprotective at the cellular level but is able to reverse synaptic dysfunction in AD-like models, specifically alterations in synaptic plasticity.",

Such metabolic adaptation should be appropriately scaled to the ingested glucose levels, and decoupling causes human metabolic diseases. However, the identity of the crucial sensor metabolite(s) that transmit circulating glucose levels to the transcriptional machinery remains elusive. Here we show that the polyol pathway, which converts glucose to fructose via sorbitol, is required for activation of the master metabolic regulator Mondo, the Drosophila homologue of MondoA/ChREBP. We demonstrate that under normal nutritional conditions polyol pathway metabolites promote Mondos nuclear localization and cause global changes in metabolic gene expression. Polyol pathway mutants block nuclear localization of Mondo and Mondo-mediated gene expression despite intact glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways. Our results uncover the normal physiological function of this pathway and cast a new light on the adverse effects of high fructose diets in human health.",

We carried out systematic fish landing surveys in South Andamans from January 2017 to May 2018, a comprehensive and cost-effective way to fill this data gap. We sampled 5,742 individuals representing 57 shark and ray species. Of the 36 species of sharks and 21 species of rays landed, six species of sharks - Loxodon macrorhinus, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, Sphyrna lewini, Carcharhinus albimarginatus, Carcharhinus brevipinna, and Paragaelus randalli dominated landings and comprised 83.35 % of shark landings, while three species of rays were most abundant \u2013 Pateobatis jenkinsii, Himantura leoparda and H. tutul, and comprised 48.82 % of ray landings. We report size extensions for seven shark species as well as three previously unreported ray species, increasing the known diversity for the islands and for India. For sharks, mature individuals of small-bodied species (63.48 % males of total landings of species less than 1.5 m total length) and immature individuals of larger species (84.79 % males of total landings of species larger than 1.5 m total length) were mostly landed; whereas for rays, mature individuals were predominantly landed (80.71 % males of total landings) likely reflecting differences in fishing patterns as well as habitat preferences and life history stages across species. Further, juvenile sharks and gravid females were landed in large quantities which might be unsustainable in the long-term. Landings were female-biased in C. amblyrhynchos, S. lewini and P. jenkinsii, and male-biased in L. macrorhinus and H. leoparda, indicating either spatio-temporal or gear specific sexual segregation in these species. Understanding these nuances - the composition and biology of sharks and rays landed in different fisheries seasonally will inform future conservation and fishery management measures for these species in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Traditional X-ray diffraction data collected at cryo-temperatures have delivered invaluable insights into the three-dimensional structures of proteins, providing the backbone of structure-function studies. While cryo-cooling mitigates radiation damage, cryo-temperatures can alter protein conformational ensembles and solvent structure. Further, conformational ensembles underlie protein function and energetics, and recent advances in room-temperature X-ray crystallography have delivered conformational heterogeneity information that is directly related to biological function. The next challenge is to develop a robust and broadly applicable method to collect single-crystal X-ray diffraction data at and above room temperatures and was addressed herein. This approach provides complete diffraction datasets with total collection times as short as ~5 sec from single protein crystals, dramatically increasing the amount of data that can be collected within allocated synchrotron beam time. Its applicability was demonstrated by collecting 1.09-1.54 [A] resolution data over a temperature range of 293-363 K for proteinase K, thaumatin, and lysozyme crystals. Our analyses indicate that the diffraction data is of high-quality and do not suffer from excessive dehydration or damage.",
