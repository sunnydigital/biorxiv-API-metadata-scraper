    "abstract": "Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs which main reported function consists on the silencing of transposable elements and genome stability in mammalian germline. In this study we have identified piRNAs in porcine sperm, using male germline and zygote datasets from human, mice, cow and swine, and evaluated the relation between their abundances and sperm quality traits. Our analysis identified 283,382 piRNAs, 1,355 of which correlated to at least one semen quality trait. Indeed, genome analysis of the correlated piRNAs evidenced that 57% of these were less than 50kb apart and were significantly enriched near Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs). Moreover, some of the significant piRNAs mapped within or close to genes relevant for fertility or spermatogenesis such as CSNK1G2 and PSMF1.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThird-generation sequencing, also called long-read sequencing, is revolutionizing genome assembly: as PacBio and Nanopore technologies become more accessible in technicity and in cost, long-read assemblers flourish and are starting to deliver chromosome-level assemblies. However, these long reads are also error-prone, making the generation of a haploid reference out of a diploid genome a difficult enterprise. Although failure to properly collapse haplotypes results in fragmented and/or structurally incorrect assemblies and wreaks havoc on orthology inference pipelines, this serious issue is rarely acknowledged and dealt with in genomic projects, and an independent, comparative benchmark of the capacity of assemblers and post-processing tools to properly collapse or purge haplotypes is still lacking.\n\nResultsTo fill this gap, we tested different assembly strategies on the genome of the rotifer Adineta vaga, a non-model organism for which high coverages of both PacBio and Nanopore reads were available. The assemblers we tested (Canu, Flye, NextDenovo, Ra, Raven, Shasta and wtdbg2) exhibited strikingly different behaviors when dealing with highly heterozygous regions, resulting in variable amounts of uncollapsed haplotypes. Filtering out shorter reads generally improved haploid assemblies, and we also benchmarked three post-processing tools aimed at detecting and purging uncollapsed haplotypes in long-read assemblies: HaploMerger2, purge_haplotigs and purge_dups.\n\nConclusionsTesting these strategies separately and in combination revealed several approaches able to generate haploid assemblies with genome sizes, coverage distributions, and completeness close to expectations.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus cereus produces many factors linked to pathogenesis and is recognized for causing gastrointestinal toxemia and infections. B. cereus also causes a fulminant and often blinding intraocular infection called endophthalmitis. We reported that the PlcR/PapR system regulates intraocular virulence, but the specific factors that contribute to B. cereus virulence in the eye remain elusive. Here, we compared gene expression in ex vivo vitreous humor with expression in Luria Bertani (LB) and Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth by RNA-Seq. The expression of several cytolytic toxins in vitreous was less than or similar to levels observed in BHI or LB. Regulators of virulence genes, including PlcR/PapR, were expressed in vitreous. PlcR/PapR was expressed at low levels, though we had reported that PlcR-deficient B. cereus was attenuated in the eye. Chemotaxis and motility genes were expressed at similar levels in LB and BHI, but at low to undetectable levels in vitreous, although motility is an important phenotype for B. cereus in the eye. Superoxide dismutase, a potential inhibitor of neutrophil activity in the eye during infection, was the most highly expressed gene in vitreous. Genes previously reported to be important to intraocular virulence were expressed at low levels in vitreous under these conditions, possibly because in vivo cues are required for higher level expression. Genes expressed in vitreous may contribute to the unique virulence of B. cereus endophthalmitis, and future analysis of the B. cereus virulome in the eye will identify those expressed in vivo, which could potentially be targeted to arrest virulence.\n\nImpact statementB. cereus is the causative agent of gastrointestinal infections, but can also cause a serious infection of the eye that often results in blindness or enucleation. Current therapeutic measures often fail to mitigate these poor outcomes. This necessitates the development of new treatment modalities based on new targets. To begin to better define those B. cereus factors with roles in intraocular infection, we analyzed the expression of genes related to gastrointestinal infections, as well as those with both known and hypothesized roles in intraocular infections, after growth in an ex vivo vitreous. Potentially targetable candidate genes were demonstrated to be expressed in vitreous, which suggests that these genes might contribute to the unique virulence of B. cereus endophthalmitis. Importantly, our results lay the groundwork for assessing the expression of these genes in vivo and defining the virulome of B. cereus in intraocular infections.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic and increasingly multi-drug resistant human pathogen rated as a critical priority 1 pathogen for the development of new antibiotics by the WHO in 2017. Despite the lack of flagella, A. baumannii can move along wet surfaces in 2 different ways: via twitching motility and surface-associated motility. While twitching motility is known to depend on type IV pili, the mechanism of surface-associated motility is poorly understood. In this study we established a library of 30 A. baumannii ATCC 17978 mutants that displayed deficiency in surface-associated motility. By making use of natural competence we also introduced these mutations into strain 29D2 to differentiate strain-specific versus species-specific effects of mutations. Mutated genes were associated with purine/pyrimidine/folate biosynthesis (e.g. purH, purF, purM, purE), alarmone/stress metabolism (e.g. Ap4A hydrolase), RNA modification/regulation (e.g. methionyl-tRNA synthetase), outer membrane proteins (e.g. ompA), and genes involved in natural competence (comEC). All tested mutants originally identified as motility-deficient in strain ATCC 17978 also displayed a motility-deficient phenotype in 29D2. By contrast, further comparative characterization of the mutant sets of both strains regarding pellicle biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and virulence in the Galleria mellonella infection model revealed numerous strain-specific mutant phenotypes. Our studies highlight the need for comparative analyses to characterize gene functions in A. baumannii and for further studies on the mechanisms underlying surface-associated motility.",

    "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) levels in Plasmodium falciparum correlate with tolerance to cellular stresses caused by artemisinin, a first-line malaria treatment, and environmental factors. However, the functional role of PI(3)P in the Plasmodium stress response and a possible mechanism of protection were unknown. Here, we used multiple chemical probes including PI3K inhibitors and known antimalarial drugs to examine the importance of PI(3)P under thermal conditions that recapitulate malaria fever. Live cell microscopy using both chemical and genetic reporters revealed that PI(3)P stabilizes the acidic and proteolytic digestive vacuole (DV) under heat stress. We demonstrate that heat-induced DV destabilization in PI(3)P-deficient P. falciparum precedes cell death and is reversible after withdrawal of the stress condition and the PI3K inhibitor. These phenotypes are not observed with an inactive structural analog of the PI3K inhibitor. A chemoproteomic and biochemical approach identified PfHsp70-1 as a parasite PI(3)P-binding protein. Targeting PfHsp70-1 with a small molecule inhibitor phenocopied PI(3)P-deficient parasites under heat shock. Furthermore, tunable knockdown of PfHsp70-1 showed that PfHsp70-1 downregulation causes DV destabilization and hypersensitizes parasites to heat shock and PI3K inhibitors. Our findings underscore a mechanistic link between PI(3)P and PfHsp70-1, and present a novel PI(3)P function in stabilizing the DV compartment during heat stress.",

    "abstract": "Chemosynthetic symbioses occur worldwide in marine habitats, but comprehensive physiological studies of chemoautotrophic bacteria thriving on animals are scarce. Stilbonematinae are coated by monocultures of thiotrophic Gammaproteobacteria. As these nematodes migrate through the redox zone, their ectosymbionts experience varying oxygen concentrations. However, nothing is known about how these variations affect their physiology or metabolism. Here, by applying omics, Raman microspectroscopy and stable isotope labelling, we investigated the effect of oxygen on Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti. Unexpectedly, sulfur oxidation genes were upregulated in anoxic relative to oxic conditions, but carbon fixation genes and incorporation of 13C-labeled bicarbonate were not. Instead, several genes involved in carbon fixation were upregulated in oxic conditions, together with genes involved in organic carbon assimilation, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthesis, nitrogen fixation and urea utilization. Furthermore, in the presence of oxygen, stress-related genes were upregulated together with vitamin biosynthesis genes likely necessary to withstand its deleterious effects, and the symbiont appeared to proliferate less. Based on its physiological response to oxygen, we propose that Ca. T. oneisti may exploit anaerobic sulfur oxidation coupled to denitrification to proliferate in anoxic sand. However, the ectosymbiont would still profit from the oxygen available in superficial sand, as the energy-efficient aerobic respiration would facilitate carbon and nitrogen assimilation by the ectosymbiont.\n\nIMPORTANCEChemoautotrophic endosymbionts are famous for exploiting sulfur oxidization to feed marine organisms with fixed carbon. However, the physiology of thiotrophic bacteria thriving on the surface of animals (ectosymbionts) is less understood. One long standing hypothesis posits that attachment to animals that migrate between reduced and oxic environments would boost sulfur oxidation, as the ectosymbionts would alternatively access sulfide and oxygen, the most favorable electron acceptor. Here, we investigated the effect of oxygen on the physiology of Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti, a Gammaproteobacterium which lives attached to marine nematodes inhabiting shallow water sand. Surprisingly, sulfur oxidation genes were upregulated in anoxic relative to oxic conditions. Furthermore, under anoxia, the ectosymbiont appeared to be less stressed and to proliferate more. We propose that animal-mediated access to oxygen, rather than enhancing sulfur oxidation, would facilitate assimilation of carbon and nitrogen by the ectosymbiont.",

    "abstract": "Phytophthora blight, caused by pathogen Phytophthora nicotianae, is responsible for a huge reduction in sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) crop yields. In this study, we utilized a combinatorial approach involving biparental QTL mapping and genome-wide association (GWAS) analysis to identify genes associated with Phytophthora blight resistance in sesame. Evaluation of resistant of the parental varieties (Goenbaek, Osan and Milsung) and the RILs of both the populations in greenhouse conditions suggested the qualitative nature of the trait.. The genetic map comprised thirteen LGs covering a total map length of 887.49 cM with an average inter-marker distance of 4.69 cM. Significant QTLs explaining phenotypic variation in the range of 2.25% to 69.24% were identified on chromosomes 10 and 13 (Chr10 and Chr13). A resistance locus detected on Chr10 was found to be highly significant. The association of this locus to PBR was also identified through BSA and single marker analysis in Goenbaek x Milsung cross and through genome-wide association mapping of 87 sesame accessions. The GWAS analysis identified 44 SNP loci significantly associated with Phytophthora disease-resistant traits on Chr10. Further, the haplotype block analysis conducted in order to find whether the SNPs associated with resistance in this study showed that the SNPs are in high LD with the resistance QTL. We obtained a total of 68 candidate genes, which included a number of defense-related R genes. One of the genes, SIN_1019016 (At1g58390) showed high expression in the resistant parent. The results from this study would be highly useful in identifying genetic and molecular factors associated with Phytophthora blight resistance in sesame.",

    "abstract": "Visual crowding refers to the inability to identify objects when surrounded by other similar items. Crowding-like mechanisms are thought to play a key role in numerical perception by determining the sensory mechanisms through which ensembles are perceived. Enhanced visual crowding might hence prevent the normal development of a system involved in segregating and perceiving discrete numbers of items and ultimately the acquisition of more abstract numerical skills. Here, we investigated whether excessive crowding occurs in developmental dyscalculia (DD), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty in learning the most basic numerical and arithmetical concepts, and whether it is found independently of associated major reading and attentional difficulties. We measured spatial crowding in two groups of adult individuals with DD and control subjects. In separate experiments, participants were asked to discriminate the orientation of a Gabor patch either in isolation or under spatial crowding. Orientation discrimination thresholds were comparable across groups when stimuli were shown in isolation, yet they were much higher for the DD group with respect to the control group when the target was crowded by closely neighbouring flanking gratings. The difficulty in discriminating orientation (as reflected by the combination of accuracy and reaction times) in the DD compared to the control group persisted over several larger target flanker distances. Finally, we found that the degree of such spatial crowding correlated with impairments in mathematical abilities even when controlling for visual attention and reading skills. These results suggest that excessive crowding effects might be a characteristic of DD, independent of other associated neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nBullet pointsO_LIPeople with DD have difficulty learning about numbers and arithmetics.\nC_LIO_LIPerception of non-symbolic number seems to be modulated by visual crowding.\nC_LIO_LICan stronger than normal crowding effects contribute to the origin of DD?\nC_LIO_LIWe measured crowding with orientation discrimination tasks using Gabor gratings.\nC_LIO_LIAbnormal crowding characterizes DD independently of other developmental deficits.\nC_LI",

In the alpha (8-13 Hz) band, five-minute epochs of EEG were extracted for: baseline; induction; unconscious; 30-, 10- and 5-minutes pre-recovery of responsiveness; 30- and 180-minutes post-recovery of responsiveness.

Three motifs (motifs 1, 2 and 5) were significantly present across participants and epochs, when compared to random networks (p<0.05). The topology of motifs 1 and 5 changed significantly between responsive and unresponsive epochs (p<0.01). Motif 1 was constituted by long-range chain-like connections, while motif 5 was constituted by short-range, loop-like connections. Our results suggest that anesthetic-induced unconsciousness is associated with a topological re-organization of network motifs. As motif topological re-organization may precede (motif 5) or accompany (motif 1) the return of responsiveness, motifs could contribute to the understanding of the neural correlates of consciousness.",

Available methods to quantify mosquito flight usually require special devices and mostly assess spontaneous locomotor activity at individual level. Here, we developed a new method to determine longitudinal untethered adult A. aegypti induced flight activity: the INduced FLight Activity TEst (INFLATE). This method was an adaptation of the \"rapid iterative negative geotaxis\" assay to assess locomotor activity in Drosophila and explore the spontaneous behavior of mosquito to fly upon a physical stress. Insects were placed on a plastic cage previously divided in four vertical quadrants and flight performance was carried out by tapping cages towards the laboratory bench. After one minute, the number of insects per quadrant was registered by visual inspection and categorized in five different scores. By using INFLATE, we observed that flight performance was not influenced by repeated testing, sex or 5 % ethanol intake. However, induced flight activity was strongly affected by aging, blood meal and inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. This simple and rapid method allows the longitudinal assessment of induced flight activity of multiple untethered mosquitoes and may contribute to a better understanding of A. aegypti dispersal biology.",

The predominant species contaminated sperm after ejaculation from soil, faeces and water sources (Bacillus megaterium, Brachybacterium faecium, Bacillus coagulans). Some potential pathogens were also found but at relatively low levels (Escherichia coli, Clostridioides difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis). We also identified 3 potential antibiotic resistant genes from E. coli against chloramphenicol, Neisseria meningitidis against spectinomycin and Staphylococcus aureus against linezolid. None of these genes were highly abundant. Finally, we classified the ejaculates into categories according to their bacterial features and semen quality parameters and identified two categories that significantly differed for 5 semen quality traits and 13 bacterial features including the genera Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas and Rhodobacter. Our results show that boar semen contains a rich microbiome with potential pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes which may affect its reproductive performance.",

    "abstract": "The functional organization of brain networks can be estimated using fMRI by examining the coherence of spontaneous fluctuations in the fMRI signal, a method known as resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Previous studies in humans reported that such functional networks are dominated by stable group and individual factors, demonstrating that fMRI is suited to measuring subject-specific characteristics, and suggesting the utility of such precision fMRI approach in personalized medicine. However, mechanistic investigations to the sources of individual variability in health and disease are limited in humans and thus require animal models. Here, we used repeated-measurement resting-state fMRI in awake mice to quantify the contribution of individual variation to the functional architecture of the mouse cortex. Comparing the organization of functional networks across the group, we found dominant common organizational principles. The data also revealed stable individual features, which create a unique fingerprint that allow identification of individual mice from the group. Examining the distribution of individual variation across the mouse cortex, we found it is homogeneously distributed in both sensory and association networks. Finally, connectome-based predictive modeling of motor behavior in the rotarod task revealed that individual variation in functional connectivity explained behavioral variability. Collectively, these results show that mouse functional networks are characterized by individual variations suggesting that individual variation characterizes the mammalian cortex in general, and not only the primate cortex. These findings lay the foundation for future mechanistic investigations of individual brain organization and pre-clinical studies of brain disorders in the context of personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "At critically high temperature, cardiac output in fish collapses due to depression of heart rate (bradycardia). However, the cause of bradycardia remains unresolved. Here we provide a mechanistic explanation for the temperature induced bradycardia. To this end rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; acclimated at +12{degrees}C) were exposed to acute warming, while cardiac function was followed from electrocardiograms. From +12{degrees}C to +25.3{degrees}C, electrical excitation between different parts of the heart was coordinated but above +25.3{degrees}C atrial and ventricular beating rates became partly dissociated due to 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. With further warming atrial rate increased to the peak value of 188 {+/-} 22 bpm at +27{degrees}C, while the rate of the ventricle reached the peak value of 124 {+/-} 10 bpm at +25.3{degrees}C and thereafter dropped to 111 {+/-} 15 bpm at +27{degrees}C. In single ventricular myocytes, warming from +12{degrees}C to +25{degrees}C attenuated electrical excitability as evidenced by increases in rheobase current and critical depolarization required to trigger action potential. The depression of excitability was caused by temperature induced decrease in input resistance (sarcolemmal K+ leak via the outward IK1 current) of resting myocytes and decrease in inward charge transfer by the Na+ current (INa) of active myocytes. Collectively these findings show that at critically high temperatures AV block causes ventricular bradycardia which is an outcome from the increased excitation threshold of the ventricle due to changes in passive (resting ion leak) and active (inward charge movement) electrical properties of ventricular myocytes. The sequence of events from the level of ion channels to the cardiac function in vivo provides a mechanistic explanation for the depression of cardiac output in fish at critically high temperature.",

    "abstract": "Many animals can modify the environments in which they live, thereby changing the selection pressures they experience. A common example of such niche-construction is the use, creation, or modification of environmental resources for use as nests or shelters. Because these resources often have correlated structural elements, it can be difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of these elements to resource choice, and the preference functions underlying niche-construction behaviour remain hidden. Here, we present an experimental paradigm that uses 3D-scanning, -modelling, and -printing to create replicas of structures that differ with respect to key structural attributes. We show that a niche-constructing, shelldwelling cichlid fish, Neolamprologus multifasciatus, has strong open-ended preference functions for exaggerated shell replicas. Fish preferred shells that were fully intact and either enlarged, lengthened, or had widened apertures. Shell intactness was the most important structural attribute, followed by shell length, then aperture width. We disentangle the relative roles of different shell attributes, which are tightly correlated in the wild, but nevertheless differentially influence shelter choice and therefore niche construction in this species. We highlight the broad utility of our approach when compared to more traditional methods (e.g. two-choice tasks) for studying animal decision-making in a range of contexts.",

    "abstract": "Recent biological invasions offer  natural laboratories to understand the genetics and ecology of adaptation, hybridization, and range limits. One of the most impressive and well-documented biological invasions of the 20th century began in 1957 when Apis mellifera scutellata honey bees swarmed out of managed experimental colonies in Brazil. This newly-imported subspecies, native to southern and eastern Africa, both hybridized with and out-competed previously-introduced European honey bee subspecies. Populations of scutellata-European hybrid honey bees rapidly expanded and spread across much of the Americas in less than 50 years. We use broad geographic sampling and whole genome sequencing of over 300 bees to map the distribution of scutellata ancestry where the northern and southern invasions have presently stalled, forming replicated hybrid zones with European bee populations in California and Argentina. California is much farther from Brazil, yet these hybrid zones occur at very similar latitudes, consistent with the invasion having reached a climate barrier. At these range limits, we observe genome-wide clines for scutellata ancestry, and parallel clines for wing length that span hundreds of kilometers, supporting a smooth transition from climates favoring scutellata-European hybrid bees to climates where they cannot survive winter. We find no large effect loci maintaining exceptionally steep ancestry transitions. Instead, we find most individual loci have concordant ancestry clines across South America, with a build-up of somewhat steeper clines in regions of the genome with low recombination rates, consistent with many loci of small effect contributing to climate-associated fitness trade-offs. Additionally, we find no substantial reductions in genetic diversity associated with rapid expansions nor complete dropout of scutellata ancestry at any individual loci on either continent, which suggests that the competitive fitness advantage of scutellata ancestry at lower latitudes has a polygenic basis and that scutellata-European hybrid bees maintained large population sizes during their invasion. To test for parallel selection across continents, we develop a null model that accounts for drift in ancestry frequencies during the rapid expansion. We identify several peaks within a larger genomic region where selection has pushed scutellata ancestry to high frequency hundreds of kilometers past the present cline centers in both North and South America and that may underlie high-fitness traits driving the invasion.\n\nAuthor SummaryCrop pollination around the world relies on native and introduced honey bee populations, which vary in their behaviors and climatic ranges. Scutellata-European hybrid honey bees (also known as  Africanized honey bees) have been some of the most ecologically successful; originating in a 1950s experimental breeding program in Brazil, they rapidly came to dominate across most of the Americas. As a recent genetic mixture of multiple imported Apis mellifera subspecies, scutellata-European hybrid honey bees have a patchwork of ancestry across their genomes, which we leverage to identify loci with an excess of scutellata or European ancestry due to selection. We additionally use the natural replication in this invasion to compare outcomes between North and South America (California and Argentina). We identify several genomic regions with exceptionally high scutellata ancestry across continents and that may underlie favored scutellata-European hybrid honey bee traits (e.g. Varroa mite resistance). We find evidence that a climatic barrier has dramatically slowed the invasion at similar latitudes on both continents. At the current range limits, scutellata ancestry decreases over hundreds of kilometers, creating many bee populations with intermediate scutellata ancestry proportions that can be used to map the genetic basis of segregating traits (here, wing length) and call into question the biological basis for binary  Africanized vs. European bee classifications.",

NRSs serve as useful catalogues of genetic variation for population and disease studies and while the majority consists of repetitive elements, a substantial fraction is made of non-repetitive, non-reference (NRNR) sequences. The presence of non-human sequences in these catalogues can inflate the number of \"novel\" human sequences, overestimate the genetic differentiation among populations, and jeopardize subsequent analyses that rely on these resources. We uncovered almost 2,000 contaminant sequences of microbial origin in NRNR sequences from recent human pan-genome studies. The contaminant contigs (3,501,302 bp) harbour genes totalling 4,720 predicted proteins (>40 aa). The major sources of contamination are related to Rhyzobiales, Burkholderiales, Pseudomonadales and Lactobacillales, which may have been associated with the original samples or introduced later during sequencing experiments. We additionally observed that the majority of human novel protein-coding genes described in one of the studies entirely overlap repetitive regions and are likely to be false positive predictions. We report here the list of contaminant sequences in three recent human pan-genome catalogues and discuss strategies to increase decontamination efficacy for current and future pan-genome studies.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing technologies have advanced to the point where it is possible to generate high accuracy, haplotype resolved, chromosome scale assemblies. Several long read sequencing technologies are available on the market and a growing number of algorithms have been developed over the last years to assemble the reads generated by those technologies. When starting a new genome project, it is therefore challenging to select the most cost-effective sequencing technology as well as the most appropriate software for assembly and polishing. For this reason, it is important to benchmark different approaches applied to the same sample. Here, we report a comparison of three long read sequencing technologies applied to the de novo assembly of a plant genome, Macadamia jansenii. We have generated sequencing data using Pacific Biosciences (Sequel I), Oxford Nanopore Technologies (PromethION) and BGI (single-tube Long Fragment Read) technologies for the same sample. Several assemblers were benchmarked in the assembly of PacBio and Nanopore reads. Results obtained from combining long read technologies or short read and long read technologies are also presented. The assemblies were compared for contiguity, accuracy and completeness as well as sequencing costs and DNA material requirements. Overall, the three long read technologies produced highly contiguous and complete genome assemblies of Macadamia jansenii. At the time of sequencing, the cost associated with each method was significantly different but continuous improvements in technologies have resulted in greater accuracy, increased throughput and reduced costs. We propose updating this comparison regularly with reports on significant iterations of the sequencing technologies.",

This genome is more contiguous and more complete than GRCh38, the latest version of the human reference genome, and is annotated with highly similar gene content. The Ashkenazi reference genome, Ash1, contains 2,973,118,650 nucleotides as compared to 2,937,639,212 in GRCh38. Annotation identified 20,157 protein-coding genes, of which 19,563 are >99% identical to their counterparts on GRCh38. Most of the remaining genes have small differences. 40 of the protein-coding genes in GRCh38 are missing from Ash1; however, all of these genes are members of multi-gene families for which Ash1 contains other copies. 11 genes appear on different chromosomes from their homologs in GRCh38. Alignment of DNA sequences from an unrelated Ashkenazi individual to Ash1 identified ~1 million fewer homozygous SNPs than alignment of those same sequences to the more-distant GRCh38 genome, illustrating one of the benefits of population-specific reference genomes.",

    "abstract": "Integration of the proviral DNA intermediate into the host cell genome represents an essential step in the retroviral life cycle. While the reason(s) for this requirement remains unclear, it is known that unintegrated proviral DNA is epigenetically silenced. Here, we demonstrate that HIV-1 mutants lacking functional integrase can mount a robust, spreading infection in cells expressing the Tax transcription factor encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus 1. In these cells, HIV-1 forms episomal DNA circles, analogous to Hepatitis B virus covalently closed circular DNAs (cccDNAs), that are transcriptionally active and fully capable of supporting viral replication. This rescue correlates with the loss of inhibitory epigenetic marks, and the acquisition of activating marks, on histones bound to unintegrated HIV-1 DNA. Thus retroviral DNA integration may have evolved, at least in part, as a mechanism to avoid the epigenetic silencing of extrachromosomal viral DNA by host innate antiviral factors.\n\nSignificanceWhile retroviral DNA is synthesized normally after infection by integrase-deficient viruses, the resultant episomal DNA is then epigenetically silenced. Here, we show that expression of the Tax transcription factor encoded by a second human retrovirus, HTLV-1, prevents the epigenetic silencing of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA and instead induces the addition of activating epigenetic marks, and the recruitment of NF-kB/Rel proteins, to the HIV-1 LTR promoter. Moreover, in the presence of Tax, the HIV-1 DNA circles that form in the absence of integrase function are not only efficiently transcribed but also support a spreading, pathogenic IN- HIV-1 infection. Thus, retroviruses have the potential to replicate without integration, as is indeed seen with HBV.",

    "abstract": "H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac) was first identified in yeast and has recently been reported to play important roles in maintaining genomic stability, chromatin assembly, DNA replication, cell cycle progression and DNA repair. Although H3.1K56Ac has been relatively well studied, the function of H3.3K56Ac remains mostly unknown in mammals. In this study, we used H3.3K56Q and H3.3K56R mutants to study the possible function of H3.3K56 acetylation. The K-to-Q substitution mimics a constitutively acetylated lysine, while the K-to-R replacement mimics a constitutively unmodified lysine. We report that cell lines harboring mutation of H3.3K56R exhibit dramatic morphology changes and cell death. Using Tet-Off inducible system, we show an increased population of polyploid/aneuploid cells and a decreased cell viability in H3.3K56R mutant cells. In consistence with these results, H3.3K56R mutant compromised H3.3 incorporation into several pericentric and centric heterochromatin regions we tested. Moreover, mass spectrometry analysis coupled with label free quantification reveal that biological processes regulated by the H3.3-associating proteins, whose interaction with H3.3 is markedly increased by H3.3K56Q mutation but decreased by H3.3K56Q mutation, include sister chromatid cohesion, mitotic nuclear division, and mitotic nuclear envelope disassembly. These results suggest that H3.3K56 acetylation is crucial for chromosome segregation and cell division in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Active haptic sensation is critical for object identification and manipulation, such as for tool use in humans, or prey capture in rodents. The neural circuit basis for recognizing objects through active touch alone is poorly understood. To address this gap, we combined optogenetics, two photon imaging, and high-speed behavioral tracking in mice solving a novel surface orientation discrimination task with their whiskers. We found that orientation discrimination required animals to summate input from multiple whiskers specifically along the whisker arc. Many animals discriminated the orientation of the stimulus per se, as their performance was invariant to the specific location of the presented stimulus. Two photon imaging showed that populations of neurons in the barrel cortex encoded each of the discriminated orientations, and this coding depended on integration over the whisker array. Finally, acute optogenetic inactivation of the barrel cortex strongly impaired surface orientation discrimination, and even cell-type specific optogenetic suppression of layer 4 excitatory neurons degraded performance, implying a role for superficial layers in this computation. These data suggest a model in which spatial summation over an active haptic array generates representations of an objects surface orientations. These computations may facilitate the encoding of complex three-dimensional objects during active exploration.",

Prior 2D approximations are relaxed in order to analyze 3D blood flow dynamics as a function of cortical depth. Comparison of the predictions with experimental data for typical stimuli demonstrates that the full 3D model matches at least as well as previous approaches while requiring significantly fewer assumptions and model parameters (e.g., there is no more need to define depth-specific parameter values for spatial spreading, peak amplitude, and hemodynamic velocity).",

    "abstract": "Spatial working memory (SWM) is a cognitive skill supporting survival-relevant behaviors, such as optimizing foraging behavior by remembering recent routes and visited sites. It is known that SWM decision-making in rodents requires the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampus. The decision process in SWM tasks carries a specific electrophysiological signature of a brief, decision-related increase in neuronal communication in the form of an increase in the coherence of neuronal theta oscillations (4-12 Hz) between the mPFC and dorsal hippocampus, a finding we replicated here during spontaneous exploration of a plus maze in freely moving mice. We further evaluated SWM decision-related coherence changes within frequency bands above theta. Decision-related coherence increases occurred in seven frequency bands between 4 and 200 Hz and decision-outcome related differences in coherence modulation occurred within the beta and gamma frequency bands and in higher frequency oscillations up to 130 Hz. With recent evidence that Purkinje cells in the cerebellar lobulus simplex (LS) represent information about the phase and phase differences of gamma oscillations in the mPFC and dorsal hippocampus, we hypothesized that LS might be involved in the modulation of mPFC-hippocampal gamma coherence. We show that optical stimulation of LS significantly impairs SWM performance and decision-related mPFC-dCA1 coherence modulation, providing causal evidence for an involvement of cerebellar LS in SWM decision making at the behavioral and neuronal level. Our findings suggest that the cerebellum might contribute to SWM decision-making by optimizing the decision-related modulation of mPFC-dCA1 coherence.",

    "abstract": "Subanesthetic ketamine evokes rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effects in human patients. The mechanism for ketamines effects remains elusive, but ketamine may broadly modulate brain plasticity processes. We show that single-dose ketamine reactivates adult mouse visual cortical plasticity and promotes functional recovery of visual acuity defects from amblyopia. Ketamine specifically induces down-regulation of neuregulin-1 (NRG1) expression in parvalbumin-expressing (PV) inhibitory neurons in mouse visual cortex. NRG1 downregulation in PV neurons co-tracks both the fast onset and sustained decreases in synaptic inhibition to excitatory neurons, along with reduced synaptic excitation to PV neurons in vitro and in vivo following a single ketamine treatment. These effects are blocked by exogenous NRG1 as well as PV targeted receptor knockout. Thus ketamine reactivation of adult visual cortical plasticity is mediated through rapid and sustained cortical disinhibition via downregulation of PV-specific NRG1 signaling. Our findings reveal the neural plasticity-based mechanism for ketamine-mediated functional recovery from adult amblyopia.\n\nHighlights{circ} Disinhibition of excitatory cells by ketamine occurs in a fast and sustained manner\n{circ}Ketamine evokes NRG1 downregulation and excitatory input loss to PV cells\n{circ}Ketamine induced plasticity is blocked by exogenous NRG1 or its receptor knockout\n{circ}PV inhibitory cells are the initial functional locus underlying ketamines effects",

Biosynthetic protein-based fibers have the potential to overcome these concerns, but large-scale production with high yield (>1g/L) and purity (>%80), as well as low cost (<$50/kg), must be achieved. Here we developed an optimized expression and purification method for biosynthetic tandem repeat proteins, that are inspired from squid ring tooth (SRT) protein using three wetwaste feedstock, corn steep liquor, molasses, and soybean extract. SRT is composed of a highly stiff, naturally occurring bioplastic and these properties arise from the molecular architecture of the constituant proteins, which are segmented co-polymers with alternating semicrystalline and amorphous domains similar to silk. We have developed protocols to use liquid industrial and agricultural waste as feedstock for SRT production, which has the potential to divert waste streams into useful products. We also show that our biosynthetic protein powder, produced at 1 g/L yield and greater than 80% purity, can be manufactured into fibers using conventional split film or wet-spinning approaches.",

    "abstract": "Oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), as well as synthetic ligands targeting their receptors (OTR, V1aR), are used in a wide variety of research contexts, but typically their pharmacological properties are determined in only a few species. Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) have a long history of use as a behavioral and biomedical model for the study of oxytocin and vasopressin, and more recently, hamsters have been used to investigate behavioral consequences of OT-mediated activation of V1aRs. We sought to determine the binding affinities of OT, AVP, and the selective V1aR antagonist, Manning compound, in OTRs and V1aRs found in hamster brains. We performed saturation binding asays to determine the Kd values for the selective OTR and V1aR radioligands, [125I]OVTA and [125I]LVA in hamster brains. We then performed competition binding assays to determine Ki values for OT, AVP, and Manning compond at both the OTR and V1aR. We found that OT and AVP each had the highest affinity for their canonical receptors (OT-OTR Ki=4.28 nM; AVP-V1ar Ki=4.70 nM), and had the lowest affinity for their non-canonical ligands (OT-V1aR=495.2nM; AVP-OTR Ki=36.1 nM). Manning compound had the highest affinity for the V1aR (MC-V1aR Ki=6.87 nM; MC-OTR Ki=213.8 nM), but Manning compound was not as selective for the V1aR as has been reported in rat receptor. When comparing these data to previously published work, we found that the promiscuity of the V1aR in hamsters with respect to oxytocin and vasopressin binding is more similar to the promiscuity of the human V1aR than the rat V1aR receptor. Moreover, the selectivity of oxytocin at hamster receptors is more similar to the selectivity of oxytocin at human receptors than the selectivity of oxytocin at rat receptors. These data highlight the importance of determining the pharmacological properties of behaviorally relevant compounds in diverse models species.",

    "abstract": "There is a long-established link between anatomy and function in the somatomotor system in the mammalian cerebral cortex. The morphology of the central sulcus is predictive of the location of functional activation peaks relating to movement of different effectors in individuals. By contrast, morphological variation in the subcentral region and its relationship to function is, as yet, unknown. Investigating the subcentral region is particularly important in the context of speech, since control of the larynx during human speech production is related to activity in this region. Here, we examined the relationship between morphology in the central and subcentral region and the location of functional activity during movement of the hand, lips, tongue, and larynx at the individual participant level. We provide a systematic description of the sulcal patterns of the subcentral and adjacent opercular cortex, including the inter-individual variability in sulcal morphology. We show that, in the majority of participants, the anterior subcentral sulcus is not continuous, but consists of two distinct segments. A robust relationship between morphology of the central and subcentral sulcal segments and movement of different effectors is demonstrated. Inter-individual variability of underlying anatomy might thus explain previous inconsistent findings, in particular regarding the ventral larynx area in subcentral cortex. A surface registration based on sulcal labels indicated that such anatomical information can improve the alignment of functional data for group studies.",

    "abstract": "Auditory verbal hallucinations, or \"hearing voices\", is a remarkable state of the mind, occurring in psychiatric and neurological patients, and in a significant minority of the general population. An unexplained characteristic of this phenomenon is that it transiently fluctuates, with coming and going of episodes with time. We monitored neural activity with BOLD-fMRI second-by-second before and after participants indicated the start and end of a transient hallucinatory episode during the scanning session by pressing a response-button. We show that a region in the ventro-medial frontal cortex is activated in advance of conscious awareness of going in or out of a transient hallucinatory state. There was an increase in activity initiated a few seconds before the button-press for onsets, and a corresponding decrease in activity initiated a few seconds before the button-press for offsets. We identified the time between onset and offset button-presses, extracted the corresponding BOLD time-courses from nominated regions-of-interest, and analyzed changes in the signal from 10 seconds before to 15 seconds after the response-button was pressed, which identified onset and offset events. We suggest that this brain region act as a switch to turn on and off a hallucinatory episode. The results may have implications for new interventions for intractable hallucinations.",

Here, we addressed whether metacognition in different cognitive domains rely on common or distinct neural substrates with combined diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. After acquiring DTI and resting-state fMRI data, we asked participants to perform a temporal-order memory task and a perceptual discrimination task, followed by trial-specific confidence judgments. DTI analysis revealed that the structural integrity (indexed by fractional anisotropy) in the anterior portion of right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) was associated with both perceptual and mnemonic metacognitive abilities. Using perturbed mnemonic metacognitive scores produced by inhibiting the precuneus using TMS, the mnemonic metacognition scores did not correlate with individuals SLF structural integrity anymore, revealing the relevance of this tract in memory metacognition. In order to further verify the involvement of several cortical regions connected by SLF, we took the TMS-targeted precuneus region as a seed in a functional connectivity analysis and found the functional connectivity between precuneus and two SLF-connected regions (inferior parietal cortex and precentral gyrus) differentially mediated mnemonic but not perceptual metacognition performance. These results illustrate the importance of SLF and a putative white-matter grey-matter circuitry that supports human metacognition.",

    "abstract": "Coordinated activity across networks of neurons is a hallmark of both resting and active behavioral states in many species, including worms, flies, fish, mice and humans1-5. These global patterns alter energy metabolism in the brain over seconds to hours, making oxygen consumption and glucose uptake widely used proxies of neural activity6,7. However, whether changes in neural activity are causally related to changes in metabolic flux in intact circuits on the sub-second timescales associated with behavior, is unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether transitions between rest and action are associated with spatiotemporally structured changes in neuronal energy metabolism. Here, we combine two-photon microscopy of the entire fruit fly brain with sensors that allow simultaneous measurements of neural activity and metabolic flux, across both resting and active behavioral states. We demonstrate that neural activity drives changes in metabolic flux, creating a tight coupling between these signals that can be measured across large-scale brain networks. Further, these studies reveal that the initiation of even minimal behavioral movements causes large-scale changes in the pattern of neural activity and energy metabolism, revealing unexpected structure in the functional architecture of the brain. The relationship between neural activity and energy metabolism is likely evolutionarily ancient. Thus, these studies provide a critical foundation for using metabolic proxies to capture changes in neural activity and reveal that even minimal behavioral movements are associated with changes in large-scale brain network activity.",

An additional proteomics dataset (94 AD, 55 MCI and 100 controls) was included for external proteomics validation. Modules created within each modality were correlated with clinical AD diagnosis, brain atrophy measures and disease progression, as well as with each other. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was employed to examine the biological processes and molecular and cellular functions for protein modules associated with AD phenotypes. Lipid species were annotated in the lipid modules associated with AD phenotypes.

    "abstract": "There has been enormous progress defining the genetic landscape of disease. However, genotypes rarely fully predict neurological phenotypes, and we rarely understand why. TOR1A +/{Delta}gag that causes dystonia with ~30% penetrance is a classic case. Here we show, in inbred mice, that +/{Delta}gag affects embryonic brain lipid metabolism with sex-skewed reduced penetrance. Penetrance is affected by environmental context, including maternal diet. The lipid metabolic defect resolves during post-natal development. Nevertheless, we discover dystonia-like symptoms in ~30% of juvenile female Tor1a+/{Delta}gag mice, and prevent these symptoms by genetically suppressing abnormal lipid metabolism. We conclude that Tor1a+/{Delta}gag embryos poorly buffer metabolic stress in utero, resulting in a period of abnormal metabolism that hardwires the brain for dystonia in later life. The data show unexpected and profound impacts of sex, and thus highlight the importance of examining male and female animal models of disease.\n\nSignificance StatementThe genetic landscape of neurological disease is relatively well mapped. However, we typically cannot explain why some mutations only cause disease in a subset of individuals. A classic case is DYT-TOR1A dystonia that only develops in 30% of TOR1A+/{Delta}gag carriers. We now find that ~30% of inbred female Tor1a+/{Delta}gag mice develop abnormal brain lipid metabolism as embryos, while males are spared. The percentage is affected by maternal diet. Further, this period of abnormal lipid metabolism causes dystonia-like symptoms in juvenile mice. These data show how an environmentally-sensitive event of development defines which genetically-susceptible individuals develop disease in later life. They also highlight the importance of examining male and female animal models of disease.",

Here, we report that loss of sfpq leads to premature termination of multiple transcripts due to widespread activation of previously unannotated cryptic last exons (CLEs). These CLEs appear preferentially in long introns of genes with neuronal functions and dampen gene expression outputs and/or give rise to short peptides interfering with the normal gene functions. We show that one such peptide encoded by the CLE-containing epha4b mRNA isoform is responsible for neurodevelopmental defects in the sfpq mutant. The uncovered CLE-repressive activity of SFPQ is conserved in mouse and human, and SFPQ-inhibited CLEs are found across ALS iPSC-derived neurons. These results greatly expand our understanding of SFPQ function and uncover a new gene regulation mechanism with wide relevance to human pathologies.",

    "abstract": "In the primary visual cortex (V1) of higher mammals, long-range horizontal connections (LHCs) are observed to develop, linking iso-orientation domains of cortical tuning. It is unknown how this feature-specific wiring of circuitry develops before eye opening. Here, we show that LHCs in V1 may originate from spatio-temporally structured feedforward activities generated from spontaneous retinal waves. Using model simulations based on the anatomy and observed activity patterns of the retina, we show that waves propagating in retinal mosaics can initialize the wiring of LHCs by co-activating neurons of similar tuning, whereas equivalent random activities cannot induce such organizations. Simulations showed that emerged LHCs can produce the patterned activities observed in V1, matching topography of the underlying orientation map. We also confirmed that the model can also reproduce orientation-specific microcircuits in salt-and-pepper organizations in rodents. Our results imply that early peripheral activities contribute significantly to cortical development of functional circuits.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDevelopmental model of long-range horizontal connections (LHCs) in V1 is simulated\nC_LIO_LISpontaneous retinal waves generate feature-specific wiring of LHCs in visual cortex\nC_LIO_LIEmerged LHCs induce orientation-matching patterns of spontaneous cortical activity\nC_LIO_LIRetinal waves induce orientation-specific microcircuits of visual cortex in rodents\nC_LI\n\nSignificance statementLong-range horizontal connections (LHCs) in the primary visual cortex (V1) are observed to emerge before the onset of visual experience, selectively connecting iso-domains of orientation maps. However, it is unknown how such tuning-specific wirings develop before eye-opening. Here, we show that LHCs in V1 originate from the tuning-specific activation of cortical neurons by spontaneous retinal waves during early developmental stages. Our simulations of a visual cortex model show that feedforward activities from the retina initialize the spatial organization of activity patterns in V1, which induces visual feature-specific wirings of V1 neurons. Our model also explains the origin of cortical microcircuits observed in rodents, suggesting that the proposed developmental mechanism is applicable universally to circuits of various mammalian species.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm that can account for how organisms learn to adapt their behavior in complex environments with sparse rewards. However, implementations in spiking neuronal networks typically rely on input architectures involving place cells or receptive fields. This is problematic, as such approaches either scale badly as the environment grows in size or complexity, or presuppose knowledge on how the environment should be partitioned. Here, we propose a learning architecture that combines unsupervised learning on the input projections with clustered connectivity within the representation layer. This combination allows input features to be mapped to clusters; thus the network self-organizes to produce task-relevant activity patterns that can serve as the basis for reinforcement learning on the output projections. On the basis of the MNIST and Mountain Car tasks, we show that our proposed model performs better than either a comparable unclustered network or a clustered network with static input projections. We conclude that the combination of unsupervised learning and clustered connectivity provides a generic representational substrate suitable for further computation.",

    "abstract": "Brain interdependencies can be studied either from a structural/anatomical perspective (\"structural connectivity\", SC) or by considering statistical interdependencies (\"functional connectivity\", FC). Interestingly, while SC is typically pairwise (white-matter fibers start in a certain region and arrive at another), FC is not; however, most FC analyses focus only on pairwise statistics and neglect high-order interactions. A promising tool to study high-order interdependencies is the recently proposed O-Information, which can quantify the intrinsic statistical synergy and redundancy in groups of three or more interacting variables. In this paper we used the O-Information to investigate how high-order statistical interdependencies are affected by age. For this, we analised functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data at rest obtained from 164 healthy participants, ranging from 10 to 80 years old. Our results show that older subjects (age ranging from 60 to 80 years) exhibit a higher predominance of redundant dependencies than younger subjects; moreover, this effect seems to be pervasive, taking place at all interaction orders. Additionally, we found that these effects are highly heterogeneous across brain regions, and suggest the existence of a \"redundancy core\" formed by the prefrontal and motor cortices - thus involving functions such as working memory, executive and motor functions. Our methodology to assess high-order interdependencies in fMRI data has unlimited applications. The code to calculate these metrics is freely available.",

A majority of studies have taken a metabarcoding approach--that is, amplifying and sequencing one or more gene targets of interest. Shotgun sequencing of eDNA--also called metagenomics--while popular in microbial community analysis has not seen much adoption for the analysis of other groups of organisms. Especially in light of the existence of extremely high-capacity DNA sequencers, we decided to test the performance of a shotgun approach side-by-side with a metabarcoding approach on marine water samples obtained from offshore Newfoundland. We found that metabarcoding remains the most efficient technique, but that metagenomics also has significant power to reveal biodiversity patterns, and in fact can be treated as an independent confirmation of ecological gradients. Moreover, we show that metagenomics can also be used to infer factors related to ecosystem health and function.",

    "abstract": "How is the primary motor cortex (M1) organized to control fine finger movements? We investigated the population activity in M1 for single finger flexion and extension, using 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in female and male human participants, and compared these results to the neural spiking patterns recorded in two male monkeys performing the identical task. fMRI activity patterns were distinct for movements of different fingers, but quite similar for flexion and extension of the same finger. In contrast, spiking patterns in monkeys were quite distinct for both fingers and directions, similar to what was found for muscular activity patterns. The discrepancy between fMRI and electrophysiological measurements can be explained by two (non-mutually exclusive) characteristics of the organization of finger flexion and extension movements. Given that fMRI reflects predominantly input and recurrent activity, the results can be explained by an architecture in which neural populations that control flexion or extension of the same finger produce distinct outputs, but interact tightly with each other and receive similar inputs. Additionally, neurons tuned to different movement directions for the same finger (or combination of fingers) may cluster closely together, while neurons that control different finger combinations may be more spatially separated. When measuring this organization with fMRI at a coarse spatial scale, the activity patterns for flexion and extension of the same finger would appear very similar. Overall, we suggest that the discrepancy between fMRI and electrophysiological measurements provides new insights into the general organization of fine finger movements in M1.\n\nSignificance statementThe primary motor cortex (M1) is important for producing individuated finger movements. Recent evidence shows that movements that commonly co-occur are associated with more similar activity patterns in M1. Flexion and extension of the same finger, which never co-occur, should therefore be associated with distinct representations. However, using carefully controlled experiments and multivariate analyses, we demonstrate that human fMRI activity patterns for flexion or extension of the same finger are highly similar. In contrast, spiking patterns measured in monkey M1 are clearly distinct. This suggests that populations controlling opposite movements of the same finger, while producing distinct outputs, may cluster together and share inputs and local processing. These results provide testable hypotheses about the organization of hand control in M1.",

We used three different visual tasks: mental rotation, working memory and mental arithmetic in a classic fMRI ON-OFF block design where task (ON) blocks alternated with equal periods of rest (OFF) blocks. By analysing data in two ways, using an ON-OFF contrast, we showed the existence of a generalized task-positive network, labelled the extrinsic mode network (EMN) which was anti-correlated with the default mode network (DMN) as processing demands shifted from rest to active processing. We then identified two key regions of interest (ROIs) in the SMA and Precuneus/PCC regions as hubs for the extrinsic and intrinsic networks, and extracted the time-course from these ROIs. The results showed a close to perfect correlations for the SMA and Precuneus/PCC time-courses for ON-respective OFF-blocks. We suggest the existence of two large-scale networks, an extrinsic mode network and an intrinsic mode network, respectively, which are up- and down-regulated as environmental demands change from active to passive processing.",

    "abstract": "Our subjective perception of time is optimized to temporal regularities in the environment. This is illustrated by the central tendency effect: when estimating a range of intervals, short intervals are overestimated whereas long intervals are underestimated to reduce the overall estimation error. Most models of interval timing ascribe this effect to the weighting of the current interval with previous memory traces after the interval has been perceived. Alternatively, the perception of the duration could already be flexibly tuned to its temporal context. We investigated this hypothesis using an interval reproduction task in which human participants (both sexes) reproduced a shorter and longer interval range. As expected, reproductions were biased towards the subjective mean of each presented range. EEG analyses showed that temporal context indeed affected neural dynamics during the perception phase. Specifically, longer previous durations decreased CNV and P2 amplitude and increased beta power. In addition, multivariate pattern analysis showed that it is possible to decode context from the transient EEG signal quickly after both onset and offset of the perception phase. Together, these results suggest that temporal context creates dynamic expectations which actively affect the perception of duration.\n\nSignificance StatementThe subjective sense of duration does not arise in isolation, but is informed by previous experiences. This is demonstrated by abundant evidence showing that the production of duration estimates is biased towards previously experienced time intervals. However, it is yet unknown whether this temporal context actively affects perception or only asserts its influence in later, post-perceptual stages as proposed by most current formal models of this task. Using an interval reproduction task, we show that EEG signatures flexibly adapt to the temporal context during perceptual encoding. Furthermore, interval history can be decoded from the transient EEG signal even when the current duration was identical. Thus, our results demonstrate that context actively influences perception.",

    "abstract": "Sporozoite forms of the malaria parasite Plasmodium are transmitted by mosquitoes and first infect the liver for an initial round of replication before parasite proliferation in the blood. The molecular mechanisms involved during sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes remain poorly understood. Two receptors of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV), the tetraspanin CD81 and the scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), play an important role during the entry of Plasmodium sporozoites into hepatocytic cells. In contrast to HCV entry, which requires both CD81 and SR-B1 together with additional host factors, CD81 and SR-B1 operate independently during malaria liver infection. Sporozoites from human-infecting P. falciparum and P. vivax rely respectively on CD81 or SR-B1. Rodent-infecting P. berghei can use SR-B1 to infect host cells as an alternative pathway to CD81, providing a tractable model to investigate the role of SR-B1 during Plasmodium liver infection. Here we show that mouse SR-B1 is less functional as compared to human SR-B1 during P. berghei infection. We took advantage of this functional difference to investigate the structural determinants of SR-B1 required for infection. Using a structure-guided strategy and chimeric mouse/human SR-B1 constructs, we could map the functional region of human SR-B1 within apical loops, suggesting that this region of the protein may play a crucial role for interaction of sporozoite ligands with host cells and thus the very first step of Plasmodium infection.\n\nIMPORTANCEMalaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites and remains one of the deadliest parasitic diseases worldwide. The parasite is transmitted by a blood feeding mosquito and first invades the liver for an initial, obligatory and silent round of replication. The liver infection is an attractive target for antimalarial vaccine strategies, however the molecular mechanisms of parasite invasion of hepatocytes remain to be fully elucidated. Two hepatocyte surface proteins are known to be important for parasite entry into hepatocytes, the tetraspanin CD81 and the scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1). These receptors constitute independent gateways depending on the Plasmodium species. Here, we identified the structural determinants of SR-B1, an important hepatocyte entry factor for human-infecting P. vivax. This study paves the way toward a better characterization of the molecular interactions underlying the crucial early stages of infection, a pre-requisite for the development of novel malaria vaccine strategies.",

    "abstract": "Moderate overexpression of Opa1, encoding a master regulator of mitochondrial cristae morphology, has been shown to improve significantly mitochondrial damage induced by drugs, surgical denervation, or genetically determined OXPHOS defects. However, this approach has been so far demonstrated in a limited number of genetically defective OXPHOS models characterized by specific impairment of a single mitochondrial respiratory chain complex. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of moderate Opa1 overexpression in the Mpv17-/- mouse, characterized by profound, multisystem mtDNA depletion. In naive Mpv17-/- individuals, whose genetic background was crossed with individuals belonging to the Opa1tg strain, we found a surprising anticipation of severe, progressive focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, previously described in Mpv17-/- animals as a late-onset clinical feature (after 12-18 months of life). In contrast, kidney failure led Mpv17-/- individuals from this new \"mixed\" strain leading to death 8-9 weeks after birth. However, Mpv17-/-::Opa1tg mice lived much longer than Mpv17-/- littermates, and developed much later severe proteinuria associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. MtDNA content and OXPHOS activities were significantly higher in Mpv17-/-::Opa1tg than in Mpv17-/- kidneys, and similar to WT littermates. Mitochondrial network and cristae ultrastructure were largely preserved in Mpv17-/-::Opa1tg vs. Mpv17-/- kidney and isolated podocytes. Mechanistically, the protective effect of Opa1 overexpression in this model was mediated by a block in apoptosis due to the stabilization of the mitochondrial cristae, consequently increasing the levels of mitochondrial morphology proteins like MFN2 and MIC19 as well as stabilizing ATP synthase oligomers. These results demonstrate that strategies aiming at increasing Opa1 expression or activity can be an effective aid against mtDNA depletion syndromes.",

In humans, renal function is affected by recurrent episodes of acute congestive heart failure (CHF). The aim of this prospective, case-control study was to evaluate the appearance and influence of worsening cardiac disease (WCD), defined on echocardiographic and radiographic parameters, on renal function (defined as worsening renal function [WRF], on the basis of serum creatinine level and presence of proteinuria) in two population: 21 dogs with chronic mitral valve disease (CMVD) and 20 healthy dogs. Dogs were sorted into groups according to the presence/absence of WRF or WCD. Statistical analysis was performed between CMVD dogs and healthy dogs and inside the CMVD dogs group. There was no statistically significant difference in developing WRF between dogs with/without WCD and no statistical evidence to support a difference in WRF parameters in dogs experiencing CHF and dogs not experiencing it. The prevalence of azotemia in CMVD dogs was significantly higher than the prevalence of azotemia previously reported in the general population of dogs. Diuretics therapy didnt affect renal function. No difference in survival time was seen between groups. In conclusion, CHF, WCD and diuretics therapy didnt directly induce WRF. However, considering the prevalence of azotemia, data suggests a link between heart and kidney function (despite we didnt excluded aged-related coexistence of organ damage).

HUVEC cultures of each APOL1 genotype were generated. APOL1 was expressed using IFN{gamma}; HUVEC mitochondrial function, lysosome integrity, and autophagic flux were measured. IFN{gamma} increased APOL1 expression across all genotypes 20-fold (p=0.001).

These cells also demonstrated a contracted lysosome compartment (p<0.001), and an accumulation of autophagosomes suggesting a defect in autophagic flux. Treatment of 0RV HUVECs with a non-selective lysosome inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine, produced autophagosome accumulations similar to the 2RV cells, thus implicating lysosome dysfunction in blocking autophagy. Compared to 0RV and 2RV HUVECs, 1 RV cells demonstrated an intermediate autophagy defect which was exacerbated by IFN{gamma}. Our findings implicate dysfunction of mitochondrial respiration, lysosome, and autophagy in APOL1 RV-mediated endothelial cytotoxicity. IFN{gamma} amplified this phenotype even in variant heterozygous cells-a potential underpin of the APOL1/inflammation interaction. This is the first description of APOL1 pathobiology in variant heterozygous cell cultures.",

    "abstract": "Korean peninsular weather is rapidly becoming subtropical due to global warming. In summer 2018, South Korea experienced the highest temperatures since the meteorological observations recorded in 1907. Heat stress has a negative effect on Holstein cows, the most popular breed of dairy cattle in South Korea, which is susceptible to heat. To examine physiological changes in dairy cows under heat stress conditions, we analyzed the profiles circulating microRNAs isolated from whole blood samples collected under heat stress and non-heat stress conditions using small RNA sequencing. We compared the expression profiles in lactating cows under heat stress and non-heat stress conditions to understand the regulation of biological processes in heat-stressed cows. Moreover, we measured several heat stress indicators, such as rectal temperature, milk yield, average daily gain, and progesterone concentration. All these assessments showed that pregnant cows were more susceptible to heat stress than non-pregnant cows. Particularly, progesterone concentrations known to have maternal warming effects were at similar levels in non-pregnant cows but significantly increased in pregnant cows under heat stress conditions. The differentially expressed miRNAs and their putative target genes were analyzed in pregnant cows. Interestingly, we found that differentially expressed miRNAs (bta-miR-146b, bta-miR-20b, bta-miR-29d-3p, bta-miR-1246) specifically targeted progesterone biosynthesis (StAR) and the function of corpus luteum-related genes (CCL11, XCL), suggesting that pregnant cows with elevated progesterone concentrations are more susceptible to heat stress. In addition, we found the differential expression of 11 miRNAs (bta-miR-19a, bta-miR-19b, bta-miR-30a-5p, and several from the bta-miR-2284 family) in both pregnant and non-pregnant cows under heat stress conditions. In target gene prediction and gene set enrichment analysis, these miRNAs were found to be associated with the cytoskeleton, cell junction, vasculogenesis, cell proliferation, ATP synthesis, oxidative stress, and immune responses involved in heat response. These miRNAs can be used as potential biomarkers for heat stress.",

Our work aims to study the frequency and patterns of resistance of normal urinary aerobic bacterial flora.\n\nMethodsClean catch midstream urine specimens were collected from 120 young healthy females, and then cultured. Identification of bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibility were done by means of Biomerieux VITEK(R) 2 automated systems. Subjects who have undergone antimicrobial treatment in one month werent included.\n\nResultsThe incidence of positive bacterial cultures was 54.2%, of which 21.5% were ploymicrobial. 107 bacterial isolates that encompass 12 genera and 27 species that were predominated by Gram-positive bacteria (72%) were cultivated. Staphylococcaceae (46.1%) and Enterobacteriaceae (17.8%) were the most frequently isolates among Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria respectively, from them 36 species have been identified as b lactamase producers. The top four frequently isolated bacteria are Micrococcus species (16%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (13.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (10%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%). Twenty two bacterial species were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing by using broad and narrow spectrum antibiotics and antimicrobials. Ampicillin showed the lowest susceptibility rate against Gram positives, followed by erythromycin and azithromycin. The lesser antimicrobial susceptibility potential among Gram negative bacteria was exhibited against ampicillin, followed by piperacillin and cefotaxime.\n\nConclusionOur findings emphasize the importance of highlighting urine bacterial flora in research especially those related to susceptibility patterns, employing more advanced culture methods as multiple drug resistant bacteria were isolated.",

    "abstract": "Reported pain intensity depends not only on stimulus intensity but also on previously experienced pain. A painfully hot temperature applied to the skin evokes a lower subjective pain intensity if immediately preceded by a higher temperature, a phenomenon called offset analgesia. This is typically evoked using a three-step noxious heat stimulus. In other clinical and laboratory settings, prior pain experience may increase pain intensity as well. Therefore, we hypothesized that even small increases in stimulus intensity within the noxious range would be accompanied by enhanced reported pain intensity. To test this possibility, we inverted the intensity order of the three-step stimulus, so that the same hot temperature is immediately preceded by an increase from a transiently lowered temperature. Using healthy volunteer subjects, we observed a disproportionate increase in pain intensity during the novel, inverted, three-step stimulus. This disproportionate increase is similar in magnitude to that of offset analgesia. Control stimuli demonstrate that these changes in pain intensity are distinct from habituation. The magnitudes of offset analgesia and the disproportionate increase in pain intensity correlate with each other but not with the absolute noxious stimulus temperature. These observations suggest that the disproportionate increase in pain intensity represents an \"onset hyperalgesia.\" Finally, the magnitude of both offset analgesia and onset hyperalgesia depends on preceding temperature changes. Overall, this study finds that perceptual enhancement of noxious stimulus change occurs bidirectionally and that this depends on the intensity and direction of change of the immediately preceding stimulus.",

    "abstract": "Female fertility is the capacity to produce oocytes and achieve fertilization and pregnancy, and these outcomes are impaired by age, diseases, environment and social pressure. However, there is no effective therapy that preserves female reproductive ability. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can exhibit multidirectional differentiation potential, and they have gained great attention as a tool for preserving female fertility. Therefore, this study uses human umbilical cords-MSCs (Huc-MSCs) to preserve and restore fertility in aging female mice and chemotherapy-damaged mice through the rescue of ovarian function and the reconstruction of the fallopian tubes and uterus. In our study, 2 mouse models were generated: aging mice (37 weeks old) and chemotherapy-damaged mice. Then, we injected Huc-MSCs into mice through the tail vein. After treatment, the effect of MSCs on the ovary, fallopian tubes and uterus was evaluated by analyzing gonadal hormone levels and by performing morphological analysis and statistical analysis. The levels of E2 and FSH exhibited a significant recovery after HUC-MSC transplantation both in aging mice and mice treated with chemotherapy. Huc-MSC treatment also increased the numbers of primordial, developing and preovulatory follicles in the ovaries of mice. Meanwhile, MSCs have been shown to rescue the morphology of the fallopian tubes and uterus through mechanisms such as regenerating the cilia in fallopian tubes and reforming glands and chorionic villi in the uterus. Therefore, it is suggested that Huc-MSCs may represent an effective potential treatment for preserving female fertility through recovery from chemotherapy damage and rescuing female reproductive organs from the effects of aging.",

    "abstract": "Trpm8 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 8) is expressed by sensory neurons, and it is involved in the detection of cold temperatures. Increased TRPM8 activity triggers an increase in uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1)-dependent brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. Bone density and marrow adipose tissue are regulated by rodent housing temperature and brown adipose tissue, suggesting one mediator of this effect may be TRPM8. In order to test whether TRPM8 was involved in the co-regulation of thermogenesis and bone homeostasis, we examined the bone phenotypes of one-year-old Trpm8 knockout mice (Trpm8-KO) and then exposed them to a 4-week cold temperature challenge. Male Trpm8-KO mice had lower bone mineral density than WT, with smaller bone size (femur length and cross-sectional area) being the most striking finding, and exhibited a delayed cold acclimation with increased BAT expression of Ucp1, Dio2 and Cidea at the end of the study. In contrast to males, female Trpm8-KO mice had low vertebral bone microarchitectural parameters, but no genotype-specific alterations in body temperature. Interestingly, Trpm8 was not required for cold-induced trabecular bone loss in either sex, but may be required for cold-induced changes in marrow adiposity in males. Furthermore, bone marrow adipose tissue accumulation in females was significantly blunted by Trpm8 deletion. In summary, we identified sex differences in the role of TRPM8 in maintaining body temperature, bone density and marrow adipose tissue. Identifying mechanisms through which cold temperature and brown adipose tissue influence bone could help to ameliorate potential bone side effects of obesity treatments designed to stimulate thermogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Grassland biodiversity is among the most vulnerable to land use. How to best manage semi-natural grasslands for maintaining biodiversity is still unclear in many cases because processes may depend on environmental conditions and indirect effects are rarely considered. Here we evaluate the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of grazing intensity on plant communities along an elevational gradient on a large topographic scale in the Eastern Carpathians in Ukraine. We sampled 31 semi-natural grasslands exposed to cattle grazing in two years. Within each grassland site we measured plant community properties such as the number of species, functional groups, and the proportion of undesirable weeds. In addition, we recorded cattle density (as proxy for grazing intensity), soil properties (bare soil exposure, soil organic carbon, and soil pH) and densities of soil decomposers (earthworms and soil microorganisms). We used structural equation modelling to explore direct and indirect effects of grazing intensity on plant communities along the elevation gradient. We found that cattle density decreased plant species and functional diversity but increased the proportion of undesirable weeds. Some of these effects were directly linked to grazing intensity (i.e., species richness), while others (i.e., functional diversity and proportion of undesirable weeds) were mediated via bare soil exposure. Although grazing intensity decreased with elevation, the effects of grazing on the plant community did not change along the elevation gradient. Generally, elevation had a strong positive direct effect on plant species richness as well as a negative indirect effect, mediated via altered soil acidity and decreased decomposer density. Our results indicate that plant diversity and composition are controlled by the complex interplay among grazing intensity and changing environmental conditions along elevation. Furthermore, we found lower soil pH, organic carbon and decomposer density with elevation, indicating that the effects of grazing on soil and related ecosystem functions and services in semi-natural grasslands may be more pronounced with elevation. This demonstrates that we need to account for environmental gradients when attempting to generalize effects of land-use intensity on biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) represent a serious threat to public health due to the lack of treatment and high mortality. The rate of antimicrobial resistance of Enterobacterales isolates to major antimicrobials, including carbapenems, is much higher in Vietnam than in Western countries, but the reasons remain unknown due to the lack of genomic epidemiology research. A previous study suggested that carbapenem resistance genes, such as the carbapenemase gene blaNDM, spread via plasmids among Enterobacterales in Vietnam. In this study, we characterized blaNDM-carrying plasmids in Enterobacterales isolated in Vietnam, and identified several possible cases of horizontal transfer of plasmids both within and among species of bacteria. Twenty-five carbapenem-nonsusceptible isolates from a medical institution in Hanoi were sequenced on Illumina short-read sequencers, and 13 blaNDM-positive isolates, including isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, and Proteus mirabilis, were further sequenced on an Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencer to obtain complete plasmid sequences. Almost identical 73 kb IncFII(pSE11)::IncN hybrid plasmids carrying blaNDM-1 were found in a P. mirabilis isolate and an M. morganii isolate. A 112 kb IncFII(pRSB107)::IncN hybrid plasmid carrying blaNDM-1 in an E. coli isolate had partially identical sequences with a 39 kb IncR plasmid carrying blaNDM-1 and an 88 kb IncFII(pHN7A8)::IncN hybrid plasmid in a C. freundii isolate. 148-149 kb IncFIA(Hl1)::IncA/C2 plasmids and 75-76 kb IncFII(Yp) plasmids, both carrying blaNDM-1 were shared among three sequence type 11 (ST11) isolates and three ST395 isolates of K. pneumoniae, respectively. Most of the plasmids co-carried genes conferring resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials, including third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, in addition to blaNDM-1. These results provide insight into the genetic basis of CRE in Vietnam, and could help control nosocomial infections.",

    "abstract": "Influenza is one of the most widespread viral infections worldwide and represents a major public health problem. The risk that one of the next pandemics is caused by an influenza strain is very high. It is very important to develop broad-spectrum influenza antivirals to be ready for any possible vaccine shortcomings. Anti-influenza drugs are available but they are far from ideal. Arguably, an ideal antiviral should target conserved viral domains and be virucidal, i.e. irreversibly inhibit viral infectivity. Here, we describe a new class of broad-spectrum anti-influenza macromolecules that meets these criteria and displays exceedingly low toxicity. These compounds are based on a cyclodextrin core modified on its primary face with long hydrophobic linkers terminated in 6sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine (6SLN) or 3SLN. SLN enables nanomolar inhibition of the viruses while the hydrophobic linkers confer irreversibility to the inhibition. The combination of these two properties allows for efficacy in vitro against several human or avian influenza strains, as well as against a 2009 pandemic influenza strain ex vivo. Importantly, we show that, in mice, the compounds provide therapeutic efficacy when administered 24h post-infection allowing 90% survival as opposed to no survival for the placebo and oseltamivir..",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic plant-pollinator interactions are critical for the functioning of both non-managed and agricultural systems. Mathematical models of plant-pollinator interactions can help understand key determinants in pollination success. However, most previous models have not addressed pollinator behavior and plant biology combined. Information generated from such a model can inform optimal design of crop orchards and effective utilization of managed pollinators like honey bees, and help generate hypotheses about the effects of management practices and cultivar selection. We expect that honey bee density per flower and male to female flower ratio will influence fruit yield. To test the relative importance of these effects, both singly and simultaneously, we utilized a delay differential equation model combined with Latin hypercube sampling for sensitivity analysis. Empirical data obtained from historical records and collected in kiwifruit orchards in New Zealand were used to parameterize the model. We found that, at realistic bee densities, the optimal orchard had 65-75% female flowers, and the most benefit was gained from the first 6-8 bees/1000 flowers, with diminishing returns thereafter. While bee density significantly impacted fruit production, plant-based parameters-flower density and male:female flower ratio-were the most influential. The predictive model provides strategies for improving crop management.",
