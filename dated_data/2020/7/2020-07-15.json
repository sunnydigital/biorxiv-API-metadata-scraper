    "abstract": "The design and implementation of Boolean logic functions in living cells has become a very active field within synthetic biology. By controlling networks of regulatory proteins, novel genetic circuits are engineered to generate predefined output responses. Although many current implementations focus solely on the genetic components of the circuit, the host context in which the circuit performs is crucial for its outcome. Here, we characterise 20 genetic NOT logic gates (inverters) in up to 7 bacterial-based contexts each, to finally generate 135 different functions. The contexts we focus on are particular combinations of four plasmid backbones and three hosts, two Escherichia coli and one Pseudomonas putida strains. Each NOT logic gate shows seven different logic behaviours, depending on the context. That is, gates can be reconfigured to fit response requirements by changing only contextual parameters. Computational analysis shows that this range of behaviours improves the compatibility between gates, because there are considerably more possibilities for combination than when considering a unique function per genetic construct. Finally, we address the issue of interoperability and portability by measuring, scoring, and comparing gate performance across contexts. Rather than being a limitation, we argue that the effect of the genetic background on synthetic constructs expand the scope of the functions that can be engineered in complex cellular environments, and advocate for considering context as a fundamental design parameter for synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "Ras dimerization is critical for Raf activation, yet Ras alone does not dimerize. Here we show that the Ras binding domain of Raf (Raf-RBD) induces robust Ras dimerization at low surface densities on supported lipid bilayers and, to a lesser extent, in solution as observed by size exclusion chromatography and confirmed by SAXS. Community network analysis based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show robust allosteric connections linking the two Raf-RBD D113 residues, located in the Galectin scaffold protein binding site of each Raf-RBD molecule and 85 [A] apart on opposite ends of the dimer complex. Our results suggest that Raf-RBD binding and Ras dimerization are concerted events that lead to a high-affinity signaling complex at the membrane that we propose is an essential unit in the macromolecular assembly of higher order Ras/Raf/Galectin complexes important for signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.",

To enhance their usage, we reanalyzed whole exome sequencing data published for 601 dogs with mammary cancer, osteosarcoma, oral melanoma, lymphoma, glioma or hemangiosarcoma from over 35 breeds, after rigorous quality control, including breed validation. Each cancer type harbors distinct molecular features, with major pathway alterations matching its human counterpart (e.g., PI3K for mammary cancer and p53 for osteosarcoma). On average, mammary cancer and glioma have lower mutation rates (median <0.5 mutation per Mb), whereas oral melanoma, osteosarcoma and hemangiosarcoma have higher mutation rates (median [&ge;]1 mutation per Mb). Across cancer types and across breeds, the mutation rate is strongly associated with TP53 mutation, but not with PIK3CA mutation. The mutation rate is also associated with a mutation signature enriched in osteosarcoma of Golden Retrievers, independent of TP53 mutation. Finally, compared to other breeds examined, DNA repair genes appear to be less conserved in Golden Retriever which is predisposed to numerous cancers.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria are the most abundant and metabolically diverse cellular lifeforms on Earth. A rooted bacterial phylogeny provides a framework to interpret this diversity and to understand the nature of early life. Inferring the position of the bacterial root is complicated by incomplete taxon sampling and the long branch to the archaeal outgroup. To circumvent these limitations, we model bacterial genome evolution at the level of gene duplication, transfer and loss events, allowing outgroup-free inference of the root1. We infer a rooted bacterial tree on which 68% of gene transmission events are vertical. Our analyses reveal a basal split between Terrabacteria and Gracilicutes, which together encompass almost all known bacterial diversity. However, the position of one phylum, Fusobacteriota, could not be resolved in relation to these two major clades. In contrast to recent proposals, our analyses strongly reject a root between the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) and all other Bacteria. Instead, we find that the CPR is a sister lineage to the Chloroflexota within the Terrabacteria. We predict that the last bacterial common ancestor was a free-living flagellated, rod-shaped cell featuring a double membrane with a lipopolysaccharide outer layer, a Type III CRISPR-Cas system, Type IV pili, and the ability to sense and respond via chemotaxis.",

We present a method for determining the posterior probability distribution of IBD segment endpoints. Our approach accounts for genotype errors, recent mutations, and gene conversions which disrupt DNA sequence identity within IBD segments. We find that our methods estimates of uncertainty are well calibrated for homogeneous samples. We quantify endpoint uncertainty for 7.7 billion IBD segments from 408,883 individuals of White British ancestry in the UK Biobank, and use these IBD segments to find regions showing evidence of recent natural selection. We show that many spurious selection signals are eliminated by the use of unbiased estimates of IBD segment endpoints and a pedigree-based genetic map. Nine of the top ten regions with the greatest evidence for recent selection in our scan have been identified as selected in previous analyses using different approaches. Our computationally efficient method for quantifying IBD segment endpoint uncertainty is implemented in the open source ibd-ends software package.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundsSevoflurane is a most frequently used volatile anaesthetics, but its molecular mechanisms of action remain unclear. We hypothesized that specific genes play regulatory roles in whole brain exposed to sevoflurane. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effects of sevoflurane inhalation and identify potential regulatory genes by RNA-seq analysis.\n\nMethodsEight-week old mice were exposed to sevoflurane. RNA from four medial prefrontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus were analysed using RNA-seq. Differently expressed genes were extracted. Their gene ontology terms and the transcriptome array data of the cerebral cortex of sleeping mice were analysed using Metascape, and the gene expression patterns were compared. Finally, the activities of transcription factors were evaluated using a weighted parametric gene set analysis (wPGSA). JASPAR was used to confirm the existence of binding motifs in the upstream sequences of the differently expressed genes.\n\nResultsThe gene ontology term enrichment analysis result suggests that sevoflurane inhalation upregulated angiogenesis and downregulated neural differentiation in the whole brain. The comparison with the brains of sleeping mice showed that the gene expression changes were specific to anaesthetized mice. Sevoflurane induced Klf4 upregulation in the whole brain. The transcriptional analysis result suggests that KLF4 is a potential transcriptional regulator of angiogenesis and neural development.\n\nConclusionsKlf4 was upregulated by sevoflurane inhalation in whole brain. KLF4 might promote angiogenesis and cause the appearance of undifferentiated neural cells by transcriptional regulation. The roles of KLF4 might be key to elucidating the mechanisms of sevoflurane induced functional modification in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Modern electrophysiological recordings simultaneously capture single-unit spiking activities of hundreds of neurons spread across large cortical distances. Yet this massively parallel activity is often confined to relatively low-dimensional manifolds. This implies strong coordination also among neurons that are most likely not even connected. Here, we combine in vivo recordings with network models and theory to characterize the nature of mesoscopic coordination patterns in macaque motor cortex and to expose their origin: We find that heterogeneity in local connectivity supports network states with complex long-range cooperation between neurons that arises from multi-synaptic, short-range connections. Our theory explains the experimentally observed spatial organization of covariances in resting state recordings as well as the behaviorally related modulation of covariance patterns during a reach-to-grasp task. The ubiquity of heterogeneity in local cortical circuits suggests that the brain uses the described mechanism to flexibly adapt neuronal coordination to momentary demands.",

The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which neurons and astrocytes communicate and coordinate are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that the canonical Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway is active in cortical astrocytes, where it acts to coordinate layer-specific synaptic connectivity and functional circuit development. We show that Ptch1 is a Shh receptor that is expressed by cortical astrocytes during development and that Shh signaling is necessary and sufficient to promote the expression of layer-specific astrocyte genes involved in regulating synapse formation and function. Loss of Shh in layer V neurons reduces astrocyte complexity and coverage by astrocytic processes in tripartite synapses, moreover, cell-autonomous activation of Shh signaling in astrocytes promotes cortical excitatory synapse formation. Together, these results suggest that Shh secreted from deep layer cortical neurons acts to specialize the molecular and functional features of astrocytes during development to shape circuit assembly and function.",

We studied the influence of allocentric coordinates on ongoing reaching movements, which has been reported to strongly affect the reaching movements of typically developing (TD) individuals. ASD and TD participants observed a target presented randomly on one of the four corners of a frame on a screen. After it disappeared, another frame was presented slightly shifted leftward/rightward. The participants touched the memorized position of the target relatively congruent with a reference frame (allocentric condition) or ignoring it (egocentric condition). Results suggested that touch positions were less affected by shift directions of reference frame in the allocentric condition in ASD participants, so that they tended to reach in egocentric manner. Our findings demonstrate that decreased utilization of visual landmarks in ongoing movement may underlie motor disabilities in autism.",

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed by brain capillary endothelial cells (BECs) supported by pericytes and astrocytes. The BBB maintains homeostasis and protects the brain against toxic substances circulating in the blood, which consequently means that only a few drugs can pass the BBB. Thus for drug screening, understanding cell interactions, and pathology, in vitro BBB models have been developed using BECs from various animal sources. When comparing models of different species, differences exist especially in regards to the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). Thus, in the present study, we compared primary mice, rat, and porcine BECs (mBECs, rBECs, and pBECs) cultured in mono- and co-culture with astrocytes, to identify potential species-dependent differences that could explain the variations in TEER and aid to the selection of models for future in vitro BBB studies.\n\nThe in vitro BBB models based on primary mBECs, rBECs, and pBECs were evaluated and compared in regards to major BBB characteristics. The barrier integrity was evaluated by the expression of tight junction proteins and measurements of TEER and apparent permeability (Papp). Furthermore, the cell size, the functionality of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter, and the expression of the transferrin receptor were evaluated and compared.\n\npBECs exhibit the highest TEER followed by rBECs and mBECs, but surprisingly the Papp was not that different, which might be explained by a significantly larger cell size of pBECs than rBECs and mBECs. The expression and organization of many tight junction proteins were in all three species influenced by co-culturing, which supports the findings that the TEER increases after co-culturing with astrocytes. Furthermore, all models had functional polarised P-gp efflux transporters and expressed the transferrin receptor. In conclusion, the choice of species for in vitro BBB modeling should be based on the purpose of the study.",

    "abstract": "AbstractsAuditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are one of the most pronounced symptoms that manifest the underlying mechanisms of deficits in schizophrenia. Cognitive models postulate that malfunctioned source monitoring incorrectly weights the top-down prediction and bottom-up sensory processing and causes hallucinations. Here, we investigate the featural-temporal characteristics of source monitoring in AVHs. Schizophrenia patients with and without AVHs, and healthy controls identified target tones in noise at the end of tone sequences. Predictions of different timescales were manipulated by either an alternating pattern in the preceding tone sequences, or a repetition between the target tone and the tone immediately before. The sensitivity index, d, was obtained to assess the modulation of predictions on tone identification. We found that patients with AVHs showed higher d when the target tones conformed to the long-term regularity of alternating pattern in the preceding tone sequence than that when the targets were inconsistent with the pattern. Whereas, the short-term regularity of repetitions modulated the tone identification in patients without AVHs. Predictions did not influence tone identification in healthy controls. These findings suggest that malfunctioned source monitoring in AVHs heavily weights predictions to form incorrect perception. The weighting function in source monitoring can extend to the process of basic tonal features, and predictions at multiple timescales differentially modulate perception in different clinical populations. These collaboratively reveal the featural and temporal characteristics of weighting function in source monitoring of AVHs and suggest that the malfunctioned interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes might underlie the development of auditory hallucinations.\n\nHighlightsMalfunctioned source monitoring incorrectly weights the top-down prediction and bottom-up sensory processing underlie pathogenesis of auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia.\n\nThe weighting function in top-down predictions and bottom-up sensory processing can extend to tonal features.\n\nPredictions at multiple timescales differentially modulate perception in different clinical schizophrenia populations.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the neurotoxic effects of a mixture of two co-occurring cyanotoxins, {beta}-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) and microcystin leucine and arginine (MCLR), using the larval zebrafish model. We combined high-throughput behavior based toxicity assays with discovery proteomic techniques to identify behavioral and molecular changes following 6 days of exposure. While neither toxin caused mortality, morphological defects, or altered general locomotor behavior in zebrafish larvae, both toxins increased acoustic startle sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner by at least 40% (p<0.0001). Furthermore, startle sensitivity was enhanced by an additional 40% in larvae exposed to the BMAA/MCLR mixture relative to those exposed to the individual toxins. Supporting these behavioral results, our proteomic analysis revealed a 4-fold increase in the number of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the mixture exposed group. Additionally, prediction analysis reveals activation and/or inhibition of 8 enriched canonical pathways (enrichment p-value<0.01; z-score[&ge;]|2|), including ILK, Rho Family GTPase, RhoGDI, and calcium signaling pathways, which have been implicated in neurodegeneration. We also found that expression of TDP-43, of which cytoplasmic aggregates are a hallmark of ALS pathology, was significantly upregulated by 5.7-fold following BMAA/MCLR mixture exposure. Together, our results emphasize the importance of including mixtures of cyanotoxins when investigating the link between environmental cyanotoxins and neurodegeneration as we reveal that BMAA and MCLR interact in vivo to enhance neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLocal envenomation following snakebites is accompanied by thermal changes, which could be visualized using infrared imaging. We explored whether infrared thermal imaging could be used to differentiate venomous snakebites from non-venomous and dry bites.\n\nMethodsWe prospectively enrolled adult patients with a history of snakebite in the past 24 hours presenting to the emergency of a teaching hospital in southern India. A standardized clinical evaluation for symptoms and signs of envenomation including 20-minute whole-blood clotting test and prothrombin time was performed to assess envenomation status. Infrared thermal imaging was done at enrolment, 6 hours, and 24 hours using a smartphone-based device under ambient conditions. Processed infrared thermal images were independently interpreted twice by a reference rater and once by three novice raters.\n\nFindingsWe studied 89 patients; 60 (67%) of them were male. Median (IQR) time from bite to enrolment was 11 (6.5--15) hours; 21 (24%) patients were enrolled within 6 hours of snakebite. In all, 48 patients had local envenomation with/without systemic envenomation, and 35 patients were classified as non-venomous/dry bites. Envenomation status was unclear in six patients. At enrolment, area of increased temperature around the bite site (Hot spot) was evident on infrared thermal imaging in 45 of the 48 patients with envenomation, while hot spot was evident in only 6 of the 35 patients without envenomation. Presence of hot spot on baseline infrared thermal images had a sensitivity of 93.7% (95% CI 82.8% to 98.7%) and a specificity of 82.9% (66.3% to 93.4%) to differentiate envenomed patients from those without envenomation. Interrater agreement for identifying hot spots was more than substantial (Kappa statistic >0.85), and intrarater agreement was almost perfect (Kappa = 0.93). Paradoxical thermal changes were observed in 14 patients.\n\nConclusionsPoint-of-care infrared thermal imaging could be useful in the early identification of non-venomous and dry snakebites.\n\nAuthor summaryMost poisonous snakebites cause swelling of the bitten body part within a few hours if venom had been injected. Usually, health care providers diagnose poisonous snakebites by doing a clinical examination and by testing for incoagulable blood. If no abnormalities are found, then the snakebite is diagnosed as a non-poisonous bite or a dry bite. Swelling of the bitten body part results from venom-induced inflammation and is accompanied by local increase in skin temperature. It is possible to capture visual images of these temperature changes by using infrared imaging, the same technology used in night vision cameras. This study found that most persons with poisonous snakebites had hot areas on infrared images while such changes were observed in only a few persons with non-poisonous or dry snakebites. This new knowledge could help doctors identify non-poisonous and dry snakebites early.",

    "abstract": "Passion fruit (Passiflora edulia Sims), an important tropical and sub-tropical species, is classified as a respiration climacteric fruit, the quality deteriorates rapidly after harvest. To reveal the mechanisms involved in ripening and rapidly fruit senescence, the phytochemical characteristics and RNA sequencing were conducted in the purple passion fruits with different (1-MCP and PF) treatment. Comprehensive functional annotation and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the starch and sucrose metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonid biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis were involved in fruit ripening. Applying with PF and 1-MCP significantly affected transcript levels of passion fruit after harvest storage. A large number of differently expressed unigenes (DEGs) were identified significantly enrichen in starch and sucrose metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis at postharvest stage. The preservative film (PF) and 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) treatments increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) gene expression and enzyme activities, accelerated the lignin accumulation, decline {beta}-galactosidase ({beta}-Gal), polygalacturonase (PG) and cellulose activities and gene expression to delay cell wall degradation during fruit senescence. The RNA sequencing data of cell wall metabolism and hormone signal transduction pathway related unigenes were verified by RT-qPCR. The results indicated that the cell wall metabolism and hormone signal pathways were notably related to passion fruit ripening. PF and 1-MCP treatment might inhibited ethylene signaling and regulated cell wall metabolism pathways to inhibited cell wall degradation. Our results reveal ripening and senescence related networks during passion fruit ripening, which can provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying PF and 1-MCP treatment on fruit ripening.",

    "abstract": "Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins, also known as Siglecs, have recently been designated as glyco-immune checkpoints. Through their interactions with sialylated glycan epitopes overexpressed on tumor cells, inhibitory Siglecs on innate and adaptive immune cells modulate signaling cascades to restrain anti-tumor immune responses. However, the mechanisms underlying these processes are just starting to be elucidated. We discover that when human natural killer (NK) cells attack tumor cells, glycan remodeling occurs on the target cells at the immunological synapse. This remodeling occurs through both transfer of sialylated glycans from NK cells to target tumor cells and accelerated de novo synthesis of sialosides on the tumor cell themselves. The functionalization of NK cells with a high-affinity ligand of Siglec-7 leads to multifaceted consequences in modulating Siglec-7-regulated NK-activation. At high levels, the added Siglec-7 ligand suppresses NK-cytotoxicity through the recruitment of Siglec-7, whereas at low levels the same ligand triggers the release of Siglec-7 from the cell surface into the culture medium, preventing Siglec-7-mediated inhibition of NK cytotoxicity. These results suggest that glycan engineering of NK cells may provide a means to boost NK effector functions.",

Through their high spatio-temporal habitat diversity, floodplains are highly productive ecosystems, supporting communities that are naturally resilient and highly diverse. We examined linkages among floodplain wetland habitats, invertebrate communities and their associated traits, and ecosystem function across 60 sites within the floodplain wetlands of the lower Wolastoq | Saint John River, New Brunswick, using structural equation modelling and Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN2). We identified key environmental filters of invertebrate communities, namely linking increased niche differentiation through historical change, flood pulse dynamics, and macrophyte bed complexity with increased taxa and functional diversity. Examination of traits linked to ecosystem functions revealed that healthy wetlands with higher primary productivity were associated with greater functional evenness and richness, while habitat patches with increased decomposition rates had low functional richness, reflecting highly disturbed habitat. Our results highlight key differences between wetland and riverine ecosystems, relating to how critical functions support healthy wetland habitats by providing increased resilience to disturbance, here associated with differing levels of conservation protection.",

    "abstract": "With continued expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic, antiviral drugs are desperately needed to treat patients at high risk of life-threatening disease and even to limit spread if administered early during infection. Typically, the fastest route to identifying and licensing a safe and effective antiviral drug is to test those already shown safe in early clinical trials for other infections or diseases. Here, we tested in vitro oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to have inhibitory activity against several viruses. Using Vero cells, we found that prophylactic oleandrin administration at concentrations down to 0.05 g/ml exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, with an 800-fold reduction in virus production, and a 0.1 g/ml dose resulted in a greater than 3,000-fold reduction in infectious virus production. The EC50 values were 11.98ng/ml when virus output was measured at 24 hours post-infection, and 7.07ng/ml measured at 48 hours post-infection. Therapeutic (post-infection) treatment up to 24 hours after infection of Vero cells also reduced viral titers, with the 0.1 g/ml dose causing greater than 100-fold reductions as measured at 48 hours, and the 0.05 g/ml dose resulting in a 78-fold reduction. The potent prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activities demonstrated here strongly support the further development of oleandrin to reduce the severity of COVID-19 and potentially also to reduce spread by persons diagnosed early after infection.\n\nIMPORTANCECOVID-19, a pandemic disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has swept around the world to cause millions of infections and hundreds-of-thousands of deaths due to the lack of vaccines and effective therapeutics. We tested oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to reduce the replication of several viruses, against SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells. When administered both before and after virus infection, nanogram doses of oleandrin significantly inhibited replication by up to 3,000-fold, indicating the potential to prevent disease and virus spread in persons recently exposed to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to prevent severe disease in persons at high risk. These results indicate that oleandrin should be tested in animal models and in humans exposed to infection to determine its medical usefulness in controlling the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Oxidized cholesterols have emerged as important signaling molecules of immune function, but little is known about the role of these oxysterols during mycobacterial infections. We found that expression of the oxysterol-receptor GPR183 was reduced in blood from patients with tuberculosis (TB) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to TB patients without T2D and was associated with TB disease severity on chest x-ray. GPR183 activation by 7,25-hydroxycholesterol (7,25-OHC) reduced growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and Mycobacterium bovis BCG in primary human monocytes, an effect abrogated by the GPR183 antagonist GSK682753. Growth inhibition was associated with reduced IFN-{beta} and IL-10 expression and enhanced autophagy. Mice lacking GPR183 had significantly increased lung Mtb burden and dysregulated IFNs during early infection. Together, our data demonstrate that GPR183 is an important regulator of intracellular mycobacterial growth and interferons during mycobacterial infection.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/203398v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@76c86dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@60a3bcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9dc233org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@138db01_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "When performing a long chain of actions in rapid sequence, future movements need to be planned concurrently with ongoing action. However, how far ahead we plan, and whether this ability improves with practice, is currently unknown. Here we designed an experiment in which healthy volunteers produced sequences of 14 finger presses quickly and accurately on a keyboard in response to numerical stimuli. On every trial, participants were only shown a fixed number of stimuli ahead of the current keypress. The size of this viewing window varied between 1 (next digit revealed with the pressing of the current key) and 14 (full view of the sequence). Participants practiced the task for five days and their performance was continuously assessed on random sequences. Our results indicate that participants used the available visual information to plan multiple actions into the future, but that the planning horizon was limited: receiving information about more than 3 movements ahead did not result in faster sequence production. Over the course of practice, we found larger performance improvements for larger viewing windows and an expansion of the planning horizon. These findings suggest that the ability to plan future responses during ongoing movement constitutes an important aspect of skillful movement. Based on the results, we propose a framework to investigate the neuronal processes underlying simultaneous planning and execution.\n\nSignificance StatementAlthough skill learning has typically focused on the training of specific movement sequences, practice improves performance even for random sequences. Here we hypothesize that a fundamental aspect of skilled sequential behavior is the ability to plan multiple actions into the future, both before and during execution. By controlling the amount of visual information available for motor planning, we show that people plan at least three movements beyond current action and that this planning horizon expands with practice. Our findings suggest that coordinating ongoing movement and planning of future actions is an essential component of skilled sequential behavior and offer testable predictions for the neural implementation of online motor planning.",

    "abstract": "Variability in functional brain network connectivity has been linked to individual differences in cognitive, affective, and behavioral traits in adults. However, little is known about the developmental origins of such brain-behavior correlations. The current study examined functional brain network connectivity and its link to behavioral temperament in newborn and 1-month-old infants (M [age] = 25 days; N = 75) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Specifically, we measured long-range connectivity between cortical regions approximating fronto-parietal, default mode, and homologous-interhemispheric networks. Our results show that connectivity in these functional brain networks varies across infants and maps onto individual differences in behavioral temperament. Specifically, connectivity in the fronto-parietal network was positively associated with regulation and orienting behaviors, whereas connectivity in the default mode network showed the opposite effect on these behaviors. Our analysis also revealed a significant positive association between the homologous-interhemispheric network and infants negative affect. The current results suggest that variability in long-range intra-hemispheric and cross-hemispheric functional connectivity between frontal, parietal and temporal cortex is associated with individual differences in affect and behavior. These findings shed new light on the brain origins of individual differences in early-emerging behavioral traits and thus represent a viable novel approach for investigating developmental trajectories in typical and atypical neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "The heterogeneity of fibroblasts in the murine and human lung during homeostasis and disease is increasingly recognized. It remains unclear if the different phenotypes identified to date are characteristic of unique subpopulations with unique progenitors or whether they arise by a process of differentiation from common precursors. Our understanding of this ubiquitous cell type is limited by an absence of well validated, specific, markers with which to identify each cell type and a clear consensus on the distinct populations present in the lung. Here we describe single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on mesenchymal cells from the murine lung throughout embryonic (E) development (E9.5 - 17.5), at post-natal day (P1 - 15), as well as in the adult and the aged murine lungs before and after bleomycin-induced fibrosis. We carried out complementary scRNA-seq on human lung tissue from a P1 lung, a month 21 lung and lung tissue from healthy donors and patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The murine and human data were supplemented with publicly available scRNA-seq datasets. We consistently identified lipofibroblasts, myofibroblasts, pericytes, mesothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. In addition, we identified a novel population delineated by Ebf1 (early B-cell factor 1) expression and an intermediate subtype. Comparative analysis with human mesenchymal cells revealed homologous mesenchymal subpopulations with remarkably conserved transcriptomic signatures. Comparative analysis of changes in gene expression in the fibroblast subpopulations from age matched non-fibrotic and fibrotic lungs in the mouse and human demonstrates that many of these subsets contribute to matrix gene expression in fibrotic conditions. Subtype selective transcription factors were identified and putative divergence of the clusters during development were delineated. Prospective isolation of these fibroblast subpopulations, localization of signature gene markers, and lineage-tracing each cluster are under way in the laboratory. This analysis will enhance our understanding of fibroblast heterogeneity in homeostasis and fibrotic disease conditions.",

    "abstract": "The dietary supplement industry is a growing enterprise, valued at over $100 billion by 2025 yet, a recent study revealed that up to 60% of herbal supplements may have substituted ingredients not listed on their labels, some with harmful contaminants. Substituted ingredients make rigorous quality control testing a necessary aspect in the production of supplements. Traditionally, species have been verified morphologically or biochemically, but this is not possible for all species if the identifying characteristics are lost in the processing of the material. One approach to validating plant and fungal ingredients in herbal supplements is through DNA barcoding complemented with a molecular phylogenetic analysis. This method provides an efficient, objective, rigorous and repeatable method for species identification. We employed a molecular phylogenetic analysis for species authentication of the commonly used fungal supplement, reishi (Ganoderma lingzhi), by amplifying and sequencing the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) with genus-specific primers. PCR of six powdered samples and one dried sample sold as G. lucidum representing independent suppliers produced single, strong amplification products in the expected size-range for Ganoderma. Both best-hit BLAST and molecular phylogenetic analyses using a reference panel assembled from Genbank clearly identified the predominant fungal DNA was G. lingzhi in all seven herbal supplements. We detected variation in ITS among our samples, but all samples still fall within a large clade of G. lingzhi. ITS is a successful and cost-effective method for DNA-based species authentication that could be used in the herbal supplement industry for this and other fungal and plant species that are otherwise difficult to identify.",

Drosophila is a well-established model for defining mechanisms that drive ZGA. Zelda (ZLD) is a key pioneer transcription factor (TF) that promotes ZGA in the Drosophila embryo. However, many genomic loci that contain GA-rich motifs become accessible during ZGA independent of ZLD. Therefore, we hypothesized that other early TFs that function with ZLD have not yet been identified, especially those that are capable of binding to GA-rich motifs such as CLAMP. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila embryonic development requires maternal CLAMP to: 1) activate zygotic transcription; 2) increase chromatin accessibility at promoters of specific genes that often encode other essential TFs; 3) enhance chromatin accessibility to facilitate ZLD occupancy at a subset of key embryonic promoters. Thus, maternal CLAMP functions with ZLD in a pioneer-like role to drive zygotic genome activation.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infections pose a global threat to human health and an unprecedented research challenge. Among the most urgent tasks is obtaining a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions that facilitate viral replication or contribute to host defense mechanisms in infected cells. While SARS-CoV-2 co-opts cellular factors for viral translation and genome replication, a comprehensive map of the host cell proteome in direct contact with viral RNA has not been elucidated. Here, we use RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) to obtain an unbiased and quantitative picture of the human proteome that directly binds the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells. We discover known host factors required for coronavirus replication, regulators of RNA metabolism and host defense pathways, along with dozens of potential drug targets among direct SARS-CoV-2 binders. We further integrate the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome with proteome dynamics induced by viral infection, linking interactome proteins to the emerging biology of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Validating RAP-MS, we show that CNBP, a regulator of proinflammatory cytokines, directly engages the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Supporting the functional relevance of identified interactors, we show that the interferon-induced protein RYDEN suppresses SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal frameshifting and demonstrate that inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-bound proteins is sufficient to manipulate viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome provides an unprecedented molecular perspective on SARS-CoV-2 infections and enables the systematic dissection of host dependency factors and host defense strategies, a crucial prerequisite for designing novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Vaccinia virus (VACV) is a prototypical poxvirus originally used for eradication of smallpox. Investigation into VACV mRNAs carried out almost half a century ago substantially contributed to the fundamental discovery of the 5 mRNA cap, a hallmark of all eukaryotic and many viral mRNAs. VACV research also facilitated the identification and understanding of the general mechanism of 5 mRNA cap synthesis. We characterized the VACV transcripts at the individual mRNA molecule level and found that vaccinia postreplicative mRNAs, containing nontemplated 5 poly(A) leaders, surprisingly lack the 5 cap structure in vivo. We also show that the lengths of the nontemplated leaders and the presence or absence of cap structures at the 5 mRNA ends are controlled by the initiator sequence of the VACV postreplicative promoters.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe promoter sequence determines the synthesis of the 5 cap and poly(A) leaders in vaccinia virus postreplicative mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "The protein K-Ras functions as a molecular switch in signaling pathways regulating cell growth. In the MAPK pathway, which is implicated in many cancers, multiple K-Ras proteins are thought to assemble at the cell membrane with Ras-effector proteins from the Raf family. Here we propose an atomistic structural model for such an assembly. Our starting point was an asymmetric, GTP-mediated K-Ras dimer model, which we generated using unbiased molecular dynamics simulations and verified with mutagenesis experiments. Adding further K-Ras monomers in a head-to-tail fashion led to a compact helical assembly, a model we validated using electron microscopy and cell-based experiments. This assembly stabilizes K-Ras in its active state and presents composite interfaces to facilitate Raf binding. Guided by existing experimental data, we then positioned C-Raf, the downstream kinase MEK1, and accessory proteins (Galectin-3 and 14-3-3{sigma}) on the helical assembly. The resulting Ras-Raf signalosome model offers an explanation for a large body of data on MAPK signaling.",
