    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are related conditions that are associated with cholinergic system dysfunction. Dysfunction of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM), a basal forebrain structure that provides the dominant source of cortical cholinergic innervation, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both PDD and DLB. Here we leverage the temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) with the spatial resolution of MRI tractography in order to explore the intersection of functional and structural connectivity of the NBM in a unique cohort of PDD and DLB patients undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of this structure. We observe that NBM-cortical structural and functional connectivity correlate within spatially and spectrally segregated networks including: 1) a beta band network to supplementary motor area (SMA), where activity in the SMA was found to drive activity in the NBM, 2) a delta/theta band network to medial temporal lobe structures encompassing the parahippocampal gyrus and 3) a delta/theta band network to visual areas including lingual gyrus. These findings reveal functional networks of the NBM that are likely to subserve important roles in motor control, memory and visual function respectively. Furthermore, they motivate future studies aimed at disentangling network contribution to disease phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Gibberellins (GAs) are growth-promoting hormones that regulate organ growth, mainly via cell elongation. Contradicting reports leave an open question of whether GA is as important for root elongation as it is for stem elongation.\n\nHere we have addressed this question focusing on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) primary-root elongation. We used a combination of physiological, molecular and genetic approaches to tackle this question.\n\nTomato has three GA receptors; GID1a, GID1b1 and GID1b2. The loss of all three receptors, strongly suppressed stem elongation and leaf expansion, but had a relatively minor effect on primary root elongation. The effect of GA on cell elongation and gene-expression was much weaker in roots, than in shoots, reaching saturation at lower hormone concentrations. Our results imply that this differential response to GA in shoots and roots is caused by the lower expression of the dominant GA receptor GID1a in roots.\n\nWe show that the differential activity of GA between shoots and roots affects root-to-shoot ratio, and speculate that this evolved as an adaptive mechanism to changing environments.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptional response in Vero cells (ATCC(R) CCL-81) infected with the coronavirus Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) was measured by RNAseq analysis 4 and 6 hours after infection. Differential expressed genes (DEGs) in PEDV infected cells were compared to DEGs responding in Vero cells infected with Mammalian Orthoreovirus (MRV). Functional analysis of MRV and PEDV DEGs showed that MRV increased the expression level of several cytokines and chemokines (e.g. IL6, CXCL10, IL1A, CXCL8 [alias IL8]) and antiviral genes (e.g. IFI44, IFIT1, MX1, OASL), whereas for PEDV no enhanced expression was observed for these \"hallmark\" antiviral and immune effector genes. Pathway and Gene Ontology \"enrichment analysis\" revealed that PEDV infection did not stimulate expression of genes able to activate an acquired immune response, whereas MRV did so within 6h. Instead, PEDV down-regulated the expression of a set of zinc finger proteins with putative antiviral activity and enhanced the expression of the transmembrane serine protease gene TMPRSS13 (alias MSPL) to support its own infection by virus-cell membrane fusion (Shi et al, 2017, Viruses, 9(5):114). PEDV also down-regulated expression of Ectodysplasin A, a cytokine of the TNF-family able to activate the canonical NFKB-pathway responsible for transcription of inflammatory genes like IL1B, TNF, CXCL8 and PTGS2. The only 2 cytokine genes found up-regulated by PEDV were Cardiotrophin-1, an IL6-type cytokine with pleiotropic functions on different tissues and types of cells, and Endothelin 2, a neuroactive peptide with vasoconstrictive properties. Furthermore, by comprehensive datamining in biological and chemical databases and consulting related literature we identified sets of PEDV-response genes with potential to influence i) the metabolism of biogenic amines (e.g. histamine), ii) the formation of cilia and \"synaptic clefts\" between cells, iii) epithelial mucus production, iv) platelets activation, and v) physiological processes in the body regulated by androgenic hormones (like blood pressure, salt/water balance and energy homeostasis). The information in this study describing a \"very early\" response of epithelial cells to an infection with a coronavirus may provide pharmacologists, immunological and medical specialists additional insights in the underlying mechanisms of coronavirus associated severe clinical symptoms including those induced by SARS-CoV-2. This may help them to fine-tune therapeutic treatments and apply specific approved drugs to treat COVID-19 patients.",

The present study fills the vacuum and does mutational analysis of genomic sequence of Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Results reveal the existence of non-synonymous G614 spike protein mutation in 61.45% of the total study genome along with three other mutations. Further, temporal variation in the frequencies of G614 genotype in the country is observed. The examination of the probable association of G614 genotype with COVID-19 severity shows that CFR G614 genotype in India is positively and strongly correlated. It appears that the clinical outcome of the COVID-19 cases in India are significantly and adversely affected by the increasing trend in the G614 genotype; which needs to be addressed combining both laboratory experiments and epidemiological investigations.",

    "abstract": "Prevailing pandemic across the world due to SARSCoV-2 drawing great attention towards discovering its evolutionary origin. We perform an exploratory study to understand the variability of the whole coding region of possible proximal evolutionary neighbours of SARSCoV-2. We consider seven (07) human coronavirus strains from six different species as a candidate for our study.\n\nFirst, we observe a good variability of nucleotides across candidate strains. We did not find a significant variation of GC content across the strains for codon position first and second. However, we interestingly see huge variability of GC-content in codon position 3rd (GC3), and pairwise mean GC-content (SARSCoV, MERSCoV), and (SARSCoV-2, hCoV229E) are quite closer. While observing the relative abundance of dinucleotide feature, we find a shared typical genetic pattern, i.e., high usage of GC and CT nucleotide pair at the first two positions (P12) of codons and the last two positions (P23) of codons, respectively. We also observe a low abundance of CG pair that might help in their evolution bio-process. Secondly, Considering RSCU score, we find a substantial similarity for mild class coronaviruses, i.e., hCoVOC43, hCoVHKU1, and hCoVNL63 based on their codon hit with high RSCU value ([&ge;] 1.5), and minim number of codons hit (count-9) is observed for MERSCoV. We see seven codons ATT, ACT, TCT, CCT, GTT, GCT and GGT with high RSCU value, which are common in all seven strains. These codons are mostly from Aliphatic and Hydroxyl amino acid group. A phylogenetic tree built using RSCU feature reveals proximity among hCoVOC43 and hCoV229E (mild). Thirdly, we perform linear regression analysis among GC content in different codon position and ENC value. We observe a strong correlation (significant p-value) between GC2 and GC3 for SARSCoV-2, hCoV229E and hCoVNL63, and between GC1 and GC3 for hCoV229E, hCoVNL63, SARSCoV. We believe that our findings will help in understanding the mechanism of human coronavirus.",

    "abstract": "Schizorhodopsins (SzRs), a new rhodopsin family identified in Asgard archaea, are phylogenetically located at an intermediate position between type-1 microbial rhodopsins and heliorhodopsins. SzRs reportedly work as light-driven inward H+ pumps, as xenorhodopsin. Here we report the crystal structure of SzR AM_5_00977 at 2.1 [A] resolution. The SzR structure superimposes well on that of bacteriorhodopsin rather than heliorhodopsin, suggesting that SzRs are classified with type-1 rhodopsins. The structure-based mutagenesis study demonstrated that the residues N100 and V103 are essential for color tuning in SzRs. The cytoplasmic parts of transmembrane helices 2, 6, and 7 in SzR are shorter than those in the other microbial rhodopsins. Thus, E81 is located near the cytosol, playing a critical role in the inward H+ release. We suggested the H+ is not metastably trapped in E81 and released through the water-mediated transport network from the retinal Schiff base to the cytosol. Moreover, most residues on the H+ transport pathway are not conserved between SzRs and xenorhodopsins, suggesting that they have entirely different inward H+ release mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a health care crisis. The resistance-conferring mutation F98Y in Staphylococcus aureus dihydrofolate reductase (SaDHFR) reduces effectiveness of antifolates, e.g., trimethoprim (TMP). Although propargyl-linked antifolates (PLAs) are much more resilient than TMP towards F98Y, this substitution still vitiates their inhibition potency. Surprisingly, differences in the enantiomeric configuration at the stereogenic center of PLAs influence the isomeric state of NADPH cofactor. Is resistance correlated with chiral evasion? A mechanism of action underpinning this coupling is unknown. To understand the molecular basis of F98Y-mediated resistance and how PLAs inhibition drives NADPH isomeric states, we used OSPREY to analyze a comprehensive suite of structural, biophysical, biochemical, and computational data. We present a model showing how F98Y SaDHFR exploits a different anomeric configuration of NADPH to evade certain PLAs inhibition, while other PLAs remain resilient to resistance. Our model should enable general design of inhibitors that are resilient to chiral evasion.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila melanogaster peripheral nervous system (PNS) comprises the sensory organs that allow the fly to detect environmental factors such as temperature and pressure. PNS development is a highly specified process where each sensilla originates from a single sensory organ precursor (SOP) cell. One of the major genetic orchestrators of PNS development is Senseless, which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor (Sens). Sens is both necessary and sufficient for SOP differentiation. Senseless expression and SOP number are regulated by the microRNA miR-9a. However, the reciprocal dynamics of Senseless and miR-9a are still obscure. By coupling smFISH with immunofluorescence, we are able to visualize transcription of the mir-9a locus and expression of Sens simultaneously. During embryogenesis, we show that the expression of mir-9a in SOP cells is rapidly lost as Senseless expression increases. However, this mutually exclusive expression pattern is not observed in the third instar imaginal wing disc, where some Senseless-expressing cells show active sites of mir-9a transcription. These data challenge and extend previous models of Senseless regulation, and show complex co-expression dynamics between mir-9a and Senseless. The differences in this dynamic relationship between embryonic and larval PNS development suggest a possible switch in miR-9a function. Our work brings single-cell resolution to the understanding of dynamic regulation of PNS development by Senseless and miR-9a.",

Here, we take an integrative approach to capturing targets of the Hfq-associated sRNA PinT, a known post-transcriptional timer of the two major virulence programs of Salmonella enterica. Using MS2 affinity purification and RNA-sequencing (MAPS), we identify PinT ligands in bacteria under in-vitro conditions mimicking specific stages of the infection cycle, and in bacteria growing inside macrophages. This reveals PinT-mediated translational inhibition of the secreted effector kinase SteC, which had gone unnoticed in previous target searches. Using genetic, biochemical, and microscopic assays, we provide evidence for PinT-mediated repression of steC mRNA, eventually preventing actin rearrangements in infected host cells. Our findings support the role of PinT as a central post-transcriptional regulator in Salmonella virulence and illustrate the need for complementary methods to reveal the full target suites of sRNAs.",

High-throughput methods such as transposon sequencing (TnSeq) are powerful tools to identify such genes in bacterial pathogens. However, there is little information as to the distinctiveness of traits required for bacterial colonization of different hosts. Here, we utilize randomly barcoded TnSeq (RB-TnSeq) to identify the genes that contribute to the ability of Pseudomonas syringae strain B728a to grow within common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), and pepper (Capsicum annuum); species representing two different plant families. The magnitude of contribution of most genes to apoplastic fitness in each of the plant hosts was similar. However, 50 genes significantly differed in their fitness contributions to growth within these species. These genes encoded proteins in various functional categories including polysaccharide synthesis and transport, amino acid metabolism and transport, cofactor metabolism, and phytotoxin synthesis and transport. Six genes that encoded unannotated, hypothetical proteins also contributed differentially to growth in these hosts. The genetic repertoire of a relatively promiscuous pathogen such as P. syringae may thus be shaped, at least in part, by the conditional contribution of some fitness determinants.",

In autopsy hippocampus and cortex, we observed no proteomic differences between SUDEP and epilepsy cases, contrasting our previously reported robust differences between epilepsy and controls. Transcriptomics in hippocampus and cortex from surgical epilepsy cases segregated by PGES identified 55 differentially expressed genes (37 protein-coding, 15 lncRNAs, three pending) in hippocampus. Overall, the SUDEP proteome and high-risk SUDEP transcriptome largely reflected other epilepsy cases in the brain regions analyzed, consistent with diverse epilepsy syndromes and comorbidities associated with SUDEP. Thus, studies with larger cohorts and different epilepsy syndromes, as well as additional anatomic regions may identify molecular mechanisms of SUDEP.",

    "abstract": "Shigellosis results from oral ingestion of the Gram-negative bacteria Shigella, and symptoms include severe diarrhea and dysentery. In the absence of vaccines, small molecule antibacterial drugs have provided treatment options for shigellosis. However, Shigella drug resistance is rapidly emerging, and Shigella strains with resistance to both third-generation cephalosporins and azithromycin have been identified in Asia. A re-conceptualization is needed regarding the development of therapeutics that target bacterial pathogens in order to reduce resistance development and alteration of gut microbiota, which is depleted upon treatment with wide spectrum antibiotics, thereby increasing susceptibility to subsequent enteric infections. A more organism-specific approach is to develop agents targeting virulence factors such as toxins, adhesins, invasins, quorum sensing, and protein secretion systems. For Shigella, there is interest in targeting transcription factors essential for Shigella infection in vivo rather than specific effectors. Here we describe the importance of the Shigella transcription factor IlvY in Shigella virulence in vitro and in vivo. This work included the development of a novel, oral mouse model of Shigella infection with wild-type adult mice. Unlike previous models, mice do not require antibiotic pretreatment or diet modifications. This mouse model was used to demonstrate the importance of IlvY for Shigella in vivo survival and that deletion of ilvY impacts host responses to infection. These results illustrate that IlvY is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of shigellosis. In addition, the novel mouse model provides an exciting new opportunity to investigate therapeutic efficacy against Shigella infection and host responses to infection.",

    "abstract": "Circadian transcriptome studies identified a novel transcript at the Period2 (Per2) locus, which we named Per2AS. Per2AS is a long non-coding RNA transcribed from the antisense strand of Per2, and is expressed rhythmically and anti-phasic to Per2 mRNA. Previously, we mathematically tested the hypothesis that Per2AS and Per2 mutually inhibit each others expression by forming a double negative feedback loop, and found that Per2AS expands the oscillatory domain. In this study, we have experimentally tested this prediction by perturbing the expression of Per2AS in mouse fibroblasts. We found that Per2AS represses Per2 pre-transcriptionally in cis and regulates the amplitude of the circadian clock, but not period or phase. Unexpectedly, we also found that Per2 positively regulates Per2AS post-transcriptionally, indicating that Per2AS and Per2 form a single negative feedback loop. Because knock-down of Per2 does not recapitulate the phenotypes of Per2AS perturbation and Per2AS also activates Bmal1 in trans, we propose that Per2AS regulates the amplitude of the circadian clock without producing a protein by rewiring the molecular clock circuit.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is the primary cause of cognitive deficit in elderly humans. Late-onset AD (LOAD) is sporadic, multifactorial, non-Mendelian accounting at present for 95% of the cases in contrast to the genetic form. Risk factors for sporadic AD include Gene: Environment interactions. There is increasing evidence that lifestyle and environmental stress such as infection and chronic inflammation are underlying culprits of neurodegenerative dementia. Dementias that share or mimic pathological processes of AD include cerebrovascular diseases, Lewy body disease, TDP-43 proteinopathy. To date, very few mouse models reproduce the pathophysiological progression of mixed-vascular-AD, while the majority of studies have employed transgenic animals reproducing the familial form.\n\nMethodsWe have re-engineered the Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) sterile infection model in wildtype C57Bl6 mice to obtain chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. We have conducted a cross-sectional analysis of aging PolyI:C and Saline control mice (3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 16 months), taking the hippocampus as a reference brain region, based on its vulnerability, and compared the brain aging phenotype to AD progression in humans with mild AD, severe AD and Controls (CTL), parallely in Vascular dementia (VaD) patient specimens.\n\nResultsWe found that PolyI:C mice display both peripheral and central inflammation with a peak at 6 months, associated with memory deficits. The hippocampus is characterized by a pronounced and progressive tauopathy. In PolyI:C brains, microglia undergo aging-dependent morphological rearrangements progressively adopting a phagocytic phenotype. Transcriptomic analysis reveals a profound change in gene expression over the course of aging, with a peak in differential expression at 9 months. We confirm that the proinflammatory marker Lcn2 is one of the genes with the strongest upregulation in PolyI:C mice upon aging. Validation in brains from patients with increasing severity of AD and VaD shows a reproducibility of some gene targets in vascular dementia specimens rather than AD ones, in which only GFAP is strongly increased at the severe stages.\n\nConclusionsThe PolyI:C model of sterile infection demonstrates that peripheral chronic inflammation is sufficient to cause neuropathological processes resembling a mixed-VaD-AD phenotype, with progressive tau hyperphosphorylation, changes in microglia morphology, astrogliosis and gene reprogramming reflecting increased neuroinflammation, vascular remodeling and the loss of neuronal functionality seen to some extent in humans.",

    "abstract": "Recent work performed by Sberro et al. (2019) revealed a vast unexplored space of small proteins existing within the human microbiome. At present, these small open reading frames (smORFs) are unannotated in existing reference genomes and standard genome annotation tools are not able to accurately predict them. In this study, we introduce an annotation tool named SmORFinder that predicts small proteins based on those identified by Sberro et al. This tool combines profile Hidden Markov models (pHMMs) of each small protein family and deep learning models that may better generalize to smORF families not seen in the training set. We find that combining predictions of both pHMM and deep learning models leads to more precise smORF predictions and that these predicted smORFs are enriched for Ribo-Seq or MetaRibo-Seq translation signals. Feature importance analysis reveals that the deep learning models learned to identify Shine-Dalgarno sequences, deprioritize the wobble position in each codon, and group codons in a way that strongly corresponds to the codon synonyms found in the codon table. We perform a core genome analysis of 26 bacterial species and identify many core smORFs of unknown function. We pre-compute small protein annotations for thousands of RefSeq isolate genomes and HMP metagenomes, and we make these data available through a web portal along with other useful tools for small protein annotation and analysis.

We show here that a population of cells within melanoma tumors with extremely high expression of AXL are negative/low for both MITF and the transcription factor BRN2. Depletion of both transcription factors from cultured melanoma cell lines produced an increase in AXL expression greater than depletion of MITF alone. Further, re-expression of BRN2 led to decreased AXL expression, indicating a role for BRN2 in regulation of AXL levels unrelated to effects on MITF level. As AXL has been recognized as a marker of therapy resistance these cells may represent a population of cells responsible for disease relapse and as potential targets for therapeutic treatment.",

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical post-transcriptional regulators of cellular function, including inflammatory responses, though the role of RBPs in innate lymphoid cells is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that RNA-binding motif 3 (RBM3) is one of the most highly expressed RBPs in Thy1.2+ lung ILCs after fungal allergen challenge and is further induced by epithelial cytokines TSLP and IL-33 in both human and mouse ILCs. Single (rbm3-/-) and double (rbm3-/-rag2-/-) knockout mice exposed via the airway to the asthma-associated fungal allergen Alternaria alternata displayed increases in eosinophilic lung inflammation and ILC activation compared to control mice. In addition to increased Th2 cytokine production, rbm3-/- ILCs produced elevated IL-17A. The negative regulation by RBM3 in ILC responses was direct as purified rbm3-/- ILCs were hyperinflammatory in vitro and in vivo after stimulation with IL-33. Transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing of rbm3-/- lung ILCs showed increased type 2 and 17 cytokines as well as global expression differences in critical cytokines, receptors, transcription factors, and survival transcripts compared with WT ILCs. Intriguingly, these transcript changes did not correlate with the presence of AU-rich elements (AREs), which RBM3 is known to bind. Thus, regulation of ILC responses by RNA-binding proteins offers novel mechanistic insight into lung ILC biology and ILC-driven inflammatory diseases.",

In this study, we used a reproducible solubilisation protocol that allows the generation of homogenous monomeric solution of GNNQQNY to understand the molecular details of its self-assembly mechanism. The aggregation kinetics data show that the GNNQQNY sequences follow nucleation-dependent aggregation kinetics with a critical nucleus of size ~7 monomers and that the size and efficiency of nucleation was found to be inversely related to the reaction temperature. The generated nucleus reduces the thermodynamic energy barrier by acting as a template for further self-assembly and results in highly ordered amyloid fibrils. The fibers grown at different temperatures showed similar Thioflavin T positivity, Congo red binding and {beta}-sheet rich structures displaying a characteristic cross-{beta} diffraction pattern. These aggregates also share morphological and structural identity with those reported earlier. The mature GNNQQNY fibers exerted no significant oxidative stress or cytotoxicity upon incubating with differentiated SHSY5Y cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study to experimentally validate previous predictions based on theoretical and molecular dynamics simulations. These findings will provide the basis for understanding the kinetics and thermodynamics of amyloid nucleation and elongation of amyloidogenic systems associated with many systemic and neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P) is an essential lipid carrier that ferries cell wall intermediates across the cytoplasmic membrane in bacteria. Und-P is generated by dephosphorylating undecaprenyl diphosphate (Und-PP). In Escherichia coli, BacA, PgpB, YbjG, and LpxT dephosphorylate Und-PP and are conditionally essential. To identify vulnerabilities that arise when Und-P metabolism is defective, we developed a genetic screen for synthetic mutations in combination with {Delta}ybjG {Delta}lpxT {Delta}bacA. The screen uncovered system-wide connections, including novel connections to cell division, DNA replication and repair, signal transduction, and glutathione metabolism. Further analysis revealed several new morphogenes; loss of one of these, qseC, caused cells to enlarge and lyse. QseC is the sensor kinase component of the QseBC two-component system. In the absence of QseC, the QseB response regulator is overactivated by PmrB cross-phosphorylation. Here, we show that deleting qseB completely reverses the shape defect of {Delta}qseC cells, as does overexpressing rprA (a small RNA). Surprisingly, deleting pmrB only partially suppressed qseC-related shape defects. Thus, QseB is activated by multiple factors in the absence of QseC and functions ascribed to QseBC may be related to cell wall defects. Altogether, our findings provide a framework for identifying new determinants of cell integrity that could be targeted in future therapies.",

However, this results in an uneven amount of light received by the cells due to cell-cell shading. Fluorescence microscopy solves this issue as cells can be grown in a single layer, eliminating shading issues. However, microscopy brings its own challenge as hundreds of cells are imaged at the same time, making it difficult to analyze the resulting data by hand. Here we present CyAn, a toolbox to process and analyze microscope images of cyanobacteria. The toolbox automates cyanobacteria identification in microscope images, tracks moving and dividing cells, and computes relevant biological data such as growth rates. As proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that wild type and mutants can be grown on the same slide and identified using the software, allowing a much more accurate probe into photosynthetic processes that are often masked due to cellular heterogeneity or those requiring precise light control to prevent cell-cell shading.",

We found that LL induced a slight up-regulation of CD86 and MHC II in DCs and also stimulated the production of IL-6 and TNF-. By contrast, HF did not increase the expression of any co-stimulatory molecules, but also down-modulated CD40 and stimulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Both parasitic antigens promoted protein synthesis through mTOR activation. The use of rapamycin decreased the expression of the cytokines tested, empowered the down-modulation of CD40 and also reduced splenocyte proliferation. Finally, we showed that E. granulosus antigens increase the amounts of LC3-positive structures in DCs which play critical roles in the presentation of these antigens to T cells.",

Of various disease management strategies, utilization of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in disease suppression and plant growth promotion is eye catching strategy. The present study was performed to isolate and characterize PGPR indigenous to chili rhizosphere in Pakistan, and to test their potential to suppress damping off and plant growth promotion in chilli. Out of total 28 antagonists, 8 bacterial isolates (4a2, JHL-8, JHL-12, 1C2, RH-24, 1D, 5C and RH-87) significantly suppressed the colony growth of P. myriotylum in dual culture experiment. All the tested bacterial isolates were characterized for biochemical attributes, and 16S rRNA sequence based phylogenetic analysis identified these isolates as Flavobacterium spp., Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas libanensis. All the tested bacterial isolates showed positive test results for ammonia production, starch hydrolase (except 4a2), and hydrogen cyanide production (except 4a2 and 1D). All the tested antagonists produced indole-3-acetic acid (13.4-39.0 g ml-1), solubilized inorganic phosphate (75-103 gml-1) and produced siderophores (17.1-23.7%) in vitro. All the tested bacterial isolates showed varied level of susceptibility and resistance response against different antibiotics and all these bacterial isolates were found non-pathogenic to chill seeds and notably enhanced percentage seed germination, plumule, redical length and vigor index over un-inoculated control. Additionally, under pathogen pressure, bacterization increased the defense related enzymes (PO, PPO and PAL) activates. Moreover, chilli seeds treatment with these bacterial isolates significantly suppressed damping-off caused by P. myriotylum, and improved PGP traits as compared to control. In addition, a positive correlation was noticed between shoot, root length and dry shoot and root weigh and a negative correlation was seen between dry shoot, root weight and seedling percentage mortality. These results showed that native PGPR possess multiple traits beneficial to the chilli plants and can be used to develop eco-friendly and effective seed treatment formulation as an alternative to synthetic chemical fungicides.",

    "abstract": "Sesquiterpene synthases (STSs) catalyze the formation of a large class of plant volatiles called sesquiterpenes. While thousands of putative STS sequences from diverse plant species are available, only a small number of them have been functionally characterized. Sequence identity-based screening for desired enzymes, often used in biotechnological applications, is difficult to apply here as STS sequence similarity is strongly affected by species. This calls for more sophisticated computational methods for functionality prediction. We investigate the specificity of precursor cation formation in these elusive enzymes. By inspecting multi-product STSs, we demonstrate that STSs have a strong selectivity towards one precursor cation. We use a machine learning approach combining sequence and structure information to accurately predict precursor cation specificity for STSs across all plant species. We combine this with a co-evolutionary analysis on the wealth of uncharacterized putative STS sequences, to pinpoint residues and distant functional contacts influencing cation formation and reaction pathway selection. These structural factors can be used to predict and engineer enzymes with specific functions, as we demonstrate by predicting and characterizing two novel STSs from Citrus bergamia.\n\nAuthor summaryPredicting enzyme function is a popular problem in the bioinformatics field that grows more pressing with the increase in protein sequences, and more attainable with the increase in experimentally characterized enzymes. Terpenes and terpenoids form the largest classes of natural products and find use in many drugs, flavouring agents, and perfumes. Terpene synthases catalyze the biosynthesis of terpenes via multiple cyclizations and carbocation rearrangements, generating a vast array of product skeletons. In this work, we present a three-pronged computational approach to predict carbocation specificity in sesquiterpene synthases, a subset of terpene synthases with one of the highest diversities of products. Using homology modelling, machine learning and co-evolutionary analysis, our approach combines sparse structural data, large amounts of uncharacterized sequence data, and the current set of experimentally characterized enzymes to provide insight into residues and structural regions that likely play a role in determining product specifcity. Similar techniques can be repurposed for function prediction and enzyme engineering in many other classes of enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Following injury to the peripheral and central nervous systems, tissue levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-{beta}1 often increase, which is key for wound healing and scarring. However, active wound regions and scars appear to inhibit process outgrowth by regenerating neurons. We recently showed that corneal wound myofibroblasts block corneal nerve regeneration in vivo, and sensory neurite outgrowth in vitro in a manner that relies critically on TGF-{beta}1. In turn, delayed, abnormal re-innervation contributes to long-term sensory dysfunctions of the ocular surface. Here, we exposed morphologically and biochemically-differentiated sensory neurons from the ND7/23 cell line to TGF-{beta}1 to identify the intracellular signals regulating these anti-neuritogenic effects, contrasting them with those of Semaphorin(Sema)3A, a known inhibitor of neurite outgrowth. Neuronal morphology was quantified using phase-contrast imaging. Western blotting and specific inhibitors were then used to identify key molecular mediators. Differentiated ND7/23 cells expressed neuron-specific markers, including those involved in neurite extension and polarization. TGF-{beta}1 increased phosphorylation of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2), a molecule that is key for neurite extension. We now show that both glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3{beta} and Smad3 modulate phosphorylation of CRMP2 after treatment with TGF-{beta}1. GSK-3{beta} appeared to exert a particularly strong effect, which could be explained by its ability to phosphorylate not only CRMP2, but also Smad3. In conclusion, TGF-{beta}1s inhibition of neurite outgrowth in sensory neurons appears to be regulated through a highly-conserved signaling pathway, which involves the GSK-3{beta}/CRMP-2 loop via both canonical and non-canonical mechanisms. It is hoped that by defining the signaling pathways that control neurite outgrowth in wound environments, it will become possible to identify optimal molecular targets to promote re-innervation following injury.",

    "abstract": "Similar to other complex organisms, plants consist of diverse and highly specialized cell types. The gain of unique biological functions of these different cell types is the consequence of the establishment of cell-type-specific transcriptional programs and their associated regulatory mechanisms. Recently, single cell transcriptomic approaches have been applied on Arabidopsis thaliana root protoplasts allowing the accurate characterization of the transcriptional profiles of the cell-types composing seedling roots. As a first step in gaining a deeper understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling Arabidopsis gene expression, we report the use of single nucleus RNA sequencing (sNucRNA-seq) and single nucleus Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (sNucATAC-seq) technologies on Arabidopsis roots. The comparison of our single nuclei transcriptomes to previously published protoplast transcriptomes validated the use of nuclei as biological entities to establish cell-type specific transcriptomes from multicellular organs. Furthermore, our sNucRNA-seq results uncovered the transcriptome of additional cell subtypes not identified by scRNA-seq. Similar to our transcriptomic approach, the sNucATAC-seq approach led to the distribution of the Arabidopsis nuclei into distinct clusters suggesting the differential remodeling of the chromatin between groups of cells according to their identity. To reveal the impact of chromatin remodeling on gene transcription, we integrated sNucRNA-seq and sNucATAC-seq data and demonstrated that cell-type-specific marker genes also display cell-type-specific pattern of chromatin accessibility. Our data suggest that the differential remodeling of the chromatin is a critical mechanism to regulate gene activity at the cell-type level.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTriatomine bugs, the vectors of Chagas disease, associate with vertebrate hosts in highly diverse ecotopes. When these blood-sucking bugs adapt to new microhabitats, their phenotypes may change. Although understanding phenotypic variation is key to the study of adaptive evolution and central to phenotype-based taxonomy, the drivers of phenotypic change and diversity in triatomines remain poorly understood.\n\nMethods/FindingsWe combined a detailed phenotypic appraisal (including morphology and morphometrics) with mitochondrial cytb and nuclear ITS2 DNA-sequence analyses to study Rhodnius ecuadoriensis populations from across the species range. We found three major, naked-eye phenotypic variants. Southern-Andean bugs (SW Ecuador/NW Peru) from house and vertebrate-nest microhabitats are typical, light-colored, small bugs with short heads/wings. Northern-Andean bugs (W Ecuador wet-forest palms) are dark, large bugs with long heads/wings. Finally, northern-lowland bugs (coastal Ecuador dry-forest palms) are light-colored and medium-sized. Wing and (size-free) head shapes are similar across Ecuadorian populations, regardless of habitat or naked-eye phenotype, but distinct in Peruvian bugs. Bayesian phylogenetic and multispecies-coalescent DNA-sequence analyses strongly suggest that Ecuadorian and Peruvian populations are two independently-evolving lineages, with little within-lineage structuring/differentiation.\n\nConclusionsWe report sharp naked-eye phenotypic divergence of genetically similar Ecuadorian R. ecuadoriensis (house/nest southern-Andean vs. palm-dwelling northern bugs; and palm-dwelling Andean vs. lowland); and sharp naked-eye phenotypic similarity of typical, yet genetically distinct, southern-Andean bugs from house and nest (but not palm) microhabitats (SW Ecuador vs. NW Peru). This remarkable phenotypic diversity within a single nominal species likely stems from microhabitat adaptations possibly involving predator-driven selective pressure (yielding substrate-matching camouflage coloration) and a shift from palm-crown to vertebrate-nest microhabitats (yielding smaller bodies and shorter heads and wings). These findings shed new light on the origins of phenotypic diversity in triatomines, warn against excess reliance on phenotype-based triatomine-bug taxonomy, and confirm the Triatominae as an informative model-system for the study of phenotypic change under ecological pressure.\n\nAuthor summaryTriatomine bugs feed on the blood of vertebrates including humans and transmit the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The bugs, of which 150+ species are known, are highly diverse in size, shape, and color. Some species look so similar that they are commonly confused, whereas a few same-species populations look so different that they were thought to be separate species. Despite the crucial role of naked-eye phenotypes in triatomine-bug identification and classification (which are essential for vector control-surveillance), the origins of this variation remain unclear. Here, we describe a striking case of phenotypic divergence, with genetically similar bugs looking very different from one another, and phenotypic convergence, with bugs from two genetically distinct populations (likely on their way to speciation) looking very similar - and all within a single nominal species, Rhodnius ecuadoriensis. Phenotypically divergent populations occupy different ecological regions (wet vs. dry) and microhabitats (palm-crowns vs. vertebrate nests), whereas convergent populations occupy man-made and nest (but not palm) microhabitats. These findings suggest that triatomines can  respond to ecological novelty by changing their external, naked-eye phenotypes as they adapt to new microhabitats. We therefore warn that phenotypic traits such as overall size or color may confound triatomine-bug species identification and classification.",

    "abstract": "Regime shifts are increasingly prevalent in the ecological literature. However, definitions vary, and many detection methods are subjective. Here, we employ an operationally objective means of identifying regime shifts, using a Bayesian online change-point detection algorithm able to simultaneously identify shifts in the mean and(or) variance of time series data. We detected multiple regime shifts in long-term (59-154 years) patterns of coastal Norwegian Atlantic cod (>70% decline) and putative drivers of cod productivity: North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO); sea-surface temperature; zooplankton abundance; fishing mortality (F). The consequences of an environmental or climate-related regime shift on cod productivity are accentuated when regime shifts coincide, fishing mortality is high, and populations are small. The analyses suggest that increasing F increasingly sensitized cod in the mid 1970s and late 1990s to regime shifts in NAO, zooplankton abundance, and water temperature. Our work underscores the necessity of accounting for human-induced mortality in regime shift analyses of marine ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-specific knockout techniques are widely applied in biological studies to probe the tissue-specific roles of specific genes in physiology, development, and disease. CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used technology to perform fast and efficient genome editing in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report a robust CRISPR-based gateway system for tissue-specific gene inactivation in zebrafish. A transgenic fish line expressing Cas9 under the control of a neutrophil-restricted promoter was constructed. As proof of principle, we transiently disrupted rac2 or cdk2 in neutrophils using plasmids driving the expression of sgRNAs from U6 promoters. Loss of the rac2 or cdk2 gene in neutrophils resulted in significantly decreased cell motility, which could be restored by re-expressing Rac2 or Cdk2 in neutrophils in the corresponding knockout background. The subcellular location of Rac activation and actin structure and stress in the context of neutrophil migration was determined in both the wild-type and rac2 knockout neutrophils in vivo. In addition, we evaluated an alternative approach where the Cas9 protein is ubiquitously expressed while the sgRNA is processed by ribozymes and expressed in a neutrophil-restricted manner. Cell motility was also reduced upon rac2 sgRNA expression. Together, our work provides a potent tool that can be used to advance the utility of zebrafish in identification and characterization of gene functions in neutrophils.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma congolense is one of the principal agents causing livestock trypanosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa. This wasting disease is costing these developing economies billions of dollars and undermining food security. Only two old drugs, the diamidine diminazene and the phenanthridine isometamidium are regularly used, and resistance is widespread but poorly understood. We induce diminazene resistance in T. congolense laboratory strain IL3000 in vitro. Resistance was stable and not deleterious to in vitro growth. There was no cross-resistance with the phenanthridine drugs, with melaminophenyl arsenicals, with two promising new oxaborole trypanocides, nor with other diamidine trypanocides such as pentamidine, except the close structural analogues DB829 and DB75. Fluorescence microscopy showed that accumulation of DB75 was inhibited by folate. Uptake of [3H]-diminazene was also partly inhibited by folate, as well as by competing diamidine drugs, albeit at quite high concentrations, and uptake of tritiated diminazene and pentamidine was slow and low affinity. Uptake of [3H]-folate was in turn partly inhibited by diminazene, and inhibition of diminazene uptake by folate and pentamidine appeared to be additive, indicating multiple low affinity transport mechanisms for the drug. Expression of the T. congolense folate transporters TcoFT1-3 in diminazene-resistant T. b. brucei significantly sensitized the cells to diminazene and DB829, but not to oxaborole AN7973. However, [3H]-diminazene uptake was not different in T. congolense IL3000 and its diminazene resistant clones and RNAseq and whole-genome sequencing of multiple resistant clones did not reveal major changes in folate transporter sequence or expression. Instead, flow cytometry revealed a strong and stable reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential {Psi}m in all resistant clones. We conclude that diminazene uptake in T. congolense proceed via multiple low affinity mechanisms including folate transporters and that resistance is the result of a reduction in {Psi}m that limits mitochondrial accumulation of the drug.",

Recent work has begun to investigate the neural mechanisms that underlie shared representations of input, documenting neural synchrony or coupling (measured using intersubject temporal correlations of neural activity) between individuals exposed to the same stimulus. Neural synchrony has been found to predict the quality of engagement with a stimulus and with communicative cues, but studies have yet to address how neural synchrony among children may relate to real-time learning. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we recorded the neural activity of 45 children (3.5-4.5 years) during joint book reading with an adult experimenter. The custom childrens book contained four novel words and objects embedded in an unfolding story, as well as a range of narrative details about object functions and character roles. We observed synchronized neural activity between child participants during book reading and found a positive correlation between learning and intersubject neural synchronization in parietal cortex, an area implicated in narrative-level processing in adult research. Our findings suggest that childrens learning is facilitated by active neural engagement with the dynamics of natural social input.",

Here, we investigated this using two different tasks (in two different cohorts): (i) visual location discrimination, and (ii) multisensory (visual-vestibular) heading discrimination. We fit the data using a logistic regression model to dissociate the specific effects of prior stimuli and prior choices. In both tasks perceptual decisions were biased toward recent choices. Notably, the  attractive effect of prior choices was significantly larger in ASD (in both tasks and cohorts), while there was no difference in the influence of prior stimuli. These results challenge theories of reduced priors in ASD, and rather suggest an increased consistency bias for perceptual decisions in ASD.",

Development of these mathematical models for human-derived brain organoids offer an opportunity for testing new hypotheses about the human brain. When it comes to testing ideas about the brain that require a careful balance between experimental accessibility, manipulation, and complexity, in order to connect neurobiological details with higher level cognitive properties and clinical considerations, we argue that fundamental structure-function constraints applied to models of brain organoids offer a path forward. Moreover, we show these constraints appear in canonical and novel math models of neural activity and learning, and we make the case that constraint-based modeling and use of representations can bridge to machine learning for powerful mutual benefit.",

    "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC) of neural oscillations (~1-150Hz) is thought to facilitate neural information exchange across brain areas by forming malleable neural ensembles in the service of cognitive processes. However, neural oscillations and their FC are not restricted to certain cognitive demands and continuously unfold in all cognitive states. To what degree is the spatial organization of oscillation-based FC affected by cognitive state or governed by an intrinsic architecture? And what is the impact of oscillation frequency and FC mode (phase-versus amplitude coupling)? Using ECoG recordings of 18 presurgical patients, we quantified the state-dependency of oscillation-based FC in five canonical frequency bands and across an array of 6 task states. For both phase- and amplitude coupling, static FC analysis revealed a spatially largely state-invariant (i.e. intrinsic) component in all frequency bands. Further, the observed intrinsic FC pattern was spatially similar across all frequency bands. However, temporally independent FC dynamics in each frequency band allow for frequency-specific malleability in information exchange. In conclusion, the spatial organization of oscillation-based FC is largely stable over cognitive states, i.e. primarily intrinsic in nature, and shared across frequency bands. The state-invariance is in line with prior findings at the other temporal extreme of brain activity, the infraslow range (~<0.1Hz) observed in fMRI. Our observations have implications for conceptual frameworks of oscillation-based FC and the analysis of task-related FC changes.",

Using neuropharmacological, optogenetic, chemogenetic as well as microdialyses approaches, we revealed that enhanced OXT release within the ventral LS (vLS), combined with reduced AVP release within the dorsal LS (dLS), are required for female aggression. Accordingly, increased excitability of OXT-responsive neurons in the vLS and decreased excitability of AVP-responsive neurons in the dLS were essential to evoke female aggression. Finally, in vitro activation of OXT receptors in the vLS increased tonic GABAergic inhibition of dLS neurons. Overall, our data demonstrate that septal release of OXT and AVP affects female aggression by differential regulation of the excitatory-inhibitory balance within subnetworks of the LS.",

    "abstract": "The identity of a glycinergic synapse is maintained presynaptically by the activity of a surface glycine transporter, GlyT2, which recaptures glycine back to presynaptic terminals to preserve vesicular glycine content. GlyT2 loss-of-function mutations cause Hyperekplexia, a rare neurological disease in which loss of glycinergic neurotransmission causes generalized stiffness and strong motor alterations. However, the molecular underpinnings controlling GlyT2 activity remain poorly understood. In this work, we identify the Hedgehog pathway as a robust controller of GlyT2 expression and transport activity. Modulating the activation state of the Hedgehog pathway in vitro in rodent primary spinal cord neurons or in vivo in zebrafish embryos induced a selective control in GlyT2 expression, regulating GlyT2 transport activity. Our results indicate that activation of Hedgehog reduces GlyT2 expression by decreasing its mRNA levels and increasing its ubiquitination and degradation. This work describes a new molecular link between the Hedgehog signaling pathway and presynaptic glycine availability.",

    "abstract": "Connexins are transmembrane proteins that form hemichannels allowing the exchange of molecules between the extracellular space and cell interior. Two hemichannels from adjacent cells dock and form a continuous gap junction pore, thereby permitting direct intercellular communication. Connexin 36 (Cx36), expressed primarily in neurons, is involved in the synchronous activity of neurons and may play a role in aberrant synchronous firing, as seen in seizures. To understand the reciprocal interactions between Cx36 and seizure-like neural activity, we examined three questions: a) does Cx36 deficiency affect seizure susceptibility, b) does seizure-like activity affect Cx36 expression patterns, and c) does acute blockade of Cx36 conductance increase seizure susceptibility. We utilize the zebrafish pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; a GABA(A) receptor antagonist) induced seizure model, taking advantage of the compact size and optical translucency of the larval zebrafish brain to assess how PTZ affects brain-wide neuronal activity and Cx36 protein expression. We exposed wild-type and genetic Cx36-deficient (cx35.5- /-) zebrafish larvae to PTZ and subsequently mapped neuronal activity across the whole brain, using phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (pERK) as a proxy for neuronal activity. We found that cx35.5-/- fish exhibited region-specific susceptibility and resistance to PTZ-induced hyperactivity compared to wild-type controls, suggesting that genetic Cx36 deficiency may affect seizure susceptibility in a region-specific manner. Regions that showed increased PTZ sensitivity include the dorsal telencephalon, which is implicated in human epilepsy, and the lateral hypothalamus, which has been underexplored. We also found that PTZ-induced neuronal hyperactivity resulted in a rapid reduction of Cx36 protein levels. 30 minutes and one-hour exposure to 20 mM PTZ significantly reduced the expression of Cx36. This Cx36 reduction persists after one-hour of recovery but recovered after 3-6 hours. This acute downregulation of Cx36 by PTZ is likely maladaptive, as acute pharmacological blockade of Cx36 by mefloquine results in increased susceptibility to PTZ-induced neuronal hyperactivity. Together, these results demonstrate a reciprocal relationship between Cx36 and seizure-associated neuronal hyperactivity: Cx36 deficiency contributes region-specific susceptibility to neuronal hyperactivity, while neuronal hyperactivity-induced downregulation of Cx36 may increase the risk of future epileptic events.",

    "abstract": "Activation of the primary motor cortex (M1) is important for the execution of skilled movements and motor learning, and its dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of Parkinsons disease (PD). A well accepted idea in PD research, albeit not tested experimentally, is that loss of midbrain dopamine leads to decreased activation of M1 by the motor thalamus (Mthal). Here, we report that midbrain dopamine loss reduced Mthal input in a laminar- and cell type-specific fashion and induced laminar-specific changes in intracortical synaptic transmission. As a result, M1 activation by Mthal was decreased, but M1 output was increased. Our results demonstrate that loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons alters thalamocortical activation of M1, and provide novel insights into circuit mechanisms for motor cortex dysfunction in a mouse model of PD.",

    "abstract": "The activity of the epiphyseal growth plates, which drive longitudinal growth of long bones, is dependent on the ability of chondrocytes to change their shape and size extensively as they differentiate. However, organ size, extracellular matrix density and cell number have hindered the study of chondrocyte morphology. Here, we describe a new pipeline called 3D Morphometric Analysis for Phenotypic significance (3D MAPs), which overcomes these obstacles. By using 3D MAPs, we have created an image database of hundreds of thousands of cells from orthologous long bones. Analysis of this database revealed the growth strategies that chondrocytes use during differentiation. We found that chondrocytes employed both allometric and isometric growth, and that allometric growth is achieved by changes either in volume or surface area along a specific cell axis in a zone-specific manner. Additionally, we discovered a new organization of chondrocytes within the growth plate, where cells are orientated such that their longest axis always aligns with the dorsal-ventral axis of the bone. To demonstrate the ability of 3D MAPs to explore mechanisms of growth plate regulation, we studied the abnormally short tibiae of Gdf5-null mice. 3D MAPs identified aberrant cellular growth behaviors which resulted in a 3-fold reduction in volumetric cell growth, as well as affected cell morphology and orientation, highlighting GDF5 as a new regulator of growth plate activity. Overall, our findings provide new insight into the morphological sequence that chondrocytes undergo during differentiation and highlight the ability of 3D MAPs to uncover molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating this process. More broadly, this work provides a new framework for studying growth plate biology.",

    "abstract": "Neurons exhibit diverse intrinsic dynamics, which govern how they integrate synaptic inputs to produce spikes. Intrinsic dynamics are often plastic during development and learning, but the effects of these changes on stimulus encoding properties are not well known. To examine this relationship, we simulated auditory responses to zebra finch song using a linear-dynamical cascade model, which combines a linear spectrotemporal receptive field with a dynamical, conductance-based neuron model, then used generalized linear models to estimate encoding properties from the resulting spike trains. We focused on the effects of a low-threshold potassium current (KLT) that is present in a subset of cells in the zebra finch caudal mesopallium and is affected by early auditory experience. We found that KLT affects both spike adaptation and the temporal filtering properties of the receptive field. The direction of the effects depended on the temporal modulation tuning of the linear (input) stage of the cascade model, indicating a strongly nonlinear relationship. These results suggest that small changes in intrinsic dynamics in tandem with differences in synaptic connectivity can have dramatic effects on the tuning of auditory neurons.\n\nAuthor summaryExperience-dependent developmental plasticity involves changes not only to synaptic connections, but to voltage-gated currents as well. Using biophysical models, it is straightforward to predict the effects of this intrinsic plasticity on the firing patterns of individual neurons, but it remains difficult to understand the consequences for sensory coding. We investigated this in the context of the zebra finch auditory cortex, where early exposure to a complex acoustic environment causes increased expression of a low-threshold potassium current. We simulated responses to song using a detailed biophysical model and then characterized encoding properties using generalized linear models. This analysis revealed that this potassium current has strong, nonlinear effects on how the model encodes the songs temporal structure, and that the sign of these effects depend on the temporal tuning of the synaptic inputs. This nonlinearity gives intrinsic plasticity broad scope as a mechanism for developmental learning in the auditory system.",

    "abstract": "While thousands of loci have been associated with human phenotypes, the role of gene-environment (GxE) interactions in determining individual risk of human diseases remains unclear. This is partly due to the severe erosion of statistical power resulting from the massive number of statistical tests required to detect such interactions. Here, we focus on improving the power of GxE tests by developing a statistical framework for assessing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with the trait means and/or trait variances. When applying this framework to body mass index (BMI), we find that GxE discovery and replication rates are significantly higher when prioritizing genetic variants associated with the variance of the phenotype (vQTLs) compared to assessing all genetic variants. Moreover, we find that vQTLs are enriched for associations with other non-BMI phenotypes having strong environmental influences, such as diabetes or ulcerative colitis. We show that GxE effects first identified in quantitative traits such as BMI can be used for GxE discovery in disease phenotypes such as diabetes. A clear conclusion is that strong GxE interactions mediate the genetic contribution to body weight and diabetes risk.",
