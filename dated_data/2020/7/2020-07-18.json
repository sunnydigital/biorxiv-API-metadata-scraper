    "abstract": "Genetic variation in host populations may lead to differential viral susceptibilities. Here, we investigate the role of natural genetic variation in the Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR), an important antiviral pathway in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans against Orsay virus (OrV). The IPR involves transcriptional activity of 80 genes including the pals-genes. We examine the genetic variation in the pals-family for traces of selection and explore the molecular and phenotypic effects of having distinct pals-gene alleles. Genetic analysis of 330 global C. elegans strains reveals that genetic diversity within the IPR-related pals-genes can be categorized in a few haplotypes worldwide. Importantly, two key IPR regulators, pals-22 and pals-25, are in a genomic region carrying signatures of balancing selection, suggesting that different evolutionary strategies exist in IPR regulation. We infected eleven C. elegans strains that represent three distinct pals-22 pals-25 haplotypes with Orsay virus to determine their susceptibility. For two of these strains, N2 and CB4856, the transcriptional response to infection was also measured. The results indicate that pals-22 pals-25 haplotype shapes the defense against OrV and host genetic variation can result in constitutive activation of IPR genes. Our work presents evidence for balancing genetic selection of immunity genes in C. elegans and provides a novel perspective on the functional diversity that can develop within a main antiviral response in natural host populations.",

    "abstract": "Cellular differentiation is a tightly regulated process under the control of intricate signaling and transcription factors interaction network working in coordination. These interactions make the systems dynamic, robust and stable but also difficult to dissect. In the spinal cord, recent work has shown that a network of FGF, WNT and Retinoic Acid (RA) signaling factors regulate neural maturation by directing the activity of a transcription factor network that contains CDX at its core. Here we have used partial and ordinary (Hill) differential equation based models to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of the FGF/WNT/RA and the CDX/transcription factor networks, alone and in combination. We show that in both networks, the strength of interaction among network partners impacts the dynamics, behavior and output of the system. In the signaling network, interaction strength determine the position and size of discrete regions of cell differentiation and small changes in the strength of the interactions among networking partners can result in a signal overriding, balancing or oscillating with another signal. We also show that the spatiotemporal information generated by the signaling network can be conveyed to the CDX/transcription network to produces a transition zone that separates regions of high cell potency from regions of cell differentiation, in agreement with most in vivo observations. Importantly, both networks have built in robustness to extrinsic disturbances. This analysis provides a model for the interaction conditions underlying spinal cord cell maturation during embryonic axial elongation.",

ZIKV-related neuropathogenesis, predictors of birth defects, and neurodevelopmental deficits are not well defined in people. Here we assess the methodological and statistical feasibility of a congenital ZIKV exposure macaque model for identifying infant neurobehavior and brain abnormalities that may underlie neurodevelopmental deficits. We inoculated five pregnant macaques with ZIKV and mock-inoculated one macaque in the first trimester. Following birth, growth, ocular structure/function, brain structure, hearing, histopathology, and neurobehavior were quantitatively assessed during the first week of life. We identified the typical pregnancy outcomes of congenital ZIKV infection, with fetal demise and placental abnormalities. We estimated sample sizes needed to define differences between groups and demonstrated that future studies quantifying brain region volumes, retinal structure, hearing, and visual pathway function require a sample size of 14 animals per group (14 ZIKV, 14 control) to detect statistically significant differences in at least half of the infant exam parameters. Establishing the parameters for future studies of neurodevelopmental outcomes following congenital ZIKV exposure in macaques is essential for robust and rigorous experimental design.",

    "abstract": "How underlying mechanisms bias evolution toward predictable outcomes remains an area of active debate. In this study, we leveraged phenotypic plasticity and parallel adaptation across independent lineages of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to assess the predictability of gene expression evolution during parallel adaptation. Trinidadian guppies have repeatedly and independently adapted to high- and low-predation environments in the wild. We combined this natural experiment with a laboratory breeding design to attribute transcriptional variation to the genetic influences of population of origin and developmental plasticity in response to rearing with or without predators. We observed substantial gene expression plasticity as well as the evolution of expression plasticity itself across populations. Genes exhibiting expression plasticity within populations were more likely to also differ in expression between populations, with the direction of population differences more likely to be opposite those of plasticity. While we found more overlap than expected by chance in genes differentially expressed between high- and low-predation populations from distinct evolutionary lineages, the majority of differentially expressed genes were not shared between lineages. Our data suggest alternative transcriptional configurations associated with shared phenotypes, highlighting a role for transcriptional flexibility in the parallel phenotypic evolution of a species known for rapid adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing, a ubiquitous phenomenon in eukaryotes, is a regulatory mechanism for the biological diversity of individual genes. Most studies have focused on the effects of alternative splicing for protein synthesis. However, the transcriptome-wide influence of alternative splicing on RNA subcellular localization has rarely been studied. By analyzing RNA-seq data obtained from subcellular fractions across 13 human cell lines, we identified 8720 switching genes between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Consistent with previous reports, intron retention was observed to be enriched in the nuclear transcript variants. Interestingly, we found that short and structurally stable introns were positively correlated with nuclear localization. Motif analysis reveals that fourteen RNA-binding protein (RBPs) are prone to be preferentially bound with such introns. To our knowledge, this is the first transcriptome-wide study to analyze and evaluate the effect of alternative splicing on RNA subcellular localization. Our findings reveal that alternative splicing plays a promising role in regulating RNA subcellular localization.",

    "abstract": "The differentiation of neurons and formation of connections between cells is the basis of both the adult phenotype and behaviors tied to cognition, perception, reproduction, and survival. Such behaviors are associated with local (circuits) and global (connectome) brain networks. A solid understanding of how these networks emerge is critical. This opinion piece features a guided tour of early developmental events in the emerging connectome, which is crucial to a new view on the connectogenetic process. Connectogenesis includes associating cell identities with broader functional and developmental relationships. During this process, the transition from developmental cells to terminally differentiated cells is defined by an accumulation of traits that ultimately results in neuronal-driven behavior. The well-characterized developmental and cell biology of C. elegans will be used to build a synthesis of developmental events that result in a functioning connectome. Specifically, our view of connectogenesis enables a first-mover model of synaptic connectivity to be demonstrated using data representing larval synaptogenesis. In a first-mover model of Stackleberg competition, potential pre- and postsynaptic relationships are shown to yield various strategies for establishing various types of synaptic connections. By comparing these results to what is known regarding principles for establishing complex network connectivity, these strategies are generalizable to other species and developmental systems. In conclusion, we will discuss the broader implications of this approach, as what is presented here informs an understanding of behavioral emergence and the ability to simulate related biological phenomena.\n\nHighlightsO_LIwe can understand the complexity of connectomes in terms of their emergence from embryogenetic precursors, connection dynamics, and relationship to organismal behavior.\nC_LIO_LIa first-mover competition model can explain how neuronal cells follow a specific set of heuristic strategies to form chemical synapses with other cells in larval development.\nC_LIO_LIthe timing and relative order of terminal differentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans are shown to have both subtle and consequential effects on patterns of connectivity.\nC_LIO_LIa correspondence is established between the emergence of small connectomes and the emergence of specific behavioral outcomes in both animal and in silico models.\nC_LI",

In this study, polymer coatings are synthesized from subunits of cyclodextrin, an additive/excipient found in food/pharmaceutical formulations. These unique polymers, which have been applied mainly towards sustained drug delivery applications, are evaluated in this study for their ability to mitigate non-specific protein adsorption, mammalian cell (NIH/3T3) adhesion, and bacterial cell (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli) attachment. Effects of cyclodextrin polymer composition, particularly incorporation of nonpolar crosslinks, on material properties and passive anti-biofouling performance are investigated. Results suggest that lightly-crosslinked cyclodextrin polymers possess excellent passive resistance to protein, cell, and bacterial attachment, likely due to the hydrophilic and electrically neutral surface properties of these coatings. At the same time, anti-biofouling performance decreased with increasing crosslink ratios, possibly a reflection of decreased polymer mobility, increased rigidity, and increased hydrophobic character. Cyclodextrin-based materials may be broadly useful as coatings in industrial or medical applications where biofouling-resistant and/or drug-delivering surfaces are required.",

Thus 5P degradome sequencing, in addition to informing about RNA decay, also provides valuable information regarding ribosome dynamics.

Here we present fivepseq: an easy-to-use application for analysis and interactive visualization of 5P degradome data. This tool performs both metagene and gene specific analysis, and allows to easily investigate codon specific ribosome pauses. To demonstrate its ability to provide new biological information, we investigate gene specific ribosome pauses in S. cerevisiae after eIF5A depletion. In addition to identifying pauses at expected codon motifs, we identify multiple genes with strain-specific frameshifts. To show its wide applicability, we investigate more complex 5P degradome from A. thaliana and discover both motif-specific ribosome protection associated with particular developmental stages, as well as generally increased ribosome protection at termination level associated with age.

    "abstract": "One of the most important ways that bacteria compete for resources and space is by producing antibiotics that inhibit competitors. Because antibiotic production is costly, the biosynthetic gene clusters coordinating their synthesis are under strict regulatory control and often require \"elicitors\" to induce expression, including cues from competing strains. Although these cues are common, they are not produced by all competitors and so the phenotypes causing induction remain unknown. By studying interactions between 24 antibiotic-producing streptomycetes we show that inhibition between competitors is common and occurs more frequently if strains are closely related. Next, we show that antibiotic production is more likely to be induced by cues from strains that are closely related or that share secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Unexpectedly, antibiotic production is less likely to be induced by competitors that inhibit the growth of a focal strain, indicating that cell damage is not a general cue for induction. In addition to induction, antibiotic production often decreased in the presence of a competitor, although this response was not associated with genetic relatedness or overlap in BGCs. Finally, we show that resource limitation increases the chance that antibiotic production declines during competion. Our results reveal the importance of social cues and resource availability in the dynamics of interference competition in streptomycetes.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBacteria secrete antibiotics to inhibit their competitors, but the presence of competitors can determine whether these toxins are produced. Here, we study the role of the competitive and resource environment on antibiotic production in Streptomyces, bacteria renowned for their production of antibiotics. We show that Streptomyces are more likely to produce antibiotics when grown with closely related competitors or that share biosynthetic pathways for secondary metabolites, but not when they are threatened by competitors toxins, in contrast to predictions of the competition sensing hypothesis. Streptomyces also often reduce their output of antibiotics when grown with competitors, especially under nutrient limitation. Our findings highlight that interactions between the social and resource environments strongly regulate antibiotic production in these medicinally important bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Nociceptive and pruriceptive neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) convey sensations of pain and itch to the spinal cord, respectively. One subtype of mature DRG neurons, comprising about 5% of neurons in the ganglia, is responsible for sensing mediators of acute itch and atopic dermatitis, including the cytokine IL-31. How itch-sensitive (pruriceptive) neurons are specified is unclear. Here we show that Tmem184b, a gene with roles in axon degeneration and nerve terminal maintenance, is required for the expression of a large cohort of itch receptors, including those for IL-31, Leukotriene C4, and Histamine. Male and female mice lacking Tmem184b show reduced responses to IL-31, but maintain normal responses to pain and mechanical force, indicating a specific behavioral defect in pruriception. Calcium imaging experiments indicate that a reduction in IL-31 induced calcium entry is a likely contributor to this phenotype. We identify an early failure of proper Wnt-dependent transcriptional signatures and signaling components in Tmem184b mutant mice that may explain the improper DRG neuronal subtype specification. Accordingly, lentiviral re-expression of Tmem184b in mutant embryonic neurons restores Wnt signatures. Together, these data demonstrate that Tmem184b promotes adult somatosensation through developmental Wnt signaling and promotion of proper pruriceptive gene expression. Our data illuminate a new key regulatory step in the processes controlling the establishment of diversity in the somatosensory system.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation behaviors can often reduce predation risk, whether through dilution, confusion, or vigilance effects, but these effects are challenging to measure under natural conditions, involving strong interactions between the behaviors of predators and prey. Here we study aerial predation of massive swarms of Brazilian free-tailed bats Tadarida brasiliensis by Swainsons hawks Buteo swainsoni, testing how the behavioral strategies of predator and prey influence catch success and predation risk. The hawks achieved high overall catch success, but they were no more successful against lone bats than against bats flying in column formation. There was therefore no evidence of any net vigilance or confusion effect, and hawks attacking the column benefitted from the opportunity to make several attempted grabs. Even so, the bats overall risk of predation was an order of magnitude higher when flying alone. Attacks on lone bats ([~]10% of attacks) were greatly overrepresented relative to the proportion of bats classified as flying alone ([~]0.2%), so dilution is both necessary and sufficient to explain the higher survival rates of bats flying in the column. From the hawks perspective, their odds of catching a bat more than trebled if the attack involved a stoop rather than level flight, or a rolling rather than pitching grab maneuver. These behavioral tactics were independently deployed in nearly three-quarters of all attacks. Hence, whereas the survival rate of a bat depends principally on whether it flies alone or in a group, the catch success of a hawk depends principally on how it maneuvers to attack.\n\nLay summaryBats emerging by daylight from a massive desert roost are able to minimise their predation risk by maintaining tight column formation, because the hawks that attack them target stragglers disproportionately often. Whereas the predation risk of a bat therefore depends on how it maintains its position within the swarm, the catch success of a hawk depends on how it maneuvers to attack. Catch success is maximised by executing a stooping dive or a rolling grab.",

This dissociation has largely been explored by contrasting views of navigable-scale spaces compared to close-up views of isolated objects. However, in naturalistic visual experience, we encounter spaces intermediate to these extremes, like the tops of desks and kitchen counters, which are not navigable but typically contain multiple objects. How are such reachable-scale views represented in the brain? In two functional neuroimaging experiments with human observers, we find evidence for a large-scale dissociation of reachable-scale views from both navigable scene views and close-up object views. Three brain regions were identified which showed a systematic response preference to reachable views, located in the posterior collateral sulcus, the inferior parietal sulcus, and superior parietal lobule. Subsequent analyses suggest that these three regions may be especially sensitive to the presence of multiple objects. Further, in all classic scene and object regions, reachable-scale views dissociated from both objects and scenes with an intermediate response magnitude. Taken together, these results establish that reachable-scale environments have a distinct representational signature from both scene and object views.",

    "abstract": "Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a DNA repair pathway required to detect, process, and ligate DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) throughout the cell cycle. The NHEJ pathway is necessary for V(D)J recombination in developing B and T lymphocytes. During NHEJ, Ku70 and Ku80 form a heterodimer that recognizes DSBs and promotes recruitment and function of downstream factors PAXX, MRI, DNA-PKcs, Artemis, XLF, XRCC4, and LIG4. Mutations in several known NHEJ genes result in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Inactivation of Mri, Paxx or Xlf in mice results in normal or mild phenotype, while combined inactivation of Xlf/Mri, Xlf/Paxx, or Xlf/Dna-pkcs leads to late embryonic lethality. Here, we describe three new mouse models. We demonstrate that deletion of Trp53 rescues embryonic lethality in mice with combined deficiencies of Xlf and Mri. Furthermore, Xlf-/-Mri-/-Trp53+/- and Xlf-/-Paxx-/-Trp53+/- mice possess reduced body weight, severely reduced mature lymphocyte counts, and accumulation of progenitor B cells. We also report that combined inactivation of Mri/Paxx results in live-born mice with modest phenotype, and combined inactivation of Mri/Dna-pkcs results in embryonic lethality. Therefore, we conclude that XLF is functionally redundant with MRI and PAXX during lymphocyte development in vivo. Moreover, Mri genetically interacts with Dna-pkcs and Paxx.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomics facilitates the study of the genetic information from uncultured microbes and complex microbial communities. Assembling complete microbial genomes (i.e., circular with no misassemblies) from metagenomics data is difficult because most samples have high organismal complexity and strain diversity. Less than 100 circularized bacterial and archaeal genomes have been assembled from metagenomics data despite the thousands of datasets that are available. Circularized genomes are important for (1) building a reference collection as scaffolds for future assemblies, (2) providing complete gene content of a genome, (3) confirming little or no contamination of a genome, (4) studying the genomic context and synteny of genes, and (5) linking protein coding genes to ribosomal RNA genes to aid metabolic inference in 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies. We developed a method to achieve circularized genomes using iterative assembly, binning, and read mapping. In addition, this method exposes potential misassemblies from k-mer based assemblies. We chose species of the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) to focus our initial efforts because they have small genomes and are only known to have one ribosomal RNA operon. We present 34 circular CPR genomes, one circular Margulisbacteria genome, and two circular megaphage genomes from 19 public and published datasets. We demonstrate findings that would likely be difficult without circularizing genomes, including that ribosomal genes are likely not operonic in the majority of CPR, and that some CPR harbor diverged forms of RNase P RNA.

    "abstract": "There is growing research interest in the neural mechanisms underlying the recognition of material categories and properties. This research field, however, is relatively more recent and limited compared to investigations of the neural mechanisms underlying object and scene category recognition. Motion is particularly important for the perception of non-rigid materials, but the neural basis of non-rigid material motion remains unexplored. Using fMRI, we investigated which brain regions respond preferentially to material motion versus other types of motion. We introduce a new database of stimuli - dynamic dot materials - that are animations of moving dots that induce vivid percepts of various materials in motion, e.g. flapping cloth, liquid waves, wobbling jelly. Control stimuli were scrambled versions of these same animations and rigid three-dimensional rotating dots. Results showed that isolating material motion properties with dynamic dots (in contrast with other kinds of motion) activates a network of cortical regions in both ventral and dorsal visual pathways, including areas normally associated with the processing of surface properties and shape, and extending to somatosensory and premotor cortices. We suggest that such a widespread preference for material motion is due to strong associations between stimulus properties. For example viewing dots moving in a specific pattern not only elicits percepts of material motion; one perceives a flexible, non-rigid shape, identifies the object as a cloth flapping in the wind, infers the objects weight under gravity, and anticipates how it would feel to reach out and touch the material. These results are a first important step in mapping out the cortical architecture and dynamics in material-related motion processing.",

    "abstract": "Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a microbial process that can efficiently degrade organic waste into renewable energies such as methane-rich biogas. However, the underpinning microbial mechanisms are highly vulnerable to a wide range of inhibitory compounds, leading to process failure and economic losses. High-throughput sequencing technologies enable the identification of microbial indicators of digesters inhibition and can provide new insights into the key phylotypes at stake during AD process. But yet, current studies have used different inocula, substrates, geographical sites and types of reactors, resulting in indicators that are not robust or reproducible across independent studies. In addition, such studies focus on the identification of a single microbial indicator that is not reflective of the complexity of AD. Our study proposes the first analysis of its kind that seeks for a robust signature of microbial indicators of phenol and ammonia inhibitions, whilst leveraging on 4 independent in-house and external AD microbial studies. We applied a recent multivariate integrative method on two-in-house studies to identify such signature, then predicted the inhibitory status of samples from two datasets with more than 90% accuracy. Our study demonstrates how we can efficiently analyze existing studies to extract robust microbial community patterns, predict AD inhibition, and deepen our understanding of AD towards better AD microbial management.\n\nHighlightsO_LIRobust biomarkers of AD inhibition were tagged by integrating independent 16S studies\nC_LIO_LIIncrease of the Clostridiales relative abundance is an early warning of AD inhibition\nC_LIO_LICloacimonetes is associated with good performance of biomethane production\nC_LIO_LIMultivariate model predicts ammonia inhibition with 90% accuracy in external data\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Navigation can be directed toward distant targets represented within the brains spatial maps; alternatively, navigation can be directed toward objects in the local environment. Here we identify neurons in the Drosophila brain that integrate these two types of navigation drives. These neurons send axonal projections to the ventral nerve cord, and their activity predicts and influences steering during walking. Meanwhile, their dendrites integrate steering signals from the compass in the brains spatial memory center, as well as stimulus-directed steering signals from multimodal sensory pathways that bypass the compass. Using a computational model, we show how the specific connectivity of this network can generate steering behavior directed toward internal (remembered) goals, and we show how environmental cues can dynamically alter the balance of stimulus- and memory-directed steering. Our results suggest a framework where motor dynamics emerge from the integration of parallel feedback loops that drive steering toward internal versus external goals.",

However, despite their importance and the large application of deep learning in computational biology for classification tasks, there are few studies of deep learning and neural networks for piRNAs prediction. Therefore, this paper presents an investigation on deep feedforward networks models for classification of transposon-derived piRNAs. We analyze and compare the results of the neural networks in different hyperparameters choices, such as number of layers, activation functions and optimizers, clarifying the advantages and disadvantages of each configuration. From this analysis, we propose a model for human piRNAs classification and compare our method with the state-of-the-art deep neural network for piRNA prediction in the literature and also traditional machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, showing that our model has achieved a great performance with an F-measure value of 0.872, outperforming the state-of-the-art method in the literature.",

    "abstract": "We have previously described a novel temporal encoding mechanism in the somatosensory system, where mechanical pulses grouped into periodic bursts create a perceived tactile frequency based on the duration of the silent gap between bursts, rather than the mean rate or the periodicity. This coding strategy may offer new opportunities for transmitting information to the brain using various sensory neural prostheses and haptic interfaces. However, it was not known whether the same coding mechanisms apply when using electrical stimulation, which recruits a different spectrum of afferents. Here, we demonstrate that the predictions of the burst gap coding model for frequency perception apply to burst stimuli delivered with electrical pulses, re-emphasising the importance of the temporal structure of spike patterns in neural processing and perception of tactile stimuli. Reciprocally, the electrical stimulation data confirm that the results observed with mechanical stimulation do indeed depend on neural processing mechanisms in the central nervous system, and are not due to skin mechanical factors and resulting patterns of afferent activation.",

Genome-wide sequencing has produced a catalogue of millions of somatic mutations, which contain the evolutionary history of the cancers. However, the connection between the mutation accumulation and disease development and risks is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed more than 1,200,000 mutations from 5,000 cancer patients with whole-exome sequencing, and discovered two novel signatures for 16 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A strong correlation between Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and the Patient Age at Diagnosis (PAD) is observed for cancers with low TMB (mean value less than 3 mutations per million base pairs) but is absent in cancers with high TMB. We also validate this finding using whole-genome sequencing data from more than 2,000 patients for 24 cancer types. Surprisingly, the differences in cancer risk between the sexes are also mainly driven by the disparity in mutation burden. The TMB variations, imprinted at the chromosome level, also reflect accumulation of mutation clusters within small chromosome segments in high TMB cancers. By analyzing the characteristics of mutations based on multi-region sequencing, we found that a combination of TMB and intratumor heterogeneity could a potential biomarker for predicting the patient survival and response to treatment.",

This work involved sophisticated data collection and analysis techniques to use data from PubMed, Wikipedia, and WikiData, and study it with respect to the above mentioned axes. Importantly, I employ state-of-the-art analysis and visualization techniques from natural language processing (NLP) to understand the topics in retracted literature. To highlight a few results, the analyses demonstrate an increasing rate of retraction over time and noticeable differences in the publication quality (as measured by journal impact factor) among top countries. Moreover, while molecular biology and cancer dominate retractions, we also see a number of retractions not related to biology. The methods and results of this study can be applied to continuously understand the nature and evolution of retractions in life sciences, thus contributing to the health of this research ecosystem.",

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors provide an effective treatment for these diseases, they generally do not kill leukemic stem cells. Leukemic stem cells are cancer-initiating cells that compete with normal hematopoietic stem cells for the bone marrow niche. Using BCR-Abl as a model oncogene, we performed a drug screen based on competition between isogenic untransformed cells and BCR-Abl-transformed cells, and identified several compounds that selectively target BCR-Abl-transformed cells. Systems-level analysis of one of these novel compounds, DJ34, revealed that it induced depletion of c-Myc and activation of p53. c-Myc depletion occurred in a wide range of tumor types, including leukemia, lymphoma, lung, glioblastoma and breast cancer. Further analyses revealed that DJ34 interferes with c-Myc synthesis at the level of transcription, and we provide data showing that DJ34 is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor. Physiologically, DJ34 induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and cell differentiation, and primary leukemic stem cells were particularly sensitive to DJ34. Taken together, we have identified a novel compound that dually targets c-Myc and p53 in a wide variety of cancers, and with particularly strong activity against leukemic stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Genomic rearrangements can modify gene function by altering transcript sequences, and have been shown to be drivers in both cancer and rare diseases. Although there are now many methods to detect structural variants from Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) remains under-utilised as a technology for the detection of gene altering structural variants. Calling fusion genes from RNA-seq data is well established, but other transcriptional variants such as fusions with novel sequence, tandem duplications, large insertions and deletions, and novel splicing are difficult to detect using existing approaches.\n\nTo identify all types of variants in transcriptomes, we developed MINTIE, an integrated pipeline for RNA-seq data. We take a reference free approach, which combines de novo assembly of transcripts with differential expression analysis, to identify up-regulated novel variants in a case sample.\n\nWe validated MINTIE on simulated and real data sets and compared it with eight other approaches for finding novel transcriptional variants. We found MINTIE was able to detect >85% of variants while no other method was able to achieve this.\n\nWe applied MINTIE to RNA-seq data from a cohort of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient samples and identified several clinically relevant variants, including a recurrent unpartnered fusion involving the tumour suppressor gene RB1, and variants in ALL-associated genes: tandem duplications in IKZF1 and PAX5, and novel splicing in ETV6. We further demonstrate the utility of MINTIE to identify rare disease variants using RNA-seq, including the discovery of an inter-chromosomal translocation in the DMD gene in a patient with muscular dystrophy. We posit that MINTIE will be able to identify new disease variants across a range of cancers and other disease types.",

However, this integrated stress response is acute and cannot resolve lasting stress. Here we report that TyrRS, a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family capable of responding to diverse stress factors through cytosol-nucleus translocation and activating stress-response genes, also inhibits global translation, however at a later stage than eIF2/ATF4 and mTOR responses. Excluding TyrRS from the nucleus over-activates protein synthesis and increases apoptosis in cells under prolonged oxidative stress. Nuclear TyrRS transcriptionally represses translation genes by recruiting TRIM28 and/or NuRD complex. We propose TyrRS, possibly along with other family members, can sense a variety of stress signals through intrinsic properties of this enzyme and its strategically located nuclear localization signal and integrate them by nucleus-translocation to effect protective responses against prolonged stress.",

The steady-state algebraic equation reported here removes any restrictions on the relative magnitude of microscopic rate constants. The resulting formula was used in heuristic simulations designed to test the performance of the standard rapid-equilibrium kinetic model. The results show that if the inactivation rate constant is significantly higher than the dissociation rate constant, the conventional \"kobs\" method is incapable of correctly distinguishing between the two-step inhibition mechanism and a simpler one-step variant, E + I [-&gt;] EI, even for inhibitors that have very high binding affinity in the reversible noncovalent step.",

We have addressed the molecular basis for this intramolecular communication by analyzing the structure and functional properties of the SERCA mutant E340A. The mutated Glu340 residue is strictly conserved among the P-type ATPase family of membrane transporters and is located at a seemingly strategic position at the interface between the phosphorylation domain and the cytosolic ends of five out of SERCAs ten transmembrane helices. The mutant displays a marked slowing of the Ca2+-binding kinetics, and its crystal structure in the presence of Ca2+ and ATP analogue reveals a rotated headpiece, altered connectivity between the cytosolic domains and altered hydrogen bonding pattern around residue 340. Supported by molecular dynamics simulations, we conclude that the E340A mutation causes a stabilization of the Ca2+ sites in a more occluded state, hence displaying slowed dynamics. This finding underpins a crucial role of Glu340 in inter-domain communication between the headpiece and the Ca2+-binding transmembrane region.",

    "abstract": "Environmental composition is a major, though poorly understood determinant of microbiome dynamics. Here we ask whether general principles govern how key microbial community properties, i.e. yield and diversity, scale with the number of environmental molecules. By assembling hundreds of synthetic consortia, we found that community yield remains constant as a function of environmental complexity, in agreement with additive expectations of an idealized model. However, taxonomic diversity is much lower than expected. By quantifying this deviation with a metric for epistatic interactions between environments, we uncovered simple ecological rules that govern how communities respond nonlinearly to the coupling of different nutrient sets. Our results demonstrate that environmental complexity alone is not sufficient for maintaining microbiome diversity, and provide practical guidance for designing and controlling microbial communities.",

This study characterizes cognitive state dynamics during story comprehension and the corresponding network-level reconfiguration of the whole brain. We presented movie clips of temporally scrambled sequences, eliciting fluctuations in subjective feelings of understanding. An understanding occurred when processing events with high causal relations to previous events. Functional neuroimaging results showed that, during moments of understanding, the brain entered into a functionally integrated state with increased activation in the default mode network (DMN). Large-scale neural state transitions were synchronized across individuals who comprehended the same stories, with increasing occurrences of the DMN-dominant state. The time-resolved functional connectivities predicted changing cognitive states, and the predictive model was generalizable when tested on new stories. Taken together, these results suggest that the brain adaptively reconfigures its interactive states as we construct narratives to causally coherent structures.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) contributes to gene diversification in cells, but the importance of AS during germline development remains largely undefined. Here, we interrupted pre-mRNA splicing events controlled by epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 (ESRP1) and found that it induced female infertility in mice. Germline-specific knockout of Esrp1 perturbed spindle organization, chromosome alignment, and metaphase-to-anaphase transformation in oocytes. The first polar body extrusion (PBE) was blocked during oocyte meiosis and was found to be due to abnormal activation of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and insufficiency of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) in Esrp1-knockout oocytes. Esrp1-knockout in oocytes hampered follicular development and ovulation; eventually, premature ovarian failure (POF) occurred in six-month-old Esrp1-knockout mouse. Using single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, 528 aberrant AS events of maternal mRNA transcripts were revealed and were preferentially associated with microtubule cytoskeletal organization in Esrp1-knockout oocytes. Notably, we found that loss of ESRP1 disturbed a comprehensive set of gene-splicing sites--including those within Trb53bp1, Rac1, Bora, Kif2c, Kif23, Ndel1, Kif3a, Cenpa, and Lsm14b--that ultimately caused abnormal spindle organization. Taken together, our findings provide the first report elucidating the AS program of maternal mRNA transcripts, mediated by the splicing factor, ESRP1, that is required for oocyte meiosis and female fertility in mice.",

    "abstract": "Regeneration of Drosophila imaginal discs, larval precursors to adult tissues, produces a systemic response, a regeneration checkpoint that coordinates regenerative growth with developmental progression. This regeneration checkpoint is coordinated by the release of the relaxin-family peptide Dilp8 from regenerating tissues. Secreted Dilp8 protein can be detected within the imaginal disc lumen. The disc epithelium separates from the lumen from the larval hemolymph and the targets for Dilp8 activity in the brain and prothoracic gland. Here we demonstrate that the imaginal disc epithelial barrier limits Dilp8 signaling and checkpoint delay. We also observe that the wing imaginal disc barrier becomes more restrictive during development, becoming impermeable only at end of the final larval instar. This change in barrier permeability is driven by the steroid hormone ecdysone and correlates with changes in localization of Coracle, a component of the septate junctions that is required for the late, impermeable epithelial barrier. Based on these observations, we propose that the imaginal disc epithelial barrier regulates the duration of the regenerative checkpoint, providing a mechanism by which tissue function can signal the completion of regeneration.\n\nSummary StatementEcdysone signaling directs the Drosophila third instar imaginal disc epithelial barrier to mature, becoming more restrictive. This mature barrier limits Dilp8 signaling and determines the duration of the regeneration checkpoint.",

    "abstract": "Studying the evolutionary history of gene families is a challenging and exciting task with a wide range of implications. In addition to exploring fundamental questions about the origin and evolution of genes, disentangling their evolution is also critical to those who do functional/structural studies to allow a deeper and more precise interpretation of their results in an evolutionary context. The sirtuin gene family is a group of genes that are involved in a variety of biological functions mostly related to aging. Their duplicative history is an open question, as well as the definition of the repertoire of sirtuin genes among vertebrates. Our results show a well-resolved phylogeny that represents an improvement in our understanding of the duplicative history of the sirtuin gene family. We identified a new sirtuin gene family member (SIRT3.2) that was apparently lost in the last common ancestor of amniotes but retained in all other groups of jawed vertebrates. According to our experimental analyses, elephant shark SIRT3.2 protein is located in mitochondria, the overexpression of which leads to an increase in cellular levels of ATP. Moreover, in vitro analysis demonstrated it has deacetylase activity being modulated in a similar way to mammalian SIRT3. Our results indicate that there are at least eight sirtuin paralogs among vertebrates and that all of them can be traced back to the last common ancestor of the group that existed between 676 and 615 millions of years ago.",

From these 163 classes, 60 classes were detected with both techniques, whilst LESA-MS/MS and 3D OrbiSIMS individually allowed the detection of another 83 and 20 unique metabolite classes, respectively. Through data fusion and multivariate analysis, we were able to identify key metabolites and corresponding pathways predictive of tumor relapse which were retrospectively confirmed using gene expression analysis with publicly available data.

We studied a microbial community with more than 100 different types of species which evolved in a 15-years old bioreactor with benzene as the main carbon and free energy source and nitrate as the electron acceptor. We demonstrate that only a few community members are able to degrade benzene, and that most of the others feed on the metabolic left-overs or on the contents of dead cells making up a food web with different trophic levels. As a result of niche partitioning, a high species richness is maintained and the complexity of a natural community is stabilized in a relatively simple environment.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) can be used as a proxy for mitochondrial function and is associated with a number of aging-related diseases. However, it is unclear how mtDNA-CN measured in blood can reflect risk for diseases that primarily manifest in other tissues. Using the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project, we interrogated the relationships between mtDNA-CN measured in whole blood and gene expression from whole blood as well as 47 additional tissues.\n\nResultsWe evaluated associations between blood-derived mtDNA-CN and gene expression in whole blood for 418 individuals, correcting for known confounders and surrogate variables derived from RNA-sequencing. Using a permutation-derived cutoff (p<2.70e-6), mtDNA-CN was significantly associated with expression for 721 genes in whole blood, including nuclear genes that are required for mitochondrial DNA replication. Significantly enriched pathways included splicing (p=1.03e-8) and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (p=2.4e-10). Genes with target sequences for the mitochondrial transcription factor NRF1 were also enriched (p=1.76e-35).\n\nIn non-blood tissues, there were more significantly associated genes than expected in 30 out of 47 tested tissues, suggesting that global gene expression in those tissues is correlated with mtDNA-CN. Pathways that were associated in multiple tissues included RNA-binding, catalysis, and neurodegenerative disease. We evaluated the association between mtDNA-CN and incident neurodegenerative disease in an independent dataset, the UK Biobank, using a Cox proportional-hazards model. Higher mtDNA-CN was significantly associated with lower risk for incident neurodegenerative disease (HR=0.73, 95% CI= 0.66;0.90).\n\nConclusionsThe observation that mtDNA-CN measured in whole blood is associated with gene expression in other tissues suggests that blood-derived mtDNA-CN can reflect metabolic health across multiple tissues. Key pathways in maintaining cellular homeostasis, including splicing, RNA binding, and catalytic genes were significantly associated with mtDNA-CN, reinforcing the importance of mitochondria in aging-related disease. As a specific example, genes involved in neurodegenerative disease were significantly enriched in multiple tissues. This finding, validated in a large independent cohort study showing an inverse association between mtDNA-CN and neurodegenerative disease, solidifies the link between blood-derived mtDNA-CN, altered gene expression in both blood and non-blood tissues, and aging-related disease.",

This cross-species phenomenon is often explained by \"efficient coding\", whereby more neurons show sharper tuning for the orientations most common in natural vision. However, it is unclear if experience alone can account for such biases. Here, we measured orientation representations in a convolutional neural network, VGG-16, trained on modified versions of ImageNet (rotated by 0{degrees}, 22.5{degrees}, or 45{degrees} counter-clockwise of upright). Discriminability for each model was highest near the orientations that were most common in the networks training set. Furthermore, there was an over-representation of narrowly tuned units selective for the most common orientations. These effects emerged in middle layers and increased with depth in the network. Biases emerged early in training, consistent with the possibility that non-uniform representations may play a functional role in the networks task performance. Together, our results suggest that biased orientation representations can emerge through experience with a non-uniform distribution of orientations, supporting the efficient coding hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Land-use intensification has contrasting effects on different ecosystem services, often leading to land-use conflicts. While multiple studies have demonstrated how landscape-scale strategies can minimise the trade-off between agricultural production and biodiversity conservation, little is known about which land-use strategies maximise the landscape-level supply of multiple ecosystem services (landscape multifunctionality), a common goal of stakeholder communities.\n\nWe combine comprehensive data collected from 150 German grassland sites with a simulation approach to identify landscape compositions, with differing proportions of low-, medium-, and high-intensity grasslands, that minimise trade-offs between the six main grassland ecosystem services prioritised by local stakeholders: biodiversity conservation, aesthetic value, productivity, carbon storage, foraging, and regional identity. Results are made accessible through an online tool that provides information on which compositions best meet any combination of user-defined priorities (https://neyret.shinyapps.io/landscape_composition_for_multifunctionality/).\n\nResults show that an optimal landscape composition can be identified for any pattern of ecosystem service priorities. However, multifunctionality was similar and low for all landscape compositions in cases where there are strong trade-offs between services (e.g. aesthetic value and fodder production), where many services were prioritised, and where drivers other than land use played an important role. We also found that if moderate service levels are deemed acceptable, then strategies in which both high and low intensity grasslands are present can deliver landscape multifunctionality. The tool presented can aid informed decision-making by predicting the impact of future changes in landscape composition, and by allowing for the relative roles of stakeholder priorities and biophysical trade-offs to be understood by scientists and practitioners alike.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAn online tool identifies optimal landscape compositions for desired ecosystem services\nC_LIO_LIWhen the desired services are synergic, the optimum is their common best landscape composition\nC_LIO_LIWhen the desired services trade-off, a mix of grassland intensity is most multifunctional\nC_LIO_LISuch tools could support decision-making processes and aid conflict resolution\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/208199v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3273f6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5b3a5aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@153f526org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@103cbea_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Some of the most impressive functional specialization in the human brain is found in occipitotemporal cortex (OTC), where several areas exhibit selectivity for a small number of visual categories, such as faces and bodies, and spatially cluster based on stimulus animacy. Previous studies suggest this animacy organization reflects the representation of an intuitive taxonomic hierarchy, distinct from the presence of face- and body-selective areas in OTC. Using human fMRI, we investigated the independent contribution of these two factors - the face-body division and taxonomic hierarchy - in accounting for the animacy organization of OTC, and whether they might also be reflected in the architecture of several deep neural networks. We found that graded selectivity based on animal resemblance to human faces and bodies masquerades as an apparent animacy continuum, which suggests that taxonomy is not a separate factor underlying the organization of the ventral visual pathway.",

    "abstract": "Rhythmic limb movements during locomotion are controlled by a central pattern generator (CPG) circuits located in the spinal cord. It is considered that these circuits are composed of individual rhythm generators (RGs) for each limb interacting with each other through multiple commissural and long propriospinal circuits. The organization and operation of each RG are not fully understood, and different competing theories exist about interactions between its flexor and extensor components, as well as about left-right commissural interactions between the RGs. The central idea of circuit organization proposed in this study is that with an increase of excitatory input to each RGs (or an increase in locomotor speed) the rhythmogenic mechanism within the RGs changes from \"flexor-driven\" rhythmicity to a \"classical half-center\" mechanism. We test this hypothesis using our experimental data on changes in duration of stance and swing phases in the intact and spinal cats walking on the ground or tied-belt treadmills (symmetric conditions) or split-belt treadmills with different left and right belt speeds (asymmetric conditions). We compare these experimental data with the results of mathematical modeling, in which simulated CPG circuits operate in similar symmetric and asymmetric conditions with matching or differing control drives to the left and right RGs. The obtained results support the proposed concept of state-dependent changes in RG operation and specific commissural interactions between the RGs. The performed simulations and mathematical analysis of model operation under different conditions provide new insights into CPG network organization and limb coordination during locomotion.\n\nKey Point SummaryO_LILimb movements during locomotion are controlled by neural circuits located within the spinal cord.

Here, we evaluate how well the simple Arrhenius equation predicts complex multistep biological processes, using frog and fruit fly embryogenesis as two canonical models. We find the Arrhenius equation provides a good approximation for the temperature dependence of embryogenesis, even though individual developmental stages scale differently with temperature. At low and high temperatures, however, we observed significant departures from idealized Arrhenius Law behavior. When we model multistep reactions of idealized chemical networks we are unable to generate comparable deviations from linearity. In contrast, we find the single enzyme GAPDH shows non-linearity in the Arrhenius plot similar to our observations of embryonic development. Thus, we find that complex embryonic development can be well approximated by the simple Arrhenius Law and propose that the observed departure from this law results primarily from non-idealized individual steps rather than the complexity of the system.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic represents an ongoing global crisis that has already impacted over 13 million people. The responses of specific immune cell populations to the disease remain poorly defined, which hinders improvements in treatment and care management. Here, we utilized mass cytometry (CyTOF) to thoroughly phenotype peripheral myeloid cells and T lymphocytes from 30 convalescent patients with mild, moderate, and severe cases of COVID-19. We identified 10 clusters of monocytes and dendritic cells and 17 clusters of T cells. Examination of these clusters revealed that both CD14+CD16+ intermediate and CD14dimCD16+ nonclassical monocytes, as well as CD4+ stem cell memory T (TSCM) cells, correlated with COVID-19 severity, coagulation factor levels, and/or inflammatory indicators. We also identified two nonclassical monocyte subsets distinguished by expression of the sugar residue 6-Sulfo LacNac (Slan). One of these subsets (Slanlo, nMo1) was depleted in moderately and severely ill patients, while the other (Slanhi, nMo2) increased with disease severity and was linked to CD4+ T effector memory (TEM) cell frequencies, coagulation factors, and inflammatory indicators. Intermediate monocytes tightly correlated with loss of naive T cells as well as an increased abundance of effector memory T cells expressing the exhaustion marker PD-1. Our data suggest that both intermediate and non-classical monocyte subsets shape the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In summary, our study provides both broad and in-depth characterization of immune cell phenotypes in response to COVID-19 and suggests functional interactions between distinct cell types during the disease.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUse of mass cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients allows correlation of distinct monocyte and T lymphocyte subsets with clinical factors.",

As both Spike protein and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) - a pro-nociceptive and angiogenic factor, bind NRP-1, we tested if Spike could block VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling. VEGF-A-triggered sensory neuronal firing was blocked by Spike protein and NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229. Pro-nociceptive behaviors of VEGF-A were similarly blocked via suppression of spontaneous spinal synaptic activity and reduction of electrogenic currents in sensory neurons. Remarkably, preventing VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling was antiallodynic in a neuropathic pain model.

    "abstract": "Individualized treatment of acute stroke depends on the timely detection of ischemia and potentially salvageable tissue in the brain. Using functional MRI (fMRI), it is possible to characterize cerebral blood flow from blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals without the administration of exogenous contrast agents. In this study, we applied spatial independent component analysis to resting-state fMRI data of 37 stroke patients scanned within 24 hours of symptom onset, 17 of whom received follow-up scans the next day. Our analysis revealed \"Hypoperfusion spatially-Independent Components\" (HICs) whose spatial patterns of BOLD signal resembled regions of delayed perfusion depicted by dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI. These HICs were detected even in the presence of excessive patient motion, and disappeared following successful tissue reperfusion. The unique spatial and temporal features of HICs allowed them to be distinguished with high accuracy from other components in a user-independent manner (AUC = 0.95, accuracy = 0.96, sensitivity = 1.00, specificity = 0.96). Our study therefore presents a new, non-invasive method for assessing blood flow in acute stroke that minimizes interpretative subjectivity and is robust to severe patient motion.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile is a major cause of hospital-acquired infections leading to antibiotic-associated diarrhea. C. difficile exhibits a very high level of resistance to lysozyme. Bacteria commonly resist lysozyme through modification of the cell wall. In C. difficile {sigma}V is required for lysozyme resistance and {sigma}V is activated in response to lysozyme. Once activated {sigma}V, encoded by csfV, directs transcription of genes necessary for lysozyme resistance. Here we analyze the contribution of individual genes in the csfV regulon to lysozyme resistance. Using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutagenesis we constructed in-frame deletions of single genes in the csfV operon. We find pdaV, which encodes a peptidoglycan deacetylase, is partially responsible for lysozyme resistance. We then performed CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) to identify a second peptidoglycan deacetylase, pgdA, that is important for lysozyme resistance. Deletion of either pgdA or pdaV resulted in modest decreases in lysozyme resistance. However, deletion of both pgdA and pdaV resulted in a 1000-fold decrease in lysozyme resistance. Further, muropeptide analysis revealed loss of either PgdA or PdaV had modest effects on peptidoglycan deacetylation but loss of both PgdA and PdaV resulted in almost complete loss of peptidoglycan deacetylation. This suggests that PgdA and PdaV are redundant peptidoglycan deacetylases. We also use CRISPRi to compare other lysozyme resistance mechanisms and conclude that peptidoglycan deacetylation is the major mechanism of lysozyme resistance in C. difficile.\n\nImportanceClostridioides difficile is the leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea. C. difficile is highly resistant to lysozyme. We previously showed that the csfV operon is required for lysozyme resistance. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutagenesis and CRISPRi knockdown to show that peptidoglycan deacetylation is necessary for lysozyme resistance and is the major lysozyme resistance mechanism in C. difficile. We show that two peptidoglycan deacetylases in C. difficile are partially redundant and are required for lysozyme resistance. PgdA provides an intrinsic level of deacetylation and PdaV, encoded as part of the csfV operon, provides lysozyme-induced peptidoglycan deacetylation.",

Members of this bacterial genus are known to parasitise a wide array of metazoans including vertebrates. Whilst much research has been significant targeted at parasitic mammalian mycoplasmas, very little is known about their role in other vertebrates. In the current study, we aim to explore the biology and evolution of Mycoplasma in salmonids, including cellular niche, genome size structure and gene content. Using Fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH), mycoplasmas were identified in epithelial tissues across the digestive tract (stomach, pyloric caecum and midgut) during the developmental stages (eggs, parr, subadult) of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), showing a high abundance in acidic compartments. With high throughput sequencing from subadults farmed Atlantic salmon, we assembled a nearly complete genome (~0.57 MB) via shotgun-metagenomics. The phylogenetic inference from the recovered genome revealed successful taxonomic proximity to Mycoplasma penetrans (~1.36 Mb) from the recovered genome. Although, no significant correlation between genome size and its phylogeny was observed, we recovered functional signatures, especially, riboflavin encoding genes pathway and sugars transporters, suggesting a symbiotic relationship between Mycoplasma and the host. Though 247 strains of Mycoplasma are available in public databases, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate ecological and functional association between Mycoplasma and Salmo salar which delineates symbiotic reductive evolution and genome erosion primarily and also serves as a proxy for salmonid health in aquaculture processes (cell lines, in vitro gut models).",

    "abstract": "Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) contamination of agricultural water might be an important factor to recent foodborne illness and outbreaks involving leafy greens. Whole genome sequencing generation of closed bacterial genomes plays an important role in source tracking. We aimed to determine the limits of detection and classification of STECs by qPCR and nanopore sequencing using enriched irrigation water artificially contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 (EDL933). We determined the limit of STEC detection by qPCR to be 30 CFU/reaction, which is equivalent to 105 CFU/ml in the enrichment. By using Oxford Nanopores EPI2ME WIMP workflow and de novo assembly with Flye followed by taxon classification with a k-mer analysis software (Kraken), E. coli O157:H7 could be detected at 103 CFU/ml (68 reads) and a complete fragmented E. coli O157:H7 metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) was obtained at 105-108 CFU/ml. Using a custom script to extract the E. coli reads, a completely closed MAG was obtained at 107-108 CFU/ml and a complete, fragmented MAG was obtained at 105-106 CFU/ml. In silico virulence detection for E. coli MAGs for 105-108 CFU/ml showed that the virulotype was indistinguishable from the spiked E. coli O157:H7 strain. We further identified the bacterial species in the un-spiked enrichment, including antimicrobial resistance genes, which could have important implications to food safety. We propose this workflow could be used for detection and complete genomic characterization of STEC from a complex microbial sample and could be applied to determine the limit of detection and assembly of other foodborne bacterial pathogens.\n\nIMPORTANCEFoodborne illness caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) ranges in severity from diarrhea to hemolytic uremic syndrome and produce-related incidence is increasing. The pervasive nature of E. coli requires not only detection, but also a complete genome to determine potential pathogenicity based on stx and eae genes, serotype, and other virulence factors. We have developed a pipeline to determine the limits of nanopore sequencing for STECs in a metagenomic sample. By utilizing the current qPCR in the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) Chapter 4A, we can quantify the amount of STEC in the enrichment and then sequence and classify the STEC in less than half the time as current protocols that require a single isolate. These methods have wide implications for food safety, including decreased time to STEC identification during outbreaks, characterization of the microbial community, and the potential to use these methods to determine the limits for other foodborne pathogens.",

Cas12a cleaves DNA within human nucleosomes and phase-condensed nucleosome arrays. Using quantitative kinetics approaches, we show that dynamic nucleosome unwrapping regulates DNA target accessibility to Cas12a. Nucleosome unwrapping determines the extent to which both steps of Cas12a binding-PAM recognition and R-loop formation-are inhibited by the nucleosome. Nucleosomes inhibit Cas12a binding even beyond the canonical core particle. Relaxing DNA wrapping within the nucleosome by reducing DNA bendability, adding histone modifications, or introducing a target-proximal nuclease-inactive Cas9 enhances DNA cleavage rates over 10-fold. Surprisingly, Cas12a readily cleaves DNA linking nucleosomes within chromatin-like phase separated nucleosome arrays--with DNA targeting reduced only ~4-fold. This work provides a mechanism for the observation that on-target cleavage within nucleosomes occurs less often than off-target cleavage within nucleosome-depleted regions of cells. We conclude that nucleosome wrapping restricts accessibility to CRISPR-Cas nucleases and anticipate that increasing nucleosome breathing dynamics will improve DNA binding and cleavage in eukaryotic cells.",

Ex vivo mechanistic studies revealed that PARPi-induced DNA double strand break-associated microvesicles released from tumor cells, coupled with PI3Ki-mediated c-GAS de-repression, were both required for macrophage cGAS/STING pathway activation.

    "abstract": "Extended synaptotagmins (E-Syts) are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins consisting of an SMP domain and multiple C2 domains that bind phospholipids and Ca2+. E-Syts create contact junctions between the ER and plasma membrane to facilitate lipid exchange. During adipocyte differentiation, the proteasome-based removal of the C2C domain results in targeting of E-Syt3 to the primordial cisterna, a previously undescribed giant annular organelle that mothers the LDs. Further cleavage causes the E-Syt3 relocation to the surface of LDs. Fragmentation of the primordial cisterna and LD budding into its lumen are early events in the biogenesis of LDs in the 3T3-L1 adipocyte. Electron tomography-based 3D reconstruction of the fragmented primordial cisterna revealed patches of a tightly packed E-Syt3-rich network of varicose tubules in close contact with young LDs. Esyt3 binds avidly phosphatidylethanolamine through its SMP domain, a main component of the LD membrane that fosters LD biogenesis. Repression of E-Syt3 effectively inhibits LD biogenesis and growth.",

    "abstract": "Many bacterial genes are regulated by RNA elements in their 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). However, the full complement of these elements is not known even in the model bacterium Escherichia coli. Using complementary RNA-sequencing approaches, we detected large numbers of 3' ends in 5' UTRs and open reading frames (ORFs), suggesting extensive regulation by premature transcription termination. We documented regulation for multiple transcripts, including spermidine induction involving Rho and translation of an upstream ORF for an mRNA encoding a spermidine efflux pump. In addition to discovering novel sites of regulation, we detected short, stable RNA fragments derived from 5' UTRs and sequences internal to ORFs. Characterization of three of these transcripts, including an RNA internal to an essential cell division gene, revealed that they have independent functions as sRNA sponges. Thus, these data uncover an abundance of cis- and trans-acting RNA regulators in bacterial 5' UTRs and internal to ORFs.",

Mutations in the drug-binding pocket in VP1 (C199R/Y in hRV14; I194F in PV1; M252L and A156T in EV-D68), typical for this class of compounds, were identified. We also observed mutations that are located outside the pocket (K167E in EV-D68 and G149C in hRV2) and that contribute to the resistant phenotype. Remarkably, the G149C substitution made the replication of human rhinovirus 2 dependent on the presence of vapendavir. Our data suggest that vapendavir binding to the capsid of the dependent isolate may be required to stabilize the viral particle and to allow efficient dissemination of the virus.

However, how PKG transmits these signals in the absence of known second messenger-dependent calcium channels or scaffolding proteins is unknown. Here we identify a polytopic membrane protein, ICM1, with homology to transporters and calcium channels that is tightly-associated with PKG in both Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood stages and P. berghei gametocytes. Phosphoproteomic analyses in both Plasmodium species reveal multiple ICM1 phosphorylation events dependent upon PKG activity. Stage-specific depletion of P. berghei ICM1 blocks gametogenesis due to the inability of mutant parasites to mobilise intracellular calcium upon PKG activation, whilst conditional loss of P. falciparum ICM1 results in reduced calcium mobilisation, defective egress and lack of invasion. Our findings provide new insights into atypical calcium homeostasis in malaria parasites essential for pathology and disease transmission.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) regulates human metabolism, we used positron emission tomography (PET) of patient lungs along with bioenergetics and metabolomics of patient upper airway cells and fluids. We previously found a significant negative monotonic relationship between glucose uptake and respiratory viral infection in 20 pediatric patients (e.g., 70% of infected patients had glucose uptake within 0-3 days). In our recent study, 3 out of 4 patients positive for glucose uptake at later times (>5 days) were positive for RSV infection. At present, the bioenergetics of upper respiratory cells (URCs) from nasal pharyngeal aspirates have not been investigated, and in vitro studies indicate RSV reduces metabolism in cell lines. To define metabolic changes in RSV-infected pediatric patients, we acquired fresh aspirates from 6 pediatric patients. Immediately following aspiration of URCs, we measured the two major energy pathways using an XFe flux analyzer. Glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration were significantly increased in URCs from RSV-infected patients, and mitochondrial respiration was operating at near maximal levels, resulting in loss of cellular capacity to increase respiration with impaired coupling efficiency. Metabolomics analysis of metabolites flushed from the upper airways confirmed a significant increase in TCA cycle intermediates. Taken together, these studies demonstrate RSV induces significant hypermetabolism in pediatric patients lungs and respiratory tract. Thus, hypermetabolism is a potential anti-viral drug target and reveals RSV can regulate human metabolism.\n\nContributions to the fieldMetabolic changes in humans in response to viral infection are largely unknown. In this brief clinical report, we find metabolism is markedly increased in live upper respiratory cells from infants infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) concomitant to changes in metabolites in their upper airway fluids. This sheds light on viral induced hypermetabolism in the airways and offers potential biomarkers for RSV. In addition, this identifies potential therapeutic targets for host directed therapies of aberrant metabolism in RSV. This work has clinical impact as biomarkers and therapeutics for RSV are needed for this pervasive virus that causes infections with long term consequence for some children. Further, advancements in molecular mechanisms underpinning RSV infection biology are constrained by the difficulties in translating model systems to humans as well as relating human studies in adults to infants (Mestas and Hughes, 2004; Papin et al., 2013).",

    "abstract": "Complex regulatory interactions between genetic and metabolic networks together confer robustness against external and internal perturbations in an organism such as Escherichia coli. In balanced exponential growth, this robustness is attributed to cost-effective metabolism by means of efficient resource allocation coordinated by the interplay of global transcriptional regulators with growth-rate dependent machinery. Here, we reappraise the role of global transcriptional regulators FNR, ArcA and IHF, integral to sustaining proteome-efficiency in anaerobic fermentative conditions, fundamental for optimal growth of E. coli. We reveal at the transcriptome and metabolome level, that absence of these global regulators ensued a disruption of nitrogen homeostasis, overexpression of otherwise unnecessary or hedging genes and impairment in core bottleneck steps and amino acid metabolism. Notably, our findings emphasize their importance in optimizing the metabolic proteome resources essential for rapid exponential growth. Consequentially, the perturbations in the metabolic proteome as a result of deletion of global regulators unbalances the ribosomal proteome share imposing a high translation program, though at the expense of lowered efficiency. We illustrate that disruption of this inherent trade-off between metabolic and ribosomal proteomic investment eventually culminate to lowered growth rates. Despite no changes in gene expression related to glucose import, our findings elucidate that the accumulations of intracellular metabolites directly modulated by growth rate, negatively impacts the glucose uptake. Our results employing the proteome allocation theory and quantitative experimental measurements, suffices to explain the physiological consequences of altered translational and metabolic efficiency in the cell, driven by the loss of these global regulators.",

Rigorous computational methods were employed to understand the molecular pathogenic profile of mutation. The mutant model with the desired mutation was built with I-TASSER. GROMACS 5.0.1 was used to evaluate the effect of a mutation on protein stability and function. Of the 276 missense mutations, 64 were found to be disease-causing. Out of these 64, seven were of cancer-causing mutations. Among these, we evaluated K48R mutation in a computational simulated environment to determine its impact on protein stability and function since K48 position was ascertained to be highly conserved and substitution with arginine could impair the XPD activity. Molecular Dynamic Simulation and Essential Dynamics analysis showed that K48R mutation altered protein structural stability and produced conformational drift. Our predictions thus revealed that K48R mutation could impair the XPD helicase activity and affect its ability to repair the damaged DNA, thus augmenting the risk for cancer.",

    "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the main site of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and requires a high concentration of luminal chaperones to function. During protein synthesis, ER luminal chaperones are swept along the secretory pathway and must be retrieved to maintain cell viability. ER protein retrieval is achieved by the KDEL receptor, which recognises a C-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) sequence. Recognition of ER proteins by the KDEL receptor is pH dependent, with binding occurring under acidic conditions in the Golgi and release under conditions of higher pH in the ER. Recent crystal structures of the KDEL receptor in the apo and peptide bound state suggested that peptide binding drives the formation of a short-hydrogen bond that locks the KDEL sequence in the receptor and activates the receptor for COPI binding in the cytoplasm. Using quantum mechanical calculations we demonstrate that the strength of this short hydrogen bond is reinforced following protonation of a nearby histidine, linking receptor protonation to high affinity peptide binding. Protonation also controls the wetting of a cavity adjacent to the peptide binding site, leading to a conformational change that ultimately allows the complex to be recognized by the COPI system.",

    "abstract": "Complex animals build specialised muscle to match specific biomechanical and energetic needs. Hence, composition and architecture of sarcomeres as well as mitochondria are muscle type specific. However, mechanisms coordinating mitochondria with sarcomere morphogenesis are elusive. Here we use Drosophila muscles to demonstrate that myofibril and mitochondria morphogenesis are intimately linked. In flight muscles, the muscle selector spalt instructs mitochondria to intercalate between myofibrils, which in turn mechanically constrain mitochondria into elongated shapes. Conversely in cross-striated muscles, mitochondria networks surround myofibril bundles, contacting myofibrils only with thin extensions. To investigate the mechanism causing these differences, we manipulated mitochondrial dynamics and found that increased mitochondrial fusion during myofibril assembly prevents mitochondrial intercalation in flight muscles. Strikingly, this coincides with the expression of cross-striated muscle specific sarcomeric proteins. Consequently, flight muscle myofibrils convert towards a partially cross-striated architecture. Together, these data suggest a biomechanical feedback mechanism downstream of spalt synchronizing mitochondria with myofibril morphogenesis.",

Despite its agricultural importance, little is known about the fundamental molecular mechanisms of this pathogen. Understanding of genetic regulation provides new insights into the virus pathogenicity, which can help prevent epidemics. Short-read sequencing (SRS) is able to produce a huge amount of high-precision sequencing reads for transcriptomic profiling, but it is inefficient for the comprehensive annotation of transcriptomes. Long-read sequencing (LRS) is able to overcome some of the limitations of SRS, but they also have drawbacks, such as low-coverage and high error rate. The limitations of the two approaches can be surmounted by the combined use of these techniques. In this study, we used Illumina SRS and Oxford Nanopore Technologies LRS platforms with multiple library preparation methods (amplified and direct cDNA sequencings and native RNA sequencing) for constructing the transcriptomic atlas of ASFV. This work identified a large number of novel genes, transcripts and RNA isoforms, and annotated the precise termini of previously described RNA molecules. In contrast to the current view that the ASFV transcripts are monocistronic, we detected a significant extent of polycistronism. A multifaceted meshwork of transcriptional overlaps is also discovered.",

    "abstract": "Emerging fungal pathogens are a threat to forest and agroecosystems, as well as animal and human health. How pathogens evolve from non-pathogenic ancestors is still poorly understood making the prediction of future outbreaks challenging. Most pathogens have evolved lifestyle adaptations, which were enabled by specific changes in the gene content of the species. Hence, understanding transitions in the functions encoded by genomes gives valuable insight into the evolution of pathogenicity. Here, we studied lifestyle evolution in the genus Cryphonectria, including the prominent invasive pathogen C. parasitica, the causal agent of chestnut blight on Castanea species. We assembled and compared the genomes of pathogenic and putatively non-pathogenic Cryphonectria species, as well as sister group pathogens in the family Cryphonectriaceae (Diaporthales, Ascomycetes) to investigate the evolution of genome size and gene content. We found a striking loss of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism (CAZymes) in C. parasitica compared to other Cryphonectriaceae. Despite substantial CAZyme gene loss, experimental data suggests that C. parasitica has retained wood colonization abilities shared with other Cryphonectria species. Putative effectors substantially varied in number, cysteine content and protein length among species. In contrast, secondary metabolite gene clusters show a high degree of conservation within the genus. Overall, our results underpin the recent lifestyle transition of C. parasitica towards a more pathogenic lifestyle. Our findings suggest that a CAZyme loss may have promoted pathogenicity of C. parasitica on chestnuts. Analyzing gene complements underlying key nutrition modes can facilitate the detection of species with the potential to emerge as pathogens.",

Despite this, there are no studies reporting how diverse, rich, and homogeneous the beer categories are in terms of commercially available brewing yeast strains. In this work, the diversity, richness, and evenness of different beer categories and commercial yeast strains available for brewing were evaluated by applying quantitative concepts of ecology analysis in a sample of 121,528 beer recipes. For this purpose, the frequency of ale or lager and dry or liquid yeast formulations usage was accessed and its influence in the fermentation temperature, attenuation profile, and number of recipes for a beer category were analyzed. The results indicated that many beer categories are preferentially fermented with dry yeast strains formulations instead of liquid yeasts, despite considering the high number of available liquid yeast formulations. Moreover, ale dry strains are preferentially used for lager brewing. The preferential use of specific yeast formulations drives the diversity, richness, and evenness of a beer category, showing that many yeast strains are potentially and industrially underexplored.",

    "abstract": "Metformin (MET), a worldwide used drug for type 2 diabetes, has been found with the largest amount by weight among all drugs in aquatic environment, including the drinking water sources where chlorination inevitably transforms MET into chlorination byproducts. Although MET has health-promoting properties, whether or how its chlorination byproducts affect health remains largely unknown. Here we reveal that MET chlorination byproducts Y (C4H6ClN5) and C (C4H6ClN3) exhibit marked toxicity, even higher than that of the well-known poisonous arsenic, to live worms and human cells. Moreover, both byproducts are harmful to mice and Y at 250 ng/L destroys the mouse small intestine integrity. Strikingly, we detected MET and byproduct C in worldwide drinking water. Both byproducts are increasingly produced with more MET present during chlorination process. Unprecedentedly, we unveil boiling and activated carbon adsorption as effective solutions that are in urgent demand globally for removing these byproducts from water.",

Although the effects of the cellular niche have been investigated for a number of cell types using different molecular approaches, comprehensive assessments of how the global transcriptome responds to 3D scaffolds composed of various extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents are still lacking. In this study, we explored the effect of the biomechanical parameters of Collagen I and Matrigel (ECM) on transcriptional gene regulation in a cell culture system. Using Huh-7 cells cultured on traditional cell culture plates or on the components of the ECM at different concentrations to modulate microenvironment properties, we have generated transcriptome sequencing data that may be further explored to understand the differentiation and growth potential of this cell for the development of 3D cultures. Assessment of the hepatocyte phenotype in relation to our transcriptomic data set would be very useful for the development of systems mimicking the in vivo structure and function of liver cells which still remains a challenge.",

Sample collection under such difficult conditions introduces confounding factors that need to be identified and addressed. We found large changes in the transcriptome of mouse tissues dissected and preserved on-orbit compared to tissues from mice euthanized on-orbit, preserved, and dissected after return to Earth. Changes due to preservation method eclipsed those between flight and ground samples making it difficult to identify spaceflight-specific changes. Follow-on experiments to interrogate the roles of euthanasia methods, tissue and carcass preservation protocols, and library preparation methods suggested that differences due to preservation protocols are exacerbated when coupled with polyA selection.

Secreted UMOD polymerizes (pUMOD) within the lumen, where it regulates salt transport and protects the kidney from bacteria and stone formation. Under various pathological conditions, pUMOD accumulates within the tubular lumen and reaches extratubular sites where it may interact with renal interstitial cells. Here, we investigated the potential of extratubular pUMOD to act as a damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule thereby creating local inflammation. We found that intrascrotal and intraperitoneal injection of pUMOD induced leukocyte recruitment in vivo and led to TNF- secretion by F4/80 positive macrophages. Additionally, pUMOD directly affected vascular permeability and increased neutrophil extravasation independent of macrophage-released TNF-. Interestingly, pUMOD did not directly upregulate adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and did not directly activate {beta}2 integrins on neutrophils. In obstructed neonatal murine kidneys, we observed extratubular UMOD accumulation with tubular atrophy and leukocyte infiltrates. Finally, we found extratubular UMOD deposits associated with peritubular leukocyte infiltration in kidneys from patients with inflammatory kidney diseases. Taken together, we identified extratubular pUMOD as a strong inducer of leukocyte recruitment, underlining its critical role in mounting an inflammatory response in various kidneys pathologies.",

We recently described a Tn7-like transposon from Vibrio cholerae that employs a Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system for RNA-guided transposition, in which Cascade directly recruits transposition proteins to integrate donor DNA downstream of genomic target sites complementary to CRISPR RNA. However, the requirement for multiple expression vectors and low overall integration efficiencies, particularly for large genetic payloads, hindered the practical utility of the transposon. Here, we present a significantly improved INTEGRATE (insertion of transposable elements by guide RNA-assisted targeting) system for targeted, multiplexed, and marker-free DNA integration of up to 10 kilobases at ~100% efficiency. Using multi-spacer CRISPR arrays, we achieved simultaneous multiplex insertions in three genomic loci, and facile multi-loci deletions when combining orthogonal integrases and recombinases. Finally, we demonstrated robust function in other biomedically- and industrially-relevant bacteria, and developed an accessible computational algorithm for guide RNA design. This work establishes INTEGRATE as a versatile and portable tool that enables multiplex and kilobase-scale genome engineering.",

    "abstract": "In 2019 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the first documented cases of severe lung disease COVID-19. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading around the globe resulting in a severe pandemic with over 500.000 fatalities and large economical and social disruptions in human societies. Gaining knowledge on how SARS-Cov-2 interacts with its host cells and causes COVID-19 is crucial for the intervention of novel therapeutic strategies. SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, is a positive-strand RNA virus. The viral RNA is modified by RNA-modifying enzymes provided by the host cell. Direct RNA sequencing (DRS) using nanopores enables unbiased sensing of canonical and modified RNA bases of the viral transcripts. In this work, we used DRS to precisely annotate the open reading frames and the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RNA modifications. We provide the first DRS data of SARS-CoV-2 in infected human lung epithelial cells. From sequencing three isolates, we derive a robust identification of SARS-CoV-2 modification sites within a physiologically relevant host cell type. A comparison of our data with the DRS data from a previous SARS-CoV-2 isolate, both raised in monkey renal cells, reveals consistent RNA modifications across the viral genome. Conservation of the RNA modification pattern during progression of the current pandemic suggests that this pattern is likely essential for the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and represents a possible target for drug interventions.",

Here we report that mutations in the glycosyl transferase gene smlt0622 in S. maltophilia K279a mutant K M6 cause constitutive activation of SmeDEF production, leading to elevated levofloxacin MIC. Selection of a levofloxacin-resistant K M6 derivative, K M6 LEVR, allowed identification of a novel two-component regulatory system, Smlt2645/6 (renamed as SmaRS). The sensor kinase Smlt2646 (SmaS) is activated by mutation in K M6 LEVR causing over-production of two novel ABC transporters and the known aminoglycoside efflux pump SmeYZ. Over-production of one ABC transporter, Smlt1651-4 (renamed as SmaCDEF) causes levofloxacin resistance in K M6 LEVR. Over-production of the other ABC transporter, Smlt2642/3 (renamed SmaAB) and SmeYZ both contribute to the elevated amikacin MIC against K M6 LEVR. Accordingly, we have identified two novel ABC transporters associated with antimicrobial drug resistance in S. maltophilia, and two novel regulatory systems whose mutation causes resistance to levofloxacin, clinically important as a promising drug for monotherapy against this highly resistant pathogen.",

An increase in the cytoplasmic level of export substrates and gain-of-function mutations in FlhA enhanced protein export at external pH 7.5 in the absence of Na+ in a similar manner to {Delta}{Psi} increase.

    "abstract": "The ability to form biofilms is shared by many microorganisms, including archaea. Cells in a biofilm are encased in extracellular polymeric substances that typically include polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA, conferring protection while providing a structure that allows for optimal nutrient flow. In many bacteria, flagella and evolutionarily conserved type IV pili are required for the formation of biofilms on solid surfaces or floating at the air-liquid interface of liquid media. Similarly, in many archaea it has been demonstrated that type IV pili and, in a subset of these species, archaella are required for biofilm formation on solid surfaces. Additionally, in the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii, chemotaxis and AglB-dependent glycosylation play important roles in this process. H. volcanii also forms immersed biofilms in liquid cultures poured into Petri dishes. This study reveals that mutants of this haloarchaeon that interfere with the biosynthesis of type IV pili or archaella, as well as a chemotaxis-targeting transposon and aglB-deletion mutants, lack obvious defects in biofilms formed in liquid cultures. Strikingly, we have observed that these liquid-based biofilms are capable of rearrangement into honeycomb-like patterns that rapidly form upon removal of the Petri dish lid, a phenomenon that is not dependent on changes in light or oxygen concentration but can be induced by controlled reduction of humidity. Taken together, this study demonstrates that H. volcanii requires novel, as-yet-unidentified strategies for immersed liquid biofilm formation and also exhibits rapid structural rearrangements.\n\nImportanceThis first molecular biological study of archaeal immersed liquid biofilms advances our basic-biological understanding of the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. Data gleaned from this study also provide an invaluable foundation for future studies to uncover components required for immersed liquid biofilms in this haloarchaeon and also potentially for liquid biofilm formation in general, which is poorly understood compared to the formation of biofilms on surfaces. Moreover, this first description of rapid honeycomb pattern formation is likely to yield novel insights into the underlying structural architecture of extracellular polymeric substances and cells within immersed liquid biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Even though pericytes have been implicated in various neurological disorders, little is known about their function and signaling pathways in the healthy brain. Here, we characterized cortical pericyte calcium dynamics using two-photon imaging of Pdgfr{beta}-CreERT2;GCaMP6s mice under anesthesia in vivo and in brain slices ex vivo. We found distinct differences between pericyte subtypes in vivo: Ensheathing pericytes exhibited smooth muscle cell-like calcium dynamics, while calcium signals in capillary pericytes were irregular, higher in frequency and occurred in cellular microdomains. In contrast to ensheathing pericytes, capillary pericytes retained their spontaneous calcium signals during prolonged anesthesia and in the absence of blood flow ex vivo. Chemogenetic activation of neurons in vivo and acute increase of extracellular potassium in brain slices strongly decreased calcium activity in capillary pericytes. We propose that neuronal activity-induced elevations in extracellular potassium suppress calcium activity in capillary pericytes, likely mediated by Kir2.2 and KATP channel activation.",

    "abstract": "Centrioles are polarized microtubule-based organelles that seed the formation of cilia, and which assemble from a cartwheel containing stacked ring oligomers of SAS-6 proteins. A cryo-tomography map of centrioles from the termite flagellate Trichonympha spp. was obtained previously, but higher resolution analysis is likely to reveal novel features. Using sub-tomogram averaging (STA) in T. spp. and Trichonympha agilis, we delineate the architecture of centriolar microtubules, pinhead and A-C-linker. Moreover, we report [~]25 [A] resolution maps of the central cartwheel, revealing notably polarized cartwheel inner densities (CID). Furthermore, STA of centrioles from the distant flagellate Teranympha mirabilis uncovers similar cartwheel architecture and a distinct filamentous CID. Fitting the CrSAS-6 crystal structure into the flagellate maps and analyzing cartwheels generated in vitro indicates that SAS-6 rings can directly stack onto one another in two alternating configurations: with a slight rotational offset and in register. Overall, improved STA maps in three flagellates enabled us to unravel novel architectural features, including of centriole polarity and cartwheel stacking, thus setting the stage for an accelerated elucidation of underlying assembly mechanisms.",
