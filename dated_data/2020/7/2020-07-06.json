    "abstract": "BackgroundHumans routinely attempt to manage pest rodent populations with anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs). We require information on resistance to ARs within rodent populations to have effective eradication programs that minimise exposure in non-target species. Mutations to the VKORC1 gene have been shown to confer resistance in rodents with high proportions of resistance in mice found in all European populations tested. We screened mutations in Mus musculus within Western Australia, by sampling populations from the capital city (Perth) and a remote island (Browse Island). These are the first Australian mouse populations screened for resistance using this method. Additionally, the mitochondrial D-loop of house mice was sequenced to explore population genetic structure, identify the origin of Western Australian mice, and to elucidate whether resistance was linked to certain haplotypes.\n\nResultsNo resistance-related VKORC1 mutations were detected in either house mouse population. A genetic introgression in the intronic sequence of the VKORC1 gene of Browse Island house mouse was detected which is thought to have originated through hybridisation with the Algerian mouse (Mus spretus). Analysis of the mitochondrial D-loop reported two haplotypes in the house mouse population of Perth, and two haplotypes in the population of Browse Island.\n\nConclusionsBoth house mouse populations exhibited no genetic resistance to ARs, in spite of free use of ARs in Western Australia. Therefore weaker anticoagulant rodenticides can be employed in pest control and eradication attempts, which will result in reduced negative impacts on non-target species. Biosecurity measures must be in place to avoid introduction of resistant house mice, and new house mouse subspecies to Western Australia.",

    "abstract": "Identifying selection on polygenic complex traits in crops and livestock is important for understanding evolution and helps prioritize important characteristics for breeding. The QTL that contribute to polygenic trait variation often exhibit small or infinitesimal effects. This hinders the ability to detect QTL controlling polygenic traits because enormously high statistical power is needed for their detection. Recently, we circumvented this challenge by introducing a method to identify selection on complex traits by evaluating the relationship between genome-wide changes in allele frequency and estimates of effect-size. The approach involves calculating a composite-statistic across all markers that captures this relationship, followed by implementing a linkage disequilibrium-aware permutation test to evaluate if the observed pattern differs from that expected due to drift during evolution and population stratification. In this manuscript, we describe \"Ghat\", an R package developed to implement this method to test for selection on polygenic traits. We demonstrate the package by applying it to test for polygenic selection on 15 published European wheat traits including yield, biomass, quality, morphological characteristics, and disease resistance traits. Moreover, we applied Ghat to different simulated populations with different breeding history and genetic architecture. The results highlight the power of Ghat to identify selection on complex traits. The Ghat package is accessible on CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archival Network, and on GitHub.",

    "abstract": "Population structure and relationship information among goats is critical for genetic improvement, utilization and conservation. This study explored population structure and level of gene intermixing among four goat genotypes in Kenya: Alpine (n = 30), Toggenburg (n = 28), Saanen (n = 24) and Galla (n = 12). The population structuring and relatedness were estimated using principal component analysis utilizing allele frequencies of the SNP markers. Genotype relationships were evaluated based on the calculated Reynolds genetic distances. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to represent genotype clustering using iTOL software. Population structure was investigated using model-based clustering (ADMIXTURE) Genotypes relationships revealed four distinctive clusters: Alpine, Galla, Saanen and Toggenburg. The ADMIXTURE results revealed some level of gene intermixing among Alpine, Toggenburg and Saanen with Galla. Saanen goats were the most admixed genotype with 84%, 7% and 4% of its genome derived from Galla, Alpine and Toggenburg respectively. Alpine and Toggenburg goats shared some associations with the Galla goat; 10% and 1% respectively. The association of Galla with other genotypes was anticipated since Galla goat was used as the founder population for crossbreeding with Saanen, Alpine and Toggenburg breed. The genetic variations among the goat genotypes observed, will provide a good opportunity for sustainable utilization, conservation and future genetic resource improvement programs in goat genotypes in Kenya.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Various pathological conditions are accompanied by ATP release from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment, where it degrades into adenosine and modulates immune responses. Previous studies concluded that both ATP and its degradation product adenosine are important immune-regulatory molecules; ATP acted as a danger signal that promotes immune responses, but adenosine\u2019s effect was inhibitory. In this study, we show that adenosine plays an important role in balancing Th1 and Th17 pathogenic T cell responses in autoimmune disease. While its effect on Th1 responses is inhibitory, its effect on Th17 responses is enhancing, thereby impacting the balance between Th1 and Th17 responses. Mechanistic studies showed that this effect is mediated via several immune cells, among which \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activation and dendritic cell differentiation are prominent; adenosine and \u03b3\u03b4-mediated immunoregulation synergistically impact each other\u2019s effect. Adenosine augments the activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, which is an important promoter for Th17 responses and has a strong effect on DC differentiation tipping the balance from generation of DCs that stimulate Th1 responses to those that stimulate Th17 responses. The knowledge acquired in this study should improve our understanding of the immune-regulatory effect of extracellular ATP-adenosine metabolism and improve treatment for autoimmune diseases caused by both Th1 and Th17-type pathogenic T cells.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTToxoplasma gondii is a highly successful parasite that infects a significant portion of the human population. As an intracellular parasite, T. gondii thrives within many different cell types due to its residence in the parasitophorous vacuole, a specialized and heavily modified compartment in which parasites divide. Within this vacuole, numerous secreted proteins facilitate functions that optimize intracellular survival. We characterized one such protein, TgPPM3C, which is predicted to contain a domain belonging to the PP2C class of serine/threonine phosphatases and is secreted by both tachyzoites and differentiating bradyzoites into the vacuolar lumen. Genetic deletion of TgPPM3C established that parasites lacking this predicted phosphatase exhibit a minor growth defect in vitro, are avirulent during acute infection in mice, and form fewer cysts in mouse brain during chronic infection. A label-free phosphoproteomic approach was utilized to identify putative TgPPM3C substrates and demonstrated several secreted proteins with altered phosphorylation status in the absence of TgPPM3C. Altered phosphorylation status was seen in MYR1, a protein essential to the process of protein effector export from the parasitophorous vacuole into the host cell, and in GRA16 and GRA28, two exported effector proteins. Defects were seen in the export of GRA16 and GRA28, but not the effector TgIST, in the TgPPM3C knockout strain. Parasites lacking TgPPM3C also exhibited defects in host c-Myc induction, a process influenced by effector export. Phosphomimetic mutations of GRA16 serine residues recapitulated export defects, implicating de-phosphorylation as an important process in facilitating the export of GRA16. These findings provide an example of the emerging critical role that phosphatases play in regulating the complex environment of the T. gondii parasitophorous vacuole.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTIron is the fundamental element for numerous physiological functions. Reduced ferrous (Fe2+) and oxidized ferric (Fe3+) are the two ionized iron states in the living organisms. In the cell membrane, divalent metal ion transporter 1 (DMT1) is responsible for cellular uptake of Fe2+, whereas transferrin receptors (TFR) carry transferrin (TF)-bound Fe3+. In this study we performed, for the first time, detailed analysis of the action of Fe ions on cytoplasmic free calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) in astrocytes. Using qPCR and immunocytochemistry we identified DMT1 and TFR in astrocytes in primary cultures, in acutely isolated astrocytes and in brain tissue preparations; in situ both DMT1 and TFR are concentrated in astroglial perivascular endfeet. Administration of Fe2+ or Fe3+ in low \u03bcM concentrations evoked Ca2+ signals in astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. Iron ions triggered increase in [Ca2+]i by acting through two distinct molecular cascades. Uptake of Fe2+ by DMT1 inhibited astroglial Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA), which led to an elevation in cytoplasmic Na+ concentration (as measured by SBFI probe), thus reversing Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) thereby generating Ca2+ influx. Uptake of Fe3+ by TF-TFR stimulated phospholipase C to produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), thus trigering InsP3 receptor-mediated Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Iron-induced Ca2+ signals promote astroglial release of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin E2 cytokines by activating cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and NF-\u03baB signalling cascade. In summary, these findings reveal new mechanisms of iron-induced astrocytic signalling operational in conditions of iron overload, in response to which astrocytes actively accumulate excessive iron and activate neuroprotective pathways.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Motor skill learning involves both sensorimotor adaptation (calibrating the response to task dynamics and kinematics), and sequence learning (executing the task elements in the correct order at the necessary speed). These processes typically occur together in natural behavior and share much in common, such as working memory demands, development, and possibly neural substrates. However, sensorimotor and sequence learning are usually studied in isolation in research settings, for example as force field adaptation or serial reaction time tasks (SRTT), respectively. It is therefore unclear whether having predictive sequence information during sensorimotor adaptation would facilitate performance, perhaps by improving sensorimotor planning, or if it would impair performance, perhaps by occupying neural resources needed for sensorimotor learning. Here we evaluated adaptation to a distance-dependent force field in two different SRTT contexts: In Experiment 1, 28 subjects reached between 4 targets in a sequenced or random order. In Experiment 2, 40 subjects reached to one target, but 3 force field directions were applied in a sequenced or random order. We did not observe any consistent influence of target position sequence on force field adaptation in Experiment 1. However, sequencing of force field directions facilitated sensorimotor adaptation and retention in Experiment 2. This is inconsistent with the idea that sensorimotor and sequence learning share neural resources in any mutually exclusive fashion. These findings indicate that under certain conditions, perhaps especially when the sequence is related to the sensorimotor perturbation itself as in Experiment 2, sequence learning may interact with sensorimotor learning in a facilitatory manner.",

    "abstract": "Sensory processing involves information flow between neocortical areas, assumed to rely on direct intracortical projections. However, cortical areas may also communicate indirectly via higher-order nuclei in the thalamus, such as the pulvinar or lateral posterior nucleus (LP) in the visual system. The fine-scale organization and function of these cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways remains unclear. We find that responses of mouse LP neurons projecting to higher visual areas likely derive from feedforward input from primary visual cortex (V1) combined with information from many cortical and subcortical areas, including superior colliculus. Signals from LP projections to different higher visual areas are tuned to specific features of visual stimuli and their locomotor context, distinct from the signals carried by direct intracortical projections from V1. Thus, visual transthalamic pathways are functionally specific to their cortical target, different from feedforward cortical pathways and combine information from multiple brain regions, linking sensory signals with behavioral context.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChagas disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, a neglected tropical disease that affects thousands of people, mainly in Latin America. The drugs currently used in therapy are toxic and have therapeutic limitations during treatment. In addition, the genetic diversity of T. cruzi represents an important variable and challenge with regard to the pathogenesis of the infection, the epidemiological profile of the cases, and the therapeutic control of the infection. Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) is a compound of high pharmacological versatility acting as metal chelators and producing reactive oxygen species. Thus, the objective of this work is to characterize the antiparasitic action of DETC against different strains and evolutionary forms of T. cruzi, as well as the characterization of the mechanism of antiparasitic action.\n\nMethodology/Principal findingsThe different strains and evolutionary forms of T. cruzi were grown in LIT medium. To evaluate the antiparasitic activity of DETC, the evolutionary forms epimastigote and trypomastigote of T. cruzi were used by resazurin reduction methods and by counting under optical microscopy. Different response patterns were obtained between the strains and an IC50 of DETC ranging from 9.44 {+/-} 3,181{micro}M to 60.49 {+/-} 7.62 {micro}M. Cell cytotoxicity against cell lines 3T3 and RAW and evaluated by MTT, demonstrated that DETC in high concentration (2222 {micro}M) reduces around 60% the cell capacity of MTT reduction. The antiparasitic activity of DETC has been demonstrated through damage caused in the mitochondria of T. cruzi, a reduction of up to 80% in the mitochondrial potential of the parasites, as well as through damage caused in the membrane of the parasite.\n\nConclusionIn this study we can conclude that DETC has antiparasitic activity against different genotypes and evolutionary forms of T. cruzi, representing a promising molecule as a drug for the treatment of Chagas disease.",

    "abstract": "Limited use of medication in poultry feed led to the investigation of exogenous enzymes as antibiotic alternatives for controlling enteric disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of diet {beta}-glucanase (BGase) and medication on {beta}-glucan depolymerization, digestive tract characteristics, and performance of broilers. Broilers were fed hulless barley (HB) based diets with BGase (Econase GT 200P from AB Vista; 0 and 0.1%) and medication (Bacitracin and Salinomycin Na; with and without) arranged as a 2 x 2 factorial. In Experiment 1, 160 broilers were housed in cages from d 0 to 28. Each treatment was assigned to 10 cages. In Experiment 2, broilers (2376) were housed in floor pens and challenged with a coccidiosis vaccine on d 5. Each treatment was assigned to one floor pen in each of nine rooms. In Experiment 1, the soluble {beta}-glucan weight average molecular weight (Mw) in the ileal digesta was lower with medication in the 0% BGase treatments. Peak molecular weight (Mp) and Mw were lower with BGase regardless of medication. The maximum molecular weight for the smallest 10% {beta}-glucan (MW-10%) was lower with BGase. In Experiment 2, Mp was lower with medication in 0% BGase treatments. Beta-glucanase resulted in lower Mp regardless of medication, and the degree of response was lower with medication. The MW-10% was lower with BGase despite antibiotic addition. Body weight gain (BWG) and feed efficiency were higher with medication regardless of BGase use through-out the trial (except d 11-22 feed efficiency). Beta-glucanase resulted in higher BWG after d 11, and lower and higher feed efficiency before and after d 11, respectively, in unmedicated treatments. In conclusion, BGase and medication caused the depolymerization of soluble ileal {beta}-glucan. Beta-glucanase appeared as a partial replacement for diet medication to increase coccidiosis challenged broiler performance.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of genetic diversity in medicinal plants assists germplasm conservation and selection for use in breeding schemes. The aims of the present study were to assess genetic diversity and differentiation of several Plantago species using Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) markers and identify marker-trait associations (MTAs). Thirty-one Plantago accessions belonging to eight species with various mating system and chromosome number were collected from geographical regions of Iran environments. Polymorphism in the DNA of Plantago accessions were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of 25 ISSR primers. The data for number of polymorphic bands were analyzed on the basis of several genetic diversity parameters. The results of gel analysis indicated that the ISSR primers amplified 5 to 21 polymorphic bands with 100 to 3000 bp size. The mean polymorphism was 83.83% and five primers showed 100% polymorphism among Plantago accessions. The Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) for ISSR as a dominant marker ranged from 0.1103 to 0.3829 with the mean 0.2727 in the species tested. Accessions in P. amplexicaulis and P. pysillum species represented the highest Neis and Shannons genetic diversity whilst the lowest obtained for P. lagopus. Analysis of phylogenetic network generated by the Neighbor-Net Algorithm showed moderate split of the eight species tested and the network depicted moderate conflict. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) results showed lower conflict in separation of accessions of the eight species. Fifty-six significant MTAs were detected for the traits tested in Plantago accessions, of which six were shared between three seed and mucilage traits and 24 were common between two traits. The coefficient of determination (R2) for the identified MTAs varied between 32 and 73%. In conclusion, the results of genetic diversity analysis suggested that ISSR marker could efficiently differentiate Plantago species and the information of genetic diversity might assist Plantago improvement and conservation.",
