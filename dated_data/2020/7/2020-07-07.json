    "abstract": "Autophagy plays an essential role in the defence against many microbial pathogens as a regulator of both innate and adaptive immunity. Among some pathogens, sophisticated mechanisms have evolved that promote their ability to evade or subvert host autophagy. Here, we describe a novel mechanism of autophagy subversion mediated by the recently discovered Vibrio cholerae cytotoxin, MakA. pH-dependent endocytosis of MakA by host cells resulted in the formation of a cholesterol-rich endolysosomal membrane aggregate in the perinuclear region. Aggregate formation induced the noncanonical autophagy pathway driving unconventional LC3 lipidation on endolysosomal membranes. Subsequent sequestration of the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 E3-like enzyme complex required for LC3 lipidation at the membranous aggregate resulted in an inhibition of both canonical autophagy and autophagy-related processes including the unconventional secretion of IL-1\u03b2. These findings identify a novel mechanism of host autophagy subversion and immune modulation employed by V. cholerae during bacterial infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Fabrication of a functional hierarchical vascular network remains an unmet need for cultivation and transplantation of 3D engineered tissues. In this work, an effective approach was developed to fabricate a functional, perfusable and biocompatible, multi-scale vascular network (MSVT) within thick, implantable engineered tissues. Using a templating technique, macro-vessels were patterned in a 3D biodegradable polymeric scaffold seeded with endothelial and support cells within a collagen gel. The lumen of the macro-vessel was lined with endothelial cells, which further sprouted and anastomosed with the surrounding self-assembled capillaries. Anastomoses between the two-scaled vascular systems displayed tightly bonded cell junctions, as indicated by vascular endothelial cadherin expression. Moreover, MSVT functionality and patency were demonstrated by dextran passage through the interconnected hierarchical vasculature. Additionally, physiological flow conditions were applied with home-designed flow bioreactors, to achieve a MSVT with a natural endothelium structure. Finally, implantation of a multi-scale-vascularized graft in a mouse model resulted in a clear beneficial effect, as reflected by extensive host vessel penetration into the graft and an increase in blood perfusion via the engineered vessels as compared to control microscale-vascularized graft. Designing and fabricating such multi-scale vascular architectures within 3D engineered tissues is essential, both for in-vitro models and for therapeutic translation research.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTSalmonella and E. coli O157:H7 are two of the most important problems for the beef industry. Cattle can develop salmonellosis and persistently harbor Salmonella, or they can asymptomatically shed Salmonella and/or E. coli O157:H7 resulting in contamination of the hide and carcass surfaces during processing. Additionally, Salmonella infiltrates lymph nodes that get incorporated into ground beef. In this study, we investigated the possibility of identifying cattle with reduced susceptibility to one or both of these infections. Empirical observations from previous studies suggested that a diminished susceptibility was possible in amelanotic cattle, i.e., cattle bearing the mcr1/mcr1 genotype and lacking overt black pigmentation. By searching for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) present in the 34 genes encoding the Salmonella interactome, we identified a SNP that was consistently present in amelanotic cattle with diminished susceptibility to Salmonella. Specifically, we used an ex vivo assay to screen 500 cattle blood samples for the diminished ability of Salmonella to penetrate peripheral leukocytes. Diminished Salmonella penetration was observed in 150 of these blood samples and 147 of these samples harbored two alleles bearing a SNP that introduces a miRNA cleavage site (bta-let-7b) in the 3\u2019UTR of the bsynJ1 gene, which we designate as the SYNJ1/SNYJ1 genotype. Further ex vivo studies revealed a decreased expression of SYNJ1 in leukocytes bearing the SYNJ1/SNYJ1 genotype. In vivo experimental challenge studies revealed a diminished susceptibility to salmonellosis in cattle with the SYNJ1/SNYJ1::mcr1/mcr1 genotype. Additional in vivo challenge studies revealed that SYNJ1/SNYJ1::mcr1/mcr1 cattle have a decreased susceptibility to lymph node infiltration by two Salmonella serotypes (S. Anatum and S. Montevideo) implicated in this lymph node problem, and a decreased susceptibility to E. coli O157:H7 colonization of the recto-anal junction. A field study revealed that the SYNJ1/SNYJ1::mcr1/mcr1 genotype was five times more prevalent, when compared to the SYNJ1/synj1::mcr1/mcr1 and synj1/ synj1::mcr1/mcr1 genotypes, in Salmonella-free lymph nodes. Small-scale genetic surveys revealed that the SYNJ1/SNYJ1 genotype was present in the following mcr1/mcr1 breeds: Akaushi, Barzona, Braunvieh, Hereford, Piedmontese, Red and White Holsteins, Red Angus, Red Poll, Shorthorn, Simmental (Red), and Tarentaise. Studies using the aforementioned ex vivo penetration assay, which putatively predicts the diminished susceptibility phenotype, revealed that the penetrance of the diminished susceptibility is &gt;99% in SYNJ1/SNYJ1::mcr1/mcr1 cattle but only \u223c1% in SYNJ1/SNYJ1 cattle with at least one MCR1 allele. Further studies with the ex vivo assay revealed that three additional SNPs are part of a genotype conferring diminished susceptibility to a broad array of Salmonella serotypes commonly associated with cattle. In summary, the studies presented herein reveal a bovine genotype associated with decreased susceptibility to Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7. PSR Genetics LLC holds a U.S. patent on testing for the SYNJ1/SNYJ1 genotype (patent number 9,049,848) while the three complementary SNPs are under further investigation.Competing Interest StatementThis study was funded by PSR Genetics LLC which included a rental agreement for laboratory space at Iowa State UniversityView Full Text",

In this study, A. muciniphila dynamic cultures using five different media were implemented in an in vitro bionic intestinal reactor for the first time instead of the traditional static culture using brain heart infusion broth (BHI) or BHI + porcine mucin (BPM). The biomass under dynamic culture using BPM reached 1.92 g/L, which improved 44.36% compared with the value under static culture using BPM. The biomass under dynamic culture using human mucin (HM) further increased to the highest level of 2.89 g/L. Under dynamic culture using porcine mucin (PM) and HM, the main metabolites were short-chain fatty acids (acetic acid and butyric acid), while using other media, a considerable amount of branched-chain fatty acids (isobutyric and isovaleric acids) were produced. Under dynamic culture Using HM, the cell diameters reached 999 nm, and the outer membrane protein concentration reached the highest level of 26.26 g/mg. This study provided a preliminary theoretical basis for the development of A. muciniphila as the next generation probiotic.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 encodes an envelope glycoprotein (Env) that contains a long cytoplasmic tail (CT) harboring trafficking motifs implicated in Env incorporation into virus particles and viral transmission. In most physiologically relevant cell types, the gp41 CT is required for HIV-1 replication, but in the MT-4 T-cell line the gp41 CT is not required for a spreading infection. To help elucidate the role of the gp41 CT in HIV-1 transmission, in this study we investigated the viral and cellular factors that contribute to the permissivity of MT-4 to gp41 CT truncation. We found that the kinetics of HIV-1 production are faster in MT-4 than in the other T-cell lines tested, but MT-4 express equivalent amounts of HIV-1 proteins on a per-cell basis relative to cells not permissive to CT truncation. MT-4 express higher levels of plasma-membrane-associated Env than non-permissive cells and Env internalization from the plasma membrane is slower compared to another T-cell line, SupT1. Paradoxically, despite the high levels of Env on the surface of MT-4, two-fold less Env is incorporated into virus particles in MT-4 compared to SupT1. Cell-to-cell transmission between co-cultured 293T and MT-4 is higher than in co-cultures of 293T with most other T-cell lines tested, indicating that MT-4 are highly susceptible to this mode of infection. These data help to clarify the long-standing question of how MT-4 cells overcome the requirement for the HIV-1 gp41 CT and support a role for gp41 CT-dependent trafficking in Env incorporation and cell-to-cell transmission in physiologically relevant cell lines.Importance The HIV-1 Env cytoplasmic tail (CT) is required for efficient Env incorporation into nascent particles and viral transmission in primary CD4+ T cells. The MT-4 T-cell line has been reported to support multiple rounds of infection of HIV-1 encoding a gp41 CT truncation. Uncovering the underlying mechanism of MT-4 T-cell line permissivity to gp41 CT truncation would provide key insights into the role of the gp41 CT in HIV-1 transmission. This study reveals that multiple factors contribute to the unique ability of a gp41 CT truncation mutant to spread in cultures of MT-4 cells. The lack of a requirement for the gp41 CT in MT-4 is associated with the combined effects of rapid HIV-1 protein production, high levels of cell-surface Env expression, and increased susceptibility to cell-to-cell transmission compared to non-permissive cells.List of abbreviationsCTcytoplasmic tailVSvirological synapseC-Ccell-to-cellEnvenvelope glycoproteinSTRshort tandem repeatMFImedian fluorescence intensityPMplasma membraneRadio-IPradio-immunoprecipitationhPBMChuman peripheral blood mononuclear cellsRTreverse transcriptaseVSV-GVesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteinPBSphosphate buffered salineFBSfetal bovine serumWTwild typeHRPhorseradish peroxidaseERendoplasmic reticulumMAHIV-1 Matrix proteinEBVEpstein-Barr virusHTLVHuman T-cell leukemia virusALLAcute lymphocytic leukemiaATLAdult T-cell lymphomaATCCAmerican Type Culture CollectionNIH ARPNIH AIDS Reagent Programn.s.not statistically significantINHIV-1 Integrase proteinCAHIV-1 Capsid proteinRINRNA Integrity NumberView Full Text",

    "abstract": "Scientific exploration of phototrophic bacteria over nearly 200 years has revealed large phylogenetic gaps between known phototrophic groups that limit understanding of how phototrophy evolved and diversified. Through Boreal Shield lake water incubations, we cultivated an anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium from a previously unknown order within the Chloroflexota phylum that represents a highly novel transition form in the evolution of photosynthesis. Unlike all other known phototrophs, this bacterium uses a Type I reaction center (RCI) for light energy conversion yet belongs to the same bacterial phylum as organisms that use a Type II reaction center (RCII) for phototrophy. Using physiological, phylogenomic, and environmental metatranscriptomic data, we demonstrate active RCI-utilizing metabolism by the strain alongside usage of chlorosomes and bacteriochlorophylls related to those of RCII-utilizing Chloroflexota members. Despite using different reaction centers, our phylogenomic data provide strong evidence that RCI- and RCII-utilizing Chloroflexia members inherited phototrophy from a most recent common phototrophic ancestor that used RCI, RCII, or both reaction center classes, substantially revising our view of the diversity and evolution of phototrophic life. The Chloroflexota phylum preserves an evolutionary record of interaction between RCI and RCII among anoxygenic phototrophs that gives new context for exploring the origins of phototrophy on Earth.",

    "abstract": "CUT&RUN is a powerful tool to study protein-DNA interactions in vivo. DNA fragments cleaved by the targeted micrococcal nuclease identify the footprints of DNA-binding proteins on the chromatin. We performed CUT&RUN on human lung carcinoma cell line A549 maintained in a multi-well cell culture plate to profile RNA polymerase II. Long (>270 bp) DNA fragments released by CUT&RUN corresponded to the bimodal peak around the transcription start sites, as previously seen with chromatin immunoprecipitation. However, we found that short (<120 bp) fragments identify a well-defined peak localised at the transcription start sites. This distinct DNA footprint of short fragments, which constituted only about 5% of the total reads, suggests the transient positioning of RNA polymerase II before promoter-proximal pausing, which has not been detected in the physiological settings by standard chromatin immunoprecipitation. We showed that the positioning of the large-size-class DNA footprints around the short-fragment peak was associated with the directionality of transcription, demonstrating the biological significance of distinct CUT&RUN footprints of RNA polymerase II.",

However, stomatal development plasticity has been assessed in very few species.\n\n We quantified leaf anatomy traits, including stomatal index (SI), density (SD), size (SS), and pore index (SPI), in response to water-deficit stress in river birch (Betula nigra L.), eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis L.), and silver maple (Acer saccharinum L.).\n\n Birch and redbud, but not maple, had reduced SPI in response to water deficit. The mechanism by which SPI reduction occurred (via SD or SS) varied among species and with severity of water stress. Despite reduced SPI in birch and redbud, anatomical changes were relatively small and had a minor to no effect on the theoretical maximum stomatal conductance. Furthermore, gas-exchange rates were equivalent to well-watered plants following media re-irrigation.\n\n In some tree species, stomatal development is downregulated in response to water deficit conditions. Stomatal development plasticity is facilitated by smaller or fewer stomata, depending upon the species and the intensity of the stress. Water-deficit-induced plasticity in stomatal development is species-specific, likely due to species adaptation to ecological niches.",

This invasive snail, listed among the 100 worst invasive species, is a serious crop pest and a vector of a human parasitosis. Females lay eggs in pink-reddish masses, presumably as a warning coloration of their chemical defenses. Egg ingestion alters rodents gastrointestinal tract and is lethal if injected, but its effect on other taxa is unknown. Here we explored the toxic effects of Pomacea canaliculata eggs on bullfrog Lithobathes catesbeianus (Anura, Ranidae).\n\nJuvenile bullfrogs were gavaged with egg extracts and their digestive tract analyzed after 24 h and 48 h using histological, immunohistochemical and lectin-histochemical techniques. Toxicity was also evaluated by intraperitoneal injection of eggs extracts.\n\nEgg extract ingestion adversely affected small intestine of bullfrogs. Short term (24 h) effects included large, reversible changes of the intestinal wall, villi morphology, and changes in the glycosylation patterns of enterocytes. The mucosal area increased and infiltration of inflammatory cells, mainly eosinophils and macrophages, were observed together with a weak hemorrhage. Most of these changes reversed after 48 h. Besides, intraperitoneal injection of egg extract was nontoxic to bullfrog juveniles and no lethality or behavioral changes were observed, a remarkable difference with egg effect on mammals.\n\nAs a whole, these results indicate that toxins of apple snail eggs reversibly modify gut morphology, which may alter bullfrog physiology limiting their ability to absorb egg nutrients. This study extends the known targets of the apple snail egg defenses against predation to amphibians.",

    "abstract": "Many animals become more motivated to interact after a period of isolation. This phenomenon may involve general drives, e.g. for social touch or companionship, as well as drives that are specific to particular peers, and which ultimately serve to reestablish relationships between the individuals. Female degus are known to be affiliative with multiple other individuals, including unrelated and unfamiliar conspecifics, offering an opportunity to study social motivation independent from exclusive pair-bonds or overt, same-sex competition. We attempted to disentangle factors driving peer interaction by examining reunion behavior across several social isolation and separation manipulations. High levels of interaction were observed between adult females who had been separated even without isolation, revealing a drive to re-establish relationships with specific peers. The content of separation-only reunions differed from isolation, with the latter involving more early-session interaction, higher levels of allogrooming before rear-sniffing, and a higher ratio of chitter vocalizations. To assess whether post-isolation behavior was related to stress, we examined reunions following a non-social (footshock) stressor. Like isolation, footshock increased early-session interactions, but did not increase allogrooming before rear-sniffing or chittering, as compared with controls. To test whether separation-only reunion behavior shared qualities with relationship formation, we also examined reunions of new (stranger) dyads. Strangers exhibited higher levels of interaction than cagemates, with particularly high levels of late-session rear-sniffing. Like separation-only reunions, strangers showed more non-chitter vocalizations and lower levels of allogrooming before rear-sniffing. Across experiments, an exploratory clustering method was used to identify vocalizations that differed between conditions. This yielded promising leads for future investigation, including a chaff-type syllable that may have been more common during relationship renewal. Overall, results are consistent with the hypothesis that female degu reunions are supported by both general and peer-stimulus specific drives, expressed through the structure of physical and vocal interactions over time.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial diseases linked to mutations in mitochondrial (mt)tRNA sequences are abundant. However, the contributions of these tRNA mutations to the development of diseases is mostly unknown. Mutations may affect interactions with (mt)tRNA maturation enzymes or protein synthesis machinery leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. In human mitochondria, the first step of tRNA processing is the removal of the 5'end of precursor tRNAs (pre-tRNA) catalyzed by the three-component enzyme, mtRNase P.  Additionally, one sub-component of mtRNase P, mitochondrial RNase P protein 1 (MRPP1) catalyzes methylation of the R9 base in pre-tRNAs. Despite the central role of 5' end processing in mitochondrial tRNA maturation, the link between mtRNase P and diseases is mostly unexplored. Here we investigate how 11 different human disease-linked mutations in (mt)pre-tRNAs affect the activities of mtRNase P. We find that several mutations weaken the pre-tRNA binding affinity, while the majority of mutations decrease 5' end processing and methylation activity catalyzed by mtRNase P. Furthermore, all of the investigated mutations in (mt)pre-tRNALeu(UUR) alter the tRNA fold  which contributes to the partial loss of function of mtRNase P. Overall, these results reveal an etiological link between early steps of (mt)tRNA-substrate processing and mitochondrial disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The relationship between the 3D organisation of chromatin inside the nucleus and the regulation of gene expression remains unclear. While disruption of domains and domain boundaries can lead to mis-expression of developmental genes, acute depletion of key regulators of genome organisation, such as CTCF and cohesin, and major reorganisation of genomic regions have relatively small effects on gene expression. Therefore, it is unclear whether changes in gene expression and chromatin state drive chromatin reorganisation, or whether changes in chromatin organisation facilitate cell type-specific activation of genes and their regulatory elements. Here, using the Drosophila melanogaster dorsoventral patterning system as a model, we demonstrate the independence of 3D chromatin organisation and developmental gene regulation. We define tissue-specific enhancers and link them to expression patterns at the single-cell level using single cell RNA-seq. Surprisingly, despite tissue-specific differences in chromatin state and gene expression, 3D chromatin organisation is maintained across tissues. Our results provide strong evidence that tissue-specific chromatin conformation is not required for tissue-specific gene expression, but rather acts as an architectural framework to facilitate proper gene regulation during development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Most of our knowledge of insect genomes comes from Holometabolous species, which undergo the complete metamorphosis and have genomes under 2Gb with little signs of DNA methylation. In contrast, Hemiemetabolous insects undergo the ancestral incomplete metamorphosis and have larger genomes with high levels of DNA methylation. Hemimetabolous species from the Orthopteran order (grasshoppers and crickets) have some of the largest insect genomes. What drives the evolution of these unusual insect genome sizes, remains unknown. Here we report the sequencing, assembly and annotation of the 1.66-Gb genome of the Mediterranean field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus, and the annotation of the 1.60-Gb genome of the Hawaiian cricket Laupala kohalensis. We compare these two cricket genomes with those of 14 additional insects, and find evidence that hemimetabolous genomes expanded due to transposable element activity. Based on the ratio of observed to expected CpG sites, we find higher conservation and stronger purifying selection of methylated genes than non-methylated genes. Finally, our analysis suggests an expansion of the pickpocket class V gene family in crickets, which we speculate might play a role in the evolution of cricket courtship, including their characteristic chirping.",

    "abstract": "The continuously developing field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has made a considerable contribution to the knowledge of brain architecture. It has given shape to a desire to construct a complete map of functional and structural connections. In particular, diffusion MRI paired with tractography has facilitated a non-invasive exploration of structural brain anatomy, which has helped build evidence for the existence of many association, projection and commissural fiber tracts. However, there is still a scarcity in research studies related to intralobar association fibers. The Dejerines (two of the most notable neurologists of 19th century France) gave an in-depth description of the intralobar fibers of the occipital lobe. Unfortunately, their exquisite work has since been sparsely referred to in the modern literature. This work gives the first modern description of many of the occipital intralobar lobe fibers described by the Dejerines. We perform a virtual dissection and reconstruct the tracts using diffusion MRI tractography. The virtual dissection is guided by the Dejerines treatise, Anatomie des Centres Nerveux. As an accompaniment to this article, the authors provided a French-to-English translation of the treatise portion concerning intra-occipital fiber bundles. This text provides the original description of five intralober occipital tracts, namely: the stratum calcarinum, the stratum proprium cunei, the vertical occipital fasciculus of Wernicke, the transverse fasciculus of the cuneus (TFC) and the transverse fasciculus of the lingual lobe of Vialet. It was possible to reconstruct all these tracts except for the TFC - possibly because its trajectory intermingles with a large amount of other fiber bundles. For completeness, the recently described sledge runner fasciculus, although not one of the Dejerine tracts, was identified and successfully reconstructed.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionVolumetric estimates of subcortical and cortical structures, extracted from T1-weighted MRIs, are widely used in many clinical and research applications. Here, we investigate the impact of the presence of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on FreeSurfer grey matter (GM) structure volumes and its possible bias on functional relationships.\n\nMethodsT1-weighted images from 1077 participants (4321 timepoints) from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were processed with FreeSurfer version 6.0.0. WMHs were segmented using a previously validated algorithm on either T2-weighted or Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Mixed effects models were used to assess the relationships between overlapping WMHs and GM structure volumes and overal WMH burden, as well as to investigate whether such overlaps impact associations with age, diagnosis, and cognitive performance.\n\nResultsParticipants with higher WMH volumes had higher overalps with GM volumes of bilateral caudate, cerebral cortex, putamen, thalamus, pallidum, and accumbens areas (P < 0.0001). When not corrected for WMHs, caudate volumes increased with age (P < 0.0001) and were not different between cognitively healthy individuals and age-matched probable Alzheimers disease patients. After correcting for WMHs, caudate volumes decreased with age (P < 0.0001), and Alzheimers disease patients had lower caudate volumes than cognitively healthy individuals (P < 0.01). Uncorrected caudate volume was not associated with ADAS13 scores, whereas corrected lower caudate volumes were significantly associated with poorer cognitive performance (P < 0.0001).\n\nConclusionsPresence of WMHs leads to systematic inaccuracies in GM segmentations, particularly for the caudate, which can also change clinical associations. While specifically measured for the Freesurfer toolkit, this problem likely affects other algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Aims/hypothesisTo investigate if there is a causal relationship between changes in insulin resistance and mitochondrial respiratory function and content in rats fed a high fat diet (HFD) with or without concurrent exercise training. We hypothesised that provision of a high fat diet (HFD) would increase insulin resistance and decrease mitochondrial characteristics (content and function), and that exercise training would improve both mitochondrial characteristics and insulin resistance in rats fed a HFD.\n\nMethodsMale Wistar rats were given either a chow diet or a high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. After 4 weeks of the dietary intervention, half of the rats in each group began eight weeks of interval training. In vivo glucose and insulin tolerance was assessed, as was ex vivo glucose uptake in epitrochlearis muscle. Mitochondrial respiratory function was assessed in permeabilised soleus and white gastrocnemius (WG) muscles. Mitochondrial content was determined by measurement of citrate synthase (CS) activity and protein expression of components of the electron transport system (ETS).\n\nResultsHFD rats had impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. HFD did not change CS activity in the soleus; however, it did increase CS activity in WG (Chow 5.9 {+/-} 0.5, HFD 7.2 {+/-} 0.7 mol h-1 kg protein-1). Protein expression of components of the ETS and mitochondrial respiratory function (WG Chow 65.2 {+/-} 8.4, HFD 88.6 {+/-} 8.7 pmol O2 s-1 mg-1) were also increased by HFD. Exercise training improved glucose and insulin tolerance in the HFD rats. Exercise training did not alter CS activity in either muscle. Mitochondrial respiratory function was increased with exercise training in the chow fed animals in soleus muscle, but not in WG. This exercise effect was absent in the HFD animals. Mitochondrial characteristics did not consistently correlate with insulin or glucose tolerance.\n\nConclusions/interpretationHFD induced insulin resistance, but it did not negatively affect any of the measured mitochondrial characteristics. Exercise training improved insulin resistance, but without changes in mitochondrial respiration and content. The lack of an association between mitochondrial characteristics and insulin resistance was reinforced by the absence of strong correlations between these measures. Our results suggest that defects in mitochondrial respiration and content are not responsible for insulin resistance in HFD rats.",

These fungi not only provide their host plants with access to nutrients and resources but are known to augment plant defences against insect herbivores. Relatively little is known about the role of AM fungal diversity and community assembly on the expression of plant defence traits. Here, we report how plant (Triticum aestivum) phenolic-based resistance to insect herbivory is differentially affected by different AM fungal communities. An inoculant of four AM fungal species and a field-sourced native AM fungal community increased plant phenolics by 47.9% and 50.2%, respectively, compared to plants inoculated with only one fungal species. Correspondingly, the performance (relative growth rate) of the insect herbivore was 36% and 61.3% lower when feeding on plants associated with these AM fungal communities. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between foliar phenolics and herbivore growth. We propose that AM fungal community assembly can drive insect herbivore performance by affecting phenolic-based defence mechanisms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Dragonflies and damselflies, representing the insect order Odonata, are among the earliest flying insects with living (extant) representatives. However, unravelling details of their long evolutionary history, such as egg laying (oviposition) strategies, is impeded by unresolved phylogenetic relationships, an issue particularly prevalent in damselfly families and fossil lineages. Here we present the first transcriptome-based phylogenetic reconstruction of Odonata, analyzing 2,980 protein-coding genes in 105 species representing nearly all of the orders families (except Austropetaliidae and Neopetaliidae). All damselfly families and most dragonfly families are recovered as monophyletic groups. Our Molecular clock estimates suggest that crown-Zygoptera (damselflies) and -Anisoptera (dragonflies) both arose during the late Triassic. Several of the observed long inner branches in our topology are indicative of the extinction of once flourishing lineages. We also find that exophytic egg laying behaviour with a reduced ovipositor evolved in certain dragonflies during the late Jurassic / early Cretaceous. Lastly, we find that certain fossils have an unexpected deterring impact in divergence dating analysis.",

    "abstract": "Viruses rely on their host's translation machinery for the synthesis of their own proteins. Problems belie viral translation when the host has a codon usage bias (CUB) that is different from an infecting virus with differences in the GC content between the host/virus genome. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that chloroviruses adapted to host CUB by acquisition and selection of tRNAs that at least partially favor their own CUB. The genomes of 41 chloroviruses comprising three clades of three different algal hosts have been sequenced, assembled and annotated. All 41 viruses not only encode tRNAs, but their tRNA genes are located in clusters. One tRNA gene was common to all three clades of chloroviruses, while differences were observed between clades and even within clades. By comparing the codon usage of one chlorovirus algal host, whose genome has been sequenced and annotated (67% GC content), to that of two of its viruses (40% GC content), we found that the viruses were able to at least partially overcome the host's CUB by encoding tRNAs that recognize AU-rich codons. In addition, 39/41 chloroviruses encode a putative lysidine synthase, which alters the anticodon of tRNAmet that normally recognizes AUG to recognize the codon AUA, a codon for isoleucine. This is advantageous to the viruses because the AU-rich codon AUA is 12-13 times more common in the chloroviruses than their host. Evidence is presented that supports the concept that chlorovirus tRNA clusters were acquired prior to events that separated them into the three clades.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "BackgroundExposure to coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is linked to the development of insulin resistance. Previous studies suggested that PCB126 alters muscle mitochondrial function through an indirect mechanism. Since PCBs are stored in fat, we hypothesized that PCB126 alters adipokine secretion, which in turn affects muscle metabolism.\n\nObjectivesThe objectives of this study were: 1) To study the impacts of PCB126 exposure on adipocyte cytokine/adipokine secretion; 2) To determine whether adipocyte-derived factors alter glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function in myotubes when exposed to PCB126; 3) To determine whether pre-established insulin resistance alters the metabolic responses of adipocytes exposed to PCB126 and the communication between adipocytes and myotubes.\n\nMethod3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to PCB126 (1-100 nM) in two insulin sensitivity conditions (insulin sensitive (IS) and insulin resistant (IR) adipocytes), followed by the measurement of secreted adipokines, mitochondrial function and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Communication between adipocytes and myotubes was reproduced by exposing C2C12 or mouse primary myotubes to conditioned medium (CM) derived from IS or IR 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to PCB126. Mitochondrial function and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake were then determined in myotubes.\n\nResultsPCB126 significantly increased adipokine (adiponectin, IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-) secretion and decreased mitochondrial function, glucose uptake and glycolysis in IR but not in IS 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Altered energy metabolism in IR 3T3-L1 adipocytes was linked to decreased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and increased superoxide dismutase 2 levels, an enzyme involved in reactive oxygen species detoxification. Exposure of myotubes to CM from PCB126-treated IR adipocytes decreased glucose uptake, without altering glycolysis or mitochondrial function. Interestingly, p-AMPK levels were increased rather than decreased in myotubes exposed to the CM of PCB126-treated IR adipocytes.\n\nConclusionTaken together, these data suggest that increased adipokine secretion from IR adipocytes exposed to PCB126 may explain impaired glucose uptake in myotubes.",

    "abstract": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emergence in 2003 introduced the first serious human coronavirus pathogen to an unprepared world. To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (>96% aa identity) homologous to SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors. The screening of a small (1,520 compounds) chemical library of FDA-approved drugs demonstrates the robustness of our assay and will allow to speed-up drug repositioning or novel drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPrinciple of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis detection by a fluorescence-based high throughput screening assay\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/192005v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e8122dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18557org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d95362org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f15222_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights- A new SARS-CoV non radioactive RNA polymerase assay is described\n- The robotized assay is suitable to identify RdRp inhibitors based on HTS",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are not phylogenetically closely related; however, both use the ACE2 receptor in humans for cell entry. This is not a universal sarbecovirus trait; for example, many known sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-1 have two deletions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein that render them incapable of using human ACE2. Here, we report three sequences of a novel sarbecovirus from Rwanda and Uganda which are phylogenetically intermediate to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate via in vitro studies that they are also unable to utilize human ACE2. Furthermore, we show that the observed pattern of ACE2 usage among sarbecoviruses is best explained by recombination not of SARS-CoV-2, but of SARS-CoV-1 and its relatives. We show that the lineage that includes SARS-CoV-2 is most likely the ancestral ACE2-using lineage, and that recombination with at least one virus from this group conferred ACE2 usage to the lineage including SARS-CoV-1 at some time in the past. We argue that alternative scenarios such as convergent evolution are much less parsimonious; we show that biogeography and patterns of host tropism support the plausibility of a recombination scenario; and we propose a competitive release hypothesis to explain how this recombination event could have occurred and why it is evolutionarily advantageous. The findings provide important insights into the natural history of ACE2 usage for both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and a greater understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that shape zoonotic potential of coronaviruses. This study also underscores the need for increased surveillance for sarbecoviruses in southwestern China, where most ACE2-using viruses have been found to date, as well as other regions such as Africa, where these viruses have only recently been discovered.",

    "abstract": "Multiple publications have independently described pangolin CoV genomes from the same batch of smuggled pangolins confiscated in Guangdong province in March, 2019. We analyzed the three metagenomic datasets that sampled this batch of pangolins and found that the two complete pangolin CoV genomes, GD_1 by Xiao et al. Nature and MP789 by Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens, were both built primarily using the 2019 dataset first described by Liu et al. Viruses. Other publications, such as Zhang et al. Current Biology and Lam et al. Nature, have also relied on this same dataset by Liu et al. Viruses for their assembly of the Guangdong pangolin CoV sequences and comparisons to SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, all of the published pangolin CoV genome sequences that share a highly similar Spike receptor binding domain with SARS-CoV-2 originate from this singular batch of smuggled pangolins. This raises the question of whether pangolins are truly reservoirs or hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in the wild, or whether the pangolins may have contracted the CoV from another host species during trafficking. Our observations highlight the importance of requiring authors to publish their complete genome assembly pipeline and all contributing raw sequence data, particularly those supporting epidemiological investigations, in order to empower peer review and independent analysis of the sequence data. This is necessary to ensure both the accuracy of the data and the conclusions presented by each publication.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe global COVID-19 pandemic motivates accelerated research to develop safe and efficacious vaccines. To address this need, we leveraged a biomaterial vaccine technology that consists of mesoporous silica rods (MSRs) that provide a sustained release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and adjuvants to concentrate and mature antigen-presenting cells at the vaccine site. Here we explored the humoral responses resulting from the use of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as the adjuvant and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins S1, S2, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and receptor binding domain (RBD) as the target antigens. The dose of antigen and impact of pre-manufacturing of vaccines as versus loading antigen just-in-time was explored in these studies. Single shot MSR vaccines induced rapid and robust antibody titers to the presented antigens, even without the use of a boost, and sera from vaccinated animals demonstrated neutralizing activity against a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Overall, these results suggest the MSR vaccine system may provide potent protective immunity when utilized to present SARS-CoV-2 antigens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Compared to the other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a higher reproductive number that is driving the COVID-19 pandemic. The high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been attributed to environmental, immunological, and molecular factors. The Spike protein is the foremost molecular factor responsible for virus fusion, entry and spread in the host, and thus holds clues for the rapid viral spread. The dense glycosylation of Spike, its high affinity of binding to the human ACE2 receptor, and the efficient priming by cleavage have already been proposed for driving efficient virus-host entry, but these do not explain its unusually high transmission rate. I have investigated the Spike from six {beta}-coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, and find that their surface-exposed fusion peptides constituting the defined fusion loop are spatially organized contiguous to each other to work synergistically for triggering the virus-host membrane fusion process. The architecture of the Spike quaternary structure ensures the participation of the fusion peptides in the initiation of the host membrane contact for the virus fusion process. The SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides have unique physicochemical properties, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The specific contribution of these prolines shows significantly diminished fusogenicity in vitro and associated pathogenesis in vivo, inferred from comparative studies of their deletion-mutant in a fellow murine {beta}-coronavirus MHV-A59. The priming of the Spike by its cleavage and subsequent fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread.\n\nSignificance StatementThe three proximal fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop in Spike protein are the membranotropic segments most suitable for engaging the host membrane surface for its disruption. Spikes unique quaternary structure architecture drives the fusion peptides to initiate the protein host membrane contact. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer surface is relatively more hydrophobic among other human coronavirus Spikes, including the fusion peptides that are structurally more rigid owing to the presence of consecutive prolines, aromatic/hydrophobic clusters, a stretch of consecutive {beta}-branched amino acids, and the hydrogen bonds. The synergy accrued from the location of the fusion peptides, their physicochemical features, and the fusogenic conformational transition appears to drive the virus fusion process and may explain the high spread of the SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "IL-23 is an IL-12 family cytokine that is important in promoting Th17 responses and has been strongly linked to autoimmunity and psoriasis. It is a heterodimeric cytokine made up of a p19 subunit unique to IL-23 and a p40 subunit that is shared with IL-12. We show here that in response to LPS, the induction of IL-23p19 mRNA is regulated by a MSK1/2 - CREB dependent pathway downstream of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. Knockout of MSK1/2 resulted in a decrease in both IL-23p19 mRNA transcription and IL-23 secretion in GM-CSF differentiated bone marrow cells. Similar effects were seen when the MSK1/2 phosphorylation site in CREB was mutated to alanine. Stimulation with PGE2 promotes the nuclear localisation of CRTC3, a co-activator for CREB. In combination with LPS, PGE2 promoted IL-23p19 mRNA transcription and this was blocked by knockdown of CRTC3. Imiquimod induced skin inflammation in mice has been used as a model for psoriasis and is dependent on IL-23. While MSK1/2 knockout reduced the induction of IL-23 in vivo following i.p. injection of LPS, the knockout mice were not protected from Imiquimod induced skin inflammation. MSK1/2 knockout did not reduce the induction of IL-17 producing {gamma}{delta}T cells following Imiquimod treatment, although MSK1/2 knockout did reduce the levels of these cells in mice receiving a control cream. The lack of protection in the Imiquimod model may be due to the known anti-inflammatory roles or MSKs, such as its contribution to the induction of IL-10.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is among top ten causes of death worldwide, and the number of drug-resistant strains is increasing. The direct interception of human immune signaling molecules by Mtb remains elusive, limiting drug discovery. Oxysterols and secosteroids regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we report a functional, structural, and bioinformatics study of Mtb enzymes initiating cholesterol catabolism and demonstrated their interrelation with human immunity. We show that these enzymes metabolize human immune oxysterol messengers. Rv2266, the most potent among them, can also metabolize vitamin D3 (VD3) derivatives. High-resolution structures show common patterns of sterols binding and reveal a site for oxidative attack during catalysis. Finally, we designed a compound that binds and inhibits three studied proteins. The compound shows activity against Mtb H37Rv residing in macrophages. Our findings contribute to molecular understanding of suppression of immunity and suggest that Mtb has its own transformation system resembling the human phase I drug-metabolizing system.Competing Interest StatementA.Gi. and E.S. are employees of MT-Medicals LLC.

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is the most lethal bacterial infectious disease worldwide. It is notoriously difficult to treat, requiring a cocktail of antibiotics administered over many months. The dense, waxy outer membrane of the TB-causing agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), acts as a formidable barrier against uptake of antibiotics. Subsequently, enzymes involved in maintaining the integrity of the Mtb cell wall are promising drug targets. Recently, we demonstrated that Mtb lacking malic enzyme (MEZ) has altered cell wall lipid composition and attenuated uptake by macrophages. These results suggest that MEZ provides the required reducing power for lipid biosynthesis. Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of MEZ to 3.6 [A] resolution and compare it with known structures of prokaryotic and eukaryotic malic enzymes. We use biochemical assays to determine its oligomeric state and to evaluate the effects of pH and allosteric regulators on its kinetics and thermal stability. To assess the interactions between MEZ and its substrate malate and cofactors, Mn2+ and NAD(P)+, we ran a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. First, the MD analysis corroborates our empirical observations that MEZ is unusually disordered, which persists even with the addition of substrate and cofactors. Second, the MD simulations reveal that MEZ subunits alternate between open and closed states and that MEZ can stably bind its NAD(P)+ cofactor in multiple conformations, including an inactive, compact NAD+ form. Together the structure of MEZ and insights from its dynamics can be harnessed to inform the design of MEZ inhibitors that target Mtb.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic patients are always at a higher risk of ischemic diseases like coronary artery diseases. One such ischemic carotid artery disease is Moyamoya. Moyamoya disease (MMD) has been associated with diabetes Type-I and II and the causality was unclear. RNF213 is the major susceptible gene for MMD. To understand the association between diabetes mellitus and MMD we chose the major players from both the anomalies, insulin and RNF213. But before establishing a role of RNF213 in insulin regulating pathway we had to understand the involvement of RNF213 within different biological systems. For this we have adopted a preliminary computational approach to understand the prominent interactions of RNF213. Our first objective was to construct an interactome for RNF213. We have analyzed several curated databases and adapted a list of RNF213 interacting partners to develop its interactome. Then to understand the involvement of this interactome in biological functions we have analyzed major biological pathways, biological processes and prominent clusters related to this interactome through computational approach. Then to develop a pathway that might give clue for RNF213 involvement in insulin regulatory pathway we have validated the intercluster and intracluster predictions and identified a regulatory pathway for RNF213. RNF213 interactome was observed to be involved in adaptive immunity with 4 major clusters; one of the cluster involved TNF\u03b1. Immune system involves several pathways, and therefore at this point we have chosen an event-based strategy to obtain an explicit target. Immunity is mediated by many pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF\u03b1. TNF\u03b1-mediated inflammation, obesity and insulin resistance are associated. Therefore we chose to explore the role of RNF213 in TNF\u03b1-mediated inflammation in macrophages and inflammation-mediated insulin-resistance in adipocytes. We have observed an enhancement of RNF213 gene expression by LPS mediated pro-inflammatory stimuli and suppression by PPAR\u03b3-mediated anti-inflammatory, insulin sensitizing stimuli in macrophages. A more significant response was observed in adipocytes as well. Administration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF\u03b1 was able to impede the reduction in RNF213 expression during adipogenesis and this effect was observed to be mediated by PTP1B. Inactivation of PTP1B abolished RNF213 expression which in turn enhanced the adipogenesis process through enhanced PPAR\u03b3. Constitutive expression of RNF213 suppressed the adipocyte differentiation by the inhibition of PPAR\u03b3. We could show the expression of RNF213 has been regulated by TNF\u03b1/PTP1B pathway and PPAR\u03b3. The constitutive expression of RNF213 during adipogenesis appears to be an adipostatic measure that obese patients acquire to inhibit further adipogenesis. This is verified in silico by analyzing the gene expression data obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database, which showed a higher expression of RNF213 in adipose tissue samples of obese people. Overall this study gives new insights in the TNF\u03b1-mediated pathway in adipogenesis and suggests a role of RNF213 in adipogenesis via this pathway.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTInflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a clinically distinct and highly aggressive form of breast cancer with rapid onset and a strong propensity to metastasize. The molecular mechanisms underlying the aggressiveness and metastatic propensity of IBC are largely unknown. Herein, we report that decorin (DCN), a small leucine-rich extracellular matrix proteoglycan, is downregulated in tumors from patients with IBC. Overexpression of DCN in IBC cells markedly decreased migration, invasion, and cancer stem cells in vitro and inhibited IBC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, DCN functioned as a suppressor of invasion and tumor growth in IBC by destabilizing E-cadherin and inhibiting EGFR/ERK signaling. DCN physically binds E-cadherin in IBC cells and accelerates its degradation through an autophagy-linked lysosomal pathway. We established that DCN inhibits tumorigenesis and metastasis in IBC cells by negatively regulating the E-cadherin/EGFR/ERK axis. Our findings offer a potential therapeutic strategy for IBC, and provide a novel mechanism for IBC pathobiology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Here we perform a test of the hypothesized trade off between the number and size of offspring using thousands of descriptions of the number of egg-producing compartments in the insect ovary (ovarioles), a common proxy for potential offspring number in insects. We find evidence of a negative relationship between egg size and ovariole number when accounting for adult body size. However in contrast to prior claims, we note that this relationship is not generalizable across all insect clades, and we highlight several factors that may have contributed to this size-number trade off being stated as a general rule in previous studies. We reconstruct the evolutionary history of the nurse cell arrangement within the ovariole, and show that the diversification of ovariole number and egg size have both been largely independent of nurse cell presence or position within the ovariole. Instead we show that ovariole number evolution has been shaped by a series of transitions between variable and invariant states, with multiple independent lineages evolving to have almost no variation in ovariole number. We highlight the implications of these invariant lineages on our understanding of the specification of ovariole number during development, as well as the importance of considering developmental processes in theories of life-history evolution.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYCells have evolved a metabolic control of DNA replication to respond to a wide range of nutritional conditions. Accumulating data suggest that this poorly understood control depends, at least in part, on Central Carbon Metabolism (CCM). In Bacillus subtilis, the glycolytic pyruvate kinase (PykA) is intricately linked to replication. This 585 amino-acid-long enzyme comprises a catalytic (Cat) domain that binds to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP to produce pyruvate and ATP, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function. Interestingly, the C-terminal domain termed PEPut interacts with Cat and is homologous a domain that, in other metabolic enzymes, are phosphorylated at a conserved TSH motif at the expense of PEP and ATP to drive sugar import and catalytic or regulatory activities. To gain insights into the role of PykA in replication, DNA synthesis was analyzed in various Cat and PEPut mutants grown in a medium where the metabolic activity of PykA is dispensable for growth. Measurements of replication parameters (ori/ter ratio, C period and fork speed) and of the pyruvate kinase activity showed that PykA mutants exhibit replication defects resulting from side chain modifications in the PykA protein rather than from a reduction of its metabolic activity. Interestingly, Cat and PEPut have distinct commitments in replication: while Cat impacts positively and negatively replication fork speed, PEPut stimulates initiation through a process depending on Cat-PEPut interaction and growth conditions. Residues binding to PEP and ADP in Cat, stabilizing the Cat-PEPut interaction and belonging to the TSH motif of PEPut were found important for the commitment of PykA in replication. In vitro, PykA affects the activities of replication enzymes (the polymerase DnaE, helicase DnaC and primase DnaG) essential for initiation and elongation and genetically linked to pykA. Our results thus connect replication initiation and elongation to CCM metabolites (PEP, ATP and ADP), critical Cat and PEPut residues and to multiple links between PykA and the replication enzymes DnaE, DnaC and DnaG. We propose that PykA is endowed with a moonlighting activity that senses the concentration of signaling metabolites and interacts with replication enzymes to convey information on the cellular metabolic state to the replication machinery and adjust replication initiation and elongation to metabolism. This defines a new type of replication regulator proposed to be part of the metabolic control that gates replication in the cell cycle.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "SummaryWood and litter degrading fungi are the main decomposers of lignocellulose and thus play a key role in carbon cycling in nature. Here we provide evidence for a novel lignocellulose degradation strategy employed by the litter degrading fungus Agaricus bisporus (known as the white button mushroom). Fusion of hyphae allows this fungus to synchronize the activity of its mycelium over large distances (50 cm). The synchronized activity has an 13-hour interval that increases to 20 h before becoming irregular and is associated with a 3.5-fold increase in respiration while compost temperature increases up to 2 \u00b0C. Transcriptomic analysis of this burst-like phenomenon supports a cyclic degradation of lignin, deconstruction of (hemi-) cellulose and microbial cell wall polymers, and uptake of degradation products during vegetative growth of A. bisporus. Cycling in expression of the ligninolytic system, enzymes involved in saccharification, and nutrient uptake is proposed to provide an efficient way for degradation of substrates such as litter.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is a major cause of foodborne gastrointestinal illness. The adhesion of EHEC on host tissues is the first step enabling bacterial colonization. Adhesins like fimbriae and flagella mediate this mechanism. Here, we studied the interaction of the bacterial flagellum with the host cell\u2019s plasma membrane using Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) as a biologically relevant model. Cultured cell lines contain many different molecular components including proteins and glycoproteins. In contrast, with GUVs we can characterize the bacterial mode of interaction solely with a defined lipid part of the cell membrane. Bacterial adhesion on GUVs was dependent on the presence of the flagellar filament and its motility. By testing different phospholipid head groups, the nature of the fatty acid chains or the liposome curvature, we found that lipid packing is a key parameter to enable bacterial adhesion. Using HT-29 cells grown in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acid (\u03b1-linolenic acid) or saturated fatty acid (palmitic acid), we found that \u03b1-linolenic acid reduced adhesion of wild type EHEC but not of a non-flagellated mutant. Finally, our results reveal that the presence of flagella is advantageous for the bacteria to bind to lipid rafts. We speculate that polyunsaturated fatty acids prevent flagellar adhesion on membrane bilayers and play a clear role for optimal host colonization. Flagella-mediated adhesion to plasma membranes has broad implications to host-pathogen interactions.Importance Bacterial adhesion is a crucial step to allow bacteria to colonize their hosts, invade tissues and form biofilm. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 is a human pathogen and the causative agent of diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis. Here, we use biomimetic membrane models and cell lines to decipher the impact of lipid content of the plasma membrane on enterohemorrhagic E. coli flagella-mediated adhesion. Our findings provide evidence that polyunsaturated fatty acid (\u03b1-linolenic acid) inhibits E. coli flagella adhesion to the plasma membrane in a mechanism separate from its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory functions. In addition, we confirm that cholesterol-enriched lipid microdomains, often called lipid rafts are important in bacterial adhesion. These findings significantly strengthen plasma membrane adhesion via bacterial flagella in an important human pathogen. This mechanism represents a promising target for the development of novel anti-adhesion therapies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Within the virion, adenovirus DNA associates with the virus-encoded, protamine-like structural protein pVII. Whether this association is organized, and how genome packaging changes during infection and subsequent transcriptional activation is currently unknown. Here, we combined RNA-seq, MNase-seq, ChIP-seq and single genome imaging during early adenovirus infection to unveil the structure- and time-resolved dynamics of viral chromatin changes as well as their correlation with gene transcription. Our MNase mapping data indicates that the viral genome is arranged in precisely positioned nucleoprotein particles (Adenosomes), like nucleosomes. We identified 238 Adenosomes, being positioned by a DNA sequence code and protecting about 60 to 70bp of DNA. The incoming genome is more accessible at early gene loci that undergo additional chromatin de-condensation upon infection. Histone H3.3 containing nucleosomes specifically replace pVII at distinct genomic sites and at the transcription start sites of early genes. Acetylation of H3.3 is predominant at the transcription start sites, preceding transcriptional activation. Based on our results we propose a central role for the viral pVII nucleoprotein-architecture, which is required for the dynamic structural changes during early infection, including the regulation of nucleosome assembly prior to transcription initiation. Our study thus may aid the rational development of recombinant adenoviral vectors exhibiting sustained expression in gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "SummaryTrypanosoma cruzi has three biochemically and morphologically distinct developmental stages that are programed to rapidly respond to environmental changes the parasite faces during its life cycle. Unlike other eukaryotes, Trypanosomatid genomes contain protein coding genes that are transcribed into polycistronic pre-mRNAs and control of gene expression relies on mechanisms acting at the post-transcriptional level. Transcriptome analyses comparing epimastigote, trypomastigote and intracellular amastigote stages revealed changes in gene expression that reflect the parasite adaptation to distinct environments. Several genes encoding RNA binding proteins (RBP), known to act as key post-transcriptional regulatory factors, were also differentially expressed. We characterized one T. cruzi RBP (TcZH3H12) that contains a zinc finger domain, and whose transcripts are upregulated in epimastigotes compared to trypomastigotes and amastigotes. TcZC3H12 knockout epimastigotes showed decreased growth rates and increased capacity to differentiate into metacyclic trypomastigotes. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed a TcZC3H12-dependent expression of epimastigote specific genes encoding amino acid transporters and proteins associated with differentiation (PAD), among others. RNA immunoprecipitation assays showed that transcripts from the PAD family interact with TcZC3H12. Taken together, these findings suggest that TcZC3H12 positively regulates the expression of genes involved in epimastigote proliferation and also acts as a negative regulator of metacyclogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Despite the success of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) most patients fail to respond durably, in part owing to reduced interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) sensitivity. Thus, elevating tumor IFN\u03b3-receptor 1 (IFN\u03b3-R1) expression to enhance IFN\u03b3-mediated cytotoxicity is of potential clinical interest. Here, we show that increased IFN\u03b3-R1 expression sensitizes tumors to IFN\u03b3-mediated killing. To unveil the largely undefined mechanism governing IFN\u03b3-R1 expression, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen for suppressors of its cell surface abundance. We uncovered STUB1 as key mediator of proteasomal degradation of the IFN\u03b3-R1/JAK1 complex. STUB1 inactivation amplified IFN\u03b3 signaling, thereby sensitizing to cytotoxic T cells, but also inducing PD-L1. STUB1 loss in a rational combination with PD-1 blockade strongly inhibited melanomas in vivo. Clinically corroborating these results, a STUB1-KO gene signature was strongly associated with anti-PD-1 response. These results uncover STUB1 as pivotal regulator of IFN\u03b3 tumor signaling and provide a rationale for its inhibition combined with anti-PD-1.Competing Interest StatementD.S.P. is co-founder, shareholder and advisor of Immagene B.V.\nM.A.L. is co-founder, shareholder and C.E.O. of Immagene B.V.\nThe other authors report no competing financial interests.\nView Full Text",

    "abstract": "Arteries are thought to be formed by the induction of a highly conserved arterial genetic program in a subset of vessels experiencing an increase in pulsatile and oxygenated blood flow. Both VEGF and Notch signalling have been shown to be essential for the initial steps of arterial specification. Here, we combined inducible genetic mosaics and transcriptomics to modulate and understand the function of these signalling pathways on cell proliferation, arterial-venous differentiation and mobilization. We observed that endothelial cells with high VEGF or Notch signalling are not genetically pre-determined and can form both arteries and veins. Importantly, cells completely lacking the Notch-Rbpj transcriptional activator complex can form arteries when the Myc-dependent metabolic and cell-cycle activity is suppressed. Thus, arterial development does not require the induction of a Notch-dependent arterial differentiation program, but rather the timely suppression of the endothelial metabolism and cell-cycle, a process preceding arterial mobilization and complete differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) and anti-bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signals are derived from the organiser of mesoderm origin and cooperate to promote Xenopus neural development from the gastrula ectoderm. Using antisense oligos to Fgf2 and Fgf8 and dominant-negative Ets transcription factors, we showed that the expression of Fgf2, Fgf8, and Ets in ectoderm cells is essential to initiate neural induction both in vivo and in vitro. Our findings show that neural induction is initiated primarily by autonomous signalling in ectoderm cells, rather than by paracrine signalling from organiser cells. The signalling in ectoderm cells is transduced via the Fgf/Ras/Mapk/Ets pathway, independent of Bmp signal inhibition via the Fgf/Ras/Mapk/Smad1 route, as indicated by earlier studies. Through the same pathway, Fgfs activated position-specific neural genes dose-dependently along the anteroposterior axis in cultured ectoderm cells. The expression of these genes coincides with the establishment of the activated Ets gradient within the gastrula ectoderm. Organiser cells, being located posteriorly to the ectoderm, secrete Fgfs as gastrulation proceeds, which among several candidate molecules initially promote neural patterning of the induced neuroectoderm as morphogens.\n\nSummary statementFgf/Ets signalling in ectodermal cells is required to initiate the expression of both anterior and posterior neural genes from the late blastula to gastrula stages, independent of anti-Bmp signalling.",

    "abstract": "During development, na\u00efve cells gradually acquire distinct cell fates, through sophisticated mechanisms of precise spatio-temporal gene regulation. Acquisition of cell fate is thought to rely on the specific interaction of remote cis-regulatory modules (e.g. enhancers, silencers) (CRM) and target promoters. However, the precise interplay between chromatin structure and gene expression is still unclear, particularly in single cells within multicellular developing organisms. Here we employ Hi-M, a single-cell spatial genomics approach, to systematically detect CRM-promoter looping interactions within topological associating domains (TADs) during Drosophila development. By comparing cis-regulatory loops in alternate cell types, we show that physical proximity does not necessarily instruct transcriptional states. Moreover, multi-way analyses revealed the existence of local interactions between multiple remote CRMs to form hubs. We found that loops and CRM hubs are established early during development, prior to the emergence of TADs. Moreover, CRM hubs are formed via the action of the pioneer transcription factor Zelda and precede transcriptional activation. Our approach offers a new perspective on the role of CRM-promoter interactions in defining transcriptional activation and repression states, as well as distinct cell types.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Determining which genes are targeted by miRNAs is crucial to elucidate their contributions to diverse biological processes in health and disease. Most miRNA target prediction tools rely on the identification of complementary regions between transcripts and miRNAs. Whereas important for target recognition, the presence of complementary sites is not sufficient to identify transcripts targeted by miRNAs. \nHere, we describe an unbiased statistical genomics approach that explores genetically driven changes in gene expression between human individuals. Using this approach, we identified transcripts that respond to physiological changes in miRNA levels. We found that a much smaller fraction of mRNAs expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) than what is predicted by other tools is targeted by miRNAs. We estimate that each miRNA has a relatively small number of targets. The transcripts we predict to be miRNA targets are enriched in AGO-binding and previously validated miRNAs target interactions, supporting the reliability of our predictions. Consistent with previous analysis, these targets are also enriched among dosage sensitive and highly controlled genes. \nAlmost a third of genes we predict to be miRNA targets lack sequence complementarity to the miRNA seed region (noncanonical targets). These noncanonical targets have higher complementary with the miRNA 3' end. The impact of miRNAs on the levels of their canonical or noncanonical targets is identical supporting the relevance of this poorly explored mechanism of targeting.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Pathogens can rapidly surmount crop resistance challenging global food security. On annual crops, pathogens must re-infect from environmental sources at the beginning of every growing season. Fungal pathogens evolved mixed reproductive strategies to cope with the distinct life cycle challenges of colonizing plants, spreading within fields and ultimately producing propagules for survival in winter. However, how genotypic diversity evolves over this period remains largely unknown. Here, we performed a deep hierarchical sampling in a single experimental wheat field infected by the major fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We analyzed whole genome sequences of 177 isolates collected from twelve distinct cultivars replicated in space at three time points of the growing season. The field population was highly diverse with 37 SNPs per kilobase and a linkage disequilibrium decay within 200-700 bp. We found that ~20% of the individual isolates were grouping into 15 clonal groups. Pairs of clones were disproportionally found at short distance (&lt;5m) but a low degree of dispersal occurred also at the scale of the entire field consistent with a predominant leaf-to-leaf dispersal. We found no association of wheat cultivars and clonal genotypes with the exception of one cultivar. Surprisingly, levels of clonality did not increase over time in the field although reproduction is thought to be exclusively asexual during the growing season. Our study shows that the pathogen establishes vast and stable gene pools in single fields over the growing season. Monitoring short-term evolutionary changes in crop pathogens will inform more durable strategies to contain diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Stromal cells contribute to organ integrity as fibroblasts and to vascular stability as pericytes, in addition to their enigmatic niche function in many tissues. Their inherent immunomodulatory capacity attracted particular attention, initiating numerous clinical trials, particularly testing trophic regeneration and immunomodulation. Key stromal immune functions are still enigmatic.\n\nHere we show that dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK-2) previously described for causing immune cell dysfunction plays a role in extra-hematopoietic immunity by regulating stromal/fibroblast immunomodulatory function. We used three independent strategies including iPSC-derived mesodermal stromal cell (MSC) lineage maturation, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) patient-derived cells and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout to support our findings.\n\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from healthy bone marrow and umbilical cord blood-derived fibroblasts by Sendai virus-mediated transient expression of Yamanaka factors. After mesoderm induction, stromal differentiation was induced by platelet-derived growth factors under animal serum-free conditions. Under feeder-free defined conditions, iPSCs differentiated into expandable and cryo-preservable CD73+/CD105+/Tra-1-81- early iPS-MSCs lacking immunosuppressive potential. Successive maturation was required for reaching the canonical MSC phenotype and immunomodulatory competence over time, while maintaining clonogenicity, comparable to parental MSCs. Sequential RNAseq revealed acquisition of a spectrum of immune-related genes significantly expressed in mature iPS-MSCs and resembling parental MSCs immune gene expression. The DOCK-2 gene attracted our attention because mutations can cause SCID. Interestingly, SCID patient-derived fibroblast lines harboring bi-allelic DOCK-2 mutations showed significantly reduced immunomodulatory capacity compared to non-mutated control fibroblasts. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DOCK-2 knockout in healthy iPSCs resulted in iPS-MSCs that also displayed reduced immunomodulatory capacity, thus confirming a role of DOCK-2 in stromal immune function. At a mechanistic level, DOCK-2 deficiency resulted in disturbed subcellular localization of CDC42.\n\nThis provides first evidence for an extra-hematopoietic immunomodulatory role of DOCK-2 in stromal cells, previously considered restricted to hampering immune cell migration/function resulting in SCID. We may speculate that some of the signs and symptoms of persisting immune disease after successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in SCID patients could at least in part be due to mutations, like DOCK-2-/-, permissive outside the hematopoietic immune system, as evidenced also by the increased virus infection susceptibility of DOCK-2 deficient fibroblasts.",

In this regard, individually and dynamically regulating the metabolic flux of single cells based on their cellular state is highly useful for improving the performance of populations. However, balancing the trade-offs between biomass formation and compound over-production requires sophisticated dynamic regulation networks (DRNs) which can be challenging. Here, we developed a growth coupled NCOMB (Naringenin-Coumaric acid-Malonyl-CoA-Balanced) DRN with systematic optimization of (2S)-naringenin and p-coumaric acid-responsive regulation pathways for real-time control of intracellular supply of malonyl-CoA. In doing so, the acyl carrier protein was used as a new critical node for fine-tuning malonyl-CoA consumption instead of fatty acid synthase.

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli periplasmic zinc-metallopeptidase BepA normally functions by promoting maturation of LptD, a \u03b2-barrel outer membrane protein involved in biogenesis of lipopolysaccharides, but degrades it when its membrane assembly is hampered. These processes should be properly regulated to ensure normal biogenesis of LptD, but the underlying mechanism of regulation, however, remains to be elucidated. A recently solved BepA structure has revealed unique features, in particular the active site is buried in the protease domain and conceivably inaccessible for substrate degradation. Additionally, the His-246 residue in the loop region containing helix \u03b19 (\u03b19/H246 loop), which has a potential flexibility and covers the active site, coordinates the zinc ion as the fourth ligand to exclude a catalytic water molecule, thereby suggesting that the crystal structure of BepA represents a latent form. To examine the roles of the \u03b19/H246 loop in the regulation of the BepA activity, we constructed BepA mutants with a His-246 mutation or a deletion of the \u03b19/H246 loop and analyzed their activities in vivo and in vitro. These mutants exhibited an elevated protease activity and, unlike the wild-type BepA, degraded LptD that is in the normal assembly pathway. In contrast, tethering of the \u03b19/H246 loop repressed the LptD degradation, which suggests that the flexibility of this loop is important to the exhibition of the protease activity. Based on these results, we propose that the \u03b19/H246 loop undergoes a reversible structural change that enables His-246-mediated switching (histidine switch) of its protease activity, which is important for regulated degradation of stalled/misassembled LptD.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Germline specification in mammals occurs through an inductive process whereby competent cells in the post-implantation epiblast differentiate into primordial germ cells (PGC). The intrinsic factors that endow epiblast cells with the competence to respond to germline inductive signals remain unknown. Single-cell RNA sequencing across multiple stages of an in vitro PGC-like cells (PGCLC) differentiation system shows that PGCLC genes initially expressed in the naive pluripotent stage become homogeneously dismantled in germline competent epiblast like-cells (EpiLC). In contrast, the decommissioning of enhancers associated with these germline genes is incomplete. Namely, a subset of these enhancers partly retain H3K4me1, accumulate less heterochromatic marks and remain accessible and responsive to transcriptional activators. Subsequently, as in vitro germline competence is lost, these enhancers get further decommissioned and lose their responsiveness to transcriptional activators. Importantly, using H3K4me1 deficient cells, we show that the loss of this histone modification reduces the germline competence of EpiLC and decreases PGCLC differentiation efficiency. Our work suggests that, although H3K4me1 might not be essential for enhancer function, it can facilitate the (re)activation of enhancers and the establishment of gene expression programs during specific developmental transitions.",

    "abstract": "Aims/hypothesisRecurrent hypoglycaemia (RH) is a major side-effect of intensive insulin therapy for people with diabetes. Changes in hypoglycaemia sensing by the brain contribute to the development of impaired counterregulatory responses to and awareness of hypoglycaemia. Little is known about the intrinsic changes in human astrocytes in response to acute and recurrent low glucose (RLG) exposure.\n\nMethodsHuman primary astrocytes (HPA) were exposed to zero, one, three or four bouts of low glucose (0.1 mmol/l) for three hours per day for four days to mimic RH. On the fourth day, DNA and RNA were collected. Differential gene expression and ontology analyses were performed using DESeq2 and GOseq respectively. DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip platform.\n\nResults24 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected (after correction for multiple comparisons). One bout of low glucose exposure had the largest effect on gene expression. Pathway analyses revealed that endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) stress-related genes such as HSPA5, XBP1, and MANF, involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), were all significantly increased following LG exposure, which was diminished following RLG. There was little correlation between differentially methylated positions and changes in gene expression yet the number of bouts of LG exposure produced distinct methylation signatures.\n\nConclusions/interpretationThese data suggest that exposure of human astrocytes to transient LG triggers activation of genes involved in the UPR linked to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Following RLG, the activation of UPR related genes was diminished, suggesting attenuated ER stress. This may be mediated by metabolic adaptations to better preserve intracellular and/or ER ATP levels, but this requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Collagen, the most thrombogenic constituent of blood vessel walls, activates platelets through glycoprotein VI (GPVI). In suspension, following platelet activation by collagen, GPVI is cleaved by A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase (ADAM)10 and ADAM17. In this study, we use single-molecule localization microscopy and a 2-level DBSCAN-based clustering tool to show that GPVI remains clustered along immobilised collagen fibres for at least 3 hours in the absence of significant shedding. Tyrosine phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Linker of Activated T cells (LAT), and elevation of intracellular Ca2+, are sustained over this period. Syk, but not Src kinase-dependent signalling is required to maintain clustering of the collagen integrin \u03b12\u03b21, whilst neither is required for GPVI. We propose that clustering of GPVI on immobilised collagen protects GPVI from shedding in order to maintain sustained Src and Syk-kinases dependent signalling, activation of integrin \u03b12\u03b21 and continued adhesion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Malaria has plausibly been the single strongest selective pressure on our species. Many of the best-characterized cases of adaptive evolution in humans are in genes tied to malaria resistance. However, the complex evolutionary patterns at these genes are poorly captured by standard scans for non-neutral evolution. Here we present three new statistical tests for selection based on population genetic patterns that are observed more than once among key malaria resistance loci. We assess these tests using forward-time evolutionary simulations and apply them to global whole-genome sequencing data from humans, and thus we show that they are effective at distinguishing selection from neutrality. Each test captures a distinct evolutionary pattern, here called Divergent Haplotypes, Repeated Shifts, and Arrested Sweeps, associated with a particular period of human prehistory. We clarify the selective signatures at known malaria-relevant genes and identify additional genes showing similar adaptive evolutionary patterns. Among our top outliers, we see a particular enrichment for genes involved in erythropoiesis and for genes previously associated with malaria resistance, consistent with a major role for malaria in shaping these patterns of genetic diversity. Polymorphisms at these genes are likely to impact resistance to malaria infection and contribute to ongoing host-parasite coevolutionary dynamics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "GRASP65 and GRASP55 have been implicated in stacking of Golgi cisternae and lateral linking of stacks within the Golgi ribbon. However, loss of gene function approaches by RNAi or gene knockout to dissect their respective roles often resulted in conflicting conclusions. Here, we gene-edited GRASP55 and/or GRASP65 with a degron tag in human fibroblasts, allowing for the induced rapid degradation by the proteasome. We show that acute depletion of either GRASP55 or GRASP65 does not affect the Golgi ribbon, while chronic degradation of GRASP55 disrupts lateral connectivity of the Golgi ribbon. Acute double depletion of both GRASPs coincides with the loss of the vesicle tethering proteins GM130, p115 and Golgin-45 from the Golgi and compromises ribbon linking. Furthermore, neither GRASP55 and/or GRASP65 are required for maintaining stacks or de novo assembly of stacked cisternae at the end of mitosis. These results demonstrate that both GRASPs are dispensable for Golgi stacking, but are involved in maintaining the integrity of Golgi ribbon together with GM130 and Golgin-45.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The Indian River Lagoon, located on the east coast of Florida, USA, is an Estuary of National Significance and an important economic and ecological resource. The Indian River Lagoon faces several environmental pressures, including freshwater discharges through the St. Lucie Estuary; accumulation of a anoxic, fine-grained, organic-rich sediment; and metal contamination from agriculture and marinas. Although the Indian River Lagoon has been well-studied, little is known about its microbial communities; thus, a two-year 16S amplicon sequencing study was conducted to assess the spatiotemporal changes of the sediment microbiome. In general, the Indian River Lagoon exhibited a microbiome that was consistent with other estuarine studies. Statistically different microbiomes were found between the Indian River Lagoon and St. Lucie Estuary due to changes in porewater salinity causing microbes that require salts for growth to be higher in the Indian River Lagoon. The St. Lucie Estuary exhibited more obvious microbial seasonality, such as higher Betaproteobacteriales, a freshwater associated organism, in wet season and higher Flavobacteriales in dry season samples. Distance-based linear models revealed these microbiomes were more affected by changes in total organic matter and copper than changes in temperature. Anaerobic organisms, such as Campylobacterales, were more associated with high total organic matter and copper samples while aerobic organisms, such as Nitrosopumilales, were more associated with low total organic matter and copper samples. This initial study fills the knowledge gap on the Indian River Lagoon microbiome and serves as an important baseline for possible future changes due to human impacts or environmental changes.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Out of the many pathogenic bacterial species that are known, only a fraction are readily identifiable directly from a complex microbial community using standard next generation DNA sequencing technology. Long-read sequencing offers the potential to identify a wider range of species and to differentiate between strains within a species, but attaining sufficient accuracy in complex metagenomes remains a challenge. Here, we describe and analytically validate LoopSeq, a commercially-available synthetic long-read (SLR) sequencing technology that generates highly-accurate long reads from standard short reads. LoopSeq reads are sufficiently long and accurate to identify microbial genes and species directly from complex samples. LoopSeq applied to full-length 16S rRNA genes from known strains in a microbial community perfectly recovered the full diversity of full-length exact sequence variants in a known microbial community. Full-length LoopSeq reads had a per-base error rate of 0.005%, which exceeds the accuracy reported for other long-read sequencing technologies. 18S-ITS and genomic sequencing of fungal and bacterial isolates confirmed that LoopSeq sequencing maintains that accuracy for reads up to 6 kilobases in length. Analysis of rinsate from retail meat samples demonstrated that LoopSeq full-length 16S rRNA synthetic long-reads could accurately classify organisms down to the species level, and could differentiate between different strains within species identified by the CDC as potential foodborne pathogens. The order-of-magnitude improvement in both length and accuracy over standard Illumina amplicon sequencing achieved with LoopSeq enables accurate species-level and strain identification from complex and low-biomass microbiome samples. The ability to generate accurate and long microbiome sequencing reads using standard short read sequencers will accelerate the building of quality microbial sequence databases and removes a significant hurdle on the path to precision microbial genomics.Competing Interest StatementMichael Balamotis and Tuval Ben Yehezkel are employees of Loop Genomics, the vendor for the synthetic long-read sequencing technology analyzed in this manuscript.View Full Text",

Nowadays, the treatment of breast cancer is still a problem. Radiotherapy resistance is one of the important factors leading to poor prognosis of clinical treatment. Curcumin, a plant polyphenol from Curcuma longa, has antitumor activity and inhibition of tumor recurrence and metastasis. However, the influence of curcumin on radiosensitivity of breast carcinoma xenografts, the synergistic effect and possible mechanism of curcumin and Glucose-Gold nanoparticles (Glu-GNPs) in nude mice in vivo need to be further explored. The model of transplanted tumor in nude mice was established and sensitized by intravenous injection of curcumin and Glu-GNPs. The results showed that curcumin can significantly inhibit the growth of tumor, and has no obvious effect on the body weight of nude mice, and Curcumin, Glu-GNPs and X-ray irradiation treatment alone or in combination could reduce the expression of VEGF and HSP90 mRNA and protein compared with model group in tumor tissue. The inhibition of irradiation resistance may be related to inhibiting the synthesis of VEGF and HSP90. This study suggested that curcumin and Glu-GNPs have the radiosensitization effect in vivo, which provides an experimental basis for the clinical development of green radiosensitizers.View Full Text",

However, the mechanisms that controls Atat1 activity remains poorly understood. Here, we show that a pool of vesicular ATP-citrate lyase Acly acts as a rate limiting enzyme to modulate Atat1 activity by controlling availability of Acetyl-Coenzyme-A (Acetyl-CoA). In addition, we showed that Acly expression is reduced upon loss of Elongator activity, further connecting Elongator to Atat1 in the pathway regulating \u03b1-tubulin acetylation and MT-dependent transport in projection neurons, across species. Remarkably, comparable defects occur in fibroblasts from Familial Dysautonomia (FD) patients bearing an autosomal recessive mutation in the gene coding for the Elongator subunit ELP1.

Among the extensive and crucial research that has been carried out in the last few months, the analysis of the virus-host relationship plays an important role in drug discovery. Virus-host protein-protein interactions are the active agents in virus replication, and the analysis of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks is fundamental to the study of the virus-host relationship. We have adapted and implemented a recent integer linear programming model for protein-protein interaction network alignment to virus-host networks, and obtained a consensus alignment of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interaction networks. Despite the lack of shared human proteins in these virus-host networks and the low number of preserved virus-host interactions, the consensus alignment revealed aligned human proteins that share a function related to viral infection, as well as human proteins of high functional similarity that interact with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whose alignment would preserve these virus-host interactions.View Full Text",

Constant flow cystometries (0.07 ml/min) at about 10 min interval were performed and the micturition threshold volume (MTV) was recorded and used as the dependent variable. After 4 - 5 stable control recordings, the tibial nerves of both sides were stimulated continuously for 5 min at 10 Hz, 3 times threshold for -motor axons. Six times of same stimulation were applied repeatedly with an interval of 5 min between the stimulations. The mean MTV was compiled from several cystometries in each half hour before the TNS and during, after 6 periods TNS.\n\nResultsDuring the experiment, all the animals survived in a good condition with reasonably stable micturition reflexes, a significant increase in MTV was revealed after TNS. The best effect (mean 178%) occurred during the first 30 min after 6 periods of stimulation. This clear threshold increase remained for at least 5 h.\n\nConclusionsA prolonged increase in MTV was demonstrated by a short periods of TNS repeatedly. This post stimulation modulatory effects of micturition reflex would provide a theoretical explanation for the clinical beneficial effect of TNS in patients with overactive bladder (OAB).",

    "abstract": "Audiovisual speech perception relies, among other things, on our expertise to map a speakers lip movements with speech sounds. This multimodal matching is facilitated by salient syllable features that align lip movements and acoustic envelope signals in the 4 - 8 Hz theta band. Although non-exclusive, the predominance of theta rhythms in speech processing has been firmly established by studies showing that neural oscillations track the acoustic envelope in the primary auditory cortex. Equivalently, theta oscillations in the visual cortex entrain to lip movements, and the auditory cortex is recruited during silent speech perception. These findings suggest that neuronal theta oscillations may play a functional role in organising information flow across visual and auditory sensory areas. We presented silent speech movies while participants performed a pure tone detection task to test whether entrainment to lip movements directs the auditory system and drives behavioural outcomes. We showed that auditory detection varied depending on the ongoing theta phase conveyed by lip movements in the movies. In a complementary experiment presenting the same movies while recording participants electro-encephalogram (EEG), we found that silent lip movements entrained neural oscillations in the visual and auditory cortices with the visual phase leading the auditory phase. These results support the idea that the visual cortex entrained by lip movements filtered the sensitivity of the auditory cortex via theta phase synchronisation.",

    "abstract": "In typical listeners, the perceptual salience of a surprising auditory event depends on the uncertainty of its context. For example, in melodies, pitch deviants are more easily detected and generate larger neural responses when the context is highly predictable than when it is less so. However, it is not known whether amusic listeners with abnormal pitch processing are sensitive to the degree of uncertainty of pitch sequences and, if so, whether they are to a different extent than typical non-musician listeners. To answer this question, we manipulated the uncertainty of short melodies while participants with and without congenital amusia underwent EEG recordings in a passive listening task. Uncertainty was manipulated by presenting melodies with different levels of complexity and familiarity, under the assumption that simpler and more familiar patterns would enhance pitch predictability. We recorded mismatch negativity (MMN) responses to pitch, intensity, timbre, location, and rhythm deviants as a measure of auditory surprise. In both participant groups, we observed reduced MMN amplitudes and longer peak latencies for all sound features with increasing levels of complexity, and putative familiarity effects only for intensity deviants. No significant group-by-complexity or group-by-familiarity interactions were detected. However, in contrast to previous studies, pitch MMN responses in amusics were disrupted in high complexity and unfamiliar melodies. The present results thus indicate that amusics are sensitive to the uncertainty of melodic sequences and that preattentive auditory change detection is greatly spared in this population across sound features and levels of predictability. However, our findings also hint at pitch-specific impairments in this population when uncertainty is high, thus suggesting that pitch processing under high uncertainty conditions requires an intact frontotemporal loop.",

However, a general theory describing the dynamics of this growth process does not exist. Here we obtain the first time-lapse reconstructions of neurons in living fly larvae over the entirety of their developmental stages. We show that these neurons expand in a remarkably regular stretching process that conserves their shape. Newly available space is filled optimally, a direct consequence of constraining the total amount of dendritic cable. We derive a mathematical model that predicts one time point from the previous and use this model to predict dendrite morphology of other cell types and species.

    "abstract": "Working memory (WM) performance is very often measured using the n-back task, in which the participant is presented with a sequence of stimuli, and required to indicate whether the current stimulus matches the one presented n steps earlier. In this study, we used high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) coupled to source localization to obtain information on spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of neural oscillations associated with WM update, maintenance and readout. Specifically, we a priori selected regions from a large fronto-parietal network, including also the insula and the cerebellum, and we analyzed modulation of neural oscillations by event-related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS).\n\nDuring update and readout, we found larger {theta} ERS and smaller {beta} ERS respect to maintenance in all the selected areas. {gamma}LOW and {gamma}HIGH bands oscillations decreased in the frontal and insular cortices of the left hemisphere. In the maintenance phase we observed focally decreased {theta} oscillations and increased {beta} oscillations (ERS) in most of the selected posterior areas and focally increased oscillations in {gamma}LOW and {gamma}HIGH bands in the frontal and insular cortices of the left hemisphere. Finally, during WM readout, we also found a focal modulation of the {gamma}LOW band in the left fusiform cortex and cerebellum, depending on the response trial type (true positive vs. true negative).\n\nOverall, our study demonstrated specific spectral signatures associated with updating of memory information, WM maintenance and readout, with relatively high spatial resolution.",

    "abstract": "Recent work identified that patterns of distributed brain regions sharing similar myeloarchitecture are related to underlying functional connectivity, demonstrating cortical myelins plasticity to changes in functional demand. However, the changing relation between functional connectivity and structural architecture throughout child and adulthood is poorly understood. We show that structural covariance connectivity measured using T1-weighted/T2-weighted ratio and functional connectivity measured using magnetoencephalography exhibit nonlinear developmental changes. We then show significant relations between structural and functional connectivity, which have both shared and distinct characteristics dependent on the neural oscillatory frequency. Increases in structure-function coupling are visible during the protracted myelination observed throughout childhood and adolescence, and are followed by decreases near the onset of adulthood to potentially support increasing cognitive flexibility and functional specialization in adulthood. Our work lays the foundation for understanding the mechanisms by which myeloarchitecture supports brain function, enabling future investigations into how clinical populations may deviate from normative patterns.",
