    "abstract": "Bacterial two component systems (TCSs) have been studied for decades; however, most work has focused on individual domains or proteins. Systematic characterization of an entire TCS could provide a mechanistic understanding of these important signal transduction systems. Here, genetic selections were employed to dissect the molecular basis of signal transduction by the HitRS system that has been implicated in detecting cell envelope stress in the pathogen Bacillus anthracis. Numerous point mutations were isolated within HitRS, 17 of which were in a 50-residue HAMP domain. Mutational analysis revealed the importance of hydrophobic interactions within the HAMP domain and highlighted its essentiality in TCS signaling. In addition, these data defined residues critical for activities intrinsic to HitRS, uncovered specific interactions among individual domains and between the two signaling proteins, and revealed that phosphotransfer is the rate-limiting step for signal transduction. This study establishes the use of unbiased genetic selections to study TCS signaling, provides a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of an entire TCS, and lays the foundation for development of novel antimicrobial therapeutics against this important infectious threat.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Amino acid substitutions at nonconserved protein positions can have non-canonical and \u201clong-distance\u201d outcomes on protein function. Such outcomes might arise from changes in the internal protein communication network, which is often accompanied by changes in structural flexibility. To test this, we calculated flexibilities (\u201cDFI\u201d) and dynamic coupling (\u201cDCI\u201d) for positions in the linker region of the lactose repressor protein (\u201cLacI\u201d). This region contains nonconserved positions for which substitutions alter DNA binding affinity. We first chose to study eleven substitutions at position 52. In computations, substitutions showed long-range effects on flexibilities of DNA binding positions, and the degree of flexibility change correlated with experimentally-measured changes in DNA binding. Substitutions also altered dynamic coupling to DNA binding positions in a manner that captured other experimentally-determined functional changes. Next, we broadened calculations to consider the dynamic coupling between 17 linker positions and the DNA binding domain. Experimentally, these linker positions exhibited a wide range of substitution outcomes: Four conserved positions tolerated almost no substitutions (\u201ctoggle\u201d), ten nonconserved positions showed progressive changes from a range of substitutions (\u201crheostat\u201d), and three nonconserved positions tolerated almost all substitutions (\u201cneutral\u201d). In computations with wild-type LacI, the dynamic couplings between the DNA binding domain and these linker positions showed varied degrees of asymmetry that correlated with the observed toggle/rheostat/neutral substitution outcomes. Thus, we propose that long-range and non-canonical substitutions outcomes at nonconserved positions arise from re-wiring long-range communication among functionally-important positions. Such calculations might enable predictions for substitution outcomes at a range of nonconserved positions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "It has long been understood that some proteins to undergo conformational transitions enroute to the Michaelis Complex to allow chemistry. Examination of crystal structures of glycosyltransferase enzymes in the GT-B structural class reveals that the presence of ligand in the active site is necessary for the protein to crystalize in the closed conformation. Herein we describe microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of two evolutionarily unrelated glycosytransferases, HepI and GtfA. Simulations were performed using these proteins in the open and closed conformations, (respectively,) and we sought to identify the major dynamical modes and communication networks which allow conformational transition between the open and closed structures. We provide the first reported evidence (within the scope of our experimental parameters) that conformational hierarchy/directionality of the interconversion between open and closed conformations is a conserved feature of enzymes of the same structural superfamily. Additionally, residues previously identified to be important for substrate binding in HepI were shown to have strong negative correlations with non-ionizable residues distal to the active site. Mutagenesis of these residues produced mutants with altered enzymatic efficiency exhibiting lower Km values, while the kcat is effectively unchanged. The negatively correlated motions of these residues are important for substrate binding and forming the Michaelis complex, without impacting the activation barrier for catalysis. This suggests that in the bi-domain HepI, the enzyme dynamics did not impact the transition state stabilization or chemistry, but rather earlier steps along the reaction coordinate, leading to the reorganization of the active site electrostatic environment required for catalysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsGTglycosyltransferaseHepIheptosyltransferase IheptoseL-glycero-D-manno-heptoseADP-heptose or ADPHADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptoseLPSlipopolysaccharide;ODLAO-deacylated E. coli Kdo2-lipid A;Trptryptophan;Proproline;Glyglycine;Argarginine;Lyslysine;CDcircular dichroism;MDMolecular Dynamics;PDBProtein Data BankPCAPrincipal Component Analysis,DCCDynamic Cross CorrelationView Full Text",

The goal of those studies is to translate the findings from in vitro studies of cancer cell lines into in vivo therapeutic relevance and, eventually, patients\u2019 care. Tremendous progress has been made. In this work, we built predictive models for 453 drugs using data on gene expression and drug sensitivity (IC50) from cancer cell lines. We identified many known drug-gene interactions and uncovered several potentially novel drug-gene associations. Importantly, we further applied these predictive models to \u223c17,000 bulk RNA-seq samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to predict drug sensitivity for both normal and tumor tissues. We created a web site for users to visualize and download our predicted data (https://edelgene.niehs.nih.gov/cancerRxTissue). Using trametinib as an example, we showed that our approach can faithfully recapitulate the known tumor specificity of the drug. We further demonstrated that our approach can predict drugs that 1) are tumor-type specific; 2) elicit higher sensitivity from tumor compared to corresponding normal tissue; 3) elicit differential sensitivity across breast cancer subtypes. If validated, our predictions could have clinical relevance for patients\u2019 care.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Background Candida glabrata is a human opportunistic pathogen that can cause life-threatening systemic infections. Although, there are multiple effective vaccines against fungal infections, and some of these vaccines were engaged in different stages of clinical trials, none of them yet approved by (FDA).Aim To predict the most conserved and immunogenic B- and T-cell epitopes from the Fructose Bisphosphate aldolase (Fba1) protein of C. glabrata.Materials and Methods 13 C. glabrata Fructose bisphosphate aldolase protein sequences (361amino acid) were retrieved from NCBI and several in silico tools presented in the IEDB server for predicting peptides were used and homology modeling and molecular docking were performed.Result The promising B-cell Epitopes were AYFKPH, VDKESLYTK, and HVDKESLYTK. While, promising peptides which have the high affinity to MHC I binding were: AVHEALAPI, KYFKRMAAM, QTSNGGAAY, RMAAMNQWL and YFKEHGEPL. Two peptides (LFSSHMLDL and YIRSIAPAY) were noted to have the highest affinity to MHC class II that interact with 9 MHC class II alleles. The molecular Docking revealed the epitopes QTSNGGAAY and LFSSHMLDL have the high binding energy to MHC moleculesConclusion The epitope-based vaccines predicted by using immunoinformatics tools have remarkable advantages over the conventional vaccines that they are more specific, less time consuming, safe, less allergic and more antigenic. Further in vivo and in vitro experiments are needed to prove the effectiveness of the best candidates epitopes (QTSNGGAAY and LFSSHMLDL). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has predicted B- and T-cells epitopes from Fba1 protein by using in silico tools in order to design an effective epitope-based vaccine against C. galabrata.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "In this article, we present Biologically Annotated Neural Networks (BANNs), a nonlinear probabilistic framework for association mapping in genome-wide association (GWA) studies. BANNs are feedforward models with partially connected architectures that are based on biological annotations. This setup yields a fully interpretable neural network where the input layer encodes SNP-level effects, and the hidden layer models the aggregated effects among SNP-sets. We treat the weights and connections of the network as random variables with prior distributions that reflect how genetic effects manifest at different genomic scales. The BANNs software uses variational inference to provide posterior summaries which allow researchers to simultaneously perform (i) mapping with SNPs and (ii) enrichment analyses with SNP-sets on complex traits. Through simulations, we show that our method improves upon state-of-the-art association mapping and enrichment approaches across a wide range of genetic architectures. We then further illustrate the benefits of BANNs by analyzing real GWA data assayed in approximately 2,000 heterogenous stock of mice from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics and approximately 7,000 individuals from the Framingham Heart Study. Lastly, using a random subset of individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank, we show that BANNs is able to replicate known associations in high and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol content.\n\nAuthor SummaryA common goal in genome-wide association (GWA) studies is to characterize the relationship between genotypic and phenotypic variation. Linear models are widely used tools in GWA analyses, in part, because they provide significance measures which detail how individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are statistically associated with a trait or disease of interest. However, traditional linear regression largely ignores non-additive genetic variation, and the univariate SNP-level mapping approach has been shown to be underpowered and challenging to interpret for certain trait architectures. While nonlinear methods such as neural networks are well known to account for complex data structures, these same algorithms have also been criticized as \"black box\" since they do not naturally carry out statistical hypothesis testing like classic linear models. This limitation has prevented nonlinear regression approaches from being used for association mapping tasks in GWA applications. Here, we present Biologically Annotated Neural Networks (BANNs): a flexible class of feedforward models with partially connected architectures that are based on biological annotations. The BANN framework uses approximate Bayesian inference to provide interpretable probabilistic summaries which can be used for simultaneous (i) mapping with SNPs and (ii) enrichment analyses with SNP-sets (e.g., genes or signaling pathways). We illustrate the benefits of our method over state-of-the-art approaches using extensive simulations. We also demonstrate the ability of BANNs to recover novel and previously discovered genomic associations using quantitative traits from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, the Framingham Heart Study, and the UK Biobank.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique consisting in the application of weak electric currents on the scalp. Although previous studies have demonstrated the clinical value of tDCS for modulating sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, there are still huge gaps in the knowledge of the underlying physiological mechanisms. To define the immediate impact as well as the after-effects of tDCS on sensory processing, we first performed electrophysiological recordings in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of alert mice during and after administration of S1-tDCS, and followed up with immunohistochemical analysis of the stimulated brain regions. During the application of cathodal and anodal transcranial currents we observed polarity-specific bidirectional changes in the N1 component of the sensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) and associated gamma oscillations. Regarding the long-term effects observed after 20 min of tDCS, cathodal stimulation produced significant after-effects including a decreased SEP amplitude for up to 30 min, a power reduction in the 20-80 Hz range and a decrease in gamma event related synchronization (ERS). In contrast, no significant long-term changes in SEP amplitude or power analysis were observed after anodal stimulation except for a significant increase in gamma ERS after tDCS cessation. The polarity-specific differences of these long-term effects were corroborated by immunohistochemical analysis, which revealed an unbalance of GAD 65-67 immunoreactivity between the stimulated vs. non-stimulated S1 region only after cathodal tDCS. These results highlight the differences between immediate and long-term effects of tDCS, as well as the asymmetric long-term changes induced by anodal and cathodal stimulation.\n\nSignificance StatementHere we provide a first glimpse at the immediate and long-term impact of tDCS on neural processing in alert animals. The obtained results highlight the complexity of tDCS-associated effects, which include both bidirectional as well as asymmetrical modulation depending on the polarity of the stimulation. This asymmetry suggests the implication of different mechanisms underlying the long-term effects induced by anodal and cathodal transcranial currents. Identifying and defining these effects and its associated mechanisms is crucial to help design effective protocols for clinical applications.",

However, the RT-qPCR assay has limitations in terms of sensitivity and quantification. In this study, we tested both qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect low amounts of viral RNA. The cycle threshold (CT) of viral RNA by RT-PCR significantly varied according to the sequence of primer and probe sets with in vitro transcript (IVT) RNA or viral RNA as templates, whereas the copy number of viral RNA by ddPCR was effectively quantified with IVT RNA, cultured viral RNA, and RNA from clinical samples.

The primary immunological target is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. S is exposed on the viral surface to mediate viral entry into the host cell. To identify possible antibody binding sites not shielded by glycans, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of a 4.1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length, fully glycosylated and palmitoylated S proteins. By mapping steric accessibility, structural rigidity, sequence conservation and generic antibody binding signatures, we recover known epitopes on S and reveal promising epitope candidates for vaccine development.

    "abstract": "Extensive testing is essential to break the transmission of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, CRISPR-based diagnostics have emerged as attractive alternatives to quantitative real-time PCR due to their faster turnaround time and their potential to be used in point-of-care testing scenarios. However, existing CRISPR-based assays for COVID-19 have not considered viral genome mutations and RNA editing in human cells. Here, we present the VaNGuard (Variant Nucleotide Guard) test that is not only specific and sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, but can also detect the virus when its genome or transcriptome has evolved or has been edited by deaminases in infected human cells. We show that an engineered AsCas12a enzyme is more tolerant of mismatches than wildtype LbCas12a and that multiplexed Cas12a targeting can overcome the presence of single nucleotide variations.

    "abstract": "Corals are colonized by symbiotic microorganisms that exert a profound influence on the animals health. One noted symbiont is a single-celled alga (from the family Symbiodiniaceae), which provides the coral with most of its fixed carbon. During thermal stress, hyperactivity of photosynthesis results in a toxic accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). If not scavenged by the antioxidant network, ROS may trigger a signaling cascade ending with the coral host and algal symbiont disassociating; this process is known as bleaching. Our goal was to construct a probiotic comprised of host-associated bacteria able to neutralize free radicals such as ROS. Using the coral model, the anemone Exaiptasia diaphana, and pure bacterial cultures isolated from the model animal, we identified six strains with high free radical scavenging ability belonging to the families Alteromonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and Micrococcaceae. In parallel, we established a \"negative\" probiotic consisting of genetically related strains with poor free radical scavenging capacities. From their whole genome sequences, we explored genes of interest that may contribute to their potential beneficial roles, which may help facilitate the therapeutic application of a bacterial probiotic. In particular, the occurrence of key pathways that are known to influence ROS in each of the strains has been inferred from the genomes sequences and are reported here.\n\nIMPORTANCECoral bleaching is tightly linked to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which accumulates to a toxic level in algae-harboring host cells leading to coral-algal dissociation. Interventions targeting ROS accumulation, such as the application of exogenous antioxidants, have shown promise for maintaining the coral-algal partnership. With the feasibility of administering antioxidants directly to corals being low, we aim to develop a probiotic to neutralize toxic ROS during a thermal stress event. This probiotic can be tested with corals or a coral model to assess its efficacy in improving coral resistance to environmental stress.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAntimicrobial resistant (AMR) Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an urgent threat to public health, as strains resistant to at least one of the two last line antibiotics used in empiric therapy of gonorrhoea, ceftriaxone and azithromycin, have spread internationally. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data can be used to identify new AMR clones, transmission networks and inform the development of point-of-care tests for antimicrobial susceptibility, novel antimicrobials and vaccines. Community driven tools that provide an easy access to and analysis of genomic and epidemiological data is the way forward for public health surveillance.\n\nMethodsHere we present a public health focussed scheme for genomic epidemiology of N. gonorrhoeae at Pathogenwatch (https://pathogen.watch/ngonorrhoeae). An international advisory group of experts in epidemiology, public health, genetics and genomics of N. gonorrhoeae was convened to inform on the utility of current and future analytics in the platform. We implement backwards compatibility with MLST, NG-MAST and NG-STAR typing schemes as well as an exhaustive library of genetic AMR determinants linked to a genotypic prediction of resistance to eight antibiotics. A collection of over 12,000 N. gonorrhoeae genome sequences from public archives has been quality-checked, assembled and made public together with available metadata for contextualization.\n\nResultsAMR prediction from genome data revealed specificity values over 99% for azithromycin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone and sensitivity values around 99% for benzylpenicillin and tetracycline. A case study using the Pathogenwatch collection of N. gonorrhoeae public genomes showed the global expansion of an azithromycin resistant lineage carrying a mosaic mtr over at least the last 10 years, emphasizing the power of Pathogenwatch to explore and evaluate genomic epidemiology questions of public health concern.\n\nConclusionsThe N. gonorrhoeae scheme in Pathogenwatch provides customized bioinformatic pipelines guided by expert opinion that can be adapted to public health agencies and departments with little expertise in bioinformatics and lower resourced settings with internet connection but limited computational infrastructure. The advisory group will assess and identify ongoing public health needs in the field of gonorrhoea, particularly regarding gonococcal AMR, in order to further enhance utility with modified or new analytic methods.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome plays an important role in human health and disease. Gnotobiotic animal and in vitro cell-based models provide some informative insights into mechanistic crosstalk. However, there is no existing system for a chronic co-culture of a human colonic mucosal barrier with super oxygen-sensitive commensal microbes, hindering the study of human-microbe interactions in a controlled manner. Here, we investigated the effects of an abundant super oxygen-sensitive commensal anaerobe, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, on a primary human mucosal barrier using a Gut-MIcrobiome (GuMI) physiome platform that we designed and fabricated. Chronic continuous co-culture of F. prausnitzii for two days with colon epithelia, enabled by continuous flow of completely anoxic apical media and aerobic basal media, resulted in a strictly anaerobic apical environment fostering growth of and butyrate production by F. prausnitzii, while maintaining a stable colon epithelial barrier. We identified elevated differentiation and hypoxia-responsive genes and pathways in the platform compared with conventional aerobic static culture of the colon epithelia, attributable to a combination of anaerobic environment and continuous medium replenishment. Furthermore, we demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects of F. prausnitzii through HDAC and the TLR-NFKB axis. Finally, we identified that butyrate largely contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects by downregulating TLR3 and TLR4. Our results are consistent with some clinical observations regarding F. prausnitzii, thus motivating further studies employing this platform with more complex engineered colon tissues for understanding the interaction between the human colonic mucosal barrier and microbiota, pathogens, or engineered bacteria.Competing Interest StatementA provisional patent was filed.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Active microrheology is one of the main methods to determine the mechanical properties of cells and tissue, and the modelling of the viscoelastic properties of cells and tissue is under heavy debate with many competing approaches. Most experimental methods of active microrheology such as optical tweezers or atomic force microscopy based approaches rely on single cell measurements, and thus suffer from a low throughput. Here, we present a novel method for cell based microrheology using acoustic forces which allows multiplexed measurements of several cells in parallel. Acoustic Force Spectroscopy (AFS) is used to generate multi-oscillatory forces in the range of pN-nN on particles attached to primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultivated inside a microfluidic chip. While the AFS was introduced as a single-molecule technique to measure mechanochemical properties of biomolecules, we exploit the AFS to measure the dynamic viscoelastic properties of cells exposed to different conditions, such as flow shear stresses or drug injections. By controlling the force and measuring the position of the particle, the complex shear modulus G*(\u03c9) can be measured continuously over several hours. The resulting power-law shear moduli are consistent with fractional viscoelastic models. In our experiments we confirm a decrease in shear modulus after perturbing the actin cytoskeleton via cytochalasin B. This effect was reversible after washing out the drug. Although these measurements are possible, we provide critical information regarding the AFS as a measurement tool showing its capabilities and limitations. A key result is that for performing viscoelastic measurements with the AFS, a thorough calibration and careful data analysis is crucial, for which we provide protocols and guidelines.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Kinesin-5 motors play essential roles in spindle apparatus assembly during cell division, by generating forces to establish and maintain the spindle bipolarity essential for proper chromosome segregation. Kinesin-5 is largely conserved structurally and functionally in model eukaryotes, but its role is unknown in the Plasmodium parasite, an evolutionarily divergent organism with several atypical features of both mitotic and meiotic cell division. We have investigated the function and subcellular location of kinesin-5 during cell division throughout the Plasmodium berghei life cycle. Deletion of kinesin-5 had little visible effect at any proliferative stage except sporozoite production in oocysts, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of motile sporozoites in mosquito salivary glands, which were able to infect a new vertebrate host. Live-cell imaging showed kinesin-5-GFP located on the spindle and at spindle poles during both atypical mitosis and meiosis. Fixed-cell immunofluorescence assays revealed kinesin-5 co-localized with -tubulin and centrin-2 and a partial overlap with kinetochore marker NDC80 during early blood stage schizogony. Dual-colour live-cell imaging showed that kinesin-5 is closely associated with NDC80 during male gametogony, but not with kinesin-8B, a marker of the basal body and axonemes of the forming flagella. Treatment of gametocytes with microtubule-specific inhibitors confirmed kinesin-5 association with nuclear spindles and not cytoplasmic axonemal microtubules. Altogether, our results demonstrate that kinesin-5 is associated with the spindle apparatus, expressed in proliferating parasite stages, and important for efficient production of infectious sporozoites.",

    "abstract": "Maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy is a large driver of health inequalities and a higher prevalence of conduct problem has been observed in exposed offspring. Further, maternal tobacco use during pregnancy can also alter offspring DNA methylation. However, currently, limited molecular evidence have been found to support this observation. Thus we aim to examine the association between maternal tobacco use in pregnancy and whether offspring Conduct problems is mediated by tobacco exposure-induced via DNA methylation differences. Understanding the etiology of the causal link will be crucial in the early identification and treatment of CP in children and adolescents. DNA was sourced from the Christchurch Health and Development Study, a longitudinal birth cohort studied for over 40 years in New Zealand. Bisulfite-based amplicon sequencing of 10 loci known to play a role in neurodevelopment, or with associations with CP phenotypes, was undertaken. We identified nominally significant differential DNA methylation at specific CpG sites in CYP1A1, ASH2L and MEF2C in individuals with Conduct problems who were exposed to tobacco in utero. We conclude that environmentally-induced DNA methylation differences could play a role in the observed link between maternal tobacco use during pregnancy and childhood/adolescent Conduct problems However, larger sample sizes are needed to produce an adequate amount of power to investigate this interaction further.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional chromatin looping interactions play an important role in constraining enhancer-promoter interactions and mediating transcriptional gene regulation. CTCF is thought to play a critical role in the formation of these loops, but the specificity of which CTCF binding events form loops and which do not is difficult to predict. Loops often have convergent CTCF binding site motif orientation, but this constraint alone is only weakly predictive of genome-wide interaction data. Here we present an easily interpretable and simple mathematical model of CTCF mediated loop formation which is consistent with Cohesin extrusion and can predict ChIA-PET CTCF looping interaction measurements with high accuracy. Competition between overlapping loops is a critical determinant of loop specificity. We show that this model is consistent with observed chromatin interaction frequency changes induced by CTCF binding site deletion, inversion, and mutation, and is also consistent with observed constraints on validated enhancer-promoter interactions.",

    "abstract": "The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) is a group of related pathogens that cause tuberculosis (TB) in mammals. MTBC species are distinguished by their ability to sustain in distinct host populations. While Mycobacterium bovis (Mbv) sustains transmission cycles in cattle and wild animals and causes zoonotic TB, M. tuberculosis (Mtb) affects human populations and seldom causes disease in cattle. However, the host and pathogen determinants driving host tropism between MTBC species are still unknown. Macrophages are the main host cell that encounters mycobacteria upon initial infection and we hypothesised that early interactions between the macrophage and mycobacteria influence species-specific disease outcome. To identify factors that contribute to host tropism, we analysed both blood-derived primary human and bovine macrophages (hM{phi} or bM{phi}, respectively) infected with Mbv and Mtb. We show that Mbv and Mtb reside in different cellular compartments and differentially replicate in hM{phi} whereas both Mbv and Mtb efficiently replicate in bM{phi}. Specifically, we show that out of the four infection combinations, only the infection of bM{phi} with Mbv promoted the formation of multinucleated cells (MNCs), a hallmark of tuberculous granulomas. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that both MPB70 from Mbv and extracellular vesicles released by Mbv-infected bM{phi} promote macrophage multi-nucleation. Importantly, we extend our in vitro studies to show that granulomas from Mbv-infected but not Mtb-infected cattle contained higher numbers of MNCs. Our findings implicate MNC formation in the contrasting pathology between Mtb and Mbv for the bovine host, and identify MPB70 from Mbv and extracellular vesicles from bM{phi} as mediators of this process.",

The Pygmaeomyces cultures were isolated from the roots of mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia) and pitch pine (Pinus rigida) from the acidic and oligotrophic New Jersey Pygmy Pine Plains; however, they likely have a broader distribution because their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences have high similarity with a number of environmental sequences from multiple independent studies. Based on the phylogeny and phenotypical characters, a new family Pygmaeomycetaceae is proposed to accommodate this new lineage in Mucoromycotina. Pygmaeomycetaceae corresponds to Clade GS23, which was identified based on a sequence-only soil fungal survey and was believed to be a distinct new class. Compared to the culture-based methods, we observed that sequence-only analyses tend to over-estimate the taxonomic level.

    "abstract": "The influence of quasispecies dynamics on long-term virus diversification in nature is a largely unexplored question. Specifically, whether intra-host nucleotide and amino acid variation in quasispecies fits variation observed in consensus sequences or data bank alignments is unknown. Genome conservation and dynamics simulations are used for the computational design of universal vaccines, therapeutic antibodies and pan-genomic antiviral agents. The expectation is that selection of escape mutants will be limited when mutations at conserved residues are required. This strategy assumes long-term (epidemiologically relevant) conservation but, critically, does not consider short-term (quasispecies-dictated) residue conservation. We have calculated mutant frequencies of individual loci from mutant spectra of hepatitis C virus (HCV) populations passaged in cell culture and from infected patients. Nucleotide or amino acid conservation in consensus sequences of the same populations, or in the Los Alamos HCV data bank did not match residue conservation in mutant spectra. The results relativize the concept of sequence conservation in viral genetics, and suggest that residue invariance in data banks is an insufficient basis for the design of universal viral ligands for clinical purposes. Our calculations suggest relaxed mutational restrictions during quasispecies dynamics, which may contribute to higher calculated short-term than long-term viral evolutionary rates.",

    "abstract": "Paper-based DNA biosensors are powerful tools in point-of-care diagnostics since they are affordable, portable, user-friendly, rapid and robust. However, their sensitivity is not always as high as required to enable DNA quantification. To improve the response of standard dot blots, we have applied a new enhancement strategy that increases the sensitivity of assays based on the use of biotinylated silica-nanoparticles (biotin-Si-NPs). After immobilization of a genomic Campylobacter DNA onto a paper membrane, and addition of a biotinylated-DNA detection probe, hybridization was evidenced using streptavidin-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of luminol and H2O2. Replacement of the single biotin by the biotin-Si-NPs boosted on average a 30 fold chemiluminescent read-out of the biosensor. Characterization of biotin-Si-NPs onto a paper with immobilized DNA was done using a scanning electron microscope. A limit of detection of 3 pg/L of DNA, similar to the available qPCR kits, is achieved, but it is cheaper, easier and avoids inhibition of DNA polymerase by molecules from the food matrices. We demonstrated that the new dot blot coupled to biotin-Si-NPs successfully detected Campylobacter from naturally contaminated chicken meat, without needing a PCR step. Hence, such an enhanced dot blot paves the path to the development of a portable and multiplex paper based platform for point-of-care screening of chicken carcasses for Campylobacter.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=54 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/185827v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14eca5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bc582borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@40836eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@174caaf_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The aim of our study was to source such bacteria from horticultural produce and environments and to explore the mechanisms of their antimicrobial properties. Four strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens were isolated that possessed antibacterial activity against the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. These strains (PFR46H06, PFR46H07, PFR46H08 and PFR46H09) were tested against L. monocytogenes (n=31), L. seeligeri (n=1) and L. innocua (n=1) isolated from seafood and horticultural sources, and two L. monocytogenes from clinical cases (Scott A and ATCC 49594, n=2). All Listeria strains were inhibited by the three strains PFR46H07, PFR46H08 and PFR46H09 with average zones of inhibition of 14.8, 15.1 and 18.2 mm, respectively, with PFR46H09 having significantly more inhibition than the other two (p<0.05). PFR46H06 showed minimal inhibition towards the L. seeligeri and L. innocua isolates and no inhibition towards most of the L. monocytogenes isolates. In order to investigate the functional protein differences between these strains, all four strains were subjected to whole cell lysate proteomics; data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD019965. We found significant differences in the peptide profiles and protein summaries between these isolates. The total number of proteins identified was 1781 in PFR46H06, 2030 in PFR46H07, 2228 in PFR46H08 and 1994 in PFR46H09. We paid special attention to secretion system proteins as these play a main role in the defense mechanisms of bacteria, particularly those of the type VI secretion system (T6SS) and found that they varied significantly (p<0.001) among the four isolates. PFR46H06 and PFR46H07 possessed the fewest secretion system structural proteins (12 and 11 respectively) while PFR46H08 and PFR46H09 each had 18. PFR46H09, which showed the greatest antimicrobial effect, had nine T6SS proteins compared to just four in the other three strains.",

The strain ADMK78T grows best at 28{degrees}C and pH 7.0 and can tolerate up to 2% (w/v) NaCl. Based on 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, the strain ADMK78T belongs to the genus Rhizobium, with the highest similarity to Rhizobium wuzhouense W44T (98.7%) and Rhizobium ipomoeae shin9-1T (97.9%). Core-genes based phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strain ADMK78T forms a distinct branch in between Rhizobium ipomoeae shin9-1T and Rhizobium selenitireducens BAA-1503T. The average nucleotide identity of ADMK78T was less than 82%, to members of the family Rhizobiaceae. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain ADMK78T is 58.6 mol%. The major fatty acids of strain ADMK78T were C18:0 and C18:1 {omega}7c. The strain ADMK78T showed differences in physiological, phenotypic, and protein profiles estimated by MALDI-TOF MS to its closest relatives. Based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic properties, and phylogenetic analyses, the strain ADMK78T could be distinguished from the recognized species of the genus Rhizobium. It is suggested to represent a novel species of this genus, for which the name Rhizobium desertarenae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is ADMK78T (=MCC 3400T; KACC 21383T; JCM 33657T).",

    "abstract": "The bacterial cell wall is composed primarily of peptidoglycan (PG), a poly-aminosugar that is essential to sustain cell shape, growth and structural integrity. PG is synthesized by two different types of synthase complexes (class A Penicillin-binding Proteins [PBP]s/Lpos and Shape, Elongation, Division, Sporulation [SEDS]/class B PBP pairs) and degraded by  autolytic enzymes to accommodate growth processes. It is thought that autolsyin activity (and particulary the activity of endopeptidases, EPs) is required for PG synthesis and incorporation by creating gaps that are patched and paved by PG synthases, but the exact relationship between autolysins and the separate synthesis machineries remains incompletely understood. Here, we have probed the consequences of EP depletion for PG synthesis in the diarrheal pathogen Vibrio cholerae. We found that EP depletion resulted in severe morphological defects, increased cell mass, a decline in viability, and continuing (yet aberrant) incorporation of cell wall material. Mass increase and cell wall incorporation proceeded in the presence of Rod system inhibitors, but was abolished upon inhibition of aPBPs. However, the Rod system remained functional (i.e., exhibited sustained directed motion) even after prolonged EP depletion, without effectively promoting cell elongation. Lastly, heterologous expression of an EP from Neisseria gonorrhoeae could fully complement growth and morphology of an EP-insufficient V. cholerae. Overall, our findings suggest that in V. cholerae, the Rod system requires endopeptidase activity (but not necessarily direct interaction with EPs) to promote cell expansion and substantial PG incorporation, whereas aPBPs are able to engage in sacculus construction even during severe EP insufficiency.\n\nImportanceSynthesis and turnover of the bacterial cell wall must be tightly co-ordinated to avoid structural integrity failure and cell death. Details of this coordination are poorly understood, particularly if and how cell wall turnover enzymes are required for the activity of the different cell wall synthesis machines. Our results suggest that in Vibrio cholerae, one class of turnover enzymes, the endopeptidases, are required only for substantial PG incorporation mediated by the Rod system, while the aPBPs maintain structural integrity during endopeptidase insufficiency. Our results suggest that aPBPs are more versatile than the Rod system in their ability to recognize cell wall gaps formed by autolysins other than the major endopeptidases, adding to our understanding of the co-ordination between autolysins and cell wall synthases. A detailed understanding of autolysin biology may promote the development of antibiotics that target these essential turnover processes.",

    "abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the leading cause of human gastroenteritis in the industrialized world and an emerging threat in developing countries. The incidence of campylobacteriosis in South America is greatly underestimated, mostly due to the lack of adequate diagnostic methods. Accordingly, there is limited genomic and epidemiological data from this region. In the present study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the genetic diversity, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance of the largest collection of clinical C. jejuni and C. coli strains from Chile available to date (n=81), collected in 2017-2019 in Santiago, Chile. This culture collection accounts for over a third of the genome sequences available of clinical strains from South America. cgMLST analysis identified high genetic diversity as well as 13 novel STs and alleles in both C. jejuni and C. coli. Pangenome and virulome analyses showed a differential distribution of virulence factors, including both plasmid and chromosomally encoded T6SSs and T4SSs. Resistome analysis predicted widespread resistance to fluoroquinolones, but low rates of erythromycin resistance. This study provides valuable genomic and epidemiological data and highlights the need for further genomic epidemiology studies in Chile and other South American countries to better understand molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of this emerging intestinal pathogen.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCampylobacter is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide and an emerging and neglected pathogen in South America. In this study, we performed an in-depth analysis of the genome sequences of 69 C. jejuni and 12 C. coli clinical strains isolated from Chile, which account for over a third of the sequences from clinical strains available from South America. We identified a high genetic diversity among C. jejuni strains and the unexpected identification of clade 3 C. coli strains, which are infrequently isolated from humans in other regions of the world. Most strains harbored the virulence factors described for Campylobacter. While [~]40% of strains harbored mutation in the gyrA gene described to confer fluoroquinolone resistance, very few strains encoded the determinants linked to macrolide resistance, currently used for the treatment of campylobacteriosis. Our study contributes to our knowledge of this important foodborne pathogen providing valuable data from South America.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication fidelity is essential for maintaining genetic stability. Forks arrested at replication fork barriers can be stabilised by the intra-S phase checkpoint, subsequently being rescued by a converging fork, or resuming when the barrier is removed. However, some arrested forks cannot be stabilised and fork convergence cannot rescue in all situations. Thus, cells have developed homologous recombination-dependent mechanisms to restart persistently inactive forks. To understand HR-restart we use polymerase usage sequencing to visualize in vivo replication dynamics at an S. pombe replication barrier, RTS1, and model replication by Monte Carlo simulation. We show that HR-restarted forks synthesise both strands with Pol \u03b4 for up to 30 kb without maturing to a \u03b4/\u03b5 configuration and that Pol \u03b1 is not used significantly on either strand, suggesting the lagging strand template remains as a gap that is filled in by Pol \u03b4 later. We further demonstrate that HR-restarted forks progress uninterrupted through a fork barrier that arrests canonical forks. Finally, by manipulating lagging strand resection during HR-restart by deleting pku70, we show that the leading strand initiates replication at the same position, signifying the stability of the 3\u2019 single strand in the context of increased resection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Siderophores are small molecules with unmatched capacity to scavenge iron from proteins and the extracellular milieu, where it mostly occurs as insoluble Fe3+. Siderophores chelate Fe3+ for uptake into the cell, where it is reduced to soluble Fe2+. As iron is essential for bacterial survival, siderophores are key molecules in low soluble iron conditions. Bacteria have devised many strategies to synthesize proprietary siderophores to avoid siderophore piracy by competing organisms, e.g., by incorporating different polyamine backbones into siderophores, while maintaining the catechol moieties. We report that Serratia plymuthica V4 produces a variety of siderophores, which we term the siderome, and which are assembled by the concerted action of enzymes encoded in two independent gene clusters. Besides assembling serratiochelin with diaminopropane, S. plymuthica utilizes putrescine and the same set of enzymes to assemble photobactin, a siderophore described for Photorhabdus luminescens. The enzymes encoded by one of the gene clusters can independently assemble enterobactin. A third, independent operon is responsible for biosynthesis of the hydroxamate siderophore aerobactin, initially described in Enterobacter aerogenes. Mutant strains not synthesizing polyamine-siderophores significantly increased enterobactin production levels, though lack of enterobactin did not impact serratiochelin production. Knocking out SchF0, an enzyme involved in the assembly of enterobactin alone, significantly reduced bacterial fitness. This study illuminates the interplay between siderophore biosynthetic pathways and polyamine production superpathways, indicating routes of molecular diversification. Given its natural yields of diaminopropane (97.75 \u03bcmol/g DW) and putrescine (30.83 \u03bcmol/g DW), S. plymuthica can be exploited for the industrial production of these compounds.Significance Statement Siderophores are molecules crucial for bacterial survival in low iron environments. Bacteria have evolved the capacity to pirate siderophores made by other bacterial strains and to diversify the structure of their own siderophores, to prevent piracy. We found that Serratia plymuthica V4 produces five different siderophores using three gene clusters and a polyamine production superpathway. The most well studied siderophore, enterobactin, rather than the strain\u2019s proprietary and by far most abundant siderophore, serratiochelin, displayed a crucial role in the fitness of S. plymuthica. Our results also indicate that this strain is a good candidate for engineering the large-scale production of diaminopropane (DAP), as without any optimization it produced the highest amounts of DAP reported for wild-type strains.Competing Interest StatementT.K.L. is a co-founder of Senti Biosciences, Synlogic, Engine Biosciences, Tango Therapeutics, Corvium, BiomX, and Eligo Biosciences.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe mammalian molecular clock is based on a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) containing Period1, 2 (Per1, 2), Cryptochrome1, 2 (Cry1, 2), and Brain and Muscle ARNT-Like 1 (Bmal1). TTFL robustness is endowed by genetic complementation between these components; therefore, multiple genes must be knocked out to physiologically investigate the molecular clock, which requires extensive research resources. To facilitate molecular clock disruption, we developed a CRISPR-Cas9-based single adeno-associated viral (AAV) system targeting the circadian clock (CSAC) for Pers, Crys, or Bmal1. First, we designed single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting individual clock genes using an in silico approach and validated their efficiency in Neuro2a cells. To target multiple genes, multiplex sgRNA plasmids were constructed using Golden Gate assembly and expressed in viral vectors. CSAC efficiency was demonstrated by decreased protein expression in vitro and ablated molecular oscillation ex vivo. We also measured locomotor activity and body temperature in Cas9-expressing mice injected with CSAC at the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Circadian rhythm disruption was observed under free-running conditions, indicating that CSAC can efficiently and robustly disrupt molecular circadian clock. Thus, CSAC is a simple and powerful tool for investigating the physiological role of the molecular clock in vivo.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is the main molecular pathway responsible for de novo DNA methylation in plants. In Arabidopsis, however, mutations in RdDM genes cause no visible developmental defects, which raising the question of the biological significance of RdDM in plant development. Here, we isolated and cloned Five Elements Mountain 1 (FEM1), which encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Mutation in FEM1 substantially decreased genome-wide CHH methylation levels and abolished the accumulation of 24-nt small interfering RNAs. Moreover, male and female reproductive development was disturbed, which led to the sterility of fem1 mutants. In wild-type (WT) plants but not in fem1 mutants, genome-wide CHH DNA methylation levels were greater in panicles, stamens, and pistils than in seedlings. The global increase of methylation in reproductive organs of the WT was attributed to enhancement of RdDM activity including FEM1 activity. More than half of all encoding genes in the rice genome overlapped with hypermethylated regions in the sexual organs of the WT, and many of them appear to be directly regulated by an increase in DNA methylation.Our results demonstrate that a global increase of DNA methylation through enhancement of RdDM activity in reproductive organs ensures sexual reproduction of rice.View Full Text",

This paper describes the results of a three-pronged professional development (PD) program conducted in November 2019 in which Florida teachers from eight counties gained knowledge and experience about the process and content of paleontology at an active field research site in northern Florida. Working alongside scientists, 15 elementary, middle, and high school teachers collected 5-million-year-old fossil vertebrates and made scientifically important discoveries that advance understanding of Floridas prehistoric life. The PD included three components: (1) a pre-trip webinar; (2) a morning tour of our museum exhibits to scaffold teachers understanding of the kinds of fossils they would find; and (3) the actual day-long field experience collecting fossils. A post-PD evaluation revealed gains in knowledge about, and experience with, fossils and paleontology. We also found that overall satisfaction with the PD underscored the importance of each of the three components supporting one-another--resulting in a more informative and rewarding learning experience for the participants. Fossils and the science of paleontology are a gateway for STEM learning and this subject and its extensions are applicable to existing standards in earth and life sciences at many grade levels.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTAll physical connections between sister chromatids must be broken before cells can divide, and eukaryotic cells have evolved multiple ways in which to process branchpoints connecting DNA molecules separated both spatially and temporally. A single DNA link between chromatids has the potential to disrupt cell cycle progression and genome integrity, so it is highly likely that cells require a nuclease that can process remaining unresolved and hemi-resolved DNA junctions and other branched species at the very late stages of mitosis. We argue that ANKLE1 probably serves this function in human cells (LEM-3 in C. elegans). LEM-3 has previously been shown to be located at the cell mid-body, and we show here that human ANKLE1 is a nuclease that cleaves a range of branched DNA species. It thus has the substrate selectivity consistent with an enzyme required to process a variety of unresolved and hemi-resolved branchpoints in DNA. Our results imply that ANKLE1 acts as a catch-all enzyme of last resort that allows faithful chromosome segregation and cell division to occur.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, the co-chaperone GrpE acts as a nucleotide exchange factor and plays an important role in controlling the chaperone cycle of DnaK. The functional form of GrpE is an asymmetric dimer, consisting of a long non-ideal coiled-coil. During heat stress, this region partially unfolds and prevents DnaK nucleotide exchange, ultimately ceasing the chaperone cycle. In this study, we elucidate the role of thermal unfolding of the coiled-coil domain of E. coli GrpE in regulating its co-chaperonic activity. The presence of a stutter disrupts the regular heptad arrangement typically found in an ideal coiled coil resulting in structural distortion. Introduction of hydrophobic residues at the stutter altered the structural stability of the coiled-coil. Using an in vitro FRET assay, we show for the first time that the enhanced stability of GrpE resulted in an increased affinity for DnaK. However, the mutants were defective in in vitro functional assays, and were unable to support bacterial growth at heat shock temperature in a grpE-deleted E. coli strain. This work provides valuable insights into the functional role of a stutter in the GrpE coiled-coil, and its role in regulating the DnaK-chaperone cycle for bacterial survival during heat stress. More generally, our findings illustrate how a sequence specific stutter in a coiled-coil domain regulates the structure function trade-off in proteins.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "In humans, apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) plasma levels have been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This association is in part explained by the effects of apoC-III on triglyceride (TG) metabolism; apoC-III raises plasma TG by increasing very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-mediated TG lipolysis, and impairing the removal of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) remnants from the circulation. In this study, we explored the structure-function relationship the interaction of apoC-III with plasma lipoproteins and its ultimate impact on LPL activity. The structural and functional properties of wild-type (WT) apoC-III were compared with two missense variants previously associated with lower (A23T) and higher (Q38K) plasma TG. ApoC-III in the lipid-free state is unstructured but its helix content and stability increases when bound to lipid. Lipid-bound apoC-III contains two alpha helices spanning residues amino acids 11 - 38 (helix 1) and 44 \u2013 64 (helix 2). Investigation of the structural and functional consequences of the A23T and Q38K variants showed that these amino acid substitutions within helix 1 do not significantly alter the stability of the helical structure but affect its hydrophilic-lipophilic properties. The A23T substitution impairs lipoprotein binding capacity, reduces LPL inhibition, and ultimately leads to lower plasma TG levels. Conversely, the Q to K substitution at position 38 enhances the lipid affinity of helix 1, increases TRL binding capacity and LPL inhibition, and is associated with hypertriglyceridemia. This study indicates that structural modifications that perturb the hydrophilic/lipophilic properties of the alpha helices can modulate the hypertriglyceridemic effects of apoC-III.Competing Interest StatementDJR is a a co-founder of Staten Biotechnology, he is a member of the Scientific Advisory Boards of Alnylam, Novartis, and Pfizer, and he was previously a consultant for Akcea.

    "abstract": "Contemporary theories of cardiac fibrillation typically rely on the emergence of rotors to explain the transition from regular sinus rhythm to disordered electrophysiological activity. How those rotors spontaneously arise in the absence of re-entrant anatomical circuits is not fully understood. Here we propose a novel mechanism where arrhythmias are initiated by cardiac cells that fail to repolarize following a normal heartbeat. Those cells subsequently act as a focal ectopic source that drive the ensuing fibrillation. We used a simple computational model to investigate the impact of such cells in both homogeneous and heterogeneous excitable media. We found that heterogeneous media can tolerate a surprisingly large number of abnormal cells and still support normal rhythmic activity. At a critical limit the medium becomes chronically arrhythmogenic. Numerical analysis revealed that the critical threshold for arrhythmogenesis depends on both the strength of the coupling between cells and the extent to which the abnormal cells resist repolarization. Arrhythmogenesis was also found to emerge first at tissue boundaries where cells naturally have fewer neighbors to influence their behavior. These findings may explain why atrial fibrillation typically originates from the cuff of the pulmonary vein.Author summary Cardiac fibrillation is a medical condition where normal heart function is compromised as electrical activity becomes disordered. How fibrillation arises spontaneously is not fully understood. It is generally thought to be triggered by premature depolarization of the cardiac action potential in one or more cells. Those premature beats, known as early-afterdepolarizations, subsequently initiate a self-sustaining rotor in the otherwise normal heart tissue. In this study, we propose an alternative mechanism whereby arrhythmias are initiated by cardiac cells that fail to repolarize of their own accord but still operate normally when embedded in functional heart tissue. We find that such cells can act as focal ectopic sources under appropriate conditions of inter-cellular coupling. Moreover, cells on natural tissue boundaries are more susceptible to arrhythmia because they are coupled to fewer cells. This may explain why the pulmonary vein is often implicated as a source of atrial fibrillation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYSignaling networks balance the activities of many physically interacting proteins and perturbations to this network influence downstream signaling, potentially leading to oncogenic states. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry we defined this network for all 90 human tyrosine kinases revealing 1,463 mostly novel interactions between these key cancer proteins and diverse molecular complexes. Modulation of interactor levels altered growth phenotypes associated with corresponding tyrosine kinase partners suggesting that tumors may alter the stoichiometries of interactors to maximize oncogenic signaling. We show that the levels of EGFR interactors delineates this form of network oncogenesis in 19% of EGFR wild-type lung cancer patients which were mostly otherwise oncogene negative, predicting sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. EGFR network oncogenesis occurs through mechanistically distinct network alleles often in cooperation with weak oncogenes in the MAPK pathway. Network oncogenesis may be a common and targetable convergent mechanism of oncogenic pathway activation in cancer.HIGHLIGHTSA human tyrosine kinome protein interaction map reveals novel physical and functional associations.Dependence on oncogenic tyrosine kinases is modulated through perturbation of their interactors.EGFR network oncogenesis in up to 19% of EGFR wild-type lung cancers is targetable.EGFR network oncogenesis cooperates with weak oncogenes in the MAPK pathway.Competing Interest StatementS.L.W. is an employee of Pfizer.

    "abstract": "In previous work, we focused on the optimal therapeutic strategy with a pair of drugs which are collaterally sensitive to each other, that is, a situation in which evolution of resistance to one drug induces sensitivity to the other, and vice versa. [1] Here, we have extended this exploration to the optimal strategy with a collaterally sensitive drug sequence of an arbitrary length, N([&ge;] 2). To explore this, we have developed a dynamical model of sequential drug therapies with N drugs. In this model, tumor cells are classified as one of N subpopulations represented as {Ri|i = 1,2,..., N}. Each subpopulation, Ri, is resistant to  Drug i and each subpopulation, Ri-1 (or RN, if i = 1), is sensitive to it, so that Ri increases under  Drug i as it is resistant to it, and after drug-switching, decreases under  Drug i + 1 as it is sensitive to that drug(s).\n\nSimilar to our previous work examining optimal therapy with two drugs, we found that there is an initial period of time in which the tumor is  shaped into a specific makeup of each subpopulation, at which time all the drugs are equally effective [Formula]. After this shaping period, all the drugs are quickly switched with duration relative to their efficacy in order to maintain each subpopulation, consistent with the ideas underlying adaptive therapy. [2, 3]\n\nAdditionally, we have developed methodologies to administer the optimal regimen under clinical or experimental situations in which no drug parameters and limited information of trackable populations data (all the subpopulations or only total population) are known. The therapy simulation based on these methodologies showed consistency with the theoretical effect of optimal therapy.",

    "abstract": "Ocean acidification is one the biggest threats to marine ecosystems worldwide, but its ecosystem wide responses are still poorly understood. This study integrates field and experimental data into a mass balance food web model of a temperate coastal ecosystem to determine the impacts of specific OA forcing mechanisms as well as how they interact with one another. Specifically, we forced a food web model of a kelp forest ecosystem near its southern distribution limit in the California large marine ecosystem to a 0.5 pH drop over the course of 50 years. This study utilizes a modeling approach to determine the impacts of specific OA forcing mechanisms as well as how they interact. Isolating OA impacts on growth (Production), mortality (Other Mortality), and predation interactions (Vulnerability) or combining all three mechanisms together leads to a variety of ecosystem responses, with some taxa increasing in abundance and other decreasing. Results suggest that carbonate mineralizing groups such as coralline algae, abalone, snails, and lobsters display the largest decreases in biomass while macroalgae, urchins, and some larger fish species display the largest increases. Low trophic level groups such as giant kelp and brown algae increase in biomass by 16% and 71%, respectively. Due to the diverse way in which OA stress manifests at both individual and population levels, ecosystem-level effects can vary and display nonlinear patterns. Combined OA forcing leads to initial increases in ecosystem and commercial biomasses followed by a decrease in commercial biomass below initial values over time, while ecosystem biomass remains high. Both biodiversity and average trophic level decrease over time. These projections indicate that the kelp forest community would maintain high productivity with a 0.5 drop in pH, but with a substantially different community structure characterized by lower biodiversity and relatively greater dominance by lower trophic level organisms.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTCRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as a powerful technology for tissue-specific mutagenesis. However, tissue-specific CRISPR/Cas9 tools currently available in Drosophila remain deficient in three significant ways. First, many existing gRNAs are inefficient, such that further improvements of gRNA expression constructs are needed for more efficient and predictable mutagenesis in both somatic and germline tissues. Second, it has been difficult to label mutant cells in target tissues with current methods. Lastly, application of tissue-specific mutagenesis at present often relies on Gal4-driven Cas9, which hampers the flexibility and effectiveness of the system. Here we tackle these deficiencies by building upon our previous CRISPR-mediated tissue restricted mutagenesis (CRISPR-TRiM) tools. First, we significantly improved gRNA efficiency in somatic tissues by optimizing multiplexed gRNA design. Similarly, we also designed efficient dual-gRNA vectors for the germline. Second, we developed methods to positively and negatively label mutant cells in tissue-specific mutagenesis by incorporating co-CRISPR reporters into gRNA expression vectors. Lastly, we generated genetic reagents for convenient conversion of existing Gal4 drivers into tissue-specific Cas9 lines based on homology-assisted CRISPR knock-in (HACK). In this way, we expand the choices of Cas9 for CRISPR-TRiM analysis to broader tissues and developmental stages. Overall, our upgraded CRISPR/Cas9 tools make tissue-specific mutagenesis more versatile, reliable, and effective in Drosophila. These improvements may be also applied to other model systems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Type 2 immunity plays an essential role in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis and its disruption during obesity promotes meta-inflammation and insulin resistance. Infection with the helminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni and treatment with its soluble egg antigens (SEA) can induce a type 2 immune response in metabolic organs and improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in obese mice, yet a causal relationship remains unproven. Here, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of the T2 ribonuclease omega-1 (\u03c91), one of the major S. mansoni immunomodulatory glycoproteins, on metabolic homeostasis. Male C57Bl6/J mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks followed by bi-weekly injection of SEA, \u03c91 or vehicle for 4 additional weeks. Whole-body metabolic homeostasis and energy expenditure were assessed by glucose/insulin tolerance tests and indirect calorimetry, respectively. Tissue-specific immune cell phenotypes were determined by flow cytometry. We show that treatment of obese mice with plant-produced recombinant \u03c91, harboring similar glycan motifs as present on the native molecule, decreased body fat mass and improved systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in a time-and dose-dependent manner. This effect was associated with an increase in white adipose tissue (WAT) type 2 T helper cells, eosinophils and alternatively-activated macrophages, without affecting type 2 innate lymphoid cells. In contrast to SEA, the metabolic effects of \u03c91 were still observed in obese STAT6-deficient mice with impaired type 2 immunity, indicating that its metabolic effects are independent of the type 2 immune response. Instead, we found that \u03c91 inhibited food intake, without affecting locomotor activity, WAT thermogenic capacity or whole-body energy expenditure, an effect also occurring in leptin receptor-deficient obese and hyperphagic db/db mice. Altogether, we demonstrate that while the helminth glycoprotein \u03c91 can induce type 2 immunity, it improves whole-body metabolic homeostasis in obese mice by inhibiting food intake via a STAT6-independent mechanism.Author summary The obesity-induced chronic low-grade inflammation, notably in adipose tissue, contributes to insulin resistance and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. We have previously shown that infection with parasitic helminth worms was associated with protection against obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions both in mice and humans. We have also reported that treatment of obese mice with an extract of Schistosoma mansoni eggs (SEA) improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, a beneficial effect that was associated with a helminth-specific type 2 immune response in metabolic organs. Here, we studied the effects of omega-1 (\u03c91), a single immunomodulatory molecule from SEA, on metabolic health in obese mice, and investigated the role of the host immune response elicited. We found that \u03c91 induced a helminth-characteristic type 2 immune response in adipose tissue and improved both insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in obese mice. Yet, in contrast to SEA, \u03c91\u2019s immunomodulatory properties were dispensable for its metabolic effects. Instead, we show that \u03c91 inhibited food intake, a feature accounting for most of the improvements in metabolic health. Together, our findings indicate that helminth molecules may improve metabolic health through multiple distinct mechanisms, and further characterization of such molecules could lead to new therapeutic strategies to combat obesity.List of abbreviationsAAMAlternatively activated macrophageALATAlanine aminotransferaseBATBrown adipose tissueDCDendritic cellEEEnergy expenditureGTTGlucose tolerance testHEKHuman embryonic kidneyHFDHigh-fat dietHOMA-IRHomeostatic model assessment of insulin resistanceIFN-\u03b3Interferon gammaILInterleukinILCInnate lymphoid cellITTInsulin tolerance testLBMLean body massLFDLow-fat dietNAFLDNon-alcoholic fatty liver diseaseNASHNon-alcoholic steatohepatitispLeX-\u03c91Recombinant omega-1 from LeX-glyco-engineered Nicotiana benthamiana plantsPMAPhorbol myristate acetatepWT-\u03c91Recombinant omega-1 from wild-type N. benthamiana plantsSEASchistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigensSTATSignal transducer and activator of transcriptionSVFStromal vascular fractionThT helperTNFTumor necrosis factorUCP1Uncoupling protein 1WATWhite adipose tissueWTWild-typeView Full Text",

    "abstract": "The first-line treatments for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria are artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), consisting of an artemisinin derivative combined with a longer acting partner drug. However, the spread of P. falciparum with decreased susceptibility to artemisinin and partner drugs presents a significant challenge to malaria control efforts. To stem the spread of drug resistant parasites, novel chemotherapeutic strategies are being evaluated, including the implementation of triple artemisinin-based combination therapies (TACTs). Currently, there is limited knowledge on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetic interactions of proposed TACT drug combinations. To evaluate these interactions, we established an in vitro high-throughput process for measuring the drug dose-response to three distinct antimalarial drugs present in a TACT. Sixteen different TACT combinations were screened against fifteen parasite lines from Cambodia, with a focus on parasites with differential susceptibilities to piperaquine and artemisinins. Analysis revealed drug-drug interactions unique to specific genetic backgrounds, including antagonism between piperaquine and pyronaridine associated with gene amplification of plasmepsin II/III, two aspartic proteases that localize to the parasite digestive vacuole. From this initial study, we identified parasite genotypes with decreased susceptibility to specific TACTs, as well as potential TACTs that display antagonism in a genotype-dependent manner. Our assay and analysis platform can be further leveraged to inform drug implementation decisions and evaluate next-generation TACTs.One Sentence Summary In vitro process to evaluate triple-drug combinations for prioritizing antimalarial combinations for in vivo evaluation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, asymmetric mRNA transport localizes \u223c30 specific mRNAs including those encoding polarity and secretion factors, to the bud tip. The underlying process involves RNA binding proteins (RBPs), molecular motors, processing bodies (PBs), and the actin cytoskeleton. Recently, pheromone a-factor expression in mating yeast was discovered to depend upon proper localization of its mRNA, MFA2. MFA2 mRNAs in conjunction with PBs cluster at the shmoo tip to form \u201cmating bodies\u201d, from which a-factor is locally expressed. The mechanism ensuring the correct targeting of mRNA to the shmoo tip is poorly understood.Here we analyzed the kinetics and trajectories of MFA2 mRNA transport in living, alpha-factor treated yeast. Two-(2D) and three-dimensional (3D) analyses allowed us to reconstruct the granule tracks and estimate granule velocities. Tracking analysis of single MFA2 mRNA granules, labeled using a fluorescent aptamer system, demonstrated three types movement: vibrational, oscillatory and translocational. The mRNA granule transport was complex; a granule could change its movement behavior and composition during its journey to the shmoo. Processing body assembly and the actin-based motor, Myo4p, were involved in movement of MFA2 mRNA to the shmoo, but neither was required, indicating that multiple mechanisms for translocation were at play.

Chimeric RTs showed the same optimal temperature and the efficacy of terminal transferase reaction as the original M-MuLV RT. Processivity and the efficiency in cDNA synthesis of the chimeric RT with Sto7d at C-end were increased several-fold. The attachment of Sto7d enhanced the M-MuLV RT tolerance to the most common amplification inhibitors: NaCl, urea, guanidinium chloride, formamide, components of human whole blood, and human blood plasma.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is now increasingly used to inform public health investigations of infectious disease. This approach has transformed our understanding of the global population structure of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid fever. WGS has been particularly informative for understanding the global spread of multi-drug resistant (MDR) typhoid. As WGS capacity becomes more decentralised, there is a growing opportunity for collaboration and sharing of surveillance data within and between countries to inform disease control policies. This requires freely available, community driven tools that reduce the barriers to access genomic data for public health surveillance and that deliver genomic data on a global scale.\n\nMethodsHere we present the Pathogenwatch (https://pathogen.watch/styphi) scheme for S. Typhi, a web application enabling the rapid identification of genomic markers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and contextualization with public genomic data to identify high-risk clones at a population level. Data are delivered in single genome reports or in collections of genomes combined with geographic and other data using trees, maps and tables.\n\nResultsWe show that the clustering of S. Typhi genomes in Pathogenwatch is comparable to established bioinformatics methods, and that genomic predictions of AMR are largely concordant with phenotypic drug susceptibility data. We demonstrate the public health utility of Pathogenwatch with examples selected from over 4,300 public genomes available in the application.\n\nConclusionsPathogenwatch democratises genomic epidemiology of S. Typhi by providing an intuitive entry point for the analysis of WGS and linked epidemiological data, enabling international public health monitoring of the emergence and spread of high risk clones.",

The taxonomic profiles of the 1144 soil samples generated by the two DNBSEQ-G400 modes closely resembled each other and were highly correlated with those generated by the MiSeq platform. Analyses of technical replicates demonstrated a run bias against certain taxa on the MiSeq but not DNBSEQ-G400 platform. Based on lower cost, greater capacity, and less bias, we conclude that DNBSEQ-G400 is an optimal platform for short-term metabarcoding of microbial communities.IMPORTANCE Experimental steps that generate sequencing bias during amplicon sequencing have been intensively evaluated, including the choice of primer pair, polymerase, PCR cycle and technical replication. However, few studies have assessed the accuracy and precision of different sequencing platforms. Here, we compared the performance of newly released DNBSEQ-G400 sequencer with that of the commonly used Illumina MiSeq platform by leveraging amplicon sequencing of a large number of soil samples. Significant sequencing bias among major fungal genera was found in parallel MiSeq runs, which can be easily neglected without the use of sequencing controls. We emphasize the importance of technical controls in large-scale sequencing efforts and provide DNBSEQ-G400 as an alternative with increased sequencing capacity and more stable reproducibility for amplicon sequencing.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Identification of bacterial virulence factors is critical for understanding disease pathogenesis, drug discovery and vaccine development. In this study we used two approaches to predict virulence factors of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the Gram-negative bacterium that causes melioidosis. B. pseudomallei is naturally antibiotic resistant and there are no melioidosis vaccines. To identify B. pseudomallei protein targets for drug discovery and vaccine development, we chose to search for substrates of the B. pseudomallei periplasmic disulfide bond forming protein A (DsbA). DsbA introduces disulfide bonds into extra-cytoplasmic proteins and is essential for virulence in many Gram-negative organism, including B. pseudomallei. The first approach to identify B. pseudomallei DsbA virulence factor substrates was a large-scale genomic analysis of 511 unique B. pseudomallei disease-associated strains. This yielded 4,496 core gene products, of which we hypothesise 263 are DsbA substrates. Manual curation of the 263 mature proteins yielded 73 associated with disease pathogenesis or virulence. These were screened for structural homologues to predict potential B-cell epitopes. In the second approach, we searched the B. pseudomallei genome for homologues of the more than 90 known DsbA substrates in other bacteria. Using this approach, we identified 15 potential B. pseudomallei DsbA virulence factor substrates. Two putative B. pseudomallei virulence factors were identified by both methods: homologues of PenI family \u03b2-lactamase and of succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit. These two proteins could serve as high priority targets for future B. pseudomallei virulence factor characterization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTAcid mine drainage (AMD) is a global problem in which iron sulfide minerals oxidize and generate acidic, metal-rich water. Bioremediation relies on understanding how microbial communities inhabiting an AMD site contribute to biogeochemical cycling. A number of studies have reported community composition in AMD sites from16S rRNA gene amplicons but it remains difficult to link taxa to function, especially in the absence of closely related cultured species or those with published genomes. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of genomes and cultured taxa from AMD environments. Here, we report 29 novel metagenome assembled genomes from Cabin Branch, an AMD site in the Daniel Boone National Forest, KY, USA. The genomes span 11 bacterial phyla and include one Archaea and include taxa that contribute to carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and iron cycling. These data reveal overlooked taxa that contribute to carbon fixation in AMD sites as well as uncharacterized Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria. These data provide additional context for 16S rRNA gene studies, add to our understanding of the taxa involved in biogeochemical cycling in AMD environments, and can inform bioremediation strategies.IMPORTANCE Bioremediating acid mine drainage requires understanding how microbial communities influence geochemical cycling of iron and sulfur and biologically important elements like carbon and nitrogen. Research in this area has provided an abundance of 16S rRNA gene amplicon data. However, linking these data to metabolisms is difficult because many AMD taxa are uncultured or lack published genomes. Here, we present metagenome assembled genomes from 29 novel AMD taxa and detail their metabolic potential. These data provide information on AMD taxa that could be important for bioremediation strategies including taxa that are involved in cycling iron, sulfur, carbon, and nitrogen.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Despite the important role of fungi for ecosystems, relatively little is known about the factors underlying the dynamics of their diversity. Moreover, studies do not typically consider their dark diversity: the species absent from an otherwise suitable site. Here, we examined potential drivers of local fungal dark diversity in temperate woodland and open habitats using LiDAR and in-situ field measurements, combined with a systematically collected and geographically comprehensive macro-fungi and plant data set. For the first time, we also estimated species pools of fungi by considering both plant and fungi co-occurrences. The most important LiDAR variables for modelling fungal dark diversity were amplitude and echo ratio, which are both thought to represent vegetation structure. These results suggest that the local fungal dark diversity is highest in production forests like plantations and lowest in more open forests and in open habitats with little woody vegetation. Plant species richness was the strongest explanatory factor overall and negatively correlated with local fungal dark diversity. Soil fertility showed a positive relationship with dark diversity in open habitats. These findings may indicate that the local dark diversity of macro-fungi is highest in areas with a relatively high human impact (typically areas with low plant species richness and high soil fertility). Overall, this study brings novel insights into local macro-fungi dark diversity patterns, suggesting that a multitude of drivers related to both soil and vegetation act in concert to determine fungal dark diversity.",

    "abstract": "The peroxisomal biogenesis factor Pex14p is an essential component of the peroxisomal matrix protein import machinery. Together with Pex13p and Pex17p, it is part of the membrane-associated peroxisomal docking complex in yeast, facilitating the binding of cargo-loaded receptor proteins for translocation of cargo proteins into the peroxisome. Furthermore, Pex14p is part of peroxisomal import pores. The central role of Pex14p in peroxisomal matrix protein import processes renders it an obvious target for regulatory mechanisms such as protein phosphorylation. To explore this possibility, we examined the state of Pex14p phosphorylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Phos-tag-SDS-PAGE of Pex14p affinity-purified from solubilized membranes revealed Pex14p as multi-phosphorylated protein. Using mass spectrometry, we identified 16 phosphorylation sites, with phosphorylation hot spots located in the N- and C-terminal regions of Pex14p. Analysis of phosphomimicking and nonphosphorylatable variants of Pex14p revealed a decreased import of GFP carrying a peroxisomal targeting signal type 1, indicating a functional relevance of Pex14p phosphorylation in peroxisomal matrix protein import. We show that this effect can be ascribed to the phosphomimicking mutation at serine 266 of Pex14p (Pex14p-S266D). We further screened the subcellular distribution of 23 native GFP-tagged peroxisomal matrix proteins by high-content fluorescence microscopy. Only Cit2p, the peroxisomal isoform of citrate synthase, was affected in the Pex14p-S266D mutant, showing increased cytosolic localization. Cit2p is part of the glyoxylate cycle, which is required for the production of essential carbohydrates when yeast is grown on non-fermentable carbon sources. Pex14p-S266 phosphosite mutants showed reversed growth phenotypes on oleic acid and ethanol with acetyl-CoA formed in peroxisomes and the cytosol, respectively. Our data point to the control of the peroxisomal import of Cit2p via the state of Pex14p phosphorylation at S266, which may help S. cerevisiae cells to rapidly adjust their carbohydrate metabolism according to the nutritional conditions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsPTSperoxisomal targeting signal;LC-MSliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;TEVtobacco etch virus;TPATEV protease cleavage site-Protein AView Full Text",

    "abstract": "We create and share a new red fluorophore, along with a set of strains, reagents and protocols, to make it faster and easier to label endogenous C. elegans proteins with fluorescent tags. CRISPR-mediated fluorescent labeling of C. elegans proteins is an invaluable tool, but it is much more difficult to insert fluorophore-size DNA segments than it is to make small gene edits. In principle, high-affinity asymmetrically split fluorescent proteins solve this problem in C. elegans: the small fragment can quickly and easily be fused to almost any protein of interest, and can be detected wherever the large fragment is expressed and complemented. However, there is currently only one available strain stably expressing the large fragment of a split fluorescent protein, restricting this solution to a single tissue (the germline) in the highly autofluorescent green channel. No available C. elegans lines express unbound large fragments of split red fluorescent proteins, and even state-of-the-art split red fluorescent proteins are dim compared to the canonical split-sfGFP protein. In this study, we engineer a bright, high-affinity new split red fluorophore, split-wrmScarlet. We generate transgenic C. elegans lines to allow easy single-color labeling in muscle or germline cells and dual-color labeling in somatic cells. We also describe  glonads, a novel expression strategy for the germline, where traditional expression strategies struggle. We validate these strains by targeting split-wrmScarlet to several genes whose products label distinct organelles, and we provide a protocol for easy, cloning-free CRISPR/Cas9 editing. As the collection of split-FP strains for labeling in different tissues or organelles expands, we will post updates at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3993663",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) test the association between traits and genetically predicted gene expression levels. The power of a TWAS depends in part on the strength of the correlation between a genetic predictor of gene expression and the causally relevant gene expression values. Consequently, TWAS power can be low when expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data used to train the genetic predictors have small sample sizes, or when data from causally relevant tissues are not available. Here, we propose to address these issues by integrating multiple tissues in the TWAS using sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA). We show that sCCA-TWAS combined with single-tissue TWAS using an aggregate Cauchy association test (ACAT) outperforms traditional single-tissue TWAS. In empirically motivated simulations, the sCCA+ACAT approach yielded the highest power to detect a gene associated with phenotype, even when expression in the causal tissue was not directly measured, while controlling the Type I error when there is no association between gene expression and phenotype. For example, when gene expression explains 2% of the variability in outcome, and the GWAS sample size is 20,000, the average power difference between the ACAT combined test of sCCA features and single-tissue, versus single-tissue combined with Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) method, single-tissue combined with S-MultiXcan or summarizing cross-tissue expression patterns using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approaches was 5%, 8%, and 38%, respectively. The gain in power is likely due to sCCA cross-tissue features being more likely to be detectably heritable. When applied to publicly available summary statistics from 10 complex traits, the sCCA+ACAT test was able to increase the number of testable genes and identify on average an additional 400 additional gene-trait associations that single-trait TWAS missed. Our results suggest that aggregating eQTL data across multiple tissues using sCCA can improve the sensitivity of TWAS while controlling for the false positive rate.Author summary Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) can improve the statistical power of genetic association studies by leveraging the relationship between genetically predicted transcript expression levels and an outcome. We propose a new TWAS pipeline that integrates data on the genetic regulation of expression levels across multiple tissues. We generate cross-tissue expression features using sparse canonical correlation analysis and then combine evidence for expression-outcome association across cross- and single-tissue features using the aggregate Cauchy association test. We show that this approach has substantially higher power than traditional single-tissue TWAS methods. Application of these methods to publicly available summary statistics for ten complex traits also identifies associations missed by single-tissue methods.View Full Text",

The biofilm forming ability of K. pneumoniae further complicates patient management. There is still a knowledge gap on the association of biofilm formation with patient outcome and carbapenem susceptibility, which is investigated in the present study.K. pneumoniae isolates from patients admitted in critical care units with catheters and ventilators were included. K. pneumoniae (n = 72) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility as recommended by CLSI 2019 and subjected to 96-well microtitre plate biofilm formation assay. Based on optical density at 570 nm isolates were graded as strong, moderate and weak biofilm formers. Subset of strong biofilm formers were subjected to whole genome sequencing and a core genome phylogenetic analysis in comparison with global isolates were performed. Biofilm formation was compared for an association with the carbapenem susceptibility and with patient outcome. Statistical significance, correlations and graphical representation were performed using SPSS v23.0.Phenotypic analyses showed a positive correlation between biofilm formation and carbapenem resistance. Planktonic cells observed to be susceptible in vitro exhibited higher MICs in biofilm structure. The biofilm forming ability had a significant association with the morbidity/mortality. Infections by stronger biofilm forming pathogens significantly (P&lt;0.05) resulted in fewer \u2018average days alive\u2019 for the patient (3.33) in comparison to those negative for biofilms (11.33). Phylogenetic analysis including global isolates revealed the clear association of sequence types with genes for biofilm mechanism and carbapenem resistance. Carbapenemase genes were found specific to each clade. The known hypervirulent clone-ST23 with wcaG, magA, rmpA, rmpA2 and wzc with a lack of mutation for hyper-capsulation might be poor biofilm formers. Interestingly, ST15, ST16, ST307 and ST258 \u2013 reported global high-risk clones were wcaJ negative indicating the high potential of biofilm forming capacity. Genes wabG and treC for CPS, bcsA and pgaC for adhesins, luxS for quorum sensing were common in all clades in addition to genes for aerobactin (iutA), allantoin (allS), type I and III fimbriae (fimA, fimH, mrkD) and pili (pilQ, ecpA).This study is the first of its kind to compare genetic features of antimicrobial resistance with a spectrum covering most of the genetic factors for K. pneumoniae biofilm. These results highlight the importance of biofilm screening to effectively manage nosocomial infections by K. pneumoniae.

The therapeutic use of bacteriophages, that infect and kill bacteria, is well suited to be a good strategy to combat antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, bacteriophages are increasingly used in combination with standard antibiotics against the drug-resistant pathogens. Interestingly, we found that the engineered mycobacteriophage phAE159 and natural phage D29 can not infect the Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the presence of kanamycin, hygromycin or streptomycin, but there is no effect on the phage infection in the presence of spectinomycin. Based on a series of studies and structural analysis of the above four aminoglycoside antibiotics, we can speculate as to the mechanism by which amino sugar group of aminoglycoside was able to selectively inhibit mycobacteriophage DNA replication.

    "abstract": "In barley, the transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase is complex and under the control of photoperiodic and temperature conditions. One major gene involved is PPD-H1, a PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (PRR7) that encodes a component of the circadian clock. Mutation at PPD-H1 resulted in the photoperiod non-responsive ppd-H1 alleles that are beneficial under high latitudinal environments as they allow vegetative growth during the long-day summer conditions whereby higher yields are harvested by farmers. Utilizing a diverse GWAS panel of world-wide origin and a genome-wide gene-based set of 50K SNP markers, a strong association of days to heading with the PPD-H1 gene was detected in multi-location field trials. Re-sequencing of the gene spanning putative causative SNPs, SNP22 (Turner et al. 2005) and SNP48 (Jones et al. 2008), detected recombination between the two, previously reported to be in complete LD. Phenotyping of the recombinants and phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes supported the original conclusion of Turner et al. (2005) that SNP22, present in the CCT domain, is the most likely causative SNP. To infer the origin of non-responsiveness, the PPD-H1 gene was re-sequenced in a geo-referenced collection of 2057 wild and domesticated barleys and compared with the allelic status of the 6000-year-old barley sample from the Yoram cave in the Masada cliff. A monophyletic and post-domestication origin in the Fertile Crescent was found in contrast to the pre-domestication origin proposed by Jones et al. (2008). We show that the photoperiod non-responsiveness originated from Desert type wild barley in the Southern Levant.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Environments such as light condition influence the spread of infectious diseases by affecting insect vector behavior. However, whether and how light affects the host defense which further affect insect preference and performance, remains unclear, nor has been demonstrated how pathogens co-adapt light condition to facilitate vector transmission. We previously showed that begomoviral \u03b2C1 inhibits MYC2-mediated jasmonate signaling to establish plant-dependent mutualism with its insect vector. Here we show red-light as an environmental catalyzer to promote mutualism of whitefly-begomovirus by stabilizing \u03b2C1, which interacts with PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) transcription factors. PIFs positively control plant defenses against whitefly by directly binding to the promoter of terpene synthase genes and promoting their transcription. Moreover, PIFs integrates light and jasmonate signaling by interaction with MYC2, and co-regulation the transcription of terpene synthase genes. However, begomovirus encoded \u03b2C1 inhibit PIFs\u2019 and MYC2\u2019 transcriptional activity via disturbing their dimerization, thereby impairing plant defenses against whitefly-transmitted begomoviruses. Our results thus describe how a viral pathogen hijacks host light signaling to enhance the mutualistic relationship with its insect vector.Author summary Climate change is driving disease rapidly spread, esp. for global distribution of insect-borne diseases. This paper reports red-light as an environmental factor to promote insect vector olfactory orientation behavior and increase viral disease transmission. Plant virus adapts the supplemental red lighting practice in modern agricultural greenhouse production under protection, therefore enhancing disease spreading globally.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of breast cancer is a known source of tumor heterogeneity and it has been increasingly recognized as having a role in the course of disease. In the present study, we used a computational approach to dissect the landscape of TIME states among TCGA breast cancer patients. Our central hypothesis is that the pre-existing TIME states represent a dimension which is informative about the prognosis and the response to immunotherapy. In order to test this hypothesis, we first classified breast cancer patients according to their primary TIME status. Next, we describe a TIME-based classification with prognostic value for overall survival among the TCGA patients. We further demonstrated that absolute quantification of mast cells, M0 macrophages, CD8 T cells and neutrophils were predictive of overall survival. In order to identify the TIME states which, predict response to immune checkpoint blockade, we performed a similar analysis of 11 different mouse models of primary invasive breast carcinoma that were subsequently treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. These analyses revealed that the TIME content of M1 macrophages, monocytes and resting dendritic cells were predictive of sensitivity to ICI therapy. Taken together, these results indicate that (1) the landscape of human primary TIME states is diverse and can identify patients with more or less aggressive disease and (2) that pre-existing TIME states may be able to identify patients, of all molecular subtypes of breast cancer, who are good candidates for ICI therapy.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe resurgence of interest in the comparative developmental study of chelicerates has led to important insights, such as the discovery of a genome duplication shared by spiders and scorpions, inferred to have occurred at the most recent common ancestor of Arachnopulmonata (a clade comprised of the five book lung-bearing arachnid orders). Nonetheless, several arachnid groups remain understudied in the context of development and genomics, such as the order Amblypygi (whip spiders). The phylogenetic position of Amblypygi in Arachnopulmonata posits them as an interesting group to test the incidence of the proposed genome duplication in the common ancestor of Arachnopulmonata, as well as the degree of retention of duplicates over 450 Myr. Moreover, whip spiders have their first pair of walking legs elongated and modified into sensory appendages (a convergence with the antenna of mandibulates), but the genetic patterning of these antenniform legs has never been investigated.\n\nResultsWe established genomic resources and protocols for cultivation of embryos and gene expression assays by in situ hybridization to study the development of the whip spider Phrynus marginemaculatus. Using embryonic transcriptomes from three species of Amblypygi, we show that the ancestral whip spider exhibited duplications of all ten Hox genes. We deploy these resources to show that paralogs of the leg gap genes dachshund and homothorax retain arachnopulmonate-specific expression patterns in P. marginemaculatus. We characterize the expression of leg gap genes Distal-less, dachshund-1/2 and homothorax-1/2 in the embryonic antenniform leg and other appendages, and provide evidence that allometry, and by extension the antenniform leg fate, is specified early in embryogenesis.\n\nConclusionThis study is the first step in establishing P. marginemaculatus as a model for modern chelicerate evolutionary developmental study, and provides the first resources sampling whip spiders for comparative genomics. Our results suggest that Amblypygi share a genome duplication with spiders and scorpions, and set up a framework to study the genetic specification of antenniform legs. Future efforts to study whip spider development must emphasize the development of tools for functional experiments in P. marginemaculatus.",

    "abstract": "Archeologically attested human occupation on the Tibet Plateau (TP) can be traced back to 160 thousand years ago (kya, Xiahe) via archaic people and 30~40 kya via anatomically modern human in Nwya Devu. However, the past human movements and peopling of the TP keep in its infancy in the modern/ancient DNA studies. Here, we performed the first modern/ancient genomic meta-analysis among 3,017 Paleolithic to present-day eastern Eurasian genomes (2,444 modern individuals from 183 populations (including 98 \u00dc-Tsang/Ando/Kham Tibetans) and 573 ancients (including 161 Chinese ancients first meta-analyzed here)). Closer genetic connection between ancient-modern highland Tibetans and lowland island/coastal Neolithic northern East Asians was identified, reflecting the main ancestry of high-altitude Tibeto-Burman speakers originated from the ancestors of Houli/Yangshao/Longshan ancients in the middle and lower Yellow River basin, consistent with the common North-China origin of Sino-Tibetan language and dispersal pattern of millet farmers. Although the shared common northern East Asian lineage between Tibetans and lowland East Asians, we still identified genetic differentiation between Highlanders and lowland northern East Asians, the former harboring more deeply diverged Hoabinhian/Onge ancestry and the latter possessing more modern Neolithic southern East Asian and Siberian ancestry, which suggested the co-existence of Paleolithic and Neolithic ancestries in modern and Neolithic East Asian Highlanders. Tibetans from \u00dc-Tsang/Ando/Kham Tibetan regions showed strong population stratifications consistent with their cultural backgrounds and geographic terrains (showed as barriers for human movements): stronger Chokhopani affinity in \u00dc-Tsang Tibetans, more western Eurasian ancestry in Ando and greater Neolithic southern East Asian ancestry in Kham Tibetan. Modern combined ancient genomes documented multiple waves of human migrations in TP past: the first layer of local Hunter-Gatherer mixed with Qijia Farmer arose the Chokhopani-associated Proto-Tibetan-Burman, admixture with the additional genetic materials from the western Eurasian steppe, Yellow River and Yangtze River respectively gave rise to modern Ando, \u00dc-Tsang and Kham Tibetans.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "We tested whether training paradigms targeting slow learning alleviate motor learning deficits of cerebellar patients compared to matched controls using four visuomotor tasks: standard, gradual, overlearning and long intertrial interval. We measured slow learning using spontaneous recovery, the return to learned adaptation after brief wash out of fast adaptation. Spontaneous recovery increased in both groups only in overlearning. A model of adaptation suggested that in controls the increase reflects changes in slow system dynamics. In contrast, because cerebellar participants plateaued more slowly than controls, added trials in models of cerebellar participants increased the level of slow learning. Whereas, under the model, slow learning became more resilient in controls, there was no change in its dynamics for cerebellar participants. Our results and modeling suggest that while residual slow learning does exist in cerebellar patients and can be expressed through increased training trials, the primary cerebellar deficit cannot be improved by overlearning paradigms.",
