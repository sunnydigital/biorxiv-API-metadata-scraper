    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe Allen Institute recently built a set of high-throughput experimental pipelines to collect comprehensive in vivo surveys of physiological activity in the visual cortex of awake, head-fixed mice. Developing these large-scale, industrial-like pipelines posed many scientific, operational, and engineering challenges.\n\nNEW METHODOur strategies for creating a cross-platform reference space to which all pipeline datasets were mapped required development of 1) a robust headframe, 2) a reproducible clamping system, and 3) data-collection systems that are built, and maintained, around precise alignment with a reference artifact.\n\nRESULTSWhen paired with our pipeline clamping system, our headframe exceeded deflection and reproducibility requirements. By leveraging our headframe and clamping system we were able to create a cross-platform reference space to which multi-modal imaging datasets could be mapped.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODSTogether, the Allen Brain Observatory headframe, surgical tooling, clamping system, and system registration strategy create a unique system for collecting large amounts of standardized in vivo datasets over long periods of time. Moreover, the integrated approach to cross-platform registration allows for multi-modal datasets to be collected within a shared reference space.\n\nCONCLUSIONSHere we report the engineering strategies that we implemented when creating the Allen Brain Observatory physiology pipelines. All of the documentation related to headframe, surgical tooling, and clamp design has been made freely available and can be readily manufactured or procured. The engineering strategy, or components of the strategy, described in this report can be tailored and applied by external researchers to improve data standardization and stability.",

    "abstract": "Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on histone tails spatiotemporally dictate mammalian neural stem cell (NSC) fate. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), a member of the transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF-{beta}) superfamily, suppresses NSC proliferation and fosters differentiation into astroglial cells. Whether PTMs mediate these effects of BMP4 is unknown. Here we demonstrate that BMP4 signaling causes a net reduction in cellular histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), an active histone mark at promoters of genes associated with human NSC proliferation. We also show that H3K4me3 reduction by BMP4 is mediated by decreased expression of SETD1A and WDR82, two methyltransferase components of SETD1A-COMPASS. Down-regulation of these components decreases expression of key genes expressed in hNSCs, while ectopic expression via transfection dedifferentiates human astrocytes (HAs). These observations suggest that BMP4 influences NSC fate by regulating PTMs and altering chromatin structure.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBMP4 is critical in determining hNSC fate. Whether histone posttranslational modifications (PTM) mediate the effects of BMP4 is unknown. Here we report that H3K4me3, brought about by its methyltransferases SETD1A and WDR82, at promoters of stem cell genes OCT4 and NESTIN is involved in human neural stem cell (hNSC) maintenance. BMP4 promotes hNSC astroglial differentiation in part through reduction of SETD1A and WDR82 and thus decreased frequency of H3K4me3 at the promoters of these genes. These results provide evidence that BMP4 promotes hNSC differentiation through a potential epigenetic mechanism and extend our understanding of the role of histone PTM in central nervous system development.",

    "abstract": "The human motor system can rapidly adapt its motor output in response to errors. The prevailing theory of this process posits that the motor system adapts an internal forward model that predicts the consequences of outgoing motor commands, and that this forward model is then used to guide selection of motor output. However, although there is clear evidence for the existence of adaptive forward models to help track the state of the body, there is no real evidence that such models influence the selection of motor output. A possible alternative to the forward-model-based theory of adaptation is that motor output could be directly adjusted by movement errors (\"direct policy learning\"), in parallel with but independent of any updates to a predictive forward model. Here, we show evidence for this latter theory based on the properties of implicit adaptation under mirror-reversed visual feedback. We show that implicit adaptation still occurs under this extreme perturbation but acts in an inappropriate direction, following a pattern consistent with direct policy learning but not forward-model-based learning. We suggest that the forward-model-based theory of adaptation needs to be re-examined and that direct policy learning is a more plausible mechanism of implicit adaptation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBiological methylation requires S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and participates in a range of processes from modulation of gene expression via histone modifications to neurotransmitter synthesis. An important factor in all methylation reactions is the concentration ratio of SAM to methylation byproduct S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH hydrolase, also known as adenosylhomocysteinase, depletes SAH and thereby facilitates metabolite recycling and maintains the methylation permissive SAM/SAH ratio. While the importance of SAH hydrolase in sustaining methylation is obvious on the cellular level, the function of this metabolic process on the organismal scale is not clear.\n\nResultsWe used planarian Dugesia japonica to investigate the role SAH hydrolase in physiological homeostasis on the body-wide scale. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of the SAH hydrolase results in regression of anterior tissues and is accompanied by extensive apoptosis throughout the planarian body. Moreover, exposure to the SAHH inhibitor AdOx leads to changes in brain morphology and spatial shift in the expression of Wnt-modulator Notum. Strikingly, planarians are able to overcome these destructive patterning defects through regeneration of the anterior tissues and adaptation to the used inhibitor. Transcriptome analysis indicates that resistance to the SAHH inhibitor is at least partly mediated by changes in folate cycle and lipid metabolism.\n\nConclusionsSAH hydrolase plays a critical role in planarian homeostasis and anterior patterning potentially through modulation of Wnt signaling. Moreover, planarian adaptation to the SAHH inhibitor via metabolic reprogramming suggests potential targets for addressing methylation-related human conditions.",

    "abstract": "A key limitation of the commonly-used CRISPR enzyme S. pyogenes Cas9 is the strict requirement of an NGG protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) at the target site, which reduces the number of accessible genomic loci. This constraint can be limiting for genome editing applications that require precise Cas9 positioning. Recently, two Cas9 variants with a relaxed PAM requirement (NG) have been developed (xCas9 and Cas9-NG) but their activity has been measured at only a small number of endogenous sites. Here we devised a high-throughput Cas9 pooled competition screen to compare the performance of both PAM-flexible Cas9 variants and wild-type Cas9 at thousands of genomic loci and across 3 modalities (gene knock-out, transcriptional activation and suppression). We show that PAM flexibility comes at a substantial cost of decreased DNA targeting and cutting. Of the PAM-flexible variants, we found that Cas9-NG outperforms xCas9 regardless of genome engineering modality or PAM. Finally, we combined xCas9 mutations with those of Cas9-NG, creating a stronger transcriptional modulator than existing PAM-flexible Cas9 variants.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution X-ray microcomputed tomography, or microCT (CT), enables the digital imaging of whole objects in three dimensions. The power of CT to visualise internal features without disarticulation makes it particularly valuable for the study of museum collections, which house millions of physical specimens documenting the spatio-temporal patterns of life. Despite its potential for comparative analyses, most CT studies include limited numbers of museum specimens, due to the challenges of digitising numerous individuals within a project scope. Here we describe a method for high-throughput CT scanning of hundreds of small (< 2 cm) specimens in a single container, followed by individual labelling and archival storage. We also explore the effects of various packing materials and multiple specimens per capsule to minimize sample movement that can degrade image quality, and hence CT investment. We demonstrate this protocol on vertebrate fossils from Queensland Museum, Australia, as part of an effort to track community responses to climate change over evolutionary time. This system can be easily modified for other types of wet and dry material amenable to X-ray attenuation, including geological, botanical and zoological samples, providing greater access to large-scale phenotypic data and adding value to global collections.",

    "abstract": "RationaleSevere asthma and COPD share common pathophysiologic traits such as relative corticosteroid insensitivity. We recently published three transcriptome-associated clusters (TACs) using hierarchical analysis of the sputum transcriptome in asthmatics from the U-BIOPRED cohort with one Type 2-high signature (TAC1) and 2 Type 2-low signatures.\n\nObjectiveWe examined whether gene-expression signatures obtained in asthma can be used to identify the subgroup of COPD patients with steroid sensitivity.\n\nMethodsUsing gene set variation analysis (GSVA), we examined the distribution and enrichment scores (ES) of the 3 TACs in the transcriptome of bronchial biopsies from 46 patients who participated in the GLUCOLD COPD study that received 30 months of treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with and without an added long-acting {beta}-agonist (LABA). The identified signatures were then associated with longitudinal clinical variables after treatment.\n\nMeasurements and main resultsBronchial biopsies in COPD patients at baseline showed a wide range of expression of the 3 TACs. After ICS{+/-}LABA treatment, the ES of TAC1 was significantly reduced at 30 months, but those of TAC2 and TAC3 were unaffected. A corticosteroid-sensitive TAC1 (sub)signature was developed from the TAC1 ICS-responsive genes. This signature consisted of mast cell-specific genes identified by single-cell RNA-seq and positively correlated with bronchial biopsy mast cell numbers following ICS{+/-}LABA. Baseline levels of gene transcription predicted change in FEV1 %predicted following 30-month ICS{+/-}LABA.\n\nConclusionsSputum-derived transcriptomic signatures from an asthma cohort can be recapitulated in bronchial biopsies of COPD patients and identified airway wall mast cells as a predictor of those COPD patients who will benefit from inhaled corticosteroids.",

Given the technical considerations that make MS-based cell surface proteome studies uniquely challenging, it can be difficult to select an appropriate experimental approach. To this end, we have integrated multiple prediction strategies and annotations into a single online resource, Compiled Interactive Resource for Extracellular and Surface Studies (CIRFESS).

We applied CIRFESS to identify the percentage of various subsets of the proteome which are expected to be captured by targeted enrichment strategies, including two established methods and one that is possible but not yet demonstrated. These results will inform the selection of available proteomic strategies and development of new strategies to enhance coverage of the cell surface and extracellular proteome.

To study adaptation to this new niche, we evolved one set of Cit+ populations for 2,500 generations in DM0 and a control set in DM25. We identified numerous parallel mutations, many mediated by transposable elements. Several lineages evolved multi-copy amplifications containing the maeA gene, constituting up to [~]15% of the genome. We also found substantial cell death in ancestral and evolved clones. Our results demonstrate the importance of copy-number variation and transposable elements in the refinement of the Cit+ trait.

Individual maize chromosomes show distinct FISH signal patterns, which allow universal identification of all chromosomes from different Zea species. We developed karyotypes from three Zea mays subspecies and two additional wild Zea species based on individually identified chromosomes. A paracentric inversion was discovered on the long arm of chromosome 4 in Z. nicaraguensis and Z. luxurians based on modifications of the FISH signal patterns.

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is one of the leading causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Gut microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and commensal Clostridia that encode the bile acid inducible (bai) operon are associated with protection from C. difficile infection (CDI), although the mechanism is not known. In this study we hypothesized that commensal Clostridia are important for providing colonization resistance against C. difficile due to their ability to produce secondary bile acids, as well as potentially competing against C. difficile for similar nutrients. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of four commensal Clostridia encoding the bai operon (C. scindens VPI 12708, C. scindens ATCC 35704, C. hiranonis, and C. hylemonae) to convert CA to DCA in vitro, and if the amount of DCA produced was sufficient to inhibit growth of a clinically relevant C. difficile strain. We also investigated the competitive relationship between these commensals and C. difficile using an in vitro co-culture system. We found that inhibition of C. difficile growth by commensal Clostridia supplemented with CA was strain-dependent, correlated with the production of [~]2 mM DCA, and increased expression of bai operon genes. We also found that C. difficile was able to outcompete all four commensal Clostridia in an in vitro co-culture system. These studies are instrumental in understanding the relationship between commensal Clostridia and C. difficile in the gut, which is vital for designing targeted bacterial therapeutics. Future studies dissecting the regulation of the bai operon in vitro and in vivo and how this affects CDI will be important.\n\nImportanceCommensal Clostridia encoding the bai operon such as C. scindens have been associated with protection against CDI, however the mechanism for this protection is unknown. Herein, we show four commensal Clostridia that encode the bai operon effect C. difficile growth in a strain-dependent manner, with and without the addition of cholate. Inhibition of C. difficile by commensals correlated with the efficient conversion of cholate to deoxycholate, a secondary bile acid that inhibits C. difficile germination, growth, and toxin production. Competition studies also revealed that C. difficile was able to outcompete the commensals in an in vitro co-culture system.

Therefore, the use of personalized peptide vaccination cocktails in oil emulsions are tested in the treatment of cancer patients. An equal peptide distribution in the emulsion is striking for a successful depot effect to ensure the optimal efficacy and additionally, to enable reliable drug release analytics.

    "abstract": "Control of the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis relies almost entirely on praziquantel (PZQ) monotherapy. How PZQ clears parasite infections remains poorly understood. Many studies have examined the effects of PZQ on worms cultured in vitro, observing outcomes such as muscle contraction. However, conditions worms are exposed to in vivo may vary considerably from in vitro experiments given the short half-life of PZQ and the importance of host immune system engagement for drug efficacy in animal models. Here, we investigated the effects of in vivo PZQ exposure on Schistosoma mansoni. Measurement of pro-apoptotic caspase activation revealed that worm death occurs only after parasites shift from the mesenteric vasculature to the liver, peaking 24 hours after drug treatment. This indicates that PZQ is not directly schistocidal, since the drugs half-life is [~]2 hours, and focuses attention on parasite interactions with the host immune system following the shift of worms to the liver. RNA-Seq of worms harvested from mouse livers following sub-lethal PZQ treatment revealed drug-evoked changes in the expression of putative immunomodulatory and anticoagulant gene products. Several of these gene products localized to the schistosome esophagus and may be secreted into the host circulation. These include several Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, which are also found in the secretomes of other blood feeding animals. These transcriptional changes may reflect mechanisms of parasite immune-evasion in response to chemotherapy, given the role of complement-mediated attack and the host innate / humoral immune response in parasite elimination. One of these isoforms, SmKI-1, has been shown to exhibit immunomodulatory and anti-coagulant properties. These data provide insight into the effect of in vivo PZQ exposure on S. mansoni, and the transcriptional response of parasites to the stress of chemotherapy.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe disease schistosomiasis is caused by parasitic worms that live within the circulatory system. While this disease infects over 200 million people worldwide, treatment relies almost entirely on one drug, praziquantel, whose mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the effects of praziquantel treatment on the gene expression of parasites harvested from mice treated with praziquantel chemotherapy. Despite the rapid action of the drug on worms in vitro, we found that key outcomes in vivo (measurement of cell death and changes in gene expression) occurred relatively late (12+ hours after drug administration). We found that worms increased the expression of immunomodulatory gene products in response to praziquantel, including a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor that localized to the worm esophagus and may be secreted to the external host environment. These are an intriguing class of proteins, because they display anti-coagulant and immunomodulatory properties. Up-regulation of these gene products may reflect a parasite mechanism of immune-evasion in response to chemotherapy. This research provides insight into the mechanism of praziquantel by observing the effect of this drug on worms within the context of the host immune system.",

    "abstract": "Protein homeostasis in eukaryotic organelles and their progenitor prokaryotes is regulated by a series of proteases including the caseinolytic protease (CLPP). CLPP has essential roles in chloroplast biogenesis and maintenance, but the significance of the plant mitochondrial CLPP remains unknown and factors that aid coordination of nuclear and mitochondrial encoded subunits for complex assembly in mitochondria await discovery. We generated knock-out lines of the single gene for the mitochondrial CLP protease subunit, CLPP2, in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mutants had higher abundance of transcripts from mitochondrial genes encoding OXPHOS protein complexes, while transcripts for nuclear genes encoding other subunits of the same complexes showed no change in abundance. In contrast, the protein abundance of specific nuclear-encoded subunits in OXPHOS complexes I and V increased in CLPP2 knockouts, without accumulation of mitochondrial-encoded counterparts in the same complex. Protein complexes mainly or entirely encoded in the nucleus were unaffected. Analysis of protein import, assembly and function of Complex I revealed that while function was retained, protein homeostasis was disrupted through decreased assembly, leading to accumulation of soluble subcomplexes of nuclear-encoded subunits. Therefore, CLPP2 contributes to the mitochondrial protein degradation network through supporting coordination and assembly of protein complexes encoded across mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.\n\nOne sentence summaryCLPP contributes to the mitochondrial protein degradation network through supporting coordination and assembly of protein complexes encoded across mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.",

Unfortunately, current real-time biosensors are limited to a handful of analytes (e.g. glucose and blood oxygen) and are limited in sensitivity (high nanomolar). In this work, we describe a general approach for continuously and simultaneously measuring multiple analytes with picomolar sensitivity and sub-second temporal resolution. As exemplars, we report the simultaneous detection of glucose and insulin at picomolar concentrations in live diabetic rats. Using our system, we demonstrate the capacity to resolve inter-individual differences in the pharmacokinetic responses to insulin and discriminate profiles from different insulin formulations at a high temporal resolution. Critically, our approach is general and could be readily modified to continuously and simultaneously measure other circulating analytes in vivo by swapping the affinity reagents, thus making it a versatile tool for biomedical research.",

    "abstract": "A gene regulatory network can be described at a high level by a directed graph with signed edges, and at a more detailed level by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The former qualitatively models the causal regulatory interactions between ordered pairs of genes, while the latter quantitatively models the time-varying concentrations of mRNA and proteins. This paper clarifies the connection between the two types of models.\n\nWe propose a property, called the constant sign property, for a general class of ODE models. The constant sign property characterizes the set of conditions (system parameters, external signals, or internal states) under which an ODE model is consistent with a signed, directed graph. If the constant sign property for an ODE model holds globally for all conditions, then the ODE model has a single signed, directed graph. If the constant sign property for an ODE model only holds locally, which may be more typical, then the ODE model corresponds to different graphs under different sets of conditions. In addition, two versions of constant sign property are given and a relationship between them is proved.\n\nAs an example, the ODE models that capture the effect of cis-regulatory elements involving protein complex binding, based on the model in the GeneNetWeaver source code, are described in detail and shown to satisfy the global constant sign property with a unique consistent gene regulatory graph. Even a single gene regulatory graph is shown to have many ODE models of GeneNetWeaver type consistent with it due to combinatorial complexity and continuous parameters.\n\nFinally the question of how closely data generated by one ODE model can be fit by another ODE model is explored. It is observed that the fit is better if the two models come from the same graph.",

    "abstract": "In vibrios, quorum sensing controls hundreds of genes that are required for cell density-specific behaviors including bioluminescence, biofilm formation, competence, secretion, and swarming motility. The central transcription factor in the quorum-sensing pathway is LuxR/HapR, which directly regulates [~]100 genes in the >400-gene regulon of Vibrio harveyi. Among these directly controlled genes are 15 transcription factors, which we predicted would comprise the second tier in the hierarchy of the quorum-sensing regulon. We confirmed that LuxR binds to the promoters of these genes in vitro and quantified the extent of LuxR activation or repression of transcript levels. RNA-seq indicates that most of these transcriptional regulators control only a few genes, with the exception of MetJ, which is a global regulator. The genes regulated by these transcription factors are predicted to be involved in methionine and thiamine biosynthesis, membrane stability, RNA processing, c-di-GMP degradation, sugar transport, and other cellular processes. These data support a hierarchical model in which LuxR directly regulates 15 transcription factors that drive the second level of the gene expression cascade to influence cell density-dependent metabolic states and behaviors in V. harveyi.\n\nImportanceQuorum sensing is important for survival of bacteria in nature and influences the actions of bacterial groups. In the relatively few studied examples of quorum sensing-controlled genes, these genes are associated with competition or cooperation in complex microbial communities and/or virulence in a host. However, quorum sensing in vibrios controls the expression of hundreds of genes, and their functions are mostly unknown or uncharacterized. In this study, we identify the regulators of the second-tier of gene expression in the quorum-sensing system of the aquatic pathogen Vibrio harveyi. Our identification of regulatory networks and metabolic pathways controlled by quorum sensing can be extended and compared to other Vibrio species to understand the physiology, ecology, and pathogenesis of these organisms.",

    "abstract": "Broad dysregulation of gene expression control is a hallmark of cancer progression. Identifying the underlying master regulators that drive pathological gene expression is a key challenge in precision oncology. Here, we have developed a network analytical framework, named PRADA, that identifies oncogenic RNA-binding proteins through the systematic detection of coordinated changes in their target regulons. Application of this approach to data collected from clinical samples, patient-derived xenografts, and cell line models of colon cancer metastasis revealed the RNA-binding protein RBMS1 as a suppressor of colon cancer progression. We observed that silencing RBMS1 results in increased metastatic capacity in xenograft mouse models, and that restoring its expression blunts metastatic liver colonization. We have found that RBMS1 functions as a post-transcriptional regulator of RNA stability by directly binding and stabilizing ~80 target mRNAs. Measurements in more than 180 clinical samples as well as survival analyses in publicly available datasets, have shown that RBMS1 silencing and the subsequent downregulation of its targets are strongly associated with disease progression and poor survival in colon cancer patients. Together, our findings establish a role for RBMS1 as a previously unknown regulator of RNA stability and as a suppressor of colon cancer metastasis with clinical utility for risk stratification of patients.\n\nSignificanceBy applying a new analytical approach to transcriptomic data from clinical samples and models of colon cancer progression, we have uncovered RBMS1 as a suppressor of metastasis and as a post-transcriptional regulator of RNA stability.

    "abstract": "Advances in high-throughput mapping of 3D genome organization have enabled genome-wide characterization of chromatin interactions. However, proximity ligation based mapping approaches for pairwise chromatin interaction such as Hi-C cannot capture multi-way interactions, which are informative to delineate higher-order genome organization and gene regulation mechanisms at single-nucleus resolution. The very recent development of ligation-free chromatin interaction mapping methods such as SPRITE and ChIA-Drop has offered new opportunities to uncover simultaneous interactions involving multiple genomic loci within the same nuclei. Unfortunately, methods for analyzing multi-way chromatin interaction data are significantly underexplored. Here we develop a new computational method, called MATCHA, based on hypergraph representation learning where multi-way chromatin interactions are represented as hyperedges. Applications to SPRITE and ChIA-Drop data suggest that MATCHA is effective to denoise the data and make de novo predictions of multi-way chromatin interactions, reducing the potential false positives and false negatives from the original data. We also show that MATCHA is able to distinguish between multi-way interaction in a single nucleus and combination of pairwise interactions in a cell population. In addition, the embeddings from MATCHA reflect 3D genome spatial localization and function. MATCHA provides a promising framework to significantly improve the analysis of multi-way chromatin interaction data and has the potential to offer unique insights into higher-order chromosome organization and function.",

    "abstract": "Evidence from epidemiological and laboratory studies, as well as randomized placebo-controlled trials, suggests supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may be efficacious for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). The mechanisms underlying n-3 PUFAs potential therapeutic properties remain unknown. There are suggestions in the literature that glial hypofunction is associated with depressive symptoms and that antidepressants may normalize glial function. In this study, iPSC-derived neuronal stem cell lines were generated from individuals with MDD. Astrocytes differentiated from patient-derived neuronal stem cells (iNSCs) were verified by GFAP. Cells were treated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and stearic acid (SA). During astrocyte differentiation, we found that n-3 PUFAs increased GFAP expression and GFAP positive cell formation. BDNF and GDNF production were increased in the astrocytes derived from patients subsequent to n-3 PUFA treatment. Stearic Acid (SA) treatment did not have this effect. CREB activity (phosphorylated CREB) was also increased by DHA and EPA but not by SA. Furthermore, when these astrocytes were treated with n-3 PUFAs, the cAMP antagonist, RP-cAMPs did not block n- 3 PUFA CREB activation. However, the CREB specific inhibitor (666-15) diminished BDNF and GDNF production induced by n-3 PUFA, suggesting CREB dependence. Together, these results suggested that n-3 PUFAs facilitate astrocyte differentiation, and may mimic effects of some antidepressants by increasing production of neurotrophic factors. The CREB-dependence and cAMP independence of this process suggests a manner in which n-3 PUFA could augment antidepressant effects. These data also suggest a role for astrocytes in both MDD and antidepressant action.",

However, it not always possible to conduct these localizer scans.

In this study, accumulation and assimilation mechanism of the nitrate metabolic intermediate ammonium in the fast growing Methylomonas sp. ZR1 was analyzed. Although, nitrate salt was the best nitrogen source supporting the growth of ZR1, its metabolic intermediate ammonium would accumulate and inhibit ZR1. Kinetic studies indicated that accumulation of NH4+ was deduced from the imbalance of nitrogen and carbon metabolism. Compensation of carbon skeleton -keto-glutaramate could effectively relieve the inhibition of NH4+ to ZR1, which further approved the assumption. qPCR analysis indicated a third ammonium assimilation pathway Glycine synthesis system may function in ZR1 under high ammonium tension. In the presence of ammonium, ZR1 might employ two strategies to relieve the ammonium stress, one was assimilating the excess ammonium, and another one was cutting off the nitrogen reduction reactions. Investigation of the nitrogen metabolism and its influence to the carbon metabolism is meaningful to systematically understand and control the C1 feedstock bioconversion process in methanotrophs.\n\nImportanceThe nitrogen metabolism in methanotrophs has long been concerned. However, there are lots of research problems yet to be solved. In this study, the accumulation and assimilation mechanism of the nitrogen metabolic intermediate ammonium in the fast growing Methylomonas sp. ZR1 was analyzed.

A third ammonium assimilation pathway related genes were proved actively expressing in ZR1 when it confronted with high ammonium tension. When confronted with ammonium tension, ZR1 might employ different strategies to relieve the ammonium stress according to the edible carbon source.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to provide support for the performance, localization and expression of the epithelial calcium transporter channels, calbindin-D28k (Calb) and TRPV6, and of the morphology of the digestive and reproductive system of laying quails under heat stress, and with methionine supplementation. Therefore, the present study characterized the positivity (immunohistochemistry) and expression (real-time PCR) of calcium channels (Calb and TRPV6) in the kidneys, intestine and uterus of 504 laying quails that were submitted to different methionine supplementation (100, 110 and 120%) and temperatures (20, 24, 28 and 32{degrees}C). The animals under thermal stress had lower villus height, villus:crypt ratio, and goblet cell index in the duodenum and jejunum, fewer secondary and tertiary uterine folds, smaller hepatic steatosis, and increased number of distal convoluted renal tubules (CT) positive to Calb (protein), and increased positivity in proximal CTs. The deleterious effects of heat stress were minimized with methionine supplementation for the following variables: duodenal crypts, number of goblet cells of the jejunum, number of uterine folds, decreased Calb positivity in intestines and kidney, increased positivity of Calb in the uterus and increased TRPV6 gene expression in the kidney. Calcium transporters were altered due to less need for calcium absorption and reabsorption due to more calcium available with the supplementation, increasing egg production and quality. Methionine supplementation further increased intestinal villus absorption area and height, increased steatosis, decreased Calb positivity in the intestine and kidney, increased uterine positivity and Calb expression, and increased TRPV6 expression in the uterus under thermoneutrality. This is the first study that describes the gene and protein expression of calcium transporters in the intestine, kidney and uterus of laying quails, and concludes that the use of methionine supplementation is justifiable in order to partially reverse the deleterious effects of thermal stress on the production.",

    "abstract": "Receptor Like kinases (RLKs) are conserved upstream signaling molecules that regulate several biological processes, including plant development and stress adaptation. Non arginine aspartate (non-RD) an important class of RLKs plays a vital role in disease resistance and apoptosis in plants. In present investigation, a comprehensive Insilco analysis for non-RD Kinase gene family including identification, sequence similarity, phylogeny, chromosomal localization, gene structures, gene duplication analysis, promoter analysis and transcript expression profiles were elucidated. In this study twenty six genes were observed on nine out of twelve chromosomes. All these genes were clustered into seven subfamilies under large monophyletic group termed as Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinase (IRAK) family. Structural diversity in genomic structure among non-RD kinase gene family were identified and presence of pathogen induced cis regulatory elements like STRE, MYC, MYB,W box were found. Expression profiles of genes involved in providing resistance to anthracnose pathogen Colletotrichum truncatum in hot pepper were analyzed at different infective stages in both resistant and susceptible genotypes. Among twenty six genes, CaRLK1 gene belonging to LRRXII subfamily was up regulated under severe stress after infection in resistant genotype PBC-80. This integrative approach has helped us to identify candidate genes involved in disease resistance which would be helpful in future crop improvement programs.",

    "abstract": "In 1972, Robert May showed that diversity is detrimental to an ecosystem since, as the number of species increases, the ecosystem is less stable. This is the so-called diversity-stability paradox, which has been derived by considering a mathematical model with linear interactions between the species. Despite being in contradiction with empirical evidence, the diversity-stability paradox has survived the test of time for over 40+ years. In this paper we first show that this paradox is a conclusion driven solely by the linearity of the model employed in its derivation which allows for the neglection of the fixed point solution in the stability analysis. The linear model leads to an ill-posed solution and along with it, its paradoxical stability predictions. We then consider a model ecosystem with nonlinear interactions between species, which leads to a stable ecosystem when the number of species is increased. The saturating non linear term in the species interaction is analogous to a Hill function appearing in systems like gene regulation, neurons, diffusion of information and ecosystems The exact fixed point solution of this model is based on k-core percolation and shows that the paradox disappears. This theoretical result, which is exact and non-perturbative, shows that diversity is beneficial to the ecosystem in agreement with analyzed experimental evidence",

    "abstract": "Visual perception of others actions is important for social interactions, and the ability to do so, even when one gets only brief glimpses of others behavior, may be crucial for survival. At present it is unknown how the human brain solves this problem. Imaging studies have promoted the idea that the multiple demand (MD) system, a domain general system of the human brain, operates in difficult cognitive and perceptual tasks, but not in tasks in which sensory information is reduced. Functional imaging, based on slow hemodynamic responses, may miss or standardize neural events with very diverse time courses. Here we exploited the temporal resolution of stereo-EEG to study directly cortical activity when human subjects must judge the actions of others, but only get brief glimpses of others activity, because the videos were truncated. Multiple cortical regions increased their activity in the difficult action discrimination, relative to the easy task when the complete video was visible. The majority of these regions belonged to the MD system, being located in parietal or prefrontal cortex. The variety of time courses, lasting from a few 100ms to several seconds, allowed us to disentangle control from effector regions, the latter processing observed actions. This distinction was further supported by relationships with behavior. A key operation within the control clusters was the prediction of erroneous responses, which was initiated in the PPC soon after the end of the truncated video. The time courses further suggested that MD regions not only exert control, but also perform various evaluations of the effort, important for efficient and intelligent behavior. We observed also increases outside the MD system, in temporo-parietal cortex, which may provide contextual information about variables related to the observed action, such as the actor, the object or the scene. Furthermore, to cope with the brief sensory input, the MD system called upon warning regions reacting to the static picture of the actor presented just before the video. We conclude that discrimination of brief observed actions indeed involves the MD system, which is thus is more general than assumed so far. WE also show that the MD system is more complex than assumed, as it includes evaluation of control, and more flexible, as it interacts with other systems than simply the effector circuit of the task.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveSustained inflation (SI) during chest compression (CC = CC+SI) significantly reduces time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) compared to 3:1 compression-to-ventilation ratio during neonatal resuscitation. However, the optimal peak inflation pressure (PIP) of SI during CC+SI to improve ROSC and hemodynamic recovery in severely asphyxiated piglets is unknown.\n\nAimTo examine if different PIPs of SI during CC+SI will improve ROSC and hemodynamic recovery in severely asphyxiated piglets.\n\nIntervention and measurementsTwenty-nine newborn piglets (1-3 days old) were anesthetized, intubated, instrumented and exposed to 30-min normocapnic hypoxia followed by asphyxia. Piglets were randomized into four groups: CC+SI with a PIP of 10 cmH2O (CC+SI_PIP_10, n=8), a PIP of 20 cmH2O (CC+SI_PIP_20, n=8), a PIP of 30 cmH2O (CC+SI_PIP_30, n=8), and a sham-operated control group (n=5). Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, carotid blood flow, cerebral oxygenation, and respiratory parameters were continuously recorded throughout the experiment.\n\nMain resultsBaseline parameters were similar between all groups. There was no difference in asphyxiation (duration and degree) between intervention groups. PIP correlated positively with tidal volume and inversely with exhaled CO2 during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Time to ROSC and rate of ROSC were similar between piglets resuscitated with CC+SI_PIP_10, CC+SI_PIP_20, and CC+SI_PIP_30 cmH2O: median (IQR) 75 (63-193) sec, 94 (78-210) sec, and 85 (70-90) sec; 5/8 (63%), 7/8 (88%), and 3/8 (38%) (p=0.56 and p=0.12, respectively). All piglets that achieved ROSC survived to four hours post-resuscitation. Piglets resuscitated with CC+SI_PIP_30 cmH2O exhibited increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1{beta} and tumour necrosis factor- in the frontoparietal cerebral cortex (both p<0.05 vs. sham-operated controls).\n\nConclusionsIn asphyxiated term newborn piglets resuscitated by CC+SI, the use of different PIPs resulted in similar time to ROSC, but PIP at 30 cmH2O showed a larger VT delivery, lower exhaled CO2 and increased tissue inflammatory markers in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, which are of great public health importance in Colombia. Aedes control strategies in Colombia rely heavily on the use of organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides, providing constant selection pressure and the emergence of resistant populations. In recent years, insecticide use has increased due to the increased incidence of dengue and recent introductions of chikungunya and Zika. In the present study, pyrethroid resistance was studied across six populations of A. aegypti from the Caribbean coast of Colombia. Susceptibility to {lambda}-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, and permethrin was assessed, and resistance intensity was determined. Activity levels of enzymes associated with resistance were measured, and the frequencies of three kdr alleles (V1016I, F1534C, V410L) were calculated. Results showed variations in pyrethroid susceptibility across A. aegypti populations and altered enzyme activity levels were detected. The kdr alleles were detected in all populations, with high variations in frequencies: V1016I (frequency ranging from 0.15-0.70), F1534C (range 0.94-1.00), and V410L (range 0.05-0.72). In assays of phenotyped individuals, associations were observed between the presence of V1016I, F1534C, and V410L alleles and resistance to the evaluated pyrethroids, as well as between the VI1016/CC1534/VL410 tri-locus genotype and {lambda}-cyhalothrin and permethrin resistance. The results of the present study contribute to the knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the resistance to key pyrethroids used to control A. aegypti along the Caribbean coast of Colombia.",
