    "abstract": "During chronic infections and in microbiota, bacteria predominantly colonize their hosts as multicellular structures called biofilms. Despite their ubiquity in vivo, we still lack a basic understanding of how they interact with biological tissues, and ultimately how they influence host physiology. A common assumption is that biofilms interact with their hosts biochemically. However, the contributions of mechanics, while being central to the process of biofilm formation, have been vastly overlooked as a factor influencing host physiology. Specifically, how biofilms form on soft, tissue-like materials remains unknown. Here we show that biofilms can deform soft substrates by transmission of internally-generated mechanical stresses. We found that biofilms from both Vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can induce large deformations of soft synthetic hydrogels. Using a combination of mechanical measurements and mutants in matrix components, we found that biofilms deform their substrates by simultaneous buckling and adhesion. Specifically, mechanical constraints opposing growth causes biofilm buckling, while matrix components maintaining surface adhesion transmit buckling forces to the substrate. Finally, we demonstrate that biofilms can generate sufficient mechanical stress to deform and disrupt soft epithelial cell monolayers, suggesting that these forces can damage a host independently of typical virulence factors. Altogether, our results illustrate that forces generated by bacterial communities play an important role not only in biofilm morphogenesis but also in host physiology, suggesting a mechanical mode of infection.",

    "abstract": "Animal embryogenesis requires a precise coordination between morphogenesis and cell fate specification. It is unclear if there are mechanisms that prevent uncoupling of these processes to ensure robust development. During mesoderm induction, mesodermal fate acquisition is tightly coordinated with the morphogenetic process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In zebrafish, cells exist transiently in a partial EMT state during mesoderm induction. Here we show that cells expressing the neural inducing transcription factor Sox2 are held in the partial EMT state, stopping them from completing the EMT and joining the mesodermal territory. This is critical for preventing ectopic neural tissue from forming. The mechanism involves specific interactions between Sox2 and the mesoderm inducing canonical Wnt signaling pathway. When Wnt signaling is inhibited in Sox2 expressing cells trapped in the partial EMT, cells are now able to exit into the mesodermal territory, but form an ectopic spinal cord instead of mesoderm. Our work identifies a critical developmental checkpoint that ensures that morphogenetic movements establishing the mesodermal germ layer are accompanied by robust mesodermal cell fate acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Congenital dysfibrinogenemia (CD) is a coagulation disorder caused by mutations in the fibrinogen gene, which result in abnormal fibrinogen function. Many studies have confirmed that over half of dysfibrinogenemia cases are asymptomatic. In this study, we aimed to investigate the pathogenesis of CD caused by {gamma} Ala327Val heterozygous mutation, a new mutation, by studying fibrinogen function. Blood samples of patients were collected and the coagulation function, fibrinogen (Fg) aggregation test, fibrin clot lysis test, and SDS-PAGE were performed. Coagulation was monitored using a thromboelastometer, and the fibrin clot network structure was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The effect of the mutation on fibrinogen structure and function was predicted by molecular modeling. The fibrinogen activity concentration in patients with CD was significantly lower than that in healthy individuals. Thromboelastography showed that the K value of patients with CD was higher than that for healthy individuals. The Angle values were also decreased. The function of fibrinogen in patients with CD was low. Compared to fibrinogen from healthy individuals, fibrin size was different, the fiber network structure was loose, the pore size was increased, and the fiber branch nodes were increased for fibrinogen isolated from the proband. The {gamma} Ala327Val mutation led to changes in the structure of fibrinogen D region, affecting its structural stability. Ala327Val heterozygous missense mutation in exon 8 of FGG gene {gamma}-chain thus leads to abnormal fibrinogen structure and impairs the aggregation function of fibrinogen. This mutation is reported here for the first time.",

    "abstract": "tRNA genes are widely studied sites of replication-fork pausing and genome instability in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. tRNAs are extremely highly transcribed and serve as constitutive condensin binding sites. tRNA transcription by RNA polymerase III has previously been identified as stimulating replication-fork pausing at tRNA genes, but the nature of the block to replication has not been incontrovertibly demonstrated. Here, we describe a systematic, genome-wide analysis of the contributions of candidates to replication-fork progression at tDNAs in yeast: transcription factor binding, transcription, topoisomerase activity, condensin-mediated clustering, and Rad18-dependent DNA repair. We show that an asymmetric block to replication is maintained even when tRNA transcription is abolished by depletion of one or more subunits of RNA polymerase III. By contrast, analogous depletion of the essential transcription factor TFIIIB removes the obstacle to replication. Therefore, our data suggest that the RNA polymerase III transcription complex itself represents an asymmetric obstacle to replication even in the absence of RNA synthesis. We additionally demonstrate that replication-fork progression past tRNA genes is unaffected by the global depletion of condensin from the nucleus, and can be stimulated by the removal of topoisomerases or Rad18-dependent DNA repair pathways.",

Deletion of the entire miR-140 locus in mice results in growth retardation and early-onset osteoarthritis-like pathology, however the relative contribution of miR-140-5p or miR-140-3p to the phenotype remains to be determined. An unbiased small RNA sequencing approach identified miR-140-3p as significantly more abundant (>10-fold) than miR-140-5p in human cartilage. Analysis of these data identified multiple miR-140-3p isomiRs differing from the miRBase annotation at both the 5 and 3 end, with >99% having one of two seed sequences (5   bases 2-8). Canonical (miR-140-3p.2) and shifted (miR-140-3p.1) seed isomiRs were overexpressed in chondrocytes and transcriptomics performed to identify targets. miR-140-3p.1 and miR-140-3p.2 significantly down-regulated 694 and 238 genes respectively, of which only 162 genes were commonly down-regulated. IsomiR targets were validated using 3  UTR luciferase assays. miR-140-3p.1 targets were enriched within up-regulated genes in rib chondrocytes of Mir140-null mice and within down-regulated genes during human chondrogenesis. Finally, through imputing the expression of miR-140 from the expression of the host gene WWP2 in 124 previously published datasets, an inverse correlation with miR-140-3p.1 predicted targets was identified. Together these data suggest the novel seed containing isomiR miR-140-3p.1 is more functional than original consensus miR-140-3p seed containing isomiR.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian SWI/SNF, or BAF complex, has a conserved and direct role in antagonizing polycomb-mediated repression. Yet, BAF appears to also promote repression by polycomb in stem cells and cancer. How BAF both antagonizes and promotes polycomb-mediated repression remains unknown. Here, we utilize targeted protein degradation to dissect the BAF-polycomb axis in embryonic stem cells on the timescale of hours. We report that rapid BAF depletion redistributes both PRC1 and PRC2 complexes from highly occupied domains, like Hox clusters, to weakly occupied sites that are normally opposed by BAF. Polycomb redistribution from highly repressed domains results in their decompaction, gain of active epigenomic features, and transcriptional derepression. Surprisingly, through dose-dependent degradation of PRC1 & PRC2 we identify both a conventional role for BAF in polycomb-mediated repression and a second mechanism acting by global redistribution of polycomb. These findings provide new mechanistic insight into the highly dynamic state of the Polycomb-Trithorax axis.",

    "abstract": "Compared to adult EEG, EEG signals recorded from pediatric populations have shorter recording periods and contain more artifact contamination. Therefore, pediatric EEG data necessitate specific preprocessing approaches in order to remove environmental noise and physiological artifacts without losing large amounts of data. However, there is presently a scarcity of standard automated preprocessing pipelines suitable for pediatric EEG.\n\nIn an effort to achieve greater standardization of EEG preprocessing, and in particular for the analysis of pediatric data, we developed the Maryland Analysis of Developmental EEG (MADE) pipeline as an automated preprocessing pipeline compatible with EEG data recorded with different hardware systems, different populations, levels of artifact contamination, and length of recordings. MADE uses EEGLAB and functions from some EEGLAB plugins, and includes additional customizable features particularly useful for EEG data collected from pediatric populations.\n\nMADE processes event-related and resting state EEG from raw data files through a series of preprocessing steps and outputs processed clean data ready to be analyzed in time, frequency, or time-frequency domain. MADE provides a report file at the end of the preprocessing that describes a variety of features of the processed data to facilitate the assessment of the quality of processed data. In this paper we discuss some practical issues, which are specifically relevant to pediatric EEG preprocessing. We also provide custom-written scripts to address these practical issues.\n\nMADE is freely available under the terms of the GNU General Public License at https://github.com/ChildDevLab/MADE-EEG-preprocessing-pipeline.",

    "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder of childhood onset that is characterised by the occurrence of motor and vocal tics. TS is associated with cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit [CSTC] dysfunction and hyper-excitability of cortical limbic and motor regions that are thought to lead to the occurrence of tics. Individuals with TS often report that their tics are preceded by  premonitory sensory/urge phenomena (PU) that are described as uncomfortable bodily sensations that precede the execution of a tic and are experienced as a strong urge for motor discharge. While the precise role played by PU in the occurrence of tics is largely unknown, they are nonetheless of considerable theoretical and clinical importance as they form a core component of many behavioural therapies used in the treatment of tic disorders. Recent evidence indicates that the cingulate cortex may play an important role in the generation of PU in TS, and in  urges-for-action more generally. In the current study we utilised voxel-based morphometry (VBM) techniques, together with  seed-to-voxel structural covariance network (SCN) mapping, to investigate the putative role played by the cingulate cortex in the generation of motor tics and the experience of PU in a relatively large group of young people with TS. Whole-brain VBM analysis revealed that TS was associated with clusters of significantly reduced grey matter volumes bilaterally within: the orbito-frontal cortex; the cerebellum; and the anterior and mid cingulate cortex. Similarly, analysis of SCNs associated with bilateral mid- and anterior-cingulate  seed regions demonstrated that TS is associated with increased structural covariance primarily with the bilateral motor cerebellum; the inferior frontal cortex; and the posterior cingulate cortex.",

    "abstract": "The neuroscience of jazz improvisation has shown promising results for understanding domain-specific and domain-general processes of creativity. Here, we used fMRI to measure for the first time the dynamic neural substrates of musical creativity in 16 skilled jazz pianists while they played by memory, improvised freely (iFreely) and by melody (iMelody), and during resting-state. We used the Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA) to examine how different modes of improvisation (musical creativity) evolve over time, and which cognitive mechanisms are responsible for different stages of musical creation. Our results reveal that a substate comprising auditory, sensorimotor and posterior salience networks had a significantly higher probability of occurrence (POc) in both modes of improvisation than in resting-state and play by memory. Another substate comprising the default mode (DMN), executive control (ECN) and language networks had significantly lower POc in iFreely than in resting-state, with iMelody having a higher POc than iFreely. Such indicates that iMelody, a more constrained form of creativity involves a higher recurrence of subsystems responsible for goal-directed cognition and cognitive control processes. On the other hand, iFreely recruits brain networks responsible for generation of spontaneous musical creativity. Overall, this study brings new insights into the large-scale brain mechanisms supporting and promoting the complex process of creativity, specifically in the context of jazz improvisation, as well as the relevance of different improvisation modes in creativity research.",

Using surface-based morphometry, we compared differences in cortical thickness and surface area. Mothers completed alexithymia and cortical integrity measures and participated with their children in a play task (Emotional Availability Scale). We found cortical thinning for NM in the right rostral middle frontal gyrus and the right anterior/medial cingulate cortex, and also increased surface area in the right occipital lingual and fusiform areas and the caudal middle frontal area. Mediation analyses showed that cognitive integrity and alexithymia mediated, respectively, the positive and negative effect of the rostral middle frontal gyrus on Emotional Availability. The findings suggest cortical thinning in the rostral frontal area underlying high-order regulatory functioning as being critical for poor maternal self-awareness of emotions and the organization of coordinated actions during mother-child interactive bonding.",

    "abstract": "Mining, whether current or inactive, generally increases salt concentrations in catchment watersheds due to precipitation on and through exposed rock surfaces. Practices like mountaintop removal mining have exacerbated this issue, with measurements of salt concentrations in nearby catchment systems well above normal levels. Nevertheless, the impact of the ionic composition of mining effluent on aquatic animal health is not well understood. This is a particularly important issue in Appalachia because it is home to an enormous diversity of organisms, including a huge array of amphibians that live in streams that receive mining effluent from operating and abandoned mines. To investigate this issue, we examined the effects of reconstituted mining effluent on the development of wild-caught wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles. We collected day-old fertilized eggs from a creek near Blacksburg, VA in early March, 2018 and raised them to hatch. Tadpoles were then assigned to either sulfate or chloride-based reconstituted mining effluent diluted to six different conductivities (100 S/cm - 2,400 S/cm). After 7 or 14 days of treatment, tadpoles were euthanized and fixed in paraformaldehyde. We imaged the heads and bodies of tadpoles for morphometric analysis before dissecting out brains and immunostaining them for phospho-histone H3, which labels dividing progenitor cells in the brain. We found that sulfate-based reconstituted mining effluent significantly lowered progenitor cell division at 1200 S/cm at Day 7 and at 600 S/cm at Day 14 relative to control. Chloride-based reconstituted mining effluent was less impactful, with no significant differences observed at Day 7 and significantly lowered progenitor cell division at 2400 S/cm at Day 14. In addition, both treatments slowed growth of some head morphological features, including head size and interocular distance. Chloride treatment slowed growth of body length at Day 14 at 600 S/cm, whereas sulfate-based reconstituted mining effluent had no effect on body length. These data show that sulfate-based mining effluent has a substantial impact on aspects of neural development, whereas chloride-based reconstituted mining effluent had less effect. In contrast, chloride-based reconstituted mining effluent had a much greater impact than sulfate on body morphology and growth. These experiments demonstrate that the chemical composition of salts in mining effluent can have divergent effects on the development of amphibians.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune system is highly sensitive to arrayed antigens, and multivalent display of viral glycoproteins on symmetric scaffolds has been found to substantially increase the elicitation of antigen-specific antibodies. Motivated by the considerable promise of this strategy for next-generation anti-viral vaccines, we set out to design new self-assembling protein nanoparticles with geometries specifically tailored to scaffold ectodomains of different viral glycoproteins. We first designed and characterized homo-trimers from designed repeat proteins with N-terminal helices positioned to match the C termini of several viral glycoprotein trimers. Oligomers found to experimentally adopt the designed configuration were then used to generate nanoparticles with tetrahedral, octahedral, or icosahedral symmetry. Examples of all three target symmetries were experimentally validated by cryo-electron microscopy and several were assessed for their ability to display viral glycoproteins via genetic fusion. Electron microscopy and antibody binding experiments demonstrated that the designed nanoparticles display conformationally intact native-like HIV-1 Env, influenza hemagglutinin, and prefusion RSV F trimers in the predicted geometries. This work demonstrates that novel nanoparticle immunogens can be designed from the bottom up with atomic-level accuracy and provides a general strategy for precisely controlling epitope presentation and accessibility.",

    "abstract": "The GTPase Cdc42 is the master regulator of eukaryotic cell polarisation. During this process the active form of Cdc42 is accumulated at a particular site on the cell membrane called the pole. It is believed that the accumulation of the active Cdc42 resulting in a pole is driven by a combination of activation-inactivation reactions and diffusion. It has been proposed using mathematical modelling that this is the result of diffusion-driven instability, originally proposed by Alan Turing. In this study we developed, analysed and validated a 3D bulk-surface model of the dynamics of Cdc42. We show that the model can undergo both classic and non-classic Turing instability by deriving necessary conditions for which this occurs and conclude that the non-classic case can be viewed as a limit case of the classic case of diffusion driven instability. We thoroughly investigate the parameter space. Using three-dimensional spatio-temporal simulation we predicted pole size and time to polarisation, suggesting that cell polarisation is mainly driven by the reaction strength parameter and that the size of the pole is determined by the relative diffusion.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe current outbreak caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has become a worldwide concern. As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected.\n\nMethodsWe downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs.\n\nResultsAn isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1{middle dot}05 x 10-2 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.27 x 10-4 to 2.72 x 10-2) for N, 5.34 x 10-3 (5.10 x 10-4, 1.28 x 10-2) for S, 1.69 x 10-3 (3.94 x 10-4, 3.60 x 10-3) for P, 1.65 x 10-3 (4.47 x 10-4, 3.24 x 10-3) for the whole genome, respectively. At this nucleotide substitution rate, the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs appeared about 0.253-0.594 year before the epidemic.\n\nConclusionOur analysis suggests that at least two different viral strains of 2019-nCoV are involved in this outbreak that might occur a few months earlier before it was officially reported.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo identify key dosimetric parameters that have close associations with tumor treatment response and body weight change in SFRT treatments with a large range of spatial-fractionation scale at dose rates of several Gy/min.\n\nMethodsSix study arms using uniform tumor radiation, half-tumor radiation, 2mm beam array radiation, 0.3mm minibeam radiation, and an untreated arm were used. All treatments were delivered on a 320kV x-ray irradiator. Forty-two female Fischer 344 rats with fibrosarcoma tumor allografts were used. Dosimetric parameters studied are peak dose and width, valley dose and width, peak-to-valley-dose-ratio, volumetric average dose, percentage volume directly irradiated, and tumor- and normal-tissue EUD. Animal survival, tumor volume change, and body weight change (indicative of treatment toxicity) are tested for association with the dosimetric parameters using linear regression and Cox Proportional Hazards models.\n\nResultsThe dosimetric parameters most closely associated with tumor response are tumor EUD (R2=0.7923, F-stat=15.26*; z-test=-4.07***), valley/minimum dose (R2=0.7636, F-stat=12.92*; z-test=-4.338***), and percentage tumor directly irradiated (R2=0.7153, F-stat=10.05*; z-test=-3.837***) per the linear regression and Cox Proportional Hazards models, respectively. Tumor response is linearly proportional to valley/minimum doses and tumor EUD. Average dose (R2=0.2745, F-stat=1.514 (no sig.); z-test=-2.811**) and peak dose (R2=0.04472, F-stat=0.6874 (not sig.); z-test=-0.786 (not sig.)) show the weakest associations to tumor response. Only the uniform radiation arm did not gain body weight post-radiation, indicative of treatment toxicity; however, body weight change in general shows weak association with all dosimetric parameters except for valley/min dose (R2=0.3814, F-stat=13.56**), valley width (R2=0.2853, F-stat=8.783**), and peak width (R2=0.2759, F-stat=8.382**).\n\nConclusionsFor a single-fraction SFRT at conventional dose rates, valley, not peak, dose is closely associated with tumor treatment response and thus should be used for treatment prescription. Tumor EUD, valley/min dose, and percentage tumor directly irradiated are the top three dosimetric parameters that exhibited close associations with tumor response.",

    "abstract": "Camera traps are a unique survey tool used to monitor a wide variety of mammal species. Camera trap (CT) data can be used to estimate animal distribution, density, and behaviour. Attractants, such as scent lures, are often used in an effort to increase CT detections; however, the degree which the effects of attractants vary across species is not well understood. We investigated the effects of scent lure on mammal detections by comparing detection rates between 404 lured and 440 unlured CT stations sampled in Alberta, Canada over 120 day survey periods between February and August in 2015 and 2016. We used zero-inflated negative binomial generalized linear mixed models to test the effect of lure on detection rates for a) all mammals, b) six functional groups (all predator species, all prey, large carnivores, small carnivores, small mammals, ungulates), and c) four varied species of management interest (fisher, Pekania pennanti; gray wolf, Canis lupus; moose, Alces alces; and Richardsons ground squirrel; Urocitellus richardsonii). Mammals were detected at 800 of the 844 CTs, with nearly equal numbers of total detections at CTs with (7110) and without (7530) lure, and variable effects of lure on groups and individual species. Scent lure significantly increased detections of predators as a group, including large and small carnivore sub-groups and fisher specifically, but not of gray wolf. There was no effect of scent lure on detections of prey species, including the small mammal and ungulate sub-groups and moose and Richardsons ground squirrel specifically. We recommend that researchers explicitly consider the variable effects of scent lure on CT detections across species when designing, interpreting, or comparing multi-species surveys. Additional research is needed to further quantify variation in species responses to scent lures and other attractants, and to elucidate the effect of attractants on community-level inferences from camera trap surveys.",

Statistical analyses comprised contraction of highly correlated environmental variables, best-subset model selection, stepwise model selection, and permutation tests. Results showed that: (i) probenazole (fungicide) was the unique significant stressor on fish (i.e., contamination with this compound had a significantly negative correlation with fish taxonomic richness), (ii) the interaction of BPMC (insecticide; also known as fenobucarb) and bluegill (invasive alien fish) was a significant stressor on a \"large insect\" category (Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Odonata, and Trichoptera), (iii) the interaction of BPMC and concrete bank was a significant stressor on an \"invertebrate\" category, (iv) the combined impacts of BPMC and the other stressors on the invertebrate and large insect categories resulted in an estimated mean loss of taxonomic richness by 15% and 77%, respectively, in comparison with a hypothetical pond with preferable conditions.",

    "abstract": "Diet-tracking mobile apps have been effective in behavior change. At the same time, quantity-focused diet tracking (e.g., calorie counting) can be time-consuming and tedious, leading to unsustained adoption. Diet Quality--focusing on high-quality dietary patterns rather than quantifying diet into calories--has shown effectiveness in improving heart disease risk. Healthy Heart Score (HHS) predicts 20-year cardiovascular risks based on quality-focused food category consumptions, rather than detailed serving sizes. No studies have examined how mobile health apps focusing on diet quality can bring promising results on health outcomes and ease of adoption. We designed a mobile app to support the HHS informed quality-focused dietary approach by enabling users to log simplified diet quality and view its real-time impact on future heart disease risks. Users were asked to log food categories that are the main predictors of HHS. We measured the apps feasibility and efficacy on improving individuals clinical and behavioral factors affecting future heart disease risks and app use. We recruited 38 overweight or obese participants at high heart disease risk, who used the app for 5 weeks and measured weight, blood sugar, and blood pressure, HHS, and Diet Score (DS) measuring diet quality at baseline and the fifth week of the intervention. The majority used the application every week (84%) and significantly improved DS and HHS at the fifth week (p<0.05), although only 10 participants (31%) checked their risk scores more than once. Other outcomes did not show significant changes. Our study showed logging simplified diet quality significantly improved dietary behavior. The participants were not interested in seeing HHS, and the participants perceived logging diet categories irrelevant to improving HHS as important. We discuss the complexities of addressing health risks, quantity vs. quality-based health monitoring, and incorporating secondary behavior change goals that matter to users when designing mobile health.",

    "abstract": "Accurate estimates of abundance are critical to species management and conservation. Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus truncatus) inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) estuarine system along the east coast of Florida are impacted by anthropogenic activities and have had multiple unexplained mortality events, necessitating precise estimates of demographic and abundance parameters to implement management strategies. Mark-recapture methodology following a Robust Design survey was used to estimate abundance, adult survival, and temporary emigration for the IRL estuarine system stock of bottlenose dolphins. Models included a parameter (time since first capture) to assess evidence for transient individuals. Boat-based photo-identification surveys (n = 135) were conducted along predetermined contour and transect lines throughout the entire IRL (2016-2017). The best fitting model included the \"transient\" parameter to survival, allowed survival to vary by primary period, detection to vary by secondary session, and did not allow temporary emigration. Dolphin abundance ranged from 981 (95% CI: 882-1,090) in winter to 1,078 (95% CI: 968-1,201) in summer with a mean of 1,032 (95% CI: 969 -1,098). Model averaged seasonal survival rate for marked residents ranged from 0.85-1.00. Capture probability ranged from 0.20 to 0.42 during secondary sessions and transient rate from 0.06 to 0.07. This study represents the first Robust design mark-recapture survey effort to estimate abundance for IRL dolphins and provides parameter estimates to optimize sampling design of future studies. Transients included individuals with home ranges extending north of the IRL requiring further assessment of stock delineation. Results were remarkably similar to prior abundance estimates resulting from line-transect aerial surveys and were consistent with a stable population. Data will enable managers to evaluate the impact of fisheries-related takes as well as enable future comparisons of demographic parameters for a dolphin population that continues to sustain large scale mortality events and anthropogenic impacts.",

    "abstract": "A wide range of anthropogenic structures exist in the marine environment with the extent of these set to increase as the global offshore renewable energy industry grows. Many of these pose acute risks to marine wildlife; for example, tidal energy generators have the potential to injure or kill seals and small cetaceans through collisions with moving turbine parts. Information on fine scale behaviour of animals close to operational turbines is required to understand the likely impact of these new technologies. There are inherent challenges associated with measuring the underwater movements of marine animals which have, so far, limited data collection. Here, we describe the development and application of a system for monitoring the three-dimensional movements of cetaceans in the immediate vicinity of a subsea structure. The system comprises twelve hydrophones and software for the detection and localisation of vocal marine mammals. We present data demonstrating the systems practical performance during a deployment on an operational tidal turbine between October 2017 and October 2019. Three-dimensional locations of cetaceans were derived from the passive acoustic data using time of arrival differences on each hydrophone. Localisation accuracy was assessed with an artificial sound source at known locations and a refined method of error estimation is presented. Calibration trials show that the system can accurately localise sounds to 2m accuracy within 20m of the turbine but that localisations become highly inaccurate at distances greater than 35m. The system is currently being used to provide data on rates of encounters between cetaceans and the turbine and to provide high resolution tracking data for animals close to the turbine. These data can be used to inform stakeholders and regulators on the likely impact of tidal turbines on cetaceans.",

    "abstract": "In Sub-Saharan Africa, the fan palm Borassus aethiopum Mart. is an important non-timber forest product-providing palm that faces multiple anthropogenic threats to its genetic diversity. However, this species is so far under-studied, which prevents its sustainable development as a resource.\n\nThe present work is a first attempt at characterizing the genetic diversity of this palm species as well as its spatial structuration in Benin, West Africa. During a first phase we implemented a microsatellite markers-based approach relying on the reported transferability of primers developed in other palm species and found that, in disagreement with previously published results, only 22.5% of the 80 markers tested enabled amplification of African fan palm DNA and polymorphism detection was insufficient. During a second phase, we therefore generated a B. aethiopum-specific genomic dataset through high-throughput sequencing and used it for the de novo detection of potential microsatellite markers. Among these, 11 enabled polymorphism detection and were further used for analyzing genetic diversity in nine B. aethiopum populations.\n\nOur results show that genetic diversity of Beninese fan palm populations is low, with an overall average expected heterozygosity (He) of 0.354. Moreover, the positive values of the fixation index (F) in populations from both the Central (Soudano-Guinean) and the Southern (Guinean) regions suggest limited gene flows. Our analysis show that sampled B. aethiopum populations are clustered into two groups, one spanning populations from both the Southern and most of the Central region, and the other including the Central population of Save (which also has the highest He) and populations from the North.\n\nIn light of our results, we discuss the use of inter-species transfer vs. de novo development of microsatellite markers in genetic diversity analyses targeting under-studied species. We also suggest future applications for the molecular resources generated through the present study.",

Here, to provide basic information for conservation of indigenous masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou masou, a commonly stocked fish in the Kase River system, Japan, we used whole-mitogenome analysis of fish to identify hatchery haplotypes in the river and in several hatcheries that might be used for stocking. Whole-mitogenome sequencing clearly identified hatchery haplotypes like fingerprints, identifying the tributaries contaminated with hatchery haplotypes. The results suggest that informal stocking of O. m. masou has been performed widely across the Kase River system. Non-hatchery haplotypes mainly belonged to clade I, which was not found in northern Hokkaido Island. Sites without hatchery haplotypes were estimated three, suggesting that these sites are suitable for conservation of the indigenous fish. This study demonstrated that the resolution of the conventional analysis using partial mitogenome is insufficient to distinguish hatchery haplotype from similar lineages. The whole-mitogenome sequences provided accurate information that was not available in the partial sequences, enabling various inferences: e.g., estimation of the origin of stocked fish and circulation of the reared strains. We conclude that whole-mitogenome analysis is useful for the genetic study of this species. The whole-mitogenome data produced will contribute to the conservation, resource management, and further study of O. m. masou.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli comprises of diverse strains with a large accessory genome, indicating functional diversity and the ability to adapt to a range of niches. Specific strains would display greatest fitness in niches matching their combination of phenotypic traits. Given this hypothesis, we sought to determine whether E. coli in a peri-urban pond and associated cattle pasture display niche preference. Samples were collected from water, sediment, aquatic plants, water snails associated with the pond as well as bovine feces from cattle in an adjacent pasture. Isolates (120) were obtained after plating on Membrane Lactose Glucuronide Agar (MLGA). We used the uidA and mutS sequences for all isolates to determine phylogeny by maximum likelihood, and population structure through gene flow analysis. PCR was used to allocate isolates to phylogroups and to determine the presence of pathogenicity / virulence genes (stxI, stxII, eaeA, hlyA, ST and LT). Antimicrobial resistance was determined using a disk diffusion assay for Tetracycline, Gentamicin, Ciprofloxacin, Meropenem, Ceftriaxone, and Azitrhomycin. Our results showed that isolates from water, sediment and water plants were similar by phylogroup distribution, virulence gene distribution and antibiotic resistance while both snail and feces populations were significantly different. Few of the feces isolates were significantly similar to aquatic ones, and most of the snail isolates were also different. Population structure analysis indicated three genetic backgrounds associated with bovine, snail and aquatic environments. Collectively these data support niche preference of E. coli isolates occurring in this ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the virulence and anti-trypanosomal drug sensitivity patterns of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr) isolates in the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization-Biotechnology Research Institute (KALRO-BioRI) cryobank. Specifically, the study focused on Tbr clones originally isolated from the western Kenya/eastern Uganda focus of human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). Twelve (12) Tbr clones were assessed for virulence using groups(n=10) of Swiss White Mice monitored for 60 days post infection (dpi). Based on survival time, four classes of virulence were identified: (a) very-acute: 0-15, (b) acute: 16-30, (c) sub-acute: 31-45 and (d) chronic: 46-60 dpi. Other virulence biomarkers identified included: prepatent period (pp), parasitaemia progression, packed cell volume (PCV) and body weight changes. The test Tbr clones together with KALRO-BioRi reference drug-resistant and drug sensitive isolates were then tested for sensitivity to melarsoprol (mel B) pentamidine, diminazene aceturate and suramin, using mice groups (n= 5) treated with single doses of each drug at 24 hours post infection. Our results showed that the clones were distributed among four classes of virulence as follows: 3/12 (very-acute), 3/12 (acute), 2/12 (sub-acute) and 4/12 (chronic) isolates. Differences in survivorship, parasitaemia progression and PCV were significant (P<0.001) and correlated. The isolate considered to be drug resistant at KALRO-BioRI, KETRI 2538, was confirmed to be resistant to melarsoprol, pentamidine and diminazene aceturate but it was not resistant to suramin. At least 80% cure rates of all the test isolates was achieved with melarsoprol (1mg/Kg and 20 mg/kg), pentamidine (5 and 20 mg/kg), diminazene aceturate (5 mg/kg) and suramin (5 mg/kg) indicating that the isolates were not resistant to any of the drugs despite the differences in virulence. This study provides evidence of variations in virulence of Tbr isolates from a single HAT focus and confirms that these variations are not a significant determinant of isolate sensitivity to anti-trypanosomal drugs.",

    "abstract": "Meat consumption is influenced by a variety of factors including of empathy and feelings on affinity towards farm animals. The goal of this study was to examine the role of solidarity with animals on meat consumption and attitudes towards the treatment of animals. Data was drawn from a sample of 265 respondents in the US. Correlation and mediation analyses were performed. The results of the correlation analysis indicate a moderate but positive correlation between solidarity with animals and proecological beliefs. The association between attitudes towards the treatment of farm animals and antibiotic use and solidarity with animals was also positive. Relative to meat consumption, the results indicate that proecological beliefs and concerns about the treatment of farm animals negatively influenced consumption. The effect of attitudes towards antibiotic use and solidarity with animals on consumption were however fully mediated by proecological beliefs. The results indicate that social identification with animals can play a significant role in food choice. However, its relationship with proecological beliefs implies that holistic approaches are required to address current livestock production practices that are considered unnatural.",
