    "abstract": "The role of the hippocampus in recognition memory has long been a source of debate. Tasks used to study recognition that typically require an explicit probe, where the participant must make a response to prove they remember, yield mixed results on hippocampal involvement. Here, we tasked monkeys to freely view naturalistic videos, and only tested their memory via looking times for two separate novel v. repeat video conditions on each trial. Notably, a large proportion of hippocampal neurons differentiated these videos via changes in firing rates time-locked to the duration of their presentation on screen, and not during the delay period between them as would be expected for working memory. Single neurons often contributed to both retrieval conditions, and did so across many trials with trial-unique video content, suggesting they detect familiarity. The majority of neurons contributing to the classifier showed an enhancement in firing rate on repeat compared to novel videos, a pattern which has not previously been shown in hippocampus. These results suggest the hippocampus contributes to recognition memory via familiarity during free-viewing.\n\nSignificance StatementRecognition memory enables distinction of new from previously encountered stimuli. In the majority of recognition memory work, humans or animals are tasked to explicitly identify whether a stimulus is old or new. In some of these studies--but for unknown reasons not others--there is evidence of hippocampal involvement. Here, when we present trial-unique, naturalistic videos to monkeys, firing rates from many single hippocampal neurons surprisingly differentiate new from repeated videos. The ability of these hippocampal neurons to detect recently-viewed stimuli, despite the videos unfamiliar content, suggests they contribute to memory. These results are consistent with hippocampal involvement in the familiarity aspect of recognition memory during free-viewing.",

    "abstract": "Memory loss is a usual consequence of ageing and aged mice show progressive deficits in memory tasks. In aged brains, perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are implicated in plasticity and memory, become inhibitory due to decreased 6-sulphation of their glycan chains (C6S). Removal of PNNs or digestion of their glycosaminoglycans rescued age-related memory loss. Premature reduction of permissive C6S by transgenic deletion of chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase led to very early memory loss. However, restoring C6S levels in aged animals by AAV delivery or transgenic expression of 6-sulfotransferase restored memory. Low C6S levels caused loss of cortical long-term potentiation, which was restored by AAV-mediated 6-sulfotransferase delivery. The study shows that loss of C6S in the aged brain leads to declining memory and cognition. Age-related memory impairment was restored by C6S replacement or other interventions targeting perineuronal nets",

Here we identify a new role for the Arabidopsis AT-HOOK MOTIF CONTAINING NUCLEAR LOCALIZED 15 (AHL15) gene as a suppressor of AM maturation. Loss of AHL15 function accelerates AM maturation, whereas ectopic expression of AHL15 suppresses AM maturation and promotes longevity in Arabidopsis and tobacco. Together our results indicate that AHL15 expression acts as a key molecular switch, directly downstream of flowering genes (SOC1, FUL) and upstream of GA biosynthesis, in extending the plants lifespan by suppressing AM maturation.",

While CRISPR-Cas-mediated gene activation have been extensively developed for eukaryotic systems, similar strategies have been difficult to implement in bacteria. Here, we present a generalizable platform for screening and selection of functional bacterial CRISPR-Cas transcription activators. Using this platform, we identified a novel CRISPR activator, dCas9-AsiA, that could activate gene expression by up to 200-fold across genomic and plasmid targets with diverse promoters after directed evolution. The evolved dCas9-AsiA can simultaneously mediate activation and repression of bacterial regulons in E. coli. We further identified hundreds of promoters with varying basal expression that could be induced by dCas9-AsiA, which provides a rich resource of genetic parts for inducible gene activation. Finally, we show that dCas9-AsiA can be ported to other bacteria of clinical and bioindustrial relevance, thus enabling bacterial CRISPRa in more application areas. This work expands the toolbox for programmable gene regulation in bacteria and provides a useful resource for future engineering of other bacterial CRISPR-based gene regulators.",

    "abstract": "Forest canopies are hotspots of biodiversity even in temperate forests but which and how many ecological mechanisms contribute to the high diversity remains elusive. This biodiversity is not distributed evenly throughout the complex fractal structures formed by individual tree crowns. They are non-stationary, constantly expose new surface habitat via growth, and create contrasting abiotic conditions. These features give rise to a range of vertical gradients in habitat optimality, heterogeneity, available surface area and time for succession - all known to be mechanisms shaping diversity patterns. Using a canopy crane facility and epiphytic lichens on Fraxinus excelsior and Quercus robur as model system, we aim to assess the relative importance as well as the interplay of these mechanisms in shaping biodiversity patterns within tree canopies by detecting their distinct mechanistic fingerprints. Lichen species richness exhibited a hump-shaped vertical pattern, skewed towards the top of the crown. This pattern was observable at both the level of individual plots and that of aggregate height layers and it was correlated with lichen cover. Also, a vertical gradient in species composition was found and could be related to species traits known to reflect successional niches such as dispersal mode and growth form. Habitat heterogeneity and available surface area have been found to have little effect on vertical lichen diversity patterns. We conclude that the vertical lichen diversity patterns in the tree crown are mainly shaped by the successional accumulation of species along a branch age gradient and a pronounced vertical gradient in environmental optimality from harshly exposed young branches at the top crown over suitable habitats with a balance in light and humidity towards the limiting light conditions in the dim understory. At the level of the whole canopy, successional and environmental niche dynamics jointly operate to generate lichen diversity.",

    "abstract": "Conservation interventions in developing countries are frequently thwarted by socio-economic agendas, severely limiting the scope and rigor of biodiversity and habitat conservation. Very few ecological assessments incorporate human interests in conservation prioritization, creating asynchrony between planning and implementation. For conservation actions to be logistically feasible, multiple criteria including ecological, social, economic and administrative aspects must be considered. Understanding how these different dimensions interact spatially is also important for gauging the potential for conservation success. Here, we use a guild of select mammalian carnivores (wild canids and hyenas) in India to (i) generate distribution maps at the spatial scale of administrative sub-districts, that is relevant to management, (ii) examine ecological, social and biogeographic factors associated with their distribution, quantify key threats, and identify areas important for their conservation, (iii) use prioritization tools for balancing habitat conservation, human needs and economic growth, and (iv) evaluate the spatial congruence between areas with high conservation potential, and areas currently in focus for protection efforts, conservation investments, and infrastructure development. We find that the current Protected Area system does not adequately cover or represent diverse habitats, that there is immense potential for States to increase financial investments towards alternative conservation strategies, and, most infrastructure projects may be jeopardizing important carnivore habitats. Our framework allowed for identifying locations where conservation investments would lead to the highest dividends for flagship carnivores and associated species across habitats. We make a case for re-evaluating how large-scale prioritization assessments are made, and for broadening the purview of conservation policies in India and other developing countries.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosomatid parasites are causative agents of important human and animal diseases such as sleeping sickness and leishmaniasis. Most trypanosomatids are transmitted to their mammalian hosts by insects, often belonging to Diptera (or true flies). With resistance to both vector-targeted pesticides and trypanocidal drugs being reported, there is a need for novel transmission blocking strategies to be developed. Studies using the blood-feeding vectors themselves are not broadly accessible, as such, new model systems are being developed to unpick insect-trypanosmatids interactions. One such case is the interactions between the model dipteran Drosophila melanogaster and its natural trypanosomatid Herpetomonas muscarum. Our previous work has found that much of the transcriptomic changes triggered in H. muscarum after ingestion by Drosophila reflect what is known for disease-causing trypanosomatids. Here we describe a set of tools to genetically manipulate the parasite and therefore create a truly tractable insect-parasite interaction system from both sides of this association. These include transgenic fluorescently tagged parasites to follow infection dynamics in the fly gut as well as iterations of plasmids that can be used for generating knock-in and knock-out strains. The tools presented in this short report will facilitate further characterisation of trypanosomatid establishment in a model dipteran.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) is a major source of transcriptome and proteome diversity in higher organisms. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as regulators of AS through a range of molecular mechanisms. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the AS regulators NSRa and b, which affect auxin-driven lateral root formation, can interact with the ALTERNATIVE SPLICING COMPETITOR (ASCO) lncRNA. Here, we analyzed the effect of the knockdown and overexpression of ASCO at genome-wide level and found a high number of deregulated and differentially spliced genes, related to flagellin responses and biotic stress. In agreement, roots from ASCO-knocked down plants are more sensitive to flagellin. Surprisingly, only a minor subset of genes overlapped with the AS defects of the nsra/b double mutant. Using biotin-labelled oligonucleotides for RNA-mediated ribonucleoprotein purification, we found that ASCO binds to the highly conserved core spliceosome component PRP8a. ASCO deregulation impairs the recognition of specific flagellin-related transcripts by PRP8a and SmD1b, another spliceosome component, suggesting that ASCO function regulates AS through the interaction with multiple splicing factors. Hence, lncRNAs may interact in a dynamic network with many splicing factors to modulate transcriptome reprogramming in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial genomes can contain traces of a complex evolutionary history, including extensive homologous recombination, gene loss, gene duplications and horizontal gene transfer. In order to reconstruct the phylogenetic and population history of a set of multiple bacteria, it is necessary to examine their pan-genome, the composite of all the genes in the set. Here we introduce PEPPAN, a novel pipeline that can reliably construct pan-genomes from thousands of genetically diverse bacterial genomes that represent the diversity of an entire genus. PEPPAN outperforms existing pan-genome methods by providing consistent gene and pseudogene annotations extended by similarity-based gene predictions, and identifying and excluding paralogs by combining tree- and synteny-based approaches. The PEPPAN package additionally includes PEPPAN_parser, which implements additional downstream analyses including the calculation of trees based on accessory gene content or allelic differences between core genes. In order to test the accuracy of PEPPAN, we implemented SimPan, a novel pipeline for simulating the evolution of bacterial pan-genomes. We compared the accuracy and speed of PEPPAN with four state-of-the-art pan-genome pipelines using both empirical and simulated datasets. PEPPAN was more accurate and more specific than any of the other pipelines and was almost as fast as any of them. As a case study, we used PEPPAN to construct a pan-genome of ~40,000 genes from 3052 representative genomes spanning at least 80 species of Streptococcus. The resulting gene and allelic trees provide an unprecedented overview of the genomic diversity of the entire Streptococcus genus.",

The centrosome, comprised of two centrioles surrounded by the pericentriolar material (PCM), is the cells central MT organizing center. The PCM proteins, including{gamma} -tubulin and Pericentrin, promote MT nucleation and organization. Centrosomes in cancer cells are commonly numerically amplified. However, the question of how amplification of centrosomes alters the MT organization capacity is not well-studied. We developed a quantitative image-processing and machine learning-aided approach for the automated analysis of MT organization. We designed a convolutional neural network-based approach for detecting centrosomes and an automated pipeline for analyzing MT organization around centrosomes, encapsulated in a semi-automatic graphical tool. Using this tool, we analyzed the spatial distribution of PCM proteins, the growing ends of MTs and the total MT density in breast cancer cells. We find that breast cancer cells with supernumerary centrosomes not only have increased PCM protein but also exhibit expansion in PCM size. Moreover, centrosome amplified cells have a greater MT density and more growing MT ends near centrosomes than unamplified cells. The semi-automated approach developed here enables facile, unbiased and quantitative measurements of centrosome aberrations. We show that these aberrations increase MT nucleation and promote changes to MT density and the spatial distribution of MTs around amplified centrosomes.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle possesses an outstanding capacity to regenerate upon injury due to the adult muscle stem cells (MuSCs) activity. This ability requires the proper balance between MuSCs expansion and differentiation which is critical for muscle homeostasis and contributes, if deregulated, to muscle diseases. Here, we functionally characterize a novel chromatin-associated lncRNA, lnc-Rewind, which is expressed in murine MuSCs and conserved in human. We find that, in mouse, lnc-Rewind acts as an epigenetic regulator of MuSCs proliferation and expansion by influencing the expression of skeletal muscle genes and several components of the WNT (Wingless-INT) signalling pathway. Among them, we identified the nearby Wnt7b gene as a direct lnc-Rewind target. We show that lnc-Rewind interacts with the G9a histone lysine methyltransferase and mediates the in cis repression of Wnt7b by H3K9me2 deposition. Overall, these findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of adult muscle stem cells fate by lncRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Delivery of therapeutic moieties to specific cell types, such as neurons remains a challenge. Genes present in neurons are also expressed in non-neuronal cell types such as glia where they mediate non-targeted related functions. Thus, non-specific targeting of these proteins/channels has numerous unwanted side effects, as is the case with current small molecules or drug therapies. Current methodologies that use nanoparticles, lipid-mediated uptake, or mannitol in conjunction with lipids to deliver double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) have yielded mixed and unreliable results. We used a neuroanatomical tracer (B subunit of Cholera Toxin (CTB)) that binds to the ganglioside receptors (GM1) expressed on cells, including primary sensory neurons to deliver encapsulated dsRNA. This approach greatly improved delivery of dsRNA to the desired cells by enhancing uptake, reducing vehicle-mediated toxicity and protecting nucleotides from degradation by endonucleases. The delivery complex is internalized, and once inside the cell, the dsRNA naturally dissociates itself from the carrier complex and is very effective in knocking down cognate targets, both in vivo and in vitro. Past methods have used CTB-fusion proteins or chemically modified oligos or DNA moieties that have been covalently conjugated to CTB. Furthermore, CTB conjugated to an antigen, protein, or chemically modified nucleic acid is a potent activator of immune cell (T and B cells, macrophages) response, whereas CTB admixed with antigens or unmodified nucleic acids does not evoke this immune response. Importantly, in our method, the nucleic acids are not covalently linked to the carrier molecules. Thus, our method holds strong potential for targeted delivery of therapeutic moieties for cell types expressing GM1 receptors, including neuronal cell types.",

    "abstract": "How progenitor cells can attain a distinct differentiated cell identity is a challenging problem given that critical transcription factors are often not unique to a differentiation process and the fluctuating signaling environment in which cells exist. Here we test the hypothesis that a unique differentiated cell identity can result from a core component of the differentiated state doubling up as a signaling protein that also drives differentiation. Using live single-cell imaging in the adipocyte differentiation system, we show that progenitor fat cells (preadipocytes) can only commit to terminally differentiate after upregulating FABP4, a lipid buffer that is highly enriched in mature adipocytes. Upon induction of adipogenesis, we show that after a long delay, cells first abruptly start to engage a positive feedback between CEBPA and PPARG before then engaging, after a second delay, a positive feedback between FABP4 and PPARG. These sequential positive feedbacks both need to engage in order to drive PPARG levels past the threshold for irreversible differentiation. In the last step before commitment, PPARG transcriptionally increases FABP4 expression while fatty-acid loaded FABP4 binds to and increases PPARG activity. Together, our study suggests a control principle for robust cell identity whereby a core component of the differentiated state also promotes differentiation from its own progenitor state.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIFatty-acid loaded FABP4 binds to and increases PPARG expression, thereby turning on PPARG positive feedback loops that further increase PPARG expression.\nC_LIO_LIFABP4 critically controls the second phase of adipogenesis between activation of the feedback loops and reaching the threshold to differentiate.\nC_LIO_LIOnly a small fraction ([~]10%) of the FABP4 levels typically attained in mature fat cells is needed to commit cells to the differentiated state, thus providing an explanation for why maintenance of the mature adipocyte state is so robust.\nC_LI",
