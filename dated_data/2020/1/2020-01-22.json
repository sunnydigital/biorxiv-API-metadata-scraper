    "abstract": "Although the taxonomic composition of the human microbiome varies tremendously across individuals, its gene composition or functional capacity is highly conserved1-5---implying an ecological property known as functional redundancy. Such functional redundancy is thought to underlie the stability and resilience of the human microbiome6,7, but its origin is elusive. Here, we investigate the basis for functional redundancy in the human microbiome by analyzing its genomic content network --- a bipartite graph that links microbes to the genes in their genomes. We show that this network exhibits several topological features, such as highly nested structure and fat-tailed gene degree distribution, which favor high functional redundancy. To explain the origins of these topological features, we develop a simple genome evolution model that explicitly considers selection pressure, and the processes of gene gain and loss, and horizontal gene transfer. We find that moderate selection pressure and high horizontal gene transfer rate are necessary to generate genomic content networks with both highly nested structure and fat-tailed gene degree distribution, and consequently favor high functional redundancy. These findings provide insights into the relationships between structure and function in complex microbial communities. This work elucidates the potential ecological and evolutionary processes that create and maintain functional redundancy in the human microbiome and contribute to its resilience.",

    "abstract": "Increasing the reproducibility of neuroimaging measurement addresses a central impediment to the advancement of human neuroscience and its clinical applications. Recent efforts demonstrating variance in functional brain organization within and between individuals shows a need for improving reproducibility of functional parcellations without long scan times. We apply bootstrap aggregation, or bagging, to the problem of improving reproducibility in functional parcellation. We use two large datasets to demonstrate that compared to a standard clustering framework, bagging improves the reproducibility and test-retest reliability of both cortical and subcortical functional parcellations across a range of sites, scanners, samples, scan lengths, clustering algorithms, and clustering parameters (e.g., number of clusters, spatial constraints). With as little as six minutes of scan time, bagging creates more reproducible group and individual level parcellations than standard approaches with twice as much data. This suggests that regardless of the specific parcellation strategy employed, bagging may be a key method for improving functional parcellation and bringing functional neuroimaging-based measurement closer to clinical impact.",

    "abstract": "Numerous brain imaging studies identified a domain-general or \"multiple-demand\" (MD) activation pattern accompanying many tasks and may play a core role in cognitive control. Though this finding is well established, the limited spatial localization provided by traditional imaging methods precluded a consensus regarding the precise anatomy, functional differentiation and connectivity of the MD system. To address these limitations, we used data from 449 subjects from the Human Connectome Project, with cortex of each individual parcellated using neurobiologically grounded multi-modal MRI features. The conjunction of three cognitive contrasts reveals a core of 10 widely distributed MD parcels per hemisphere that are most strongly activated and functionally interconnected, surrounded by a penumbra of 17 additional areas. Outside cerebral cortex, MD activation is most prominent in the caudate and cerebellum. Comparison with canonical resting state networks shows MD regions concentrated in the fronto-parietal network but also engaging three other networks. MD activations show modest relative task preferences accompanying strong co-recruitment. With distributed anatomical organization, mosaic functional preferences, and strong interconnectivity, we suggest MD regions are well positioned to integrate and assemble the diverse components of cognitive operations. Our precise delineation of MD regions provides a basis for refined analyses of their functions.",

    "abstract": "When exposed to fluctuating light intensity, chloroplasts move towards weak light (accumulation response), and away from strong light (avoidance response). In addition, cold treatment (5{degrees}C) induces the avoidance response even under weak light conditions (cold-avoidance response). These three responses are mediated by the phototropin (phot), which is a blue-light photoreceptor and has also been found to act as a thermosensory protein that perceives temperature variation. Our previous report indicated that cold-induced changes in phot biochemical activity initiate the cold-avoidance response. In this study, we further explored the induction mechanism of the cold-avoidance response in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha and examined the relationship between changes in the amount of phot and the induction of the cold-avoidance response. The switch between the accumulation and avoidance responses occurs at a so-called  transitional light intensity. Our physiological experiments revealed that a cold-mediated decrease in the transitional light intensity leads to the induction of the cold-avoidance response. While artificial overexpression of phot decreased the transitional light intensity as much as cold treatment did, the amount of endogenous phot remained unchanged by cold treatment in wild-type M. polymorpha. Taken together, these findings show that the cold-avoidance response is initiated by a cold-mediated reduction of the transitional light intensity, independent of the amount of endogenous phot. This study provides a clue to understand the mechanism underlying the switch in direction of chloroplast relocation in response to light and temperature.",

    "abstract": "The development of soybean varieties with higher seed protein concentration has been hindered by a negative correlation between seed protein concentration and yield. Benning HP, a genotype that breaks this tradeoff, contains a high protein allele introgressed into the cultivar Benning. Because seed protein is thought to be limited by N, field and growth chamber experiments were performed to identify the N flux(es) that enable Benning HPs increased seed protein without a yield penalty. When the N source was completely controlled in growth chambers, Benning HP was able to fix more N than its recurrent parent, but this response depended on the strain of the rhizobia symbiont and was not observed at all developmental stages. In the field, Benning HP remobilized N from its leaves at a higher rate during seed fill, but this response was only observed in one of the years studied. These results demonstrate that Benning HP has higher potential for N fixation and N remobilization from vegetative tissue compared to its lower protein recurrent parent, but those traits are not consistently expressed and may depend on environmental and sink control.",

    "abstract": "Main conclusion pRbcS-T1 and pMALD1, two new trichome-specific promoters of Nicotiana tabacum, were identified and their strength and specificity were compared to those of previously described promoters in this species.\n\nNicotiana tabacum has emerged as a suitable host for metabolic engineering of terpenoids and derivatives in tall glandular trichomes, which actively synthesize and secrete specialized metabolites. However, implementation of an entire biosynthetic pathway in glandular trichomes requires the identification of trichome-specific promoters to appropriately drive the expression of the transgenes needed to set up the desired pathway. In this context, RT-qPCR analysis was carried out on wild-type N. tabacum plants to compare the expression pattern and gene expression level of NtRbcS-T1 and NtMALD1, two newly identified genes expressed in glandular trichomes, with those of NtCYP71D16, NtCBTS2, NtCPS2, and NtLTP1, which were reported in the literature to be specifically expressed in glandular trichomes. We show that NtRbcS-T1 and NtMALD1 are specifically expressed in glandular trichomes like NtCYP71D16, NtCBTS2, and NtCPS2, while NtLTP1 is also expressed in other leaf tissues as well as in the stem. Transcriptional fusions of each of the six promoters to the GUS-VENUS reporter gene were introduced in N. tabacum by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Almost all transgenic lines displayed GUS activity in tall glandular trichomes, indicating that the appropriate cis regulatory elements were included in the selected promoter regions. However, unlike for the other promoters, no trichome-specific line was obtained for pNtLTP1:GUS-VENUS, thus in agreement with the RT-qPCR data. These data thus provide two new transcription promoters that could be used in metabolic engineering of glandular trichomes.",

    "abstract": "The cortical areas that process disparity-defined motion-in-depth (i.e. cyclopean stereomotion) were characterised with functional magnetic resonance imaging in two awake, behaving macaques. The experimental protocol was similar to previous human neuroimaging studies. We contrasted the responses to dynamic random-dot patterns that continuously changed their binocular disparity over time with those to a control condition that shared the same properties, except that the temporal frames were shuffled. A whole-brain voxel-wise analysis revealed that in all four cortical hemispheres, three areas showed consistent sensitivity to cyclopean stereomotion. Two of them were localised respectively in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus (CSMSTS) and on the neighbouring infero-temporal gyrus (CSMITG). The third area was situated in the posterior parietal cortex (CSMPPC). Additional ROIs-based analyses within retinotopic areas defined in both animals indicated weaker but significant responses to cyclopean stereomotion within the MT cluster (most notably in areas MSTv and FST). Altogether, our results are in agreement with previous findings in both human and macaque and suggest that the cortical networks that process cyclopean stereomotion is relatively well preserved between the two primate species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSchizophrenia is a complex disorder in which the causal relations between risk genes and observed clinical symptoms are not well understood and the explanatory gap is too wide to be clarified without considering an intermediary level. Thus, we aimed to test the hypothesis of a pathway from molecular polygenic influence to clinical presentation occurring via deficits in reinforcement learning.\n\nMethodsWe administered a reinforcement learning task (Go/NoGo) that measures reinforcement learning and the effect of Pavlovian bias on decision making. We modelled the behavioural data with a hierarchical Bayesian approach (hBayesDM) to decompose task performance into its underlying learning mechanisms. Study 1 included controls (n= 29, F|M=0.81), At Risk Mental State for psychosis (ARMS, n= 23, F|M=0.35) and FEP (First-episode psychosis, n= 26, F|M=0.18). Study 2 included healthy adolescents (n= 735, F|M= 1.06), 390 of whom had their polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia (PRSs) calculated.\n\nResultsPatients with FEP showed significant impairments in overriding Pavlovian conflict, a lower learning rate and a lower sensitivity to both reward and punishment. Less widespread deficits were observed in ARMS. PRSs did not significantly predict performance on the task in the general population, which only partially correlated with measures of psychopathology.\n\nConclusionsReinforcement learning deficits are observed in first episode psychosis and, to some extent, in those at clinical risk for psychosis, and were not predicted by molecular genetic risk for schizophrenia in healthy individuals. The study does not support the role of reinforcement learning as an intermediate phenotype in psychosis.",

    "abstract": "The development of new drugs is costly, time consuming, and often accompanied with safety issues. Drug repurposing can avoid the expensive and lengthy process of drug development by finding new uses for already approved drugs. In order to repurpose drugs effectively, it is useful to know which proteins are targeted by which drugs. Computational models that estimate the interaction strength of new drug--target pairs have the potential to expedite drug repurposing. Several models have been proposed for this task. However, these models represent the drugs as strings, which is not a natural way to represent molecules. We propose a new model called GraphDTA that represents drugs as graphs and uses graph neural networks to predict drug--target affinity. We show that graph neural networks not only predict drug--target affinity better than non-deep learning models, but also outperform competing deep learning methods. Our results confirm that deep learning models are appropriate for drug--target binding affinity prediction, and that representing drugs as graphs can lead to further improvements.\n\nAvailability of data and materialsThe proposed models are implemented in Python.

In this work, we show that the widely-conserved bacterial HOCl resistance enzyme RclA catalyzes the reduction of copper (II) to copper (I), and specifically protects E. coli against the combination of HOCl and intracellular copper, probably by preventing Cu(III) accumulation. E. coli lacking RclA were highly sensitive to HOCl and were defective in colonizing an animal host.

    "abstract": "The high proportion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria make it a highly effective barrier to small molecules, antibiotic drugs, and other antimicrobial agents. Given this vital role in protecting bacteria from potentially hostile environments, simulations of LPS bilayers and outer membrane systems represent a critical tool for understanding the mechanisms of bacterial resistance and the development of new antibiotic compounds that circumvent these defenses. The basis of these simulations are parameterizations of LPS, which have been developed for all major molecular dynamics force fields. However, these parameterizations differ in both the protonation state of LPS as well as how LPS membranes behave in the presence of various ion species. To address these discrepancies and understand the effects of phosphate charge on bilayer properties, simulations were performed for multiple distinct LPS chemotypes with different ion parameterizations in both protonated or deprotonated lipid A states. These simulations show that bilayer properties, such as the area per lipid and inter-lipid hydrogen bonding, are highly influenced by the choice of phosphate group charges, cation type, and ion parameterization, with protonated LPS and monovalent cations with modified nonbonded parameters providing the best match to experiments. Additionally, alchemical free energy simulations were performed to determine theoretical pKa values for LPS, and subsequently validated by 31P solid-state NMR experiments. Results from these complementary computational and experimental studies demonstrate that the protonated state dominates at physiological pH, contrary to the deprotonated form modeled by many LPS force fields. In all, these results highlight the sensitivity of LPS simulations to phosphate charge and ion parameters, while offering recommendations for how existing models should be updated for consistency between force fields as well as to best match experiments.",

However, there is no evidence of the formation or physiological function of the purinosome in the brain. Here, we showed that a signal transduction ATPases with numerous domains (STAND) protein, NACHT and WD repeat domain-containing 1 (Nwd1), interacted with Paics, a purine-synthesizing enzyme, to regulate purinosome assembly in NSPCs. Altered Nwd1 expression affected purinosome formation and induced the mitotic exit and premature differentiation of NSPCs, repressing neuronal migration and periventricular heterotopia. Overexpression/knockdown of Paics or Fgams, other purinosome enzymes, in the developing brain resulted in a phenocopy of Nwd1 defects.

High degree of data sparsity in biological high-throughput single-cell data is generally handled with imputation methods that complete the data, but specific methods for scChIP-seq are lacking. We present SIMPA, a scChIP-seq data imputation method leveraging predictive information within bulk data from ENCODE to impute missing protein-DNA interacting regions of target histone marks or transcription factors.\n\nResultsImputations using machine learning models trained for each single cell, each target, and each genomic region accurately preserve cell type clustering and improve pathway-related gene identification on real data. Results on simulated data show that 100 input genomic regions are already enough to train single-cell specific models for the imputation of thousands of undetected regions. Furthermore, SIMPA enables the interpretation of machine learning models by revealing interaction sites of a given single cell that are most important for the imputation model trained for a specific genomic region. The corresponding feature importance values derived from promoter-interaction profiles of H3K4me3, an activating histone mark, highly correlate with co-expression of genes that are present within the cell-type specific pathways. An imputation method that allows the interpretation of the underlying models facilitates users to gain an even deeper understanding of individual cells and, consequently, of sparse scChIP-seq datasets.\n\nAvailability and implementationOur interpretable imputation algorithm was implemented in Python and is available at https://github.com/salbrec/SIMPA",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThere is a body of evidence that the aging immune system is linked to cancer. Here, we hypothesized that ubiquitination might play a key gatekeeper role in immune system aging and tumorigenesis in CRC. Therefore, we will systematically study the DNA methylation of ubiquitination genes and screen candidate CRC marker that are correlated with both aging and immune cell compositions.\n\nDesignThrough aging- and immune-related DNA methylation data, we investigated the DNA methylation regulation changes in promoters with other regions of genes during aging and their association with the immune cell proportion in the circulating whole blood of healthy individuals. Then, by collecting a cohort of 100 colon cancer patients and 50 healthy individuals, we used nucleic acid mass spectrometry to test whether ubiquitination genes can be used as candidate markers for the early screening of CRC.\n\nResultsThe biological analyses for aging- and CD4 T cell proportion-derived differential genes showed that they are associated with ubiquitination. Among them, DZIP3 was significantly associated with both aging (P-value = 3.86E-06) and CD4 T cell proportion (P-value = 1.97E-05) in circulating blood. Then, we validated that the 1st exon DNA methylation of DZIP3 could predict the onset of early stage CRC (AUC = 0.833, OR = 8.82) and all pTNM stages of CRC (AUC = 0.782, OR = 5.70).\n\nConclusionsThe epigenetically regulated ubiquitination plays an important role in immune aging and tumorigenesis.

    "abstract": "Cortical function critically depends on inhibitory/excitatory balance. GABAergic cortical inhibitory interneurons (cINs) are born in the ventral forebrain. After completing their migration into cortex, their final numbers are adjusted-during a period of postnatal development - by programmed cell death (PCD). The mechanisms that regulate cIN elimination remain controversial. Here we show that genes in the protocadherin (Pcdh)-{gamma} gene cluster, but not in the Pcdh- or Pcdh-{beta} clusters, are required for survival of cINs through a BAX-dependent mechanism. Surprisingly, the physiological and morphological properties of Pcdh-{gamma} deficient and wild type cINs during PCD were indistinguishable. Co-transplantation of wild type and Pcdh-{gamma} deficient interneuron precursor cells demonstrate that: 1) the number of mutant cINs eliminated was much higher than that of wild type cells, but the proportion of mutant or WT cells undergoing cell death was not affected by their density; 2) the presence of mutant cINs increases cell death among wild-type counterparts, and 3) cIN survival is dependent on the expression of Pcdh-{gamma} C3, C4, and C5. We conclude that Pcdh-{gamma}, and specifically {gamma}C3, {gamma}C4, and {gamma}C5, play a critical role in regulating cIN survival during the endogenous period of PCD.\n\nSignificanceGABAergic cortical inhibitory interneurons (cINs) in the cerebral cortex originate from the ventral embryonic forebrain. After a long migration, they come together with local excitatory neurons to form cortical circuits. These circuits are responsible for higher brain functions, and the improper balance of excitation/inhibition in the cortex can result in mental diseases. Therefore, an understanding of how the final number of cINs is determined is both biologically and, likely, therapeutically significant. Here we show that cell surface homophilic binding proteins belonging to the clustered protocadherin gene family, specifically three isoforms in the Pcdh-{gamma} cluster, play a key role in the regulation cIN programmed cell death. Co-transplantation of mutant and wild-type cINs shows that Pcdh-{gamma} genes have cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous roles in the regulation of cIN cell death. This work will help identify the molecular mechanisms and cell-cell interactions that determine how the proper ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons is determined in the cerebral cortex.",

    "abstract": "Genetic factors that influence etiologic mechanisms shared across cancers could affect the risk of multiple cancer types. We investigated polygenic risk score (PRS)-specific pleiotropy across 17 cancers in two large population-based cohorts. The study population included European ancestry individuals from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging cohort (16,012 cases, 50,552 controls) and the UK Biobank (48,969 cases, 359,802 controls). We selected known independent risk variants from published GWAS to construct a PRS for each cancer type. Within cohorts, each PRS was evaluated in multivariable logistic regression models with respect to the cancer for which it was developed and each other cancer type. Results were then meta-analyzed across cohorts. In the UK Biobank, each PRS was additionally evaluated relative to 20 cancer risk factors or biomarkers. All PRS replicated associations with their corresponding cancers (p<0.05). Eleven cross-cancer associations - ten positive and one inverse - were found after correction for multiple testing (p<0.05/17=0.0029). Two cancer pairs showed bidirectional associations; the melanoma PRS was positively associated with oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer and vice versa, whereas the lung cancer PRS was positively associated with oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer, and the oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer PRS was inversely associated with lung cancer. We identified 65 associations between a cancer PRS and non-cancer phenotype. In this study examining cross-cancer PRS associations in two cohorts unselected for phenotype, we validated known and uncovered novel patterns of pleiotropy. Our results have the potential to inform investigations of risk prediction, shared etiology, and precision cancer prevention strategies.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEBy examining cross-cancer polygenic risk score associations, we validated known and uncovered novel patterns of pleiotropy.

    "abstract": "S-Acylation of the SNARE protein SNAP25 is mediated by a subset of Golgi zDHHC enzymes, in particular zDHHC17. The ankyrin repeat (ANK) domain of this enzyme interacts with a short linear motif known as the zDHHC ANK binding motif (zDABM) in SNAP25 (112-VVASQP-117), which is downstream of the S-acylated cysteine-rich domain (85-CGLCVCPC-92). In this study, we have investigated the importance of the flexible linker (amino acids 93-111; referred to as the \"mini-linker\" region) that separates the zDABM and S-acylated cysteines. Shortening the mini-linker had no effect of zDHHC17 interaction but blocked S-acylation. Insertion of additional flexible glycine-serine repeats had no effect on S-acylation, whereas extended and rigid alanine-proline repeats perturbed this process. Indeed, a SNAP25 mutant in which the mini-linker region was substituted with a flexible glycine-serine linker of the same length underwent efficient S-acylation. Furthermore, this mutant displayed the same intracellular localisation as wild-type SNAP25, showing that the sequence of the mini-linker is not important in this context. By using the results of previous peptide array experiments, we generated a SNAP25 mutant predicted to have a higher affinity zDABM, and this mutant showed enhanced interaction with zDHHC17 in cells. Interestingly, this mutant was S-acylated with reduced efficiency, implying that a lower affinity interaction of the SNAP25 zDABM with zDHHC17 is optimal for S-acylation efficiency. Overall, the results of this study show that amino acids 93-111 in SNAP25 act as a flexible molecular spacer to ensure efficient coupling of enzyme-substrate interaction and S-acylation.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular trafficking of organelles, driven by kinesin-1 stepping along microtubules, underpins essential processes including neuronal activity. In absence of other proteins on the microtubule surface, kinesin-1 performs micron-long runs. Under protein crowding conditions, however, kinesin-1 motility is drastically impeded. It is thus unclear how kinesin-1 acts as an efficient transporter in crowded intracellular environments. Here, we demonstrate that TRAK1 (Milton), an adaptor protein essential for mitochondrial trafficking, activates kinesin-1 and increases its robustness of stepping in protein crowding conditions. Interaction with TRAK1 i) facilitated kinesin-1 navigation around obstacles, ii) increased the probability of kinesin-1 passing through cohesive envelopes of tau and iii) increased the run length of kinesin-1 in cell lysate. We explain the enhanced motility by the observed direct interaction of TRAK1 with microtubules, providing an additional anchor for the kinesin-1-TRAK1 complex. We propose adaptor-mediated tethering as a mechanism regulating kinesin-1 motility in various cellular environments.",

Here, I used a meta-analysis of 139 extant Tara ocean seawater samples from 68 locations across to globe with information on prokaryotic taxonomy on species level from 16S metabarcoding and functionality of prokaryotes on eggNOG gene family level from metagenomes to unveil the relationship between taxonomy and functionality, and to predict the global distribution of functionality. Functional richness showed a statistically significant increase with increasing species richness (P <0.0001, R2 =0.64) and increasing species diversity (P <0.0001, R2 =0.26) while functional diversity was similar across the different waters, ranging from 2.96 to 3.22. Globally, the highest functional richness was found in the Northern Pacific Ocean and in the North Atlantic Ocean, and decreased at extreme latitudes. Taken together, I unveil the relationship between taxonomy and functionality, and predict the global distribution of functional richness in prokaryotes inhabiting aquatic ecosystems, implying more pronounced effects in terrestrial ecosystems due to larger differences in environmental parameters especially for functional diversity.",

Recent large-scale transcriptomic assays seem to confirm this hypothesis, but a lack of morphological information has limited the identification of several known cell types. For example, parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs) comprise of a main transcriptomic cluster within all inhibitory cells. However, transcriptomics alone has not resolved the different morphological PV types that exist. To close this gap, we used single-cell RNA-seq in morphologically identified PV-INs, sampled from 10 days to 3 months-old mice and studied their transcriptomic states in the morphological, physiological, and developmental domains. Our findings reveal novel genes whose expression separately identify morphological types but corroborate an overall transcriptomic homogeneity among PV-INs. Surprisingly, morphological PV types display uniform cell adhesion molecule (CAM) profiles, suggesting that CAMs do not actively maintain their specificity of wiring after development. Finally, our results reveal a pronounced change of transcriptomic states between postnatal days 20 and 25, during which PV-INs display a rapid and unexpected onset of hemoglobin gene expression which remains stable in later development.",

However, it is poorly understood how they function in sunlight. The roles of UVR8 and CRYs were assessed in a factorial experiment with Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and photoreceptor mutants exposed to sunlight for 6 h or 12 h under five types of filters with cut-offs in UV and blue-light regions. Transcriptome-wide responses triggered by UV-B and UV-A wavelengths shorter than 350 nm (UV-Asw) required UVR8 whereas those induced by blue and UV-A wavelengths longer than 350 nm (UV-Alw) required CRYs. UVR8 modulated gene expression in response to blue light while lack of CRYs drastically enhanced gene expression in response to UV-B and UV-Asw. These results agree with our estimates of photons absorbed by these photoreceptors in sunlight and with in vitro monomerization of UVR8 by wavelengths up to 335 nm. Motif enrichment analysis predicted complex signaling downstream of UVR8 and CRYs.

    "abstract": "The proto-oncogene YAP /Yki, a transcription co-factor of the Hippo pathway, has been linked to many cancers. YAP interacts with DNA-binding TEAD/Sd proteins to regulate expression of its transcriptional targets. Disruption of YAP-TEAD therefore offers a potential therapeutic strategy. The mammalian Vestigial Like (VGLL) protein, specifically its TONDU domain, has been shown to competitively inhibit YAP-TEAD interaction and a TONDU peptide can suppress YAP-induced cancer. As TONDU could potentially be developed into a therapeutic peptide for multiple cancers, we evaluated its efficacy in Yki-driven adult Intestinal Stem Cell (ISC) tumors in Drosophila. We show that oral uptake of the TONDU peptide is highly effective at inhibiting Yki-driven gut tumors by suppressing YAP-TEAD interaction. Comparative proteomics of early and late stage Yki-driven ISC tumors revealed enrichment of a number of proteins, including members of the integrin signaling pathway, such as Talin, Vinculin and Paxillin. These, in turn displayed a decrease in their levels in TONDU-peptide treated tumors. Further, we show that Sd binds to the regulatory region of integrin-coding gene, mew, which codes for PS1, a key integrin of the ISCs. In support to a possible role of integrins in Yki-driven ISC tumors, we show that genetic downregulation of mew arrests Yki-driven ISC proliferation, reminiscent of the effects of TONDU peptide. Altogether, our findings present a novel platform for screening therapeutic peptides and provide insights into tumor suppression mechanisms.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDiscovering novel strategies to inhibit oncogene activity is a priority in cancer biology. As signaling pathways are widely conserved between mammals and Drosophila, these questions can be effectively addressed in this model organism. Here, we show that progression of Drosophila Intestinal Stem Cell (ISC) tumors induced by gain of an oncogenic form of the transcription co-factor Yki can be suppressed by feeding a peptide corresponding to the conserved TONDU domain of Vestigial (Vg), which blocks binding of Yki to the Sd transcription factor. Further, we show that down regulation of the integrin signaling pathway is causally linked to TONDU-peptide-mediated ISC tumor suppression. Our findings reveal that Drosophila can be successfully used to screen peptides for their therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian male-specific Y chromosome plays a critical role in sex determination and male fertility. However, because of its repetitive and haploid nature, it is frequently absent from genome assemblies and remains enigmatic. The Y chromosomes of great apes represent a particular puzzle: their gene content is more similar between human and gorilla than between human and chimpanzee, even though human and chimpanzee shared a more recent common ancestor. To solve this puzzle, here we constructed a dataset including Ys from all extant great ape genera. We generated assemblies of bonobo and orangutan Ys, from short and long sequencing reads, and aligned them with the publicly available human, chimpanzee and gorilla Y assemblies. Analyzing this dataset, we found that the genus Pan, including chimpanzee and bonobo, experienced accelerated substitution rates. Additionally, Pan also exhibited elevated gene death rates. These observations are consistent with high levels of sperm competition in Pan. Furthermore, we inferred that the great ape common ancestor already possessed multi-copy sequences homologous to most human and chimpanzee palindromes. Nonetheless, each species also acquired distinct ampliconic sequences. We also detected increased chromatin contacts between and within palindromes (from Hi-C data), likely facilitating gene conversion and structural rearrangements. Moreover, our ENCODE data analysis suggested that Y palindromes exist to promote gene conversion preventing degradation of not only genes, as is commonly believed, but also gene regulatory sites. Our results highlight the dynamic mode of Y chromosome evolution, and open avenues for studies of male-specific dispersal in endangered great ape species.",

    "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder triggered by the exposure to a traumatic event that manifests with anguish, intrusive memories and negative mood changes. So far, there is no efficient treatment for PTSD other than symptomatic palliative care. Based on the implication of the functional amyloid cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein-3 (CPEB3) in the consolidation of memory, we propose its active amyloid state as a possible therapeutic target by blocking the consolidation of traumatic memories through polyglutamine binding peptide 1 (QBP1), an inhibitor of the amyloid oligomerization previously investigated in Drosophila.\n\nTo test this idea in mammals, here we have developed a transgenic mouse that constitutively expresses QBP1 peptide. We first assessed the innocuousness of this peptide for the normal development of the animal, which also showed normal locomotor activity and anxiety. By performing a battery of standard memory paradigms, we then showed that hippocampal-dependent and aversive memories were impaired in the QBP1 mice. Furthermore, protein expression in the hippocampi of experienced mice showed that QBP1 mice do not increase their levels of amyloid oligomerization, evincing the blockade of the CPEB3 protein in its inactive state. The ability of QBP1 to block aversive memories in mice represents the proof of concept of a novel pharmacological approach for prophylaxis and therapy of acute stress and post-traumatic stress disorders.",

    "abstract": "COPA syndrome is a recently described Mendelian autoimmune disorder caused by missense mutations in the Coatomer protein complex subunit alpha (COPA) gene. Patients with COPA syndrome develop arthritis and lung disease that presents as pulmonary hemorrhage or interstitial lung disease (ILD). Immunosuppressive medications can stabilize the disease, but many patients develop progressive pulmonary fibrosis that requires life-saving measures such as lung transplantation. Because very little is understood about the pathogenesis of COPA syndrome, it has been difficult to devise effective treatments for patients. To date, it remains unknown which cell types are critical for mediating the disease as well as the mechanisms that lead to autoimmunity. To explore these issues, we generated a CopaE241K/+ germline knock-in mouse bearing one of the same Copa missense mutations in patients. Mutant mice spontaneously developed ILD that mirrors lung pathology in patients, as well as elevations of activated cytokine-secreting T cells. Here we show that mutant Copa in epithelial cells of the thymus impairs the thymic selection of T cells and results in both an increase in autoreactive T cells and decrease in regulatory T cells in peripheral tissues. We demonstrate that T cells from CopaE241K/+ mice are pathogenic and cause ILD through adoptive transfer experiments. In conclusion, we establish a new mouse model of COPA syndrome to identify a previously unknown function for Copa in thymocyte selection and demonstrate that a defect in central tolerance is a putative mechanism by which COPA mutations lead to autoimmunity in patients.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA new mouse model of COPA syndrome develops lung pathology that recapitulates patients and reveals that T cells are important drivers of the disease.",

Here, we investigate how T cells arrive at these states during an immune response. In order to understand the metabolic state of rare, early activated T cells, we adapted mass cytometry to quantify metabolic regulators at single-cell resolution in parallel with cell signaling, proliferation, and effector function. We interrogated CD8 T cell activation in vitro as well as the trajectory of CD8 T cells responding to Listeria monocytogenes infection, a well-characterized in vivo model for studies of T cell differentiation. This approach revealed a unique metabolic state in early activated T cells characterized by maximal expression of glycolytic and oxidative metabolic proteins. Peak utilization of both pathways was confirmed by extracellular flux analysis. Cells in this transient state were most abundant five days post-infection before rapidly downregulating metabolic protein expression. This approach should be useful for mechanistic investigations of metabolic regulation of immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Multiple distinct types of intracellular bacterial pathogens have been shown to alter the mechanics of their mammalian host cells to promote cell-to-cell spread. Conversely, host cells may respond by altering their own mechanical behavior to limit infection. We monitored epithelial cell monolayers sparsely infected with the intracellular bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes or Rickettsia parkeri over the course of several days. Under conditions where these pathogens were able to trigger innate immune signaling through the NF-{kappa}B pathway and to use actin-based motility to spread non-lytically from cell to cell, domains of infected cells formed enormous three-dimensional mounds, where uninfected cells surrounding the infected cells became stiffer and actively moved toward the site of infection, collectively squeezing the softer and weaker infected cells up and ejecting them from the epithelial monolayer. Bacteria in mounds were less able to spread laterally in the monolayer, limiting the growth of the focus, while mounded cells eventually underwent cell death. Cells in infected monolayers exhibited behavioral and molecular signatures of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), such that coordinated forceful action by uninfected bystander cells actively eliminated large domains of infected cells, consistent with the hypothesis that this collective cell response represents an innate immune response.",

    "abstract": "Many modern problems in medicine and public health leverage machine learning methods to predict outcomes based on observable covariates [1, 2, 3, 4]. In an increasingly wide array of settings, these predicted outcomes are used in subsequent statistical analysis, often without accounting for the distinction between observed and predicted outcomes [1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. We call inference with predicted outcomes post-prediction inference. In this paper, we develop methods for correcting statistical inference using outcomes predicted with an arbitrary machine learning method. Rather than trying to derive the correction from the first principles for each machine learning tool, we make the observation that there is typically a low-dimensional and easily modeled representation of the relationship between the observed and predicted outcomes. We build an approach for the post-prediction inference that naturally fits into the standard machine learning framework where the data is divided into training, testing, and validation sets. We train the prediction model in the training set, estimate the relationship between the observed and predicted outcomes on the testing set, and use that model of the relationship to correct inference on the validation set and subsequent statistical models. We show our postpi approach can correct bias and improve variance estimation (and thus subsequent statistical inference) with predicted outcome data. To show the broad range of applicability of our approach, we show postpi can improve inference in two totally distinct fields: modeling predicted phenotypes in re-purposed gene expression data [10] and modeling predicted causes of death in verbal autopsy data [11]. We have made our method available through an open-source R package: [https://github.com/leekgroup/postpi]",

Since SARS- CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019-nCoV.",

Here, we report that post-translational lipidation of newly synthesized proteins in axonal compartments allows for short-term and autonomous responses to extrinsic cues. Using conditional mutant mice, we found that protein prenylation is essential for sympathetic axon innervation of target organs. We identify a localized requirement for prenylation in sympathetic axons to promote axonal growth in response to the neurotrophin, Nerve Growth Factor (NGF). NGF triggers prenylation of proteins including the Rac1 GTPase in axons, counter to the canonical view of prenylation as constitutive, and strikingly, in a manner dependent on axonal protein synthesis. Newly prenylated proteins localize to TrkA-harboring endosomes in axons, and promote receptor trafficking necessary for axonal growth. Thus, coupling of prenylation to local protein synthesis presents a mechanism for spatially segregated cellular functions during neuronal development.",

However, sample handling and conservation of sample integrity during lengthy staining and acquisition protocols remains a challenge. This study overcomes these challenges with acrylamide hydrogels synthesised to match the refractive index of solutions typically utilised in aqueous tissue clearing protocols. These hydrogels have a high-water content (82.0{+/-}3.7% by weight). The gels are stable over time and FITC-IgG readily permeated into, and effluxed out of them. Whilst the gels deformed and/or swelled over time in some commonly used solutions, this was overcome by using a previously described custom refractive index matched solution. To validate their use, CUBIC cleared mouse tissues and whole embryos were embedded in hydrogels, stained using fluorescent small molecule dyes, labels and antibodies and successfully imaged using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. In conclusion, the high-water content, high refractive index hydrogels described in this study have a broad applicability to research that delves into pathophysiological processes by stabilising and protecting large and fragile samples.",

    "abstract": "PIM1 is an oncogenic serine/threonine kinase that promotes and maintains prostate tumorigenesis. To more fully understand the mechanism by which PIM1 promotes oncogenesis, we performed a chemical genetic screen to identify direct PIM1 substrates in prostate cancer cells. The PIM1 substrates we identified were involved in a variety of oncogenic processes, and included N-Myc Downstream-Regulated Gene 1 (NDRG1), which has reported roles in the suppression of cancer cell invasion and metastasis. NDRG1 is phosphorylated by PIM1 at serine 330 (pS330), and the level of NDRG1 pS330 is associated with high grade compared to low grade prostate tumors. While NDRG1 pS330 is largely cytoplasmic, total NDRG1 is both cytoplasmic and nuclear. Mechanistically, PIM1 phosphorylation of NDRG1 decreases its stability, reducing its interaction with AR, and thereby lowering expression of AR target genes. PIM1-dependent NDRG1 phosphorylation also reduces NDRG1s ability to suppress prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Our study identifies a novel set of PIM1 substrates in prostate cancer cells using a direct, unbiased chemical genetic screen. It also provides key insights into the mechanisms by which PIM1-mediated phosphorylation of NDRG1 impairs its function, resulting in enhanced cell migration and invasion.",

Reporter assays combined with genetic studies imply that mitophagy both initiates and is completed in Drp1 impaired neurons, but fails to complete in Vps13D impaired neurons, which accumulate compromised mitochondria within stalled mito-phagophores.

    "abstract": "Current methods for detecting, accurately quantifying, and profiling complex microbial communities based on the microbial 16S rRNA marker genes are limited by a number of factors, including inconsistent extraction of microbial nucleic acids, amplification interference from contaminants and host DNA, different coverage of PCR primers utilized for quantification and sequencing, and potentially biases in PCR amplification rates among microbial taxa during amplicon barcoding. Here, we describe a single-step method that enables the quantification of microbial 16S rRNA gene DNA copies with wide dynamic range and broad microbial diversity, and simultaneous amplicon barcoding for quantitative 16S rRNA gene amplicon profiling of microbiota. The method is suitable for a variety of sample types and is robust in samples with low microbial abundance, including samples containing high levels of host mammalian DNA, as is common in human clinical samples. We demonstrate that our modification to the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) V4 16S rRNA gene primers expands their microbial coverage while dramatically reducing non-specific mammalian mitochondrial DNA amplification, thus achieving wide dynamic range in microbial quantification and broad coverage for capturing high microbial diversity in samples with or without high host DNA background. The approach relies only on broadly available hardware (real-time PCR instruments) and standard reagents utilized for conventional 16S rRNA gene amplicon library preparation both of which make it amenable for immediate and widespread adoption. Simultaneous 16S rRNA gene DNA copy quantification and amplicon barcoding for multiplexed next-generation sequencing from the same analyzed sample, performed in a combined workflow, reduces the amount of sample needed and reduces time and reagent costs. Additionally, we demonstrate that using our modified 16S rRNA gene primers in a digital PCR (dPCR) format enables precise and exact microbial quantification in samples with very high host DNA background levels without the need for quantification standards. Potential future applications of this approach include: (1) quantitative microbiome profiling in human and animal microbiome research; (2) detection of monoinfections and profiling of polymicrobial infections in tissues, stool, and bodily fluids in human and veterinary medicine; (3) environmental sample analyses (e.g., soil and water); and (4) broad-coverage detection of microbial food contamination in products high in mammalian DNA, such as meat products. We predict that utilization of this approach primarily for quantitative microbiome profiling will be invaluable to microbiome studies, which have historically been limited to analysis of relative abundances of microbes.",

    "abstract": "Caveolae, bulb-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane (PM), show distinct behaviors of scission and fusion at the cell surface. Although it is known that caveolae are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, exactly how lipid composition influences caveolae surface stability has not yet been elucidated. Accordingly, we inserted specific lipids into the PM of cells via membrane fusion and studied acute effects on caveolae dynamics. We demonstrate that cholesterol and glycosphingolipids specifically accumulate in caveolae, which decreases their neck diameter and drives their scission from the cell surface. The lipid-induced scission was counteracted by the ATPase EHD2. We propose that lipid accumulation in caveolae generates an intrinsically unstable domain prone to scission if not balanced by the restraining force of EHD2 at the neck. Our work advances the understanding of how lipids contribute to caveolae dynamics, providing a mechanistic link between caveolae and their ability to sense the PM lipid composition.\n\nSUMMARYCaveolae serve as mechanoprotectors and membrane buffers but their specific role in sensing plasma membrane lipid composition remains unclear. Hubert et al. show that cholesterol and glycosphingolipids accumulate in caveolae and drive subsequent scission from the cell surface. These results provide new insight into how lipids contribute to budding and scission of membrane domains in cells.",

    "abstract": "Toll like receptor (TLR) recruitment to phagosomes in dendritic cells (DCs) and downstream TLR signaling are essential to initiate antimicrobial immune responses. However, the mechanisms underlying TLR localization to phagosomes are poorly characterized. We show herein that phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase II (PI4KII) plays a key role in initiating phagosomal TLR4 responses in murine DCs by generating a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) platform conducive to the binding of the TLR sorting adaptor TIRAP. PI4KII is recruited to LPS-containing phagosomes in an adaptor protein AP-3 dependent manner, and both PI4KII and PtdIns4P are also detected on phagosomal membrane tubules. Knockdown of PI4KII - but not of the related PI4KII{beta} - impairs TIRAP and TLR4 localization to phagosomes, reduces proinflammatory cytokine secretion, and impairs phagosomal tubule formation and MHC-II presentation. Phagosomal TLR responses in PI4KII-deficient DCs are restored by re-expression of wild-type PI4KII, but not of variants lacking kinase activity or AP-3 binding. Our data indicate that PI4KII is an essential regulator of phagosomal TLR signaling in DCs by ensuring optimal TIRAP recruitment to phagosomes.",

While MS-based metabolomics assays are endowed with high-throughput and sensitivity, large-scale MWAS are doomed to long-term data acquisition generating an overtime-analytical signal drift that can hinder the uncovering of true biologically relevant changes.\n\nWe developed \"dbnorm\", a package in R environment, which allows visualization and removal of signal heterogeneity from large metabolomics datasets. \"dbnorm\" integrates advanced statistical tools to inspect dataset structure, at both macroscopic (sample batch) and microscopic (metabolic features) scales. To compare model performance on data correction, \"dbnorm\" assigns a score, which allows the straightforward identification of the best fitting model for each dataset. Herein, we show how \"dbnorm\" efficiently removes signal drift among batches to capture the true biological heterogeneity of data in two large-scale metabolomics studies.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the histone 3 gene (H3K27M) are the eponymous drivers in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) and other diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), aggressive pediatric brain cancers for which no curative therapy currently exists. The salient molecular consequence of these recurrent oncohistones is a global loss of repressive H3K27me3 residues and broad epigenetic dysregulation. In order to identify specific, therapeutically targetable epigenetic dependencies within this disease context, we performed an shRNA screen targeting 408 genes classified as epigenetic/chromatin-associated molecules in patient-derived DMG cultures. This approach identified AFF4, the scaffold protein of the super elongation complex (SEC), as a previously-undescribed dependency in DMG. Interrogation of SEC function demonstrated a key role for maintaining DMG cell viability and clonogenic potential while promoting self-renewal of DMG tumor stem cells. Small-molecule inhibition of the SEC with the highly-specific, clinically relevant CDK9 inhibitors atuveciclib and AZD4573 restores regulatory RNA polymerase II pausing, promotes cellular differentiation, and leads to potent anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models. These studies present a biologic rationale for translational exploration of CDK9 inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach in a disease which currently has no effective medical therapies.",

    "abstract": "Maternal effects are an important evolutionary force that may either facilitate adaptation to a new environment or buffer against unfavourable conditions. The degree of variation in traits expressed by siblings from different mothers is frequently sensitive to environmental conditions. This could generate a Maternal-by-Environment interaction (MxE) that could inflate estimates of Genotype-by-Environment effects (GxE). We aimed to test for environment-specific maternal effects (MxE) using a paternal full-sib/half-sib breeding design in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, where we split and reared offspring from the same mother on two different bean host types - original and novel. Our quantitative genetic analysis indicated that maternal effects were very small on both host types for all the measured life-history traits. There was also little evidence that maternal oviposition preference for a particular host type predicted her offsprings performance on that host. Further, additive genetic variance for most traits was relatively high on both hosts. While there was higher heritability for offspring reared in the novel host, there was no evidence for GxEs, and most cross-host genetic correlations were positive. This suggests that offspring from the same family ranked similarly for performance on both host types. Our results point to a genetic basis of host adaptation in the seed beetle, rather than maternal effects. Even so, we encourage researchers to test for potential MxEs because, due to a lack of testing, it remains unclear how often they arise.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia, intracellular endosymbionts, are estimated to infect about half of all arthropod species. These bacteria manipulate their hosts in various ways for their maximum benefits. The rising global temperature may accelerate species migration and, thus, horizontal transfer of Wolbachia may occur across species previously not in contact. We transinfected and then cured the alpine fly Drosophila nigrosparsa with Wolbachia strain wMel to study its effects on this species. We found low Wolbachia titer, possibly cytoplasmic incompatibility, and an increase in locomotion of both infected larvae and adults compared with cured ones. However, no change in fecundity, no impact on heat and cold tolerance, and no change in wing morphology were observed. Although Wolbachia increased locomotor activities in this species, we conclude that D. nigrosparsa may not benefit from the infection. Still, D. nigrosparsa can serve as a host for Wolbachia because vertical transmission is possible but may not be as high as in the native host of wMel, Drosophila melanogaster.",

    "abstract": "Determining which processes take place in the spatial distribution of bacterioplankton metacommunities has been a central goal of microbial ecology. In freshwater ecosystems, selection has been spotted as the main driver shaping bacterial community. However, its relative importance compared with others processes (dispersal, drift, diversification) may depend on spatial heterogeneity and dispersal rates within a metacommunity. Still, a decrease in the role of selection is expected with increasing dispersal homogenization. Here, we investigate the main ecological processes modulating the bacterial assembly in contrasting scenarios of environmental heterogeneity. We carried out a spatiotemporal survey in the floodplain system of Parana River. The bacterioplankton metacommunity was studied by a step-forward analysis combining different statistical inferences based on the phylogenetic and taxa turnover as well as co-occurrence networks. We found that selection was the main process even at both extremes of environmental heterogeneity and homogeneity, challenging the general view that the strength of selection is weakened due to dispersal homogenization. The ecological processes acting on the community also determined the complexity and randomness of bacterial networks. The heterogeneous selection promoted greater network complexity increasing the {beta}-diversity, and bacterial associations were more random with the increasing influence of stochasticity. Finally, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity was an important factor determining the number and identity of keystone taxa in the system. Integrating all these empirical evidences we propose a new conceptual model that elucidates how the environmental heterogeneity guides the action of ecological processes shaping the bacterial metacommunity.",

    "abstract": "A clear insight into large-scale community structure of planktonic copepods is critical to understanding mechanisms controlling diversity and biogeography of marine taxa, owing to their high abundance, ubiquity, and sensitivity to environmental changes. Here, we applied a 28S metabarcoding approach to large-scale communities of epipelagic and mesopelagic copepods at 70 stations across the Pacific Ocean and three stations in the Arctic Ocean. Major patterns of community structure and diversity, influenced by water mass structures, agreed with results from previous morphology-based studies. However, large-scale metabarcoding approach could detected community changes even under stable environmental conditions, including changes in the north/south subtropical gyres and east/west areas within each subtropical gyre. There were strong effects of epipelagic environment on mesopelagic communities, and community subdivisions were observed in the environmentally-stable mesopelagic layer. In each sampling station, higher operational taxonomic unit (OTU) numbers and lower phylogenetic diversity were observed in the mesopelagic layer than in the epipelagic layer, indicating a recent rapid increase of species numbers in the mesopelagic layer. The phylogenetic analysis utilizing representative sequences of OTUs revealed trends of recent emergence of cold-water OTUs mainly distributed at high latitudes with low water temperatures. Conversely, high diversity of copepods at low latitudes was suggested to have been formed through long evolutionary history under high water temperature. The metabarcoding results suggest that evolutionary processes have strong impacts on current patterns of copepod diversity, and support the \"out of the tropics\" theory explaining latitudinal diversity gradients of copepods. Both diversity patterns in epipelagic and mesopelagic showed high correlations to sea surface temperature; thus, predicted global warming may have a significant impact on copepod diversity in both layers.\n\nAuthor SummaryMarine planktonic copepods are highly dominant and diverse, and revealing their community structure and diversity is important to understanding marine ecosystems. We used molecular-based metabarcoding to reveal a total of 205 copepod communities in the  sunlight or epipelagic layer (0- 200 m) and the  twilight or mesopelagic layer (200-500 m and 500-1,000 m), mainly in the Pacific Ocean (data for 70 stations), but also in the Arctic Ocean (data for three stations). Different copepod communities were found in each geographical region with different environmental conditions, including tropical, subtropical, transition, Kuroshio Current, California Current, subarctic and arctic areas. The metabarcoding method sensitively detected small changes of copepod community even in environmentally-stable subtropical ocean systems and the mesopelagic layer. A high diversity of copepods was detected at low latitudes, and copepod diversity was higher in the mesopelagic layer than in the epipelagic layer in each area. These diversity patterns were influenced by both evolutionary history and present environmental conditions. The copepod community in the mesopelagic layer was strongly influenced by environmental conditions in the epipelagic layer. Thus, predicted climate changes may affect marine ecosystems not only in the epipelagic layer but also in the mesopelagic layer.",

    "abstract": "Among the first steps in inflammation is the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) stored in the cell membranes into leukotrienes. This occurs mainly in leukocytes and depends on the interaction of two proteins: 5-lipoxygenase (5LO), stored away from the nuclear membranes until use and 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), a transmembrane, homotrimeric protein, constitutively present in nuclear membrane. We could earlier visualize the binding of 5LO to nanodiscs in the presence of Ca2+-ions by the use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on samples negatively stained by sodium phosphotungstate. In the absence of Ca2+-ions 5LO did not bind to the membrane. In the present communication, FLAP reconstituted in the nanodiscs which could be purified if the His-tag was located on the FLAP C-terminus but not the N-terminus. Our aim was to find out if 1) 5LO would bind in a Ca2+-dependent manner also when FLAP is present? 2) Would the substrate (AA) have effects on 5LO binding to FLAP-nanodiscs? TEM was used to assess the complex formation between 5LO and FLAP-nanodiscs along with, sucrose gradient purification, gel-electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy. It was found that presence of AA by itself induces complex formation in the absence of added calcium. This finding corroborates that AA is necessary for the complex formation and that a Ca2+-flush is mainly needed for the recruitment of 5LO to the membrane. Our results also showed that the addition of Ca2+-ions promoted binding of 5LO on the FLAP-nanodiscs as was also the case for nanodiscs without FLAP incorporated. In the absence of added substances no 5LO-FLAP complex was formed. Another finding is that the formation of a 5LO-FLAP complex appears to induce fragmentation of 5LO in vitro.",
