    "abstract": "To increase our understanding of the inner working of cells, there is a need for specific markers to identify biomolecules, cellular structures and compartments. One type of markers comprises genetically encoded fluorescent probes that are linked with protein domains, peptides and/or signal sequences. These markers are encoded on a plasmid and they allow straightforward, convenient labeling of cultured mammalian cells by introducing the plasmid into the cells. Ideally, the fluorescent marker combines favorable spectroscopic properties (brightness, photostability) with specific labeling of the structure or compartment of interest. Here, we report our ongoing efforts to generate robust and bright genetically encoded fluorescent markers for highlighting structures and compartments in living cells.

    "abstract": "The Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) gene region is an imprinted gene complex involved in behavioral, metabolic and osteogenic functions. We have analyzed here the variation of two families of regulatory small nucleolar RNAs (SNORD115 and SNORD116) that are coded within the PWS and are expressed from the paternal chromosome. They are organized in two tandemly repeated clusters which are naturally copy number variable between individuals. We find that the copy numbers at these loci correlate with repeatable individual test scores for anxiety that are considered to constitute a component of the \"personality\" of individuals. We show this for different populations and species of mice, cavies and for the anxiety component of personality tests in humans. This is also the case for an inbred mouse strain (C57Bl6) implying that copy number variation creates phenotypic variability even in an isogenic background. In transcriptome data from brain samples of this strain we find SNORD copy-number correlated regulation of target genes that are known to be involved in influencing behavior. SNORD115 has previously been suggested to regulate splicing of the serotonin receptor Htr2c and we confirm this in our data. For SNORD116 we provide evidence that it regulates the expression level of the chromatin regulator Ankrd11, which itself regulates GABA receptors, metabolic pathways, cell differentiation and osteogenesis. Intriguingly, we find that craniofacial shapes in mice correlate also with SNORD116 copy numbers. New copy number variants are generated at very high rates in mice, possibly at every generation, explaining why conventional genetic mapping could not detect this association. Our results suggest that the variable dosage of two regulatory RNAs are major determinants of individual behavioral differences and correlated traits in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Leaf angle (LA) is one of the most important canopy architecture related traits of maize (Zea mays L.). Currently, there is an urgent need to elucidate the genetic mechanism of LA at canopy-wide levels for optimizing dense-planting canopy architecture. In present study, one RIL population derived from two parent lines which show distinct plant architecture was used to perform QTL mapping for LA at eight leaves below the tassel under three environments. Dozens of QTL for LA at eight leaves were identified, which were mapped on all maize chromosomes except for the tenth chromosome. Among them, there were nine common QTL as they were identified for LA more than 1 leaves or in two or three environments. And individual QTL could explain 1.29% - 20.14% of the phenotypic variation and affect LA of 1-8 leaves, including qLA5.1 affected LA of all eight leaves, qLA3.1 affected LA of the upper leaves (1stLA to 4thLA), and qLA9.1 could affect LA of the lower leaves (5thLA to 8thLA). Furthermore, the results indicated that the genetic architecture of LA at eight leaves was different. Specifically, 8thLA was mainly affected by major and minor QTL; 1stLA, 4thLA and 5thLA were affected by epistatic interactions beside major and minor QTL; while the other four LAs were simultaneously affected by major QTL, minor QTL, epistatic interactions and environments. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of genetic basis of LA at canopy-wide levels, which will be beneficial to design ideal plant architecture under dense planting in maize.\n\nAuthor contribution statementJ.

From the mouse conceptus, Trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) are derived, which are in vitro analogues of early trophoblasts. Here, we show that TSCs contain plastic subpopulations reflecting developmental states ranging from pre- to post-implantation trophoblasts. However, upon exposure to a specific combination of embryonic inductive signals, TSCs globally acquire properties of pre-implantation polar trophoblasts (gene expression, self-renewal) juxtaposing the inner embryonic cells, and an enhanced, homogeneous epithelial phenotype. These lines of polar-like TSCs (pTSCs) represent a transcriptionally earlier state that more efficiently forms blastoids, whose inner embryonic cells then induce the patterning of gene expression along the embryonic-abembryonic axis. Altogether, delineating the requirements and properties of polar trophoblasts and blastocyst axis formation in vitro provides a foundation for the precise description and dissection of early development.",

We identify linked chromatin domains (CDs) composed of irregular [~]200-300-nm-wide aggregates of nucleosomes that can overlap with individual topologically associating domains and are distinct from a surrounding RNA-populated interchromatin region. High-content mapping uncovers confinement of cohesin and active histone modifications to surfaces and enrichment of repressive modifications towards the core of CDs in both hetero- and euchromatic regions. This nanoscale functional topography is temporarily relaxed in post-replicative chromatin, but remarkably persists after ablation of cohesin.

    "abstract": "BackgroundR-loop is a nucleic acid structure containing an RNA-DNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA. Recently, accumulated evidence showed that R-loops widely present in various organisms genomes and are involved in many physiological processes, including DNA replication, RNA transcription, and DNA repair. RNase H-like superfamily (RNHLS) domain-containing proteins, such as RNase H enzymes, are essential in restricting R-loop levels. However, little is known about the function and relationship of other RNHLS proteins on R-loop regulation, especially in plants.\n\nResultsIn this study, we characterized 6193 RNHLS proteins from 13 representative plant species and clustered these proteins into 27 clusters, among which reverse transcriptases and exonucleases are the two largest groups. Moreover, we found 691 RNHLS proteins in Arabidopsis with a conserved catalytic alpha-helix and beta-sheet motif. Interestingly, each of the Arabidopsis RNHLS proteins is composed of not only an RNHLS domain but also another different protein domain. Additionally, the RNHLS genes are highly expressed in different meristems and metabolic tissues, which indicate that the RNHLS proteins might play important roles in the development and maintenance of these tissues.\n\nConclusionsIn summary, we systematically analyzed RNHL proteins in plants and found that there are mainly 27 subclusters of them. Most of these proteins might be implicated in DNA replication, RNA transcription, and nucleic acid degradation. We classified and characterized the RNHLS proteins in plants, which may afford new insights into the investigation of novel regulatory mechanisms and functions of R-loops.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCRISPR-Cas9 has been developed as a therapeutic agent for various infectious and genetic diseases. In many clinically relevant applications, constitutively active CRISPR-Cas9 is delivered into human cells without a temporal control system. Excessive and prolonged expression CRISPR-Cas9 can lead to elevated off-target cleavage. The need for modulating CRISPR-Cas9 activity over the dimensions of time and dose has created the demand of developing CRISPR-Cas off-switches. Protein and small molecule-based CRISPR-Cas inhibitors have been reported in previous studies.\n\nResultsWe report the discovery of Cas9-inhibiting peptides from inoviridae bacteriophages. These peptides, derived from the periplasmic domain of phage major coat protein G8P (G8PPD), can inhibit the in vitro activity of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) proteins in an allosteric manner. Importantly, the inhibitory activity of G8PPD on SpCas9 is dependent on the order of guide RNA addition. Ectopic expression of full-length G8P (G8PFL) or G8PPD in human cells can inactivate the genome-editing activity of SpCas9 with minimum alterations of the mutation patterns. Furthermore, unlike the anti-CRISPR protein AcrII4A that completely abolishes the cellular activity of CRISPR-Cas9, G8P co-transfection can reduce the off-target activity of co-transfected SpCas9 while retaining its on-target activity.\n\nConclusionG8Ps discovered in the current study represent the first anti-CRISPR peptides that can allosterically inactivate CRISPR-Cas9.

    "abstract": "The human brain differs from that of other primates, but the genetic basis of these differences remains unclear. We investigated the evolutionary pressures acting on almost all human protein-coding genes (N=11,667; 1:1 orthologs in primates) based on their divergence from those of early hominins, such as Neanderthals, and non-human primates. We confirm that genes encoding brain-related proteins are among the most strongly conserved protein-coding genes in the human genome. Combining our evolutionary pressure metrics for the protein-coding genome with recent datasets, we found that this conservation applied to genes functionally associated with the synapse and expressed in brain structures such as the prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum. Conversely, several genes presenting signatures commonly associated with positive selection appear as causing brain diseases or conditions, such as micro/macrocephaly, Joubert syndrome, dyslexia, and autism. Among those, a number of DNA damage response genes associated with microcephaly in humans such as BRCA1, NHEJ1, TOP3A, and RNF168 show strong signs of positive selection and might have played a role in human brain size expansion during primate evolution. We also showed that cerebellum granule neurons express a set of genes also presenting signatures of positive selection and that may have contributed to the emergence of fine motor skills and social cognition in humans.

    "abstract": "Astrocytes have emerged for playing important roles in brain tissue repair, however the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that acute injury and blood-brain barrier disruption trigger the formation of a prominent mitochondrial-enriched compartment in astrocytic end-feet which enables vascular remodeling. Integrated imaging approaches revealed that this mitochondrial clustering is part of an adaptive response regulated by fusion dynamics. Astrocyte-specific conditional deletion of Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) suppressed perivascular mitochondrial clustering and disrupted mitochondria-ER contact sites. Functionally, two-photon imaging experiments showed that these structural changes were mirrored by impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake leading to abnormal cytosolic transients within end-feet in vivo. At the tissue level, a compromised vascular complexity in the lesioned area was restored by boosting mitochondrial-ER perivascular tethering in MFN2-deficient astrocytes. These data unmask a crucial role for mitochondrial dynamics in coordinating astrocytic local domains and have important implications for repairing the injured brain.",

Yet the mechanistic basis of this computation at the level of neuronal populations remains obscure. Here, we investigate tactile-auditory integration using two-photon Ca2+ imaging in the mouse primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices. Pairing sound with whisker stimulation modulates tactile responses in both S1 and S2, with the most prominent modulation being robust inhibition in S2. The degree of inhibition depends on tactile stimulation frequency, with lower frequency responses the most severely attenuated. Alongside these neurons, we identify sound-selective neurons in S2 whose responses are inhibited by high tactile frequencies. These results are consistent with a hypothesized local mutually-inhibitory S2 circuit that spectrally selects tactile versus auditory inputs. Our findings enrich mechanistic understanding of multisensory integration and suggest a key role for S2 in combining auditory and tactile information.",

    "abstract": "The development of new drugs is costly, time consuming, and often accompanied with safety issues. Drug repurposing can avoid the expensive and lengthy process of drug development by finding new uses for already approved drugs. In order to repurpose drugs effectively, it is useful to know which proteins are targeted by which drugs. Computational models that estimate the interaction strength of new drug--target pairs have the potential to expedite drug repurposing. Several models have been proposed for this task. However, these models represent the drugs as strings, which is not a natural way to represent molecules. We propose a new model called GraphDTA that represents drugs as graphs and uses graph neural networks to predict drug--target affinity. We show that graph neural networks not only predict drug--target affinity better than non-deep learning models, but also outperform competing deep learning methods. Our results confirm that deep learning models are appropriate for drug--target binding affinity prediction, and that representing drugs as graphs can lead to further improvements.\n\nAvailability of data and materialsThe proposed models are implemented in Python.

    "abstract": "Monkeys are able to learn the implied ordering of pairs of images drawn from an ordered set, without ever seeing all of the images simultaneously and without explicit spatial or temporal cues. The learning of implied order differs from learning of explicit visual or motor sequences. We recorded the activity of parietal neurons in rhesus macaques while they learned 7-item TI lists when only 2 items were presented on each trial. Behavior and ensemble neuronal activity were significantly influenced by the ordinal relationship of the stimulus pairs, specifically symbolic distance (the difference in rank) and joint ranks (the sum of the ranks). Symbolic distance strongly predicted decision accuracy, and learning was consistently faster as symbolic distance increased. An effect of joint rank on performance was also found nested within the symbolic distance effect. Across the population of neurons, there was significant modulation of firing correlated with the relative ranks of the two stimuli presented on each trial. Neurons exhibited selectivity for stimulus rank during learning, but not before or after. The observed behavior during learning is best explained by a virtual workspace model, not by associative or reward mechanisms. The neural data support a role for posterior parietal cortex in representing several variables that contribute to serial learning, particularly information about the ordinal ranks of the stimuli presented during a given trial. Thus, parietal cortex appears to belong to a neural substrate for learning and representing abstract relationships in a virtual workspace.",

Therefore, gold NPs exposure is hard to evaluate at the organ level with current measurement technology. The bio-distribution assay showed that intestine was the organ with most gold NPs accumulated in C. elegans. However, our data indicated that 62.8% of the significant altered genes were function in the nervous system using tissue enrichment analysis. Notably, developmental stage analysis has demonstrated that NP exposure interfered with the development of animals. Furthermore, the transcription factors DAF-16 was regulating the oxidative stress genes induced by gold NPs. Therefore, we proposed the localization of the oxidative stress genes in the neuron cells and how their expression affect neuron communication. Our results demonstrate that the gold NPs-induced oxidative stress affects the nervous system via physical damage to the neurons and disruption of cell-to-cell communication. Future toxicology research on gold NPs should focus on neurons.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/699785v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19effeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@db10d9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f4736org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ec2a52_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Temperatures in the Arctic are expected to increase dramatically over the next century, yet little is known about how microbial communities and their underlying metabolic processes will be affected by these environmental changes in freshwater sedimentary systems. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed sediments from Lake Hazen, NU Canada. Here, we exploit the spatial heterogeneity created by varying runoff regimes across the watershed of this uniquely large lake at these latitudes to test how a transition from low to high runoff, used as one proxy for climate change, affects the community structure and functional potential of dominant microbes. Based on metagenomic analyses of lake sediments along these spatial gradients, we show that increasing runoff leads to a decrease in taxonomic and functional diversity of sediment microbes. Our findings are likely to apply to other, smaller, glacierized watersheds typical of polar or high latitude / high altitudes ecosystems; we can predict that such changes will have far reaching consequences on these ecosystems by affecting nutrient biogeochemical cycling, the direction and magnitude of which are yet to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying both the amount and content of the information transferred between neuronal populations is crucial to understand brain functions. Traditional data-driven methods based on Wiener-Granger causality quantify information transferred between neuronal signals, but do not reveal whether transmission of information refers to one specific feature of external stimuli or another. Here, we developed a new measure called Feature-specific Information Transfer (FIT), that quantifies the amount of information transferred between neuronal signals about specific stimulus features. The FIT quantifies the feature-related information carried by a receiver that was previously carried by a sender, but that was never carried by the receiver earlier. We tested the FIT on simulated data in various scenarios. We found that, unlike previous measures, FIT successfully disambiguated genuine feature-specific communication from non-feature specific communication, from external confounding inputs and synergistic interactions. Moreover, the FIT had enhanced temporal sensitivity that facilitates the estimation of the directionality of transfer and the communication delay between neuronal signals. We validated the FITs ability to track feature-specific information flow using neurophysiological data. In human electroencephalographic data acquired during a face detection task, the FIT demonstrated that information about the eye in face pictures flowed from the hemisphere contralateral to the eye to the ipsilateral one. In multi-unit activity recorded from thalamic nuclei and primary sensory cortices of rats during multimodal stimulation, FIT, unlike Wiener-Granger methods, credibly detected both the direction of information flow and the sensory features about which information was transmitted. In human cortical high-gamma activity recorded with magnetoencephalography during visuomotor mapping, FIT showed that visuomotor-related information flowed from superior parietal to premotor areas. Our work suggests that the FIT measure has the potential to uncover previously hidden feature-specific information transfer in neuronal recordings and to provide a better understanding of brain communication.\n\nAuthor summaryThe emergence of coherent percepts and behavior relies on the processing and flow of information about sensory features, such as the color or shape of an object, across different areas of the brain. To understand how computations within the brain lead to the emergence of these functions, we need to map the flow of information about each specific feature. Traditional methods, such as those based on Wiener-Granger causality, quantify whether information is transmitted from one brain area to another, but do not reveal if the information being transmitted is about a certain feature or another feature. Here, we develop a new mathematical technique for the analysis of brain activity recordings, called Feature-specific Information Transfer (FIT), that can reveal not only if any information is being transmitted across areas, but whether or not such transmitted information is about a certain sensory feature. We validate the method with both simulated and real neuronal data, showing its power in detecting the presence of feature-specific information transmission, as well as the timing and directionality of this transfer. This work provides a tool of high potential significance to map sensory information processing in the brain.",

We developed a novel  sequence licking task in which mice directed their tongue to a target that moved through a series of locations. Mice could rapidly reconfigure the sequence online based on tactile feedback. Closed-loop optogenetics and electrophysiology revealed that tongue/jaw regions of somatosensory (S1TJ) and motor (M1TJ) cortex encoded and controlled tongue kinematics at the level of individual licks. Tongue premotor (anterolateral motor, ALM) cortex encoded intended tongue angle in a smooth manner that spanned individual licks and even whole sequences, and progress toward the reward that marked successful sequence execution. ALM activity regulated sequence initiation, but multiple cortical areas collectively controlled termination of licking.

    "abstract": "Artificial enzymes hold a great potential in the field of biotechnology. The currently available design strategies are limited to recruit and organise secondary and tertiary structural elements, and functional motifs of native enzymes. Here, we demonstrate an approach towards the bottom-up development of an artificial enzyme based on DNA nanotechnology. Structural analyses of the FlaI ATPase were used to identify a set of amino acids essential for the catalytic reaction. The selected amino acids were used to design four peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates (POCs). The POCs were integrated into a DNA nanostructure and reconstituted the catalytic site of FlaI. DNA origami technology was employed to maintain the relative orientations of the amino acids and their positions analogous to those in the protein catalytic site. The substrate turnover rates were found to be comparable in our artificial nanozyme (kcat = 0.3622 s-1) and the native enzyme (kcat {approx} 0.016 s-1). The nanozymes could be recycled using an ultrafiltration protocol and reused in multiple experiments allowing a reliable reproduction of the measurements. The emulation of enzymatic activity, by this novel and computable technological framework, can be of high relevance in many different areas.",

    "abstract": "The anterior thalamus is a key relay of neuronal signals within the limbic system. During sleep, the occurrence of hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), believed to mediate consolidation of explicit memories, is modulated by thalamocortical network activity, yet how information is routed around SWRs and how this communication depends on neuronal dynamics remains unclear. Here, by simultaneously recording ensembles of neurons in the anterior thalamus and local field potentials in the CA1 area of the hippocampus, we show that the head-direction (HD) cells of the anterodorsal nucleus are set in stable directions immediately before SWRs. This response contrasts with other thalamic cells that exhibit diverse couplings to the hippocampus related to their intrinsic dynamics but independent of their anatomical location. Thus, our data suggest a specific and homogeneous contribution of the HD signal to hippocampal activity and a diverse and cell-specific coupling of non-HD neurons.",

This hypothesis and associated underlying neural mechanisms remain underexplored. Here, we investigated how MI practice during 11 h of arm-immobilization influences sensorimotor and cortical representations of the hands, as well as sleep. Fourteen participants were first tested after a normal day, followed by two 11-h periods of immobilization, either with concomitant MI treatment or control tasks. Data revealed that MI prevented the consequences of immobilization: (i) alteration of the sensorimotor representation of hands, (ii) decrease of cortical excitability over the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to arm-immobilization, and (iii) reduction of sleep spindles over both M1s. Furthermore, (iv) the time spent in REM sleep was significantly longer after MI. These results support that implementing MI during immobilization can limit the deleterious effects of limb disuse, at several levels of sensorimotor functioning.",

    "abstract": "MotivationStudies on structural variants (SV) are expanding rapidly. As a result, and thanks to third generation sequencing technologies, the number of discovered SVs is increasing, especially in the human genome. At the same time, for several applications such as clinical diagnoses, it is important to genotype newly sequenced individuals on well defined and characterized SVs. Whereas several SV genotypers have been developed for short read data, there is a lack of such dedicated tool to assess whether known SVs are present or not in a new long read sequenced sample, such as the one produced by Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore Technologies.\n\nResultsWe present a novel method to genotype known SVs from long read sequencing data. The method is based on the generation of a set of reference sequences that represent the two alleles of each structural variant. Long reads are aligned to these reference sequences. Alignments are then analyzed and filtered out to keep only informative ones, to quantify and estimate the presence of each SV allele and the allele frequencies. We provide an implementation of the method, SVJedi, to genotype insertions and deletions with long reads. The tool has been applied to both simulated and real human datasets and achieves high genotyping accuracy. We also demonstrate that SV genotyping is considerably improved with SVJedi compared to other approaches, namely SV discovery and short read SV genotyping approaches.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/llecompte/SVJedi.git\n\nContactlolita.lecompte@inria.fr",

Importantly, LCC patient fibroblasts demonstrate rRNA processing defects. Human precursor-U8 (pre-U8) containing a 3 extension rescued mutant U8 zebrafish, indicating conserved biological function. Analysis of LCC-associated U8 alleles in zebrafish revealed that one null and one hypomorphic, but still functional, allele combine to cause LCC. Mutations involving any one of seven nucleotides within the human pre-U8 3 extension, or 5 region of U8, alter processing of pre-U8, and identify a novel base-pairing interaction between the 5 end and 3 extension of human pre-U8. Variants in these seven nucleotides, one of which is present on a single allele in almost all patients, act as hypomorphic mutations. Given that biallelic null U8 alleles are likely incompatible with human development, identification of hypomorphic mutations mediating viable embryogenesis furthers understanding of LCC molecular pathology and cerebral vascular homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Myosin motor domains perform an extraordinary diversity of biological functions despite sharing a common mechanochemical cycle. Motors are adapted to their function, in part, by tuning the thermodynamics and kinetics of steps in this cycle. However, it remains unclear how sequence encodes these differences, since biochemically distinct motors often have nearly indistinguishable crystal structures. We hypothesized that sequences produce distinct biochemical phenotypes by modulating the relative probabilities of an ensemble of conformations primed for different functional roles. To test this hypothesis, we modeled the distribution of conformations for twelve myosin motor domains by building Markov state models (MSMs) from an unprecedented two milliseconds of all-atom, explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations. Comparing motors reveals shifts in the balance between nucleotide-favorable and nucleotide-unfavorable P-loop conformations that predict experimentally-measured duty ratios and ADP release rates better than sequence or individual structures. This result demonstrates the power of an ensemble perspective for interrogating sequence-function relationships.\n\nSubject AreasBiochemistry and Chemical Biology, Structural Biology and Molecular Physics",

The prevalence of DWV in honey bees has led to significant concerns about spillover of the virus to other pollinating species. Bumble bees are both a major group of wild and commercially-reared pollinators. Several studies have reported pathogen spillover of DWV from honey bees to bumble bees, but evidence of a true sustained viral infection has yet to be demonstrated. Here we investigate the infectivity and transmission of DWV in bumble bees using the buff-tailed bumble bee Bombus terrestris as a model. We apply a reverse genetics approach combined with controlled laboratory conditions to detect and monitor DWV infection. A novel reverse genetics system for three representative DWV variants, including the two master variants of DWV - type A and B - was used. Our results directly confirm DWV replication in bumble bees but also demonstrate striking resistance to infection by certain routes. Bumble bees may support DWV replication but it is not clear how infection could occur under natural environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampal CA1 is necessary to maintain experienced episodic memory in many species, including humans. To monitor the temporal dynamics of processing, we recorded multiple-unit firings of CA1 neurons in male rats experiencing one of four episodes for 10 min: restraint stress, social interaction with a female or male, or observation of a novel object. Before an experience, the neurons mostly exhibited sporadic firings with some synchronized (\u2248 50 ms) ripple-like firing events in habituated home cage. After experience onset, restraint or social interaction with other rats induced spontaneous high-frequency firings (super bursts) intermittently, while object observation induced the events inconsistently. Minutes after experience initiation, CA1 neurons frequently exhibited ripple-like firings with less-firing silent periods. The number of ripple-like events depended on the episode experienced and correlated with the total duration of super bursts. Experience clearly diversified multiple features of individual ripple-like events in an episode-specific manner, sustained for more than 30 min in the home cage.Ex vivo patch clamp analysis further revealed experience-promoted synaptic plasticity. Compared with unexposed controls, animals experiencing the female, male, or restraint episodes showed cell-dependently increased AMPA- or GABAA receptor\u2013 mediated postsynaptic currents, whereas contact with a novel object increased only GABAergic currents. Multivariate ANOVA in multi-dimensional virtual space revealed experience-specific super bursts with subsequent ripple-like events and synaptic plasticity, leading us to hypothesize that these factors are responsible for creating experience-specific memory. It is possible to decipher encrypted experience through the deep learning of the orchestrated ripple-like firings and synaptic plasticity in multiple CA1 neurons.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplication events are notably widespread in plants and this poses particular challenges for phylogenetic inference in allopolyploid lineages, i.e. lineages that result from the merging of two or more diverged genomes after interspecific hybridization. The nuclear genomes resulting from allopolyploidization contain homologous gene copies from different evolutionary origins called homoeologs, whose orthologs must be sorted out in order to reconstruct the evolutionary history of polyploid clades. In this study, we propose a methodological approach to resolve the phylogeny of allopolyploid clades focusing on mesopolyploid genomes, which experienced some level of genome reshuffling and gene fractionation across their subgenomes. To illustrate our methodological framework we applied it to a clade belonging to the model Brassicaceae plant family, the Brassiceae tribe, that experienced a mesohexaploidy event. The dataset analysed consists of both publically available genomic sequences and new transcriptomic data according to taxa. The present methodology requires a well-annotated reference genome, for which the identification of the parental subgenome fragments has been performed (e.g. Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea). Focusing on fully retained genes (i.e. genes for which all homoeologous gene copies inherited from the parental lineages are still present in the reference genome), the method constructs multi-labelled gene trees that allow subsequent assignment of each gene copy to its diploid parental lineage. Once the orthologous copies are identified, genes from the same parental origin are concatenated and tree-building methods are used to reconstruct the species tree. This method allows resolving the phylogenetic relationships (i) among extant species within a mesopolyploid clade, (ii) among the parental lineages of a mesopolyploid lineage, and (iii) between the parental lineages and closely related extant species. We report here the first well-resolved nuclear-based phylogeny of the Brassiceae tribe.",

    "abstract": "QuestionsPlant invasions are considered among the biggest threats to biodiversity worldwide. In a full-factorial greenhouse experiment we analysed the effect of soil burial depth and litter cover on the germination of invasive plants. We hypothesised that (i) burial depth and litter cover affect the germination of the studied species, (ii) the effects of burial and litter cover interact with each other, and (iii) the effects are species-specific, but dependent on seed size.\n\nMethodsWe tested the germination and seedling growth of 11 herbaceous invasive species in a full-factorial experiment using four levels of seed burial depths and litter cover. We analysed the effect of burial, litter cover, and their interactions on germination, seedling length and biomass across species and at the species level.\n\nResultsSoil burial depth and litter cover had a significant effect on the germination of the studied species, but there were considerable differences between species. We observed a general trend of species with bigger seeds being not or less seriously affected by soil burial and litter cover than smaller-seeded species. Correlations between seed weight and effect sizes mostly confirmed this general trend, but not in the case of soil burial.\n\nConclusionsOur findings confirmed that seed size is a major driver of species response to litter cover and to the combined effects of litter cover and soil burial, but there is no general trend regarding the response to soil burial depth. Despite its very small seeds the germination of Cynodon dactylon was not affected by soil burial. The germination of Ambrosia artemisiifolia was hampered by both soil burial and litter cover despite its relatively large seeds. Thus, specific information on species response to burial depth and litter accumulation is crucial when planning management or restoration in areas threatened by plant invasions.",

    "abstract": "Oilseed rape residues are a crucial determinant of stem canker epidemiology, as they support the sexual reproduction of the fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans. The aim of this study was to characterise the impact of a resistance gene against L. maculans infection on residue microbial communities and to identify micro-organisms interacting with this pathogen during residue degradation. We used near-isogenic lines to obtain healthy and infected host plants. The microbiome associated with the two types of plant residues was characterised by metabarcoding. A combination of linear discriminant analysis and ecological network analysis was used to compare the microbial communities and to identify micro-organisms interacting with L. maculans. Fungal community structure differed between the two lines at harvest, but not subsequently, suggesting that the presence/absence of the resistance gene influences the microbiome at the base of the stem whilst the plant is alive, but that this does not necessarily lead to differential colonisation of the residues by fungi. Direct interactions with other members of the community involved many fungal and bacterial ASVs (amplicon sequence variants). L. maculans appeared to play a minor role in networks, whereas one ASV affiliated to Plenodomus biglobosus (synonym Leptosphaeria biglobosa) from the Leptosphaeria species complex may be considered a keystone taxon in the networks at harvest. This approach could be used to identify and promote micro-organisms with beneficial effects against residue-borne pathogens, and more broadly, to decipher the complex interactions between multi-species pathosystems and other microbial components in crop residues.",

    "abstract": "Featuring a transitional zone between closed forests and treeless steppes, forest-steppes cover vast areas and have outstanding conservation importance. The components of this mosaic ecosystem can conveniently be classified into two basic types, forests and grasslands. However, this dichotomic classification may not fit reality as habitat organization can be much more complex. In this study, our aim was to find out if the main habitat types can be grouped into two distinct habitat categories (which would support the dichotomic description), or a different paradigm better fits this complex ecosystem. We selected six main habitats of sandy forest-steppes, and, using 176 releves, we compared their vegetation based on species composition (NMDS ordination, number of common species of the studied habitats), relative ecological indicator values (mean indicators for temperature, soil moisture, and light availability), and functional species groups (life-form categories, geoelement types, and phytosociological preference groups). According to the species composition, we found a well-defined gradient, with the following habitat order: large forest patches - medium forest patches - small forest patches - north-facing edges - south-facing edges - grasslands. A considerable number of species were shared among all habitats, while the number of species restricted to certain habitat types was also numerous, especially for north-facing edges. The total (i.e., pooled) number of species peaked near the middle of the gradient, in north-facing edges. The relative ecological indicator values and functional species groups showed mostly gradual changes from the large forest patches to the grasslands. Our results indicate that the widely used dichotomic categorization of forest-steppe habitats into forest and grassland patches is too simplistic, potentially resulting in a considerable loss of information. We suggest that forest-steppe vegetation better fits the gradient-based paradigm of landscape structure, which is able to reflect continuous variations.",

Here, we present the isolation and characterization of RiOLE1-LIKE, the desaturase involved in palmitvaccenic acid synthesis, by heterologous expression in yeast and plants. Results are in line with the scenario that RiOLE1-LIKE encodes an acyl-CoA desaturase with substrate specificity for C15-C18 acyl groups, in particular C16. Phylogenetic analysis of RiOLE1-LIKE related sequences revealed that this gene is conserved in AM fungi from the Glomales and Diversisporales, but is absent from non-symbiotic Mortierellaceae and Mucoromycotina fungi, suggesting that 16:1{Delta}11cis provides a specific function during AM colonization.",

    "abstract": "The Arabidopsis resistance protein RPS5 is activated by proteolytic cleavage of the protein kinase PBS1 by the Pseudomonas syringae effector protease AvrPphB. We have previously shown that replacing seven amino acids at the cleavage site of PBS1 with a motif cleaved by the NIa protease of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) enables RPS5 activation upon TuMV infection. However, this engineered resistance conferred a trailing necrosis phenotype indicative of a cell death response too slow to contain the virus. We theorized this could result from a positional mismatch within the cell between PBS1TuMV, RPS5 and the NIa protease. To test this, we re-localized PBS1TuMV and RPS5 to cellular sites of NIa accumulation. These experiments revealed that relocation of RPS5 away from the plasma membrane compromised RPS5-dependent cell death in N. benthamiana, even though PBS1 was efficiently cleaved. As an alternative approach, we tested whether overexpression of plasma membrane-localized PBS1TuMV would enhance RPS5 activation by TuMV. Significantly, over-expressing the PBS1TuMV decoy protein conferred complete resistance to TuMV when delivered by either Agrobacterium or by aphid transmission, showing that RPS5-mediated defense responses are effective against bacterial and viral pathogens. Lastly, we have now extended this PBS1 decoy approach to soybean by modifying a soybean PBS1 ortholog to be cleaved by the NIa protease of soybean mosaic virus (SMV). Transgenic overexpression of this soybean PBS1 decoy conferred immunity to SMV, demonstrating that we can use endogenous PBS1 proteins in crop plants to engineer economically relevant disease resistant traits.",

    "abstract": "Monovalent ions, sodium in particular, are involved in fundamental cell functions, such as water balance and electric processes, intra- and intercellular signaling, cell movement, pH regulation and metabolite transport into and out of cells. Fluorescent probes are indispensable tools for monitoring intracellular sodium levels in single living cells in heterogeneous cell populations and tissues. Since the fluorescence of sodium-sensitive dyes in cells is significantly different from that in an aqueous solution, the fluorescence signal is calibrated in situ by changing the concentration of extracellular sodium in the presence of ionophores, making the membrane permeable to sodium and equilibrating its intra- and extracellular concentrations. The reliability of this calibration method has not been well studied. Here, we compare the determinations of the intracellular sodium concentration by flame emission photometry and flow cytometry using the Na+-sensitive probe Asante Natrium Green-2 (ANG). The intracellular Na+ concentration was altered using known ionophores or, alternatively, by blocking the sodium pump with ouabain or by causing cell apoptosis with staurosporine. The use of U937 cells cultured in suspension allowed the fluorometry of single cells by flow cytometry and flame emission analysis of samples checked for uniform cell populations. It is revealed that the ANG fluorescence of cells treated with ionophores is approximately two times lower than that in cells with the same Na+ concentration but not treated with ionophores. Although the mechanism is still unknown, this effect should be taken into account when a quantitative assessment of the concentration of intracellular sodium is required. Sodium sensitive fluorescent dyes are widely used at present, and the problem is practically significant.",

Here we systematically compare all three systems; we show that the use of marker-based selection is the most efficient method and we use this to generate multiple T7 tail fiber mutants. Furthermore, we found the type II CRISPR-Cas system is easier to use and generally more efficient than a type I system in the engineering of phage T7.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The paralogous transcriptional cofactors Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ, also called WWTR1), the main downstream effectors of the Hippo signal transduction pathway, are emerging as pivotal determinants of malignancy in lung cancer. Traditionally, studies have tended to consider YAP and TAZ as functionally redundant transcriptional cofactors, with similar biological impact. However, there is growing evidence that each of them also possesses distinct attributes. Here, we sought to systematically characterize the division of labor between YAP and TAZ in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common histological subtype of lung cancer. Employing representative NSCLC cell lines, as well as patient-derived data, we show that the two paralogs orchestrate non-overlapping transcription programs in this cancer type: whereas YAP preferentially regulates gene sets associated with cell division and cell cycle progression, TAZ preferentially regulates genes associated with extracellular matrix organization. Concordantly, depletion of YAP, but not TAZ, leads to growth arrest, while YAP overexpression promotes cell proliferation. Likewise, depletion of TAZ, but not YAP, compromises cell migration, whereas TAZ overexpression enhances migration. Importantly, the differential effects of YAP vs TAZ on key cellular processes are also associated with differential response to anti-cancer therapies. Uncovering the different activities and downstream effects of YAP and TAZ may thus facilitate better stratification of lung cancer patients for anti-cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) was a master regulator of anti-tumor cell migration in various cell types. Whether and how AHR regulates glioma cell migration is largely unknown. We found that small molecule 2-(1'H-indole-3'-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE), an endogenous AHR ligand, can significantly block glioma cell migration and invasion in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Knocking down AHR by siRNA abolished ITEs migration-inhibiting effects. ITE increased the number of filopodia-like protrusion formation, but reduced protrusion attachment to the extracellular matrix, and inhibited the rear retraction of migrating glioma cells. Moreover, both mesenchymal and amoeboid migrating cells were observed in the DMSO control group while none of the cells display amoeboid migration in the ITE treated group. MYH9 was significantly reduced by ITE treatment in human glioma cells. Over-expression of MYH9 abrogated ITEs migration-inhibiting effects, with the expression level of MYH9 correlated with cell migration ability. Since MYH9 is a component of non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA), which is essential for cell migration in 3D confined space, and not a discovered target of AHR, the fact that ITE affects MYH9 via AHR opens a new research and development avenue.",

    "abstract": "We previously found that surface topographies induce the expression of the Scxa gene, encoding Scleraxis in tenocytes. Because Scxa is a TGF-{beta} responsive gene, we investigated the link between mechanotransduction and TGF-{beta} signaling. We discovered that mesenchymal stem cells exposed to both micro-topographies and TGF-{beta}2 display synergistic induction of SMAD phosphorylation and transcription of the TGF-{beta} target genes SCXA, a-SMA, and SOX9. Pharmacological perturbations revealed that Rho/ROCK/SRF signaling is required for this synergistic response. We further found an activation of the early response genes SRF and EGR1 during the early adaptation phase on micro-topographies, which coincided with higher expression of the TGF-{beta} type-II receptor gene. Of interest, PKC activators Prostratin and Ingenol-3, known for inducing actin reorganization and activation of serum response elements, were able to mimic the topography-induced TGF-{beta} response. These findings provide novel insights into the convergence of mechanobiology and TGF-{beta} signaling, which can lead to improved culture protocols and therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOctopus vulgaris has been an iconic cephalopod species for neurobiology research as well as for cephalopod aquaculture. It is one of the most intelligent and well-studied invertebrates, possessing both long- and short-term memory and the striking ability to perform complex cognitive tasks. Nevertheless, how the common octopus developed these uncommon features remains enigmatic. O. vulgaris females spawn thousands of small eggs and remain with their clutch during their entire development, cleaning, venting and protecting the eggs. In fact, eggs incubated without females usually do not develop normally, mainly due to biological contamination (fungi, bacteria, etc.). This high level of parental care might have hampered laboratory research on the embryonic development of this intriguing cephalopod.\n\nResultsHere, we present a completely parameter-controlled artificial seawater standalone egg incubation system that replaces maternal care and allows successful embryonic development of a small-egged octopus species until hatching in a laboratory environment. We also provide a practical and detailed 1 staging atlas based on bright-field and light sheet fluorescence microscopy imaging for precise monitoring of embryonic development. The atlas has a comparative section to benchmark stages to the different scales published by Naef (1928), Arnold (1965) and Boletzky (2016). Finally, we provide methods to monitor health and wellbeing of embryos during organogenesis.\n\nConclusionBesides introducing the study of O. vulgaris embryonic development to a wider community, this work can be a high-quality reference for comparative evolutionary developmental biology.",

    "abstract": "J-domain proteins (JDPs), obligatory Hsp70 cochaperones, play critical roles in protein homeostasis. They promote key allosteric transitions that stabilize Hsp70 interaction with substrate polypeptides upon hydrolysis of its bound ATP. Although a recent crystal structure revealed the physical mode of interaction between a J-domain and an Hsp70, the structural and dynamic consequences of J-domain action once bound and how Hsp70s discriminate among its multiple JDP partners remain enigmatic. We combined free energy simulations, biochemical assays and evolutionary analyses to address these issues. Our results indicate that the invariant aspartate of the J-domain perturbs a conserved intramolecular Hsp70 network of contacts that crosses domains. This perturbation leads to destabilization of the domain-domain interface - thereby promoting the allosteric transition that triggers ATP hydrolysis. While this mechanistic step is driven by conserved residues, evolutionarily variable residues are key to initial JDP/Hsp70 recognition - via electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged surfaces. We speculate that these variable residues allow an Hsp70 to discriminate amongst JDP partners, as many of them have coevolved. Together, our data points to a two-step mode of J-domain action, a recognition stage followed by a mechanistic stage.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/901538v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ba0d3aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ba9193org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab7974org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b2de33_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The gut-brain axis allows bi-directional communication between the enteric and central nervous systems. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) generated by the gut microbiota are important regulators of this interface. However, defining mechanisms by which SCFAs do so has been challenging because, amongst various roles, they co-activate both of a pair of closely related and poorly characterized G protein-coupled receptors, FFA2 and FFA3. Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) can provide an important approach in defining receptor-specific functions. By screening a library of carboxylate-containing small molecules we identified 4-methoxy-3-methyl-benzoic acid (MOMBA) as a specific agonist of a DREADD variant of FFA2 which is not activated by SCFAs. Using mice engineered to replace FFA2 with this FFA2-DREADD, whilst retaining FFA3 expression, combinations of MOMBA and the now FFA3 receptor selective SCFAs defined key, but distinct, roles of FFA2 and FFA3 in each of gut transit time, secretion of entero-endocrine hormones, and communication from the gut to each of autonomic and somatic sensory ganglion cells and the spinal cord. These studies map mechanisms and signalling pathways by which each of FFA2 and FFA3 act to link the gut and the brain and provide both animal models and novel tool compounds to further explore this interface.",

    "abstract": "We previously identified a 210 kb region on chromosome 11 (50.37-50.58 Mb, mm10) containing two protein-coding genes (Hnrnph1, Rufy1) that was necessary for reduced methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity in C57BL/6J congenic mice harboring DBA/2J polymorphisms. Gene editing of a small deletion in the first coding exon supported Hnrnph1 as a quantitative trait gene. We have since shown that Hnrnph1 mutants also exhibit reduced methamphetamine-induced reward, reinforcement, and dopamine release. However, the quantitative trait variants (QTVs) that modulate Hnrnph1 function at the molecular level are not known. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms and seven indels distinguish C57BL/6J from DBA/2J within Hnrnph1, including four variants within the 5 untranslated region (UTR). Here, we show that a 114 kb introgressed region containing Hnrnph1 and Rufy1 was sufficient to cause a decrease in MA-induced locomotor activity. Gene-level transcriptome analysis of striatal tissue from 114 kb congenics versus Hnrnph1 mutants identified a nearly perfect correlation of fold-change in expression for those differentially expressed genes that were common to both mouse lines, indicating functionally similar effects on the transcriptome and behavior. Exon-level analysis (including noncoding exons) revealed decreased 5 UTR usage of Hnrnph1 and immunoblot analysis identified a corresponding decrease in hnRNP H protein in 114 kb congenic mice. Molecular cloning of the Hnrnph1 5 UTR containing all four variants (but none of them individually) upstream of a reporter induced a decrease in reporter signal in both HEK293 and N2a cells, thus identifying a set of QTVs underlying molecular regulation of Hnrnph1.",

    "abstract": "Current hypotheses suggest that speech segmentation - the initial division and grouping of the speech stream into candidate phrases, syllables, and phonemes for further linguistic processing - is executed by a hierarchy of oscillators in auditory cortex. Theta (~3-12 Hz) rhythms play a key role by phase-locking to recurring acoustic features marking syllable boundaries. Reliable synchronization to quasi-rhythmic inputs, whose variable frequency can dip below cortical theta frequencies (down to ~1 Hz), requires \"flexible\" theta oscillators whose underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. Using biophysical computational models, we found that the flexibility of phase-locking in neural oscillators depended on the types of hyperpolarizing currents that paced them. Simulated cortical theta oscillators flexibly phase-locked to slow inputs when these inputs caused both (i) spiking and (ii) the subsequent buildup of outward current sufficient to delay further spiking until the next input. The greatest flexibility in phase-locking arose from a synergistic interaction between intrinsic currents that was not replicated by synaptic currents at similar timescales. Flexibility in phase-locking enabled improved entrainment to speech input, optimal at mid-vocalic channels, which in turn supported syllabic-timescale segmentation through identification of vocalic nuclei. Our results suggest that synaptic and intrinsic inhibition contribute to frequency-restricted and -flexible phase-locking in neural oscillators, respectively. Their differential deployment may enable neural oscillators to play diverse roles, from reliable internal clocking to adaptive segmentation of quasi-regular sensory inputs like speech.\n\nAuthor summaryOscillatory activity in auditory cortex is believed to play an important role in auditory and speech processing. One suggested function of these rhythms is to divide the speech stream into candidate phonemes, syllables, words, and phrases, to be matched with learned linguistic templates. This requires brain rhythms to flexibly synchronize with regular acoustic features of the speech stream. How neuronal circuits implement this task remains unknown. In this study, we explored the contribution of inhibitory currents to flexible phase-locking in neuronal theta oscillators, believed to perform initial syllabic segmentation. We found that a combination of specific intrinsic inhibitory currents at multiple timescales, present in a large class of cortical neurons, enabled exceptionally flexible phase-locking, which could be used to precisely segment speech by identifying vowels at mid-syllable. This suggests that the cells exhibiting these currents are a key component in the brains auditory and speech processing architecture.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating data point to a key role of Ca2+-dependent gliotransmitter release as a modulator of neuronal networks. Here, we tested the hypothesis that astrocytes in response to agonist exposure also release lipid modulators through activation of Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) activity. We found that cultured rat astrocytes treated with selective ATP and glutamatergic agonists released arachidonic acid (AA) and/or its derivatives, including the endogenous cannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2AG) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Surprisingly, buffering of cytosolic Ca2+ resulted in a sharp increase in agonist-induced astrocytic lipid release. In addition, astrocytic release of PGE2 enhanced miniature excitatory post-synaptic potentials (mEPSPs) by inhibiting the opening of neuronal Kv channels in brain slices. This study provides the first evidence for the existence of a Ca2+-independent pathway regulating the release of PGE2 from astrocytes, and furthermore demonstrates a functional role for astrocytic lipid release in the modulation of synaptic activity.\n\nSignificance StatementUntil now, the majority of studies implicating astrocytes in modulating synaptic activity have focused on Ca2+-dependent release of traditional gliotransmitters such as D-serine, ATP, and glutamate. Mobilization of intracellular stores of Ca2+ occurs within a matter of seconds, but this novel Ca2+-independent lipid pathway in astrocytes could potentially occur on a still faster time scale and thus participate in the rapid signaling processes involved in synaptic potentiation, attention, and neurovascular coupling.",

As an effort to clarify the pathogenesis mechanism by -synuclein, various PD mouse models with -synuclein overexpression have been developed. However, the systemic analysis of protein abundance change by the overexpressed -synuclein in the whole proteome level has been still lacking. To address this issue, we established two sophisticated mouse models of PD by injecting -synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF) or by inducing overexpression of human A53T -synuclein to discover overlapping pathways, which could be altered in the two different types of PD mouse model. For more accurate quantification of mouse brain proteome, stable isotope labeling with amino acid in mammal-based quantification was implemented. As a result, we have successfully identified a total of 8,355 proteins from both of the mouse models; [~]6,800 and [~]7,200 proteins from -synuclein PFF injected mice and human A53T -synuclein transgenic mice, respectively. From the pathway analysis of the differentially expressed proteins in common, the complement and coagulation cascade pathway were determined as the most enriched ones.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWClinical analyses of neuronal activity during seizures, invariably using extracellular recordings, is greatly hindered by various phenomena that are well established in animal studies: changes in local ionic concentration, changes in ionic conductance, and intense, hypersynchronous firing. The first two alter the action potential waveform, whereas the third increases the \"noise\"; all three factors confound attempts to detect and classify single neurons (units). To address these analytical difficulties, we developed a novel template-matching based spike sorting method, which enabled identification of 1,239 single units in 27 patients with intractable focal epilepsy, that were tracked throughout multiple seizures. These new analyses showed continued neuronal firing through the ictal transition, which was defined as a transient period of intense tonic firing consistent with previous descriptions of the ictal wavefront. After the ictal transition, neurons displayed increased spike duration (p < 0.001) and reduced spike amplitude (p < 0.001), in keeping with prior animal studies; units in non-recruited territories, by contrast, showed more stable waveforms. All units returned to their pre-ictal waveforms after seizure termination. Waveshape changes were stereotyped across seizures within patients. Our analyses of single neuron firing patterns, at the ictal wavefront, showed widespread intense activation, and commonly involving marked waveshape alteration. We conclude that the distinction between tissue that has been recruited to the seizure versus non-recruited territories is evident at the level of single neurons, and that increased waveform duration and decreased waveform amplitude are hallmarks of seizure invasion that could be used as defining characteristics of local recruitment.\n\nSO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOW SO_SCPLOWTATEMENTC_SCPLOWAnimal studies consistently show marked changes in action potential waveform during epileptic discharges, but acquiring similar evidence in humans has proved difficult. Assessing neuronal involvement in ictal events is pivotal to understanding seizure dynamics and in defining clinical localization of epileptic pathology. Using a novel method to track neuronal firing, we analyzed microelectrode array recordings of spontaneously occurring human seizures, and here report two dichotomous activity patterns. In cortex that is recruited to the seizure, neuronal firing rates increase and waveforms become longer in duration and shorter in amplitude, while penumbral tissue shows stable action potentials, in keeping with the \"dual territory\" model of seizure dynamics.",

This method has revolutionized biology and medicine as it allows controlling cells with high temporal and spatial precision. Optogenetics is typically applied only at short time scales, for instance to study specific behaviors. Optogenetically manipulating behavior also gives insights into physiology, as behavior controls systemic physiological processes. For example, arousal and sleep affect aging and health span. To study how behavior controls key physiological processes, behavioral manipulations need to occur at extended time scales. However, methods for long-term optogenetics are scarce and typically require expensive compound microscope setups. Optogenetic experiments can be conducted in many species. Small model animals such as the nematode C. elegans, have been instrumental in solving the mechanistic basis of medically important biological processes. We developed OptoGenBox, an affordable stand-alone and simple-to-use device for long-term optogenetic manipulation of C. elegans. OptoGenBox provides a controlled environment and is programmable to allow the execution of complex optogenetic manipulations over long experimental times of many days to weeks. To test our device, we investigated how optogenetically increased arousal and optogenetic sleep deprivation affect survival of arrested first larval stage C. elegans. We optogenetically activated the nociceptive ASH sensory neurons using ReaChR, thus triggering an escape response and increase in arousal. In addition, we optogenetically inhibited the sleep neuron RIS using ArchT, a condition known to impair sleep. Both optogenetic manipulations reduced survival. Thus, OptoGenBox presents an affordable system to study the long-term consequences of optogenetic manipulations of key biological processes in C. elegans and perhaps other small animals.",

    "abstract": "The startle reflex is considered a sensitive defensive reaction to potential threats that manifests as a unique eye blink-like pattern in the EMG. Eye blink EMG has a bell-shaped potential when startle probes are elicited, that strongly corresponds to amygdala activity. Considering how amygdala activity fluctuates over time in response to emotional and self-threatening stimuli, observing startle eyeblink size fluctuation over time could provide a cost-effective, convenient, and less resource intensive means for examining amygdala activity over time. Yet based on current standards in the literature, often startle evoked eye blink EMG values do not exhibit activity 3SDs from the mean eyeblink response, thus these trials are typically excluded from startle analyses. It stands to reason, however, that these trials may still index amygdala activity in a meaningful way. Through investigating the association between startle eyeblink amplitude, corresponding ERP amplitude, and underlying neural activity, the current study provides evidence that startle amplitudes exhibit a linear relationship with proxies for amygdala activity, e.g., N100 amplitudes and regions heavily interconnected with the amygdala. Specifically, the startle reflex correlates to large amount of brain regions in N100 time window in addition to the N100 amplitude. Thus, both valid and otherwise traditionally non-valid startle reflex responses appear to index amygdala activity and should be included accordingly. This approach could help salvage large amounts of meaningful data traditionally excluded from studies interested in amygdala responses to various stimuli over time.",

Although the anatomy and mechanisms of sound production in songbirds are well understood, little is known about the hummingbirds vocal anatomy. We use high-resolution micro-computed tomography (CT) and microdissection to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the syrinx, the vocal organ of the black jacobin (Florisuga fusca), a phylogenetically basal hummingbird species. We identify three unique features of the black jacobins syrinx: (i) a shift in the position of the syrinx to the outside of the thoracic cavity and the related loss of the sterno-tracheal muscle, (ii) complex intrinsic musculature, oriented dorso-ventrally, and (iii) ossicles embedded in the medial vibratory membranes. Their syrinx morphology allows vibratory decoupling, precise control of complex acoustic parameters, and a large redundant acoustic space that may be key biomechanical factors facilitating the occurrence of vocal production learning.",

We extracted proteins residing in these microdomains via stoichiometric capture of lipids and proteins in styrene-maleic-acid-lipid-particles (SMALPs). We purified SMALPs by affinity chromatography and quantitatively analyzed the lipids by mass spectrometry and their role in transporter function. We found that phospholipid and sterol concentrations are similar for MCC and MCP, but sphingolipids are enriched in MCP. Ergosterol is depleted from the periprotein lipidome, whereas phosphatidylserine is enriched relative to the bulk of the plasma membrane. Phosphatidylserine, non-bilayer lipids and ergosterol are essential for activity of Lyp1; the transporter also requires a balance of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids.

    "abstract": "BackgroundEnsemble docking has proven useful in drug discovery and development. It increases the hit rate by incorporating receptor flexibility into molecular docking as demonstrated on important drug targets including G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Adenosine A1 receptor (A1AR) is a key GPCR that has been targeted for treating cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injuries, neuropathic pain and renal diseases. Development of allosteric modulators, compounds binding to distinct and less conserved GPCR target sites compared with agonists and antagonists, has attracted increasing interest for designing selective drugs of the A1AR. Despite significant advances, more effective approaches are needed to discover potent and selective allosteric modulators of the A1AR.\n\nMethodsEnsemble docking that integrates Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamic (GaMD) simulations and molecular docking using Autodock has been implemented for retrospective docking of known positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) in the A1AR.\n\nResultsEnsemble docking outperforms docking of the receptor cryo-EM structure. The calculated docking enrichment factors (EFs) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) are significantly increased.\n\nConclusionsReceptor ensembles generated from GaMD simulations are able to increase the success rate of discovering PAMs of A1AR. It is important to account for receptor flexibility through GaMD simulations and flexible docking.\n\nGeneral SignificanceEnsemble docking is a promising approach for drug discovery targeting flexible receptors.",

    "abstract": "The importance of wheat yellow rust disease, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), has increased substantially due to the emergence of aggressive new Pst races in the last couple of decades. In an era of escalating human populations and climate change, it is vital to understand the infection mechanism of Pst in order to develop better strategies to combat wheat yellow disease. This study focuses on the identification of small secreted proteins (SSPs) and candidate-secreted effector proteins (CSEPs) that are used by the pathogen to support infection and control disease development. We generated de novo assembled transcriptomes of Pst collected from wheat fields in central Anatolia. We inoculated both susceptible and resistant seedlings with Pst and analyzed haustoria formation. At 10 days post-inoculation (dpi), we analyzed the transcriptomes and identified 10,550 Differentially Expressed Unigenes (DEGs), of which 6,220 were Pst-related. Among those Pst-related genes, 230 were predicted as PstSSPs. In silico characterization was performed using an approach combining the transcriptomic data and data mining results to provide a reliable list to narrow down the ever-expanding repertoire of predicted effectorome. The comprehensive analysis detected 14 Differentially Expressed Small-Secreted Proteins (DESSPs) that overlapped with the genes in available literature data to serve as the best CSEPs for experimental validation. One of the CSEPs was cloned and studied to test the reliability of the presented data. Biological assays show that the randomly selected CSEP, Unigene17495 (PSTG_10917), localizes in the chloroplast and is able to suppress cell death induced by INF1 in a Nicotiana benthamiana heterologous expression system.",

It evaluates the semantic embeddings by leveraging word-pair proximity ranking tasks and contrasts voxel encoding models trained with the two types of semantic features to reveal the brains spatial pattern for semantic processing. Results indicate that in listening comprehension, paradigmatic and syntagmatic semantic operations both recruit inferior (ITG) and middle temporal gyri (MTG), angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule (SPL), inferior frontal gyrus. A non-continuous voxel line is found in MTG with a predominance of paradigmatic processing. The ITG, middle occipital gyrus and the surrounding primary and associative visual areas are more engaged by syntagmatic processing. The comparison of two semantic axes brain map does not suggest a neuroanatomical segregation for paradigmatic and syntagmatic processing.

    "abstract": "An open question in comparative evolutionary genomics is whether or not certain loci are the primary drivers of divergence between taxonomic lineages or species groups. Alternatively, genetic drivers of species divergence may be evenly distributed across the genome. The increasing availability of genome sequences from diverse taxa has enabled the development of novel methods to address this question. Genomes of many highly diverged species may now be compared in order to tease apart genetic differences that drive adaptive or functional divergence, and genetic differences that are observed by chance and are not causally linked to traits that differ between species or lineages. In order to test the hypothesis that a particular subset of loci or genes is responsible for driving adaptive changes between mammals and non-mammals, we developed a novel comparative approach to identify sites that are highly conserved within lineages or species groups and diverge between them. Loci with a high concentration of these sites may be called Shifts in Purifying Selection (SPurS) because a change has occurred between two groups of species at some point in the past, and the shift is conserved (via purifying selection) over a long period of time. Evaluating 7484 orthologous gene copies from 76 vertebrate species, we developed an empirical distribution of SPurS across the genome between Synapsida (placental and non-placental mammals) and Sauropsida (birds, crocodilians, squamates, and turtles), and compared this distribution to the expected null distribution of SPurS using matched simulated data. We then identified a subset of genes that is enriched for SPurS, relative to the full set of genes and to their matched simulated alignments. These SPurS-enriched genes are thus likely candidate drivers of functional divergence or adaptation between the mammalian and non-mammalian species groups in our analysis. Investigators seeking to identify genetic drivers of inter-species evolution may find this method useful, and we provide a web-based software interface to facilitate its use.",

The PDX panel aimed to mimic the heterogeneity of disease observed in patients, and exhibited a distribution of responsiveness to standard of care chemotherapy similar to human clinical data. Three monotherapies and one drug combination were found to be active in different subsets of PDXs. By analyzing gene expression data we identified gene expression biomarkers predictive of responsiveness to each of three novel targeted therapy regimens. While no single treatment had as high a response rate as chemotherapy, nearly 90% of PDXs were eligible for and responded to at least one biomarker-guided treatment, including tumors resistant to standard chemotherapy. Biomarker frequency was similar in human patients, suggesting the possibility of a new therapeutic approach to ovarian cancer and demonstrating the potential power of PDX-based trials in broadening the reach of precision cancer medicine.",

    "abstract": "Arginine auxotrophy due to the silencing of argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) occurs in many cancers, especially sarcomas. Arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) therapy exploits this metabolic vulnerability by depleting extracellular arginine, causing arginine starvation. ASS1-negative cells develop resistance to ADI-PEG20 through a metabolic adaptation that includes re-expressing ASS1. As arginine-based multiagent therapies are being developed, further characterization of the changes induced by arginine starvation is needed. In order to develop a systems-level understanding of these changes, activity-based proteomic profiling (ABPP) and phosphoproteomic profiling were performed before and after ADI-PEG20 treatment in ADI-PEG20-sensitive and resistant sarcoma cells. When integrated with previous metabolomic profiling (Kremer et al, 2017a), this multi-omic analysis reveals that cellular response to arginine starvation is mediated by adaptive ERK signaling, driving a Myc-Max transcriptional network. Concomitantly, these data elucidate proteomic changes that facilitate oxaloacetate production by enhancing glutamine and pyruvate anaplerosis, and altering lipid metabolism to recycle citrate for oxidative glutaminolysis. Based on the complexity of metabolic and cellular signaling interactions, these multi-omic approaches could provide valuable tools for evaluating response to metabolically targeted therapies.",

Understanding the full repertoire of CAFs and their dynamic changes could improve the precision of cancer treatment. CAFs are usually analyzed at a single time-point using specific markers, and it is therefore unclear whether CAFs display plasticity as tumors evolve. Here, we analyze thousands of CAFs using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting, at several time-points along breast tumor progression in mice, uncovering distinct subpopulations. Strikingly, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immune-regulatory program to wound healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes, and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings indicate that the repertoire of CAFs changes over time in breast cancer progression, with direct clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Although seasonal influenza vaccines block most predominant influenza types and subtypes, humans still remain vulnerable to waves of seasonal and new potential pandemic influenza viruses for which no immunity may exist because of viral antigenic drift and/or shift, respectively. Previously, we have described a human monoclonal antibody (hMAb), KPF1, which was produced in human embryonic kidney 293T cells (KPF1-HEK) with broad and potent neutralizing activity against H1N1 influenza A viruses (IAV) in vitro, and prophylactic and therapeutic activities in vivo. In this study, we produced hMAb KPF1 in tobacco plants (KPF1-Antx) and demonstrate how the plant-produced KPF1-Antx hMAb possesses similar biological activity compared with the mammalian produced KPF1-HEK hMAb. KPF1-Antx hMAb shows broad binding to recombinant HA proteins and H1N1 IAV, including A/California/04/2009 (pH1N1) in vitro, that are comparable to those observed with KPF1-HEK hMAb. Importantly, prophylactic administration of KPF1-Antx hMAb to guinea pigs prevented pH1N1 infection and transmission in both prophylactic and therapeutic experiments, substantiating its clinical potential to prevent and treat H1N1 infections. Collectively, this study demonstrates, for the first time, that plant-produced influenza hMAbs have similar in vitro and in vivo biological properties to those produced in mammalian cells. Because of the many advantages of plant-produced hMAbs, such as rapid batch production, low cost, and the absence of mammalian cell products, they represent an alternative strategy for the production of immunotherapeutics for the treatment of influenza viral infections, including emerging seasonal and/or pandemic strains.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of RNA:DNA hybrid metabolism to cellular processes and disease states has become a prominent topic of study. The S9.6 antibody recognizes RNA:DNA hybrids with a subnanomolar affinity, making it a broadly used tool to detect and study RNA:DNA hybrids. However, S9.6 also binds double-stranded RNA in vitro with significant affinity. Though frequently used in immunofluorescence microscopy, the possible reactivity of S9.6 with non-RNA:DNA hybrid substrates in situ, particularly RNA, has not been comprehensively addressed. Furthermore, S9.6 immunofluorescence microscopy has been methodologically variable and generated discordant imaging datasets. In this study, we find that the majority of the S9.6 immunofluorescence signal observed in fixed human cells arises from RNA, not RNA:DNA hybrids. S9.6 staining was quantitatively unchanged by pre-treatment with the human RNA:DNA hybrid-specific nuclease, RNase H1, despite experimental verification in situ that S9.6 could recognize RNA:DNA hybrids and that RNase H1 was active. S9.6 staining was, however, significantly sensitive to pre-treatments with RNase T1, and in some cases RNase III, two ribonucleases that specifically degrade single-stranded and double-stranded RNA, respectively. In contrast, genome-wide maps obtained by high-throughput DNA sequencing after S9.6-mediated DNA:RNA Immunoprecipitation (DRIP) are RNase H1-sensitive and RNase T1- and RNase III-insensitive. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the S9.6 antibody, though capable of recognizing RNA:DNA hybrids in situ and in vitro, suffers from a lack of specificity that precludes reliable imaging of RNA:DNA hybrids and renders associated imaging data inconclusive in the absence of controls for its promiscuous recognition of cellular RNAs.",

We show here in prostate cancer cells that increased NOXA, mediated by activation of an integrated stress response, drives the degradation of MCL1, and identify the mitochondria-associated ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 as the primary mediator of this NOXA-dependent MCL1 degradation. Therapies that enhance MARCH5-mediated MCL1 degradation markedly enhance apoptosis in response to a BH3 mimetic agent targeting BCLXL, which may provide for a broadly effective therapy in solid tumors. Conversely, increased MCL1 in response to MARCH5 loss does not sensitize to BH3 mimetic drugs targeting MCL1, but instead also sensitizes to BCLXL inhibition, revealing a codependence between MARCH5 and MCL1 that may also be exploited in tumors with MARCH5 genomic loss.",

However, the task of animal detection and tracking for videos taken in natural settings remains challenging due to heterogeneous environments.\nC_LIO_LIWe present an open-source end-to-end pipeline called Multi-Object Tracking in Heterogenous environments (MOTHe), a python-based application that uses a basic convolutional neural network for object detection. MOTHe allows researchers with minimal coding experience to track multiple animals in their natural habitats. It identifies animals even when individuals are stationary or partially camouflaged.\nC_LIO_LIMOTHe has a command-line-based interface with one command for each action, for example, finding animals in an image and tracking each individual. Parameters used by the algorithm are well described in a configuration file along with example values for different types of tracking scenario. MOTHe doesnt require any sophisticated infrastructure and can be run on basic desktop computing units.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate MOTHe on six video clips from two species in their natural habitat - wasp colonies on their nests (up to 12 individuals per colony) and antelope herds in four different types of habitats (up to 156 individuals in a herd). Using MOTHe, we are able to detect and track all individuals in these animal group videos. MOTHes computing time on a personal computer with 4 GB RAM and i5 processor is 5 minutes for a 30-second long ultra-HD (4K resolution) video recorded at 30 frames per second.\nC_LIO_LIMOTHe is available as an open-source repository with a detailed user guide and demonstrations at Github (https://github.com/tee-lab/MOTHe).\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Antibodies targeting the NANP/NVDP repeat domain of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSPRepeat) can confer protection against malaria. However, it has also been suggested that this repeat domain exists as a decoy that distracts the immune system from mounting protective responses targeting other domains of CSP. Here we show that B cell responses to the repeat domain are indeed [~]10 fold higher than responses to the N- and C-terminal regions of CSP after sporozoite immunization. We investigated the role of the number of CSPRepeat-specific naive precursor B cells and high avidity binding by B cells in driving the immunodominance of the CSPRepeat. Using adoptive transfer of germline precursors specific for the CSPRepeat, we found that increasing precursor number did indeed increase the responses to the repeat region, but not to the detriment of responses to other epitopes. To investigate the role of avid binding by B cells to the CSPRepeat in driving immunodominance we generated CSP9: a truncated CSP molecule with just 9 NANP repeats. Compared to near full length CSP molecules, CSP9 induced lower BCR signalling in CSPRepeat-specific cells and induced stronger responses to non-repeat epitopes. Finally, we found mice immunized with CSP9 molecules were strongly protected against mosquito bite challenge. Collectively these data demonstrate that the CSPRepeat does function as an immunodominant decoy and that truncated CSP molecules may be a promising avenue for future malaria vaccines.\n\nSignificance StatementMalaria kills approximately 420,000 individuals each year(1). Our best vaccine, RTS,S/AS01 is based on the circumsporozoite protein that coasts the surface of the parasite. However, this vaccine is only partially protective. Here we show that responses to a repeat region in the circumsporozoite dominate the immune response. However, immunizing with a circumsporozoite protein with a shortened repeat region induces a more diverse immune response, which could be an avenue to make better malaria vaccines.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenetic heterogeneity denotes the situation when different genetic architectures underlying diverse populations result in the same phenotype. In this study, we explore the nature of differences in the incidence of the number of hoof and leg disorders between Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle in the context of genetic heterogeneity between the breeds.\n\nResultsDespite potentially higher power of testing due to twice as large sample size, none of the SNPs was significantly associated with the number of hoof and leg disorders in Fleckvieh, while 16 SNPs were significant in Braunvieh. The most promising candidate genes in Braunvieh are: CBLB on BTA01, which causes arthritis in rats; CAV2 on BTA04, which in effects mouse skeletal muscles; PTHLH on BTA05, which causes disease phenotypes related to the skeleton in humans, mice and zebrafish; SORCS2 on BTA06, which causes decreased susceptibility to injury in the mouse. Some of the significant SNPs (BTA01, BTA04, BTA05, BTA13, BTA16) reveal allelic heterogeneity - i.e. differences due to different allele frequencies between Fleckvieh and Braunvieh. Some of the significant regions (BTA01, BTA05, BTA13, BTA16) correlate to inter-breed differences in LD structure and may thus represent false-positive heterogeneity. However, positions on BTA06 (SORCS2), BTA14 and BTA24 mark Braunvieh-specific regions.\n\nConclusionsWe hypothesise that the observed genetic heterogeneity of hoof and leg disorders is a by-product of multigenerational differential selection of the breeds - towards dairy production in the case of Braunvieh and towards beef production in the case of Fleckvieh. Based on the current data set it is no possibly to unequivocally confirm/exclude the hypothesis of genetic heterogeneity in the susceptibility to leg disorders between Fleckvieh and Braunvieh because only explore it through associations and not the causal mutations. Rationales against genetic heterogeneity comprise a limited power of detection of true associations as well as differences in the length of LD blocks and in linkage phase between breeds. On the other hand, multigenerational differential selection of the breeds and no systematic differences in LD structure between the breeds favour the heterogeneity hypothesis at some of the significant sites.",

    "abstract": "A major issue in the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is \"de-duplication\" or removal of repeated isolates, for which there exist multiple methods. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) requires de-duplication by selecting only the first isolate of a given bacterial species per patient per surveillance period per specimen type per age group, gender, and infection origin stratification. However, no study on the comparative application of this method has been reported. The objective of this study was to evaluate differences in data tabulation between the WHO GLASS and the Japan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (JANIS) system, which counts both patients and isolates after removing repeated isolates of the same bacterial species per multiresistance phenotype isolated from a patient within 30 days, regardless of specimen type. All bacterial data, consisting of approximately 8 million samples from 1795 Japanese hospitals in 2017 were exported from the JANIS database, and were tabulated using either the de-duplication algorithm of GLASS, or JANIS. We compared the tabulated results of the total number of patients whose blood and urine cultures were taken and of the percentage of resistant isolates of Escherichia coli for each priority antibiotic. The number of patients per specimen type tabulated by the JANIS method was always smaller than that of GLASS. There was a small (< 3%) difference in the percentage of resistance of E. coli for any antibiotic between the two methods in both out- and inpatient settings and blood and urine isolates. The two tabulation methods did not show considerable differences in terms of the tabulated percentages of resistance for E. coli. We further discuss how the use of GLASS tabulations to create a public software and website that could help to facilitate the understanding of and treatment against AMR.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations in the kinase domain of the B-Raf protein have long been associated with cancers involving the MAPK pathway. One constitutive MAPK activating mutation in B-Raf, the V600E (valine to glutamate) replacement occurring adjacent to a site of threonine phosphorylation (T599) occurs in many types of cancer, and in a large percentage of certain cancers, such as melanoma. Because ATP binding activity and the V600E mutation are both known to alter the physical behavior of the activation loop in the B-Raf ATP binding domain, this system is especially amenable to comparative analyses of molecular dynamics simulations modeling various genetic and drug class variants. Here, we employ machine learning enabled identification of functionally conserved protein dynamics to compare how the binding interactions of four B-Raf inhibitors impact the functional loop dynamics controlling ATP activation. We demonstrate that drug development targeting B-Raf has progressively moved towards ATP competitive inhibitors that demonstrate less tendency to mimic the functionally conserved dynamic changes associated with ATP activation and leading to the side effect of hyperactivation (i.e. inducing MAPK activation in non-tumorous cells in the absence of secondary mutation). We compare the functional dynamic impacts of V600E and other sensitizing and drug resistance causing mutations in the regulatory loops of B-Raf, confirming sites of low mutational tolerance in these regions. Lastly, we investigate V600E sensitivity of B-Raf loop dynamics in an evolutionary context, demonstrating that while sensitivity has an ancient origin with primitive eukaryotes, it was also secondarily increased during early jawed vertebrate evolution.",

    "abstract": "The culture of differentiated human airway epithelial cells allows the study of pathogen-host interactions and innate immune responses in a physiologically relevant in vitro model. As the use of primary cell culture has gained popularity the availability of the reagents needed to generate these cultures has increased. In this study we assessed two different media, Promocell and PneumaCult, during the differentiation and maintenance of well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cell cultures (WD-PNECs). We compared and contrasted the consequences of these media on WD-PNEC morphological and physiological characteristics and their responses to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. We found that cultures generated using PneumaCult resulted in greater total numbers of smaller, tightly packed, pseudostratified cells. However, cultures from both media resulted in similar proportions of ciliated and goblet cells. There were no differences in RSV growth kinetics, although more ciliated cells were infected in the PneumaCult cultures. There was also significantly more IL-29/IFN{lambda}1 secreted from PneumaCult compared to Promocell cultures. In conclusion, the type of medium used for the differentiation of primary human airway epithelial cells impacts experimental results.",

    "abstract": "To develop effective management actions of riverine fisheries, it is important to monitor how fish resources (i.e., eggs) are recruited in the upper reaches of natural rivers, particularly where dams have been constructed, which potentially hinder life-history strategies. Here, we aimed to determine the State of drifting fish eggs resources, and the underlying environmental factors regulating the presence of fish eggs in the upper reaches of a river (Laibin section of Xijiang River, China). Based on surveys conducted over one spawning period (2016), we set out to: (1) describe the composition and abundance of drifting fish eggs in the 150 km Lainbin section under a dam control, and (2) analyze how the composition and distribution of fish eggs was correlated with environmental factors. A total of 15157 eggs belonging to two orders, four families, and 18 species were collected. Comparison of these data with historical records in the same area showed that the community structure of drifting eggs has changed considerably. Previously, the community was dominated by larger-bodied species, rather than the smaller species documented in 2016. Eggs were primarily detected between May and August. In the natural channel, the greatest abundance of eggs occurred during May and June. In comparison, the greatest abundance of eggs downstream of the dam was detected in July. The results of this study provide important information for water conservancy institutions towards managing regions containing dams to maintain the ecology of rivers and protect important fish resources.",

    "abstract": "In this study we analyze the growth-phase dependent metabolic states of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus by constructing a fully compartmented, mass and charge-balanced genome-scale metabolic model of this predatory bacterium (iCH457). Considering the differences between life cycle phases driving the growth of this predator, growth-phase condition-specific models have been generated allowing the systematic study of its metabolic capabilities. Using these unprecedented computational tools, we have been able to analyze, from a system level, the dynamic metabolism of the predatory bacteria as the life cycle progresses. We provide solid computational evidences supporting potential axenic growth of B. bacteriovoruss in a rich medium based its encoded metabolic capabilities. Our systems-level analysis confirms the presence of \"energy-saving\" mechanisms in this predator as well as an abrupt metabolic shift between the attack and intraperiplasmic growth phases. Our results strongly suggest that predatory bacterias metabolic networks have low robustness, likely hampering their ability to tackle drastic environmental fluctuations, thus being confined to stable and predictable habitats. Overall, we present here a valuable computational testbed based on predatory bacteria activity for rational design of novel and controlled biocatalysts in biotechnological/clinical applications.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYBacterial predation is an interspecific relationship widely extended in nature. Among other predators, Bdellovibrio and like organism (BALOs) have received recently a great attention due to the high potential applications such as biocontrol agent in medicine, agriculture, aquaculture and water treatment. Despite the increasing interest in of this predatory bacterium its complex lifestyle and growth conditions hamper the full exploitation of their biotechnological properties. In order to overcome these important shortcomings, we provide here the first genome-scale model of a predator bacterium constructed so far. By using the model as a computational testbed, we provide solid evidences of the metabolic autonomy of this interesting bacterium in term of growth, as well as its dynamic metabolism powering the biphasic life style of this predator. We found a low metabolic robustness thus suggesting that Bdellovibrio is more niche-specific than previously thought and that the environmental conditions governing predation may be relatively uniform. Overall, we provide here a valuable computational tool largely facilitating rational design of novel and controlled predator-based biocatalysts in biotechnological/clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "This is the first study to evaluate the efficacy of an autodissemination approach, as suggested by WHO. Therefore, the efficacy of an autodissemination approach in small-scale field trials against wild Aedes sp. population was evaluated in an urbanized setting, Malaysia. Lethal ovitraps enhanced with pyriproxyfen were used to control Aedes sp. populations at treatment sites, with the autodissemination activity was assessed using the WHO larval bioassays. Lethal ovitraps enhanced with pyriproxyfen effectively reduced of Aedes sp. population. All autodissemination stations were shown to be visited by Aedes sp. mosquitoes with 100% complete inhibition against eggs and larvae development. In the larvae bioassay, pupae mortality ranged from 14 to 40%. Statistically, a significant reduction of Aedes sp. population in the treatment sites compared to the untreated areas. The study proved for the autodissemination of pyriproxyfen to breeding habitats by wild Aedes sp. This technique is highly potentially for vector control activities. Future evaluation should focus on large-scale field trials.\n\nAuthor SummarySince 2012, Dataran Automobil, Seksyen 15, Shah Alam, was declared as one of the dengue hotspot areas. Major vector control activities were conducted by government, NGOs, social communities, and local authorities, but the number still rising. We conducted a new invention of autodissemination concepts in this area by an entomological study on mosquito populations reduction and dispersal abilities of the technique. We found that the technique has proven to control mosquito populations, but the other factors such as epidemiology link still unclear and need further clarification. Our finding highlighted the effectiveness of autodissemination strategies that can be considered as one of the alternative tools in vector control programme.",

    "abstract": "Despite the great interest to quantify the structure of ecological networks, the influence of morphological, ecological and evolutionary characteristics of the species still remains poorly understood. One of the challenging issues in ecology is how the interaction opportunity influences and provides changes to the associations between species, and which effects these changes have on ecological systems. To explore topological patterns in host-parasite networks, we sampled endoparasites-anurans interactions in South America in order to determine whether the effect of the ecological opportunity affects our understanding of the topological structure of the interaction networks. To identify the effect of the ecological opportunity for interaction, we investigated interactions in environments with and without flood pulse, where presence would promote higher ecological opportunity of interaction. Moreover, we created three theoretical models with filters to test the influence of the ecological opportunity for interaction: random, phylogeny and host body size. We then calculated commonly used binary network metrics (connectance, nestedness and modularity) for the networks generated by the theoretical models. We demonstrated that the interaction ecological opportunity changes the structure of host-parasite networks, and was influenced mainly by phylogeny and body size of the host. Our results indicate that environments that offer greater opportunities for interaction between species present networks with the most connectance/nestedness and less modularity. Networks in environments that do not have such opportunities for interaction depict the opposite pattern. Our results indicate that the ecological opportunity of interaction is reflected in an increase in interaction associations between species and affect/change the organization of these interactive assemblages. From an epidemiological point of view, changes in the composition of parasitic species are associated with risks of invasions and emerging diseases. In part, emerging diseases are the result of processes such as those occurring during the flood pulse, in which climate change, travel, and global trade create opportunities for new species associations. Our results provide insight into the dynamics of incorporating a new resource, considering an evolutionary factor responsible for these changes in species composition.",

    "abstract": "Telomeres adopt a lariat conformation and hence, engage in long and short distance intra-chromosome interactions. Budding yeast telomeres were proposed to fold back into subtelomeric regions, but a robust assay to quantitatively characterize this structure has been lacking. Therefore, it is not well understood how the interactions between telomeres and non-telomeric regions are established and regulated. We employ a telomeric chromosome conformation capture (Telo-3C) approach to directly analyze telomere folding and its maintenance in S. cerevisiae. We identify the histone modifiers Sir2, Sin3 and Set2 as critical regulators for telomere folding, which suggests that a distinct telomeric chromatin environment is a major requirement for the folding of yeast telomeres. We demonstrate that telomeres are not folded when cells enter replicative senescence, which occurs independently of short telomere length. Indeed, Sir2, Sin3 and Set2 protein levels are decreased during senescence and their absence may thereby prevent telomere folding. Additionally, we show that the homologous recombination machinery, including the Rad51 and Rad52 proteins, as well as the checkpoint component Rad53 are essential for establishing the telomere fold-back structure. This study outlines a method to interrogate telomere-subtelomere interactions at a single unmodified yeast telomere. Using this method, we provide insights into how the spatial arrangement of the chromosome end structure is established and demonstrate that telomere folding is compromised throughout replicative senescence.\n\nAuthor summaryTelomeres are the protective caps of chromosome ends and prevent the activation of a local DNA damage response. In many organisms, telomeres engage in a loop-like structure which may provide an additional layer of end protection. As we still lack insight into the regulation of the folded telomere structure, we used budding yeast to establish a method to measure telomere folding and then study the genetic requirements for its establishment. We found that cells require the homologous recombination machinery as well as components of the DNA damage checkpoint to successfully establish a folded telomere. Through the deletion of telomerase in budding yeast, we investigated how telomere folding was regulated during replicative senescence, a process that occurs in the majority of telomerase negative human cells. During senescence, telomeres gradually shorten and erode until cells stop dividing which is a potent tumor suppressor and prevents unscheduled growth of potential cancer cells. We found, that the folded telomere structure is compromised as part of the cellular senescence response, but not due to telomere shortening per se. We think, that an altered telomeric chromatin environment during senescence is important to maintain an open state - which may be important for signaling or for repair.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) plays key roles in post-transcriptional and chromatin modification levels as well as regulates various eukaryotic gene expressions which involved in stress responses, development and maintenance of genome integrity during developmental stages. The whole mechanism of RNAi pathway is directly involved with the gene-silencing process by the interaction of Dicer-Like (DCL), Argonaute (AGO) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) gene families. However, the genes of these three RNAi families are largely unknown yet in sweet orange (Citrus sinensis), though it is an economically important fruit plant all over the world. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation for genome-wide identification, characterization and diversity analysis of RNA silencing genes in C. sinensis was conducted and identified 4 CsDCL, 8 CsAGO and 4 CsRDR as RNAi genes. To characterize and validate the predicted genes of RNAi families, various bioinformatics analysis was conducted. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the predicted CsDCLs, CsAGOs and CsRDRs genes into four, six and four subgroups with the relevant genes of Arabidopsis respectively. The domain and motif composition analysis, the gene structure for all three-gene families exhibited almost homogeneity within the same group members while showed significant differences in between groups. The GO enrichment analysis results clearly indicated that the predicted genes have direct involvement into the RNAi process as expected in C. sinensis. Moreover, Cis-regulatory elements and regulatory transcription factor analysis of the reported RNAi genes demonstrated the diverse connection to the huge biological functions and regulatory pathways. The expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis showed that these genes are highly expressed in fruit and leaves which indicate that these reported genes have great involvement in C. sinensis food, flowering and fruit production. The expression analysis of the reported RNAi genes might be more useful to explore the most effective RNAi genes in C. sinensis for further biotechnological application.",

    "abstract": "Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) reflects the organization of functional networks in the brain. Functional networks measured during \"resting\", or task-absent, state are correlated with cognitive function, and much development of these networks occurs between infancy and adulthood. However, RSFC research in the intermediate years (especially between ages 3 and 5 years) has been limited, mainly due to a paucity of child-appropriate neural measures and behavioral paradigms. This paper presents a new paradigm to measure RSFC in young children, utilizing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Freeplay, a simple behavioral setup designed to approximate resting state in children. In Experiment 1, we recorded fNIRS data from children aged 3-8 years and adults aged 18-21 years and examined feasibility and validity of our measure of RSFC, and compared measures across the two groups. In Experiment 2, we recorded longitudinal data at two points (approximately 3 months apart) from children aged 3-5 years, and examined reliability under a variety of measures. In both experiments, all children were able to complete testing and provide usable data, a significant improvement over fMRI-based RSFC measurement in children. Results suggest this paradigm is practical and has good construct validity and test-retest reliability, and may contribute towards increasing the availability of reliable data on resting state networks in early childhood. In particular, these are some of the first positive results on the feasibility of reliably measuring functional connectivity in children aged 3-5 years.",

    "abstract": "The use of yeast systems to study the propagation of prions and amyloids has emerged as a crucial aspect of the global endeavor to understand those mechanisms. Yeast prion systems are intrinsically multi-scale: the molecular chemical processes are indeed coupled to the cellular processes of cell growth and division to influence phenotypical traits, observable at the scale of colonies. We introduce a novel modeling framework to tackle this difficulty using impulsive differential equations. We apply this approach to the [PSI+] yeast prion, which associated with the misconformation and aggregation of Sup35. We build a model that reproduces and unifies previously conflicting experimental observations on [PSI+] and thus sheds light onto characteristics of the intracellular molecular processes driving aggregate replication. In particular our model uncovers a kinetic barrier for aggregate replication at low densities, meaning the change between prion or prion-free phenotype is a bi-stable transition. This result is based on the study of prion curing experiments, as well as the phenomenon of colony sectoring, a phenotype which is often ignored in experimental assays and has never been modeled. Furthermore, our results provide further insight into the effect of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) on Sup35 aggregates. To qualitatively reproduce the GdnHCl curing experiment, aggregate replication must not be completely inhibited, which suggests the existence of a mechanism different than Hsp104-mediated fragmentation. Those results are promising for further development of the [PSI+] model, but also for extending the use of this novel framework to other yeast prion or amyloid systems.\n\nAuthor summaryIn the study of yeast prions, mathematical modeling is a powerful tool, in particular when it comes to facing the difficulties of multi-scale systems. In this study, we introduce a mathematical framework for investigating this problem in a unifying way. We focus on the yeast prion [PSI+] and present a simple molecular scheme for prion replication and a model of yeast budding. In order to qualitatively reproduce experiments, we need to introduce a non-linear mechanism in the molecular rates. This transforms the intracellular system into a bi-stable switch and allows for curing to occur, which is a crucial phenomenon for the study of yeast prions. To the best of our knowledge, no model in the literature includes such a mechanism, at least not explicitly. We also describe the GdnHCl curing experiment, and the propagon counting procedure. Reproducing this result requires challenging hypotheses that are commonly accepted, and our interpretation gives a new perspective on the concept of propagon. This study may be considered as a good example of how mathematical modeling can bring valuable insight into biological concepts and observations.",
