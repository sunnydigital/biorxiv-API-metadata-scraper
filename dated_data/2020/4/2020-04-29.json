    "abstract": "The systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an incurable autoimmune disease disproportionately affecting women and may lead to damage in multiple different organs. The marked heterogeneity in its clinical manifestations is a major obstacle in finding targeted treatments and involvement of multiple immune cell types further increases this complexity. Thus, identifying molecular subtypes that best correlate with disease heterogeneity and severity as well as deducing molecular cross-talk among major immune cell types that lead to disease progression are critical steps in the development of more informed therapies for SLE. Here we profile and analyze gene expression of six major circulating immune cell types from patients with well-characterized SLE (classical monocytes (n=64), T cells (n=24), neutrophils (n=24), B cells (n=20), conventional (n=20) and plasmacytoid (n=22) dendritic cells) and from healthy control subjects. Our results show that the interferon (IFN) response signature was the major molecular feature that classified SLE patients into two distinct groups: IFN-signature negative (IFNneg) and positive (IFNpos). We show that the gene expression signature of IFN response was consistent (i) across all immune cell types, (ii) all single cells profiled from three IFNpos donors using single-cell RNA-seq, and (iii) longitudinal samples of the same patient. For a better understanding of molecular differences of IFNpos versus IFNneg patients, we combined differential gene expression analysis with differential Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), which revealed a relatively small list of genes from classical monocytes including two known immune modulators, one the target of an approved therapeutic for SLE (TNFSF13B/BAFF: belimumab) and one itself a therapeutic for Rheumatoid Arthritis (IL1RN: anakinra). For a more integrative understanding of the cross-talk among different cell types and to identify potentially novel gene or pathway connections, we also developed a novel gene co-expression analysis method for joint analysis of multiple cell types named integrated WGNCA (iWGCNA). This method revealed an interesting cross-talk between T and B cells highlighted by a significant enrichment in the expression of known markers of T follicular helper cells (Tfh), which also correlate with disease severity in the context of IFNpos patients. Interestingly, higher expression of BAFF from all myeloid cells also shows a strong correlation with enrichment in the expression of genes in T cells that may mark circulating Tfh cells or related memory cell populations. These cell types have been shown to promote B cell class-switching and antibody production, which are well-characterized in SLE patients. In summary, we generated a large-scale gene expression dataset from sorted immune cell populations and present a novel computational approach to analyze such data in an integrative fashion in the context of an autoimmune disease. Our results reveal the power of a hypothesis-free and data-driven approach to discover drug targets and reveal novel cross-talk among multiple immune cell types specific to a subset of SLE patients. This approach is immediately useful for studying autoimmune diseases and is applicable in other contexts where gene expression profiling is possible from multiple cell types within the same tissue compartment.",

    "abstract": "Members of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex are causal agents of anthracnose in a wide range of commercially important plants. To provide an in-depth overview of its diversity, we sequenced the genomes of fungi belonging to this group, including multiple strains of C. fructicola (Cf) and C. siamense (Cs), as well as representatives of three previously unsequenced species, C. aenigma (Ca), C. tropicale and C. viniferum. Comparisons between multiple Cf and Cs strains led to the identification of accessory regions that show variable conservation in both lineages. These accessory regions encode effector candidate genes, including homologs of previously characterized effectors, organized in clusters of conserved synteny with copy number variations in different strains of Cf, Cs and Ca. Analysis of highly contiguous assemblies of Cf, Cs and Ca strains revealed the association of such accessory effector gene clusters with subtelomeric regions and repeat-rich minichromosomes and provided evidence of gene transfer between these two genomic compartments. In addition, expression analysis indicated that paralogs associated with clusters of conserved synteny showed a tendency for correlated gene expression. These data highlight the importance of subtelomeric regions and repeat-rich chromosomes to the genome plasticity of Colletotrichum fungi.",

    "abstract": "Within deep tissue sites, extracellular bacterial pathogens often replicate in clusters that are surrounded by immune cells. Disease is modulated by interbacterial interactions as well as bacterial-host cell interactions resulting in microbial growth, phagocytic attack and secretion of host antimicrobial factors. To overcome the limited ability to manipulate these infection sites, we established a system for Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb) growth in microfluidics-driven microdroplets that regenerates microbial social behavior in tissues. Chemical generation of nitric oxide (NO) in the absence of immune cells was sufficient to reconstruct microbial social behavior, as witnessed by expression of the NO-inactivating protein Hmp on the extreme periphery of microcolonies, mimicking spatial regulation in tissues. Similarly, activated macrophages that expressed inducible NO synthase (iNOS) drove peripheral expression of Hmp, allowing regeneration of social behavior observed in tissues. These results argue that topologically correct microbial tissue growth and associated social behavior can be reconstructed in culture.",

    "abstract": "The chloroplast ATP synthase (CF1Fo) contains a specific feature to the green lineage: a {gamma}-subunit redox domain which contains a cysteine couple and interacts with the torque-generating {beta}DELSEED-loop. Based on the recently solved structure of this domain, it was proposed to function as a chock. In vitro, {gamma}-disulfide formation slows down the activity of the CF1Fo at low transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient [Formula]. Here, we utilize in vivo absorption spectroscopy measurements for functional CF1Fo activity characterization in Arabidopsis leaves. The spectroscopic method allows us to measure the [Formula] present in dark-adapted leaves, and to identify its mitochondrial sources. Furthermore, we follow the fate of the extra [Formula] generated by an illumination, including its osmotic and electric components, and from there we estimate the lifetime of the light-generated ATP. In contrast with a previous report [Joliot and Joliot, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1777 (2008) 676-683], the CF1Fo {gamma}-subunit exists mostly in an oxidized form in the dark-adapted state. To study the redox regulation of the CF1Fo, we used thiol agent infiltration in WT and a mutant that does not form the {gamma}-disulfide. The obtained [Formula] -dependent CF1Fo activity profile in the two {gamma}-redox states in vivo reconciles with previous biochemical in vitro findings [Junesch and Graber, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 893 (1987) 275-288]. The highest rates of ATP synthesis we measured in the two {gamma}-redox state were similar at high [Formula]. In the presence of the {gamma}-dithiol, similar rates were obtained at a ~45 mV lower [Formula] value compared to the oxidized state, which closely resembled the energetic gap of 0.7 {Delta}pH units reported in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Malate is the major substrate for respiratory oxidative phosphorylation in illuminated leaves. In the mitochondria malate is converted to citrate either for replenishing tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle with carbon, or to be exported as substrate for cytosolic biosynthetic pathways or for storage in the vacuole. In this study, we show that DIC2 functions as a mitochondrial malate/citrate carrier in vivo in Arabidopsis. DIC2 knockout (dic2-1) results in growth retardation that can only be restored by expressing DIC2 but not its closest homologs DIC1 or DIC3, indicating that their substrate preferences are not identical. Malate uptake by non-energised dic2-1 mitochondria is reduced but can be restored in fully energised mitochondria by altering fumarate and pyruvate/oxaloacetate transport. A reduced citrate export but an increased citrate accumulation in substrate-fed, energised dic2-1 mitochondria suggest that DIC2 facilitates the export of citrate from the matrix. Consistent with this, metabolic defects in response to a sudden dark shift or prolonged darkness could be observed in dic2-1 leaves, including altered malate, citrate and 2-oxoglutarate utilisation. There was no alteration in TCA cycle metabolite pools and NAD redox state at night; however, isotopic glucose tracing reveals a reduction in citrate labelling in dic2-1 which resulted in a diversion of flux towards glutamine, as well as the removal of excess malate via asparagine and threonine synthesis. Overall, these observations indicate that DIC2 is responsible in vivo for mitochondrial malate import and citrate export which coordinate carbon metabolism between the mitochondrial matrix and the other cell compartments.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMitochondria are pivotal for plant metabolism. One of their central functions is to provide carbon intermediates for the synthesis of critical building blocks, such as amino acids. Malate import and citrate export are two of the most recognised and specialised features of the mitochondrial role in the plant cellular metabolic network, yet the possibility that a single carrier would unite both functions has not been considered. Here, we have demonstrated that DIC2 preferentially fulfils these two functions in Arabidopsis thaliana in vivo, making it a bifunctional gateway for two major metabolite fluxes into and out of the mitochondrial matrix in the plant cell. Our results highlight the significance of DIC2 in cooperation with other mitochondrial carriers in maintaining metabolic balance even under challenging environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "A signaling complex comprising members of the LORELEI (LRE)-LIKE GPI-anchored protein (LLG) and Catharanthus roseus RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1-LIKE (CrRLK1L) families perceive RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides and regulate growth, reproduction, immunity, and stress responses in Arabidopsis. Genes encoding these proteins are members of multi-gene families in most angiosperms and could generate thousands of signaling complex variants. However, the link(s) between expansion of these gene families and the functional diversification of this critical signaling complex as well as the evolutionary factors underlying the maintenance of gene duplicates remain unknown. Here, we investigated LLG gene family evolution, function, and expression in angiosperms. We found that LLGs in monocots and eudicots are descendants of a duplication early in angiosperm evolution and that both ancient and recent LLG duplicates are retained. Complementation and expression analysis showed that expression divergence of LLGs (regulatory subfunctionalization), rather than functional divergence, explains the retention of paralogs in Brassicales. All but one extant monocot and eudicot species examined maintained an LLG copy with preferential expression in male reproductive tissues, with the other duplicate copies showed highest levels of expression in female or vegetative tissues. Interestingly, the single LLG copy in Amborella (sister to all other angiosperms) is expressed vastly higher in male compared to female reproductive or vegetative tissues. Reconstruction of expression evolution showed that the highest inferred expression levels for the single copy ancestral angiosperm LLG was in male reproductive tissues. We propose that expression divergence played an important role in maintenance of LLG duplicates in angiosperms.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryExpression divergence played an important role in maintenance of two sub-groups of LLG duplicates in angiosperms",

    "abstract": "Time-series data on arthropod populations are critical for understanding the magnitude, direction, and drivers of abundance changes. However, most arthropod monitoring programs are short-lived and limited in taxonomic resolution and spatial extent. Consequently, variation in population dynamics among taxa and habitats remains poorly understood. Monitoring data from the Arctic are particularly underrepresented, yet important to assessments of species abundance changes because many anthropogenic drivers of change that are present in other regions are absent in polar regions. Here, we utilise 24 years of abundance data from Zackenberg in High-Arctic Greenland, which is the longest running Arctic arthropod monitoring program, to study temporal trends in abundance. Despite a strong warming signal in air temperature, we only find evidence of weak temporal trends in arthropod abundances across most taxa. These trends are more pronounced in the most recent decade, with change point analyses suggesting distinct non-linear dynamics within some functional groups such as predators and detritivores. Although the abundances of many taxa were correlated, we detected both positive and negative correlations, suggesting that multiple processes are affecting arthropod populations even in this relatively simple Arctic food web. Finally, we found clear differences among species within single families of arthropods, indicating that an apparent lack of change in abundance at broader taxonomic or functional levels could mask substantial species-specific trends. Our results reiterate the need for more basic research into the life-history, ecology, and adaptation of arthropod species to better understand their sensitivity to global changes.\n\nSignificance statementTerrestrial arthropods, including insects and spiders, serve critical ecosystem functions and are excellent indicators of environmental change due to their physiology, short generation time, and abundance. The Arctic, with its rapid climate change and limited direct anthropogenic impact, is ideal for examining arthropod population dynamics. We use the most comprehensive, standardized dataset available on Arctic arthropods to evaluate the variability in population dynamics for the most common arthropod groups at various taxonomic levels across 24 years. Our results highlight that temporal trends of arthropod populations seem less directional in the Arctic than in temperate regions. Although abundances of some arthropod taxa are declining, particularly in recent decades, population trends still display high variation among time periods, taxa, and habitats.",

Here, we show how the evolutionary genetic species concept and the K/{theta} ratio can be applied to bacteria, using the sequences from some genes of the core genome that are rarely, if ever, transferred horizontally between different species. This completes the demonstration that K/{theta} is a general method for species delimitation, applicable to all organisms. Also, it adds to the evidence that bacteria have species in the most general sense, even though they have the ability to exchange genes across species boundaries. Finally, we show that a published critique of the use of K/{theta} [&ge;] 4 as a criterion for independently evolving species rests on two errors in the application of population/evolutionary genetic theory.",

New antigenic variants have a substantial selective advantage at the population level, but these variants are rarely selected within-host, even in previously immune individuals. Using a mathematical model, we show that the temporal asynchrony between within-host virus exponential growth and antibody-mediated selection could limit within-host antigenic evolution. If selection for new antigenic variants acts principally at the point of initial virus inoculation, where small virus populations encounter well-matched mucosal antibodies in previously infected individuals, there can exist protection against reinfection that does not regularly produce observable new antigenic variants within individual infected hosts. Our results provide a theoretical explanation for how virus antigenic evolution can be highly selective at the global level but nearly neutral within host.

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is a disease marked by progressive and irreversible hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage breakdown that affects the lives of millions of patients worldwide. Female sex and menopause are both risk factors for knee osteoarthritis, indicating that estrogen could play a role in this disease. In this study, RNA sequencing was used to determine the effects of estrogen treatment on human meniscal cells. Differences in the number and type of differentially expressed genes were seen based on donor sex, estrogen dose, and dosing kinetics. Significantly more differentially expressed genes were seen from male meniscal cells in response to all dosing conditions compared to female cells. Importantly, more genes were differentially expressed in cells treated with continuous dosing of estrogen, which has been shown to stimulate genomic estrogen signaling, as compared to pulsed dosing. Additionally, functional enrichment analysis revealed that many genes of the extracellular matrix, which is important for joint health and injury repair, were differentially expressed. Overall, this initial study lays the groundwork for future avenues to pursue the effect of estrogen delivery on regenerative pathways. This critical analysis will then inform the design and implementation of estrogen replacement therapies to promote meniscal health and reduce the onset of osteoarthritis.",

    "abstract": "Millions of women avoid using available contraceptives and risk unintended pregnancies every year, due to perceived and/or real side-effects associated with the use of exogenous hormones. Naturally occurring anti-sperm antibodies can prevent fertilization in immune infertile women by limiting sperm permeation through mucus, particularly multivalent antibodies such as sIgA that offers robust agglutination potencies. Unfortunately, sIgA remains challenging to produce in large quantities and easily aggregates. Here, we designed two tetravalent anti-sperm IgGs with a Fab domain previously isolated from an immune infertile woman. Both constructs possess at least 4-fold greater agglutination potency and induced much more rapid sperm agglutination than the parent IgG while exhibiting comparable production yields and identical thermostability as the parent IgG. These tetravalent IgGs offer promise for non-hormonal contraception and underscore the multimerization of IgG as a promising strategy to improve existing mAb therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "In humans, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been used as a clinical tool in diagnosis and/or prognosis of a variety of cancers and medical conditions, as well as in measuring physiological stress over time. Given the close phylogenetic relationship and physical similarities between humans and apes, NLR may similarly be a useful diagnostic tool in assessing chimpanzee health. Only one study has examined NLR in apes, reporting that NLR increased with age and was affected by body-mass index and sex. In the current study, we examined changes in NLR data from longitudinal health records for 443 chimpanzees in two captive chimpanzee populations. Using these data, we analyzed intra-individual changes and inter-individual differences in NLR as a function of age, rearing history, and sex. Contrary to previous studies in humans and the one previous study in chimpanzees, NLR values did not change over a 10-year timespan within individual chimpanzees. However, cross-sectional comparisons revealed a significant quadratic relationship between age and NLR with the highest values during mid-life (20-30 years of age) and the lowest values in younger and older individuals. Additionally, males and mother-reared individuals had higher NLR than females and nursery-reared chimpanzees, respectively. Lastly, males and those with higher NLR values died at younger ages. These findings may suggest that NLR can be used a predictor of longevity in chimpanzees. However, given the complexities of these relationships, more research is needed to determine the utility of NLR as a diagnostic health tool for use in chimpanzees.",

Such symbiont effects on host resource acquisition and allocation are often simultaneous and difficult to disentangle. Here we partitioned symbiont effects on host resource acquisition and allocation using a new framework based on the analysis of a well-established trade-off between host fitness components. This framework was used to analyze the effect of symbiotic yeast on the larval development of Drosophila larvae in field-realistic conditions. The screening of eighteen yeast fresh isolates showed they had similar effects on the resource acquisition in Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans and D. suzukii but species-specific effects on resource allocation between either larval development speed or adult size. These differences shed light on the ecology of Drosophila flies and illustrate why distinguishing between these qualitatively different effects of microorganisms on hosts is essential to understand and predict symbiosis evolution.",

Here we confirm the assumption that they affect pollen by altering ion transport through the plasma membrane; as a more deferred effect, pollen proteome is modified. We detected ROS in stigma exudate, found hyperpolarization in exudate-treated growing pollen tubes and used flow cytometry of pollen protoplasts to compare the effects of fresh exudate and exogenous H2O2 on pollen tube plasmalemma. Exudate causes plasmalemma hyperpolarization similar to the one provoked by H2O2, which is abolished by catalase treatment and ROS quencher MnTMPP. Inhibitory analysis indicates the participation of Ca2+- and K+-conducting channels in the observed hyperpolarization, linking obtained data with previous patch-clamp studies in vitro. For a deeper understanding of pollen response to ROS we analyzed proteome alterations in H2O2-treated pollen grains. We found 50 unique proteins and 20 differently accumulated proteins that are mainly involved in cell metabolism, energetics, protein synthesis and folding. Thus, pollen is getting ready for effective resource usage, construction of cellular components and rapid growth.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe active substance in stigma exudate is H2O2\nC_LIO_LIH2O2 causes hyperpolarization mediated by the activation of cation channels.\nC_LIO_LIH2O2 affects pollen proteome; we found 50 unique proteins.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The progression of diabetic complications does not halt despite termination of hyperglycemia, suggesting a \"metabolic memory\" phenomenon. However, whether metabolic memory exists in and affects the healing of diabetic wounds, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms, remain unclear. In this study, we found that wound healing was delayed and angiogenesis was decreased in diabetic mice, despite normalization of glycemic control. Thus, we hypothesized that transient hyperglycemic spikes may be a risk factor for diabetic wound healing. We showed that transient hyperglycemia caused persistent damage to the vascular endothelium. Transient hyperglycemia directly upregulated DNMT1 expression, leading to the hypermethylation of Ang-1 and reduced Ang-1 expression, which, in turn, induced long-lasting activation of nuclear factor (NF)-{kappa}B and subsequent endothelial dysfunction. An in vivo study further showed that inhibition of DNMT1 promoted angiogenesis and accelerated diabetic wound healing by regulating the Ang-1/NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway. These results highlight the dramatic and long-lasting effects of transient hyperglycemic spikes on wound healing and suggest that DNMT1 is a novel target for diabetic vascular complications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a serious infectious disease affecting human health worldwide and rapidly declared a pandemic by WHO. Early, several RT-qPCR were designed by using only the first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence.\n\nObjectivesA few days later, when additional SARS-CoV-2 genome were retrieved, the kit GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test was designed to provide a highly specific detection method and commercially available worldwide. The kit was validated following criteria recommended by the UNE/EN ISO 17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 15189:2012.\n\nMethodsThe present study approached the in silico specificity of the GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test and RT-qPCR designs currently published. The empirical validation parameters specificity (inclusivity/exclusivity), quantitative phase analysis (10-106 copies), reliability (repeatability/reproducibility) and sensitivity (detection/quantification limits) were evaluated for a minimum of 10-15 assays. Diagnostic validation was achieved by two independent reference laboratories, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), (Madrid, Spain) and the Public Health England (PHE; Colindale, London, UK).\n\nResultsThe GPS RT-qPCR primers and probe showed the highest number of mismatches with the closet related non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, including some indels. The kits passed all parameters of validation with strict acceptance criteria. Results from reference laboratories 100% correlated with these obtained by suing reference methods and received an evaluation with 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.\n\nConclusionsThe GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test, available with full analytical and diagnostic validation, represents a case of efficient transfer of technology being successfully used since the pandemic was declared. The analysis suggested the GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test is the more exclusive by far.",

We show here that dendritic cells (DCs) display unusually high eIF2 phosphorylation, which is mostly caused by a developmentally regulated activation of the ER kinase PERK (EIF2AK3). Despite high p-eIF2 levels, differentiated DCs display active protein synthesis and no signs of a chronic ISR. eIF2 phosphorylation does not majorly impact DC differentiation nor cytokines production. It is however important to adapt protein homeostasis to the variations imposed on DCs by the immune or physiological contexts. This biochemical specificity prevents translation arrest and expression of the transcription factor ATF4 during ER-stress induction by subtilase cytotoxin or upon DC stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharides. This is also exemplified by the influence of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics on eIF2 phosphorylation and the migratory deficit observed in PERK-deficient DCs.",

Previous studies have shown, however, that specific odor binding to ORco, the common subunit of odorant receptor heteromers, may alter allosterically olfactory receptor function and affect profoundly subsequent behavioral responses. Here we report on the identification of several antagonists of the odorant receptor co-receptor of the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, AgamORco, in a small collection of natural volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using a relevant insect cell-based screening platform. Because some of the identified antagonists were previously shown to strongly repel Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes, here we examined the bioactivities of the identified antagonists against Aedes, the third major genus of the Culicidae family. The tested antagonists were found to inhibit the function of Ae. aegypti ORco ex vivo and repel Asian tiger, Ae. albopictus, adult mosquitoes. Specific antagonist binary mixtures elicited higher repellency than single antagonists. Binding competition assays suggested antagonist binding to distinct ORco sites as a likely cause for the enhanced repellence of the blends. These findings demonstrate that a simple screening assay may be used for the identification of allosteric modifiers of olfactory-driven behaviors capable of providing enhanced indoor and outdoor protection against multiple mosquito borne infectious diseases.",

This can lead to dormancy or cell death; to avoid this, cells need a way to remove cOA from the cell once a viral infection has been defeated. Enzymes specialised for this task are known as ring nucleases, but are limited in their distribution. Here, we demonstrate that the widespread CRISPR associated protein Csx3, previously described as an RNA deadenylase, is a ring nuclease that rapidly degrades cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA4). The enzyme has an unusual cooperative reaction mechanism involving an active site that spans the interface between two dimers, sandwiching the cA4 substrate.

    "abstract": "The cellular cytoskeleton provides the cell with mechanical rigidity and mediates mechanical interaction between cells and with the extracellular environment. The actin structure plays a key role in regulating cellular behaviors like motility, cell sorting, or cell polarity. From the earliest stages of development, in naive stem cells, the critical mechanical role of the actin structure is becoming recognized as a vital cue for correct segregation and lineage control of cells and as a regulatory structure that controls several transcription factors. The ultrastructure of the earliest embryonic stem cells has not been investigated in living cells despite the fact that it is well-known that cells undergo morphological shape changes during the earliest stages of development. Here, we provide 3D investigations of the actin cytoskeleton of naive mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in clusters of sizes relevant for early stage development using super resolution optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). We quantitatively describe the morphological, cytoskeletal and mechanical changes appearing between cells in small clusters at the earliest stages of inner cell mass differentiation, as recapitulated by cells cultured under two media conditions, 2i and Serum/LIF, thus promoting the naive and first primed state, respectively. High resolution images of living stem cells showed that the peripheral actin structure undergoes a dramatic change between the two media conditions. The actin organization changed from being predominantly oriented parallel to the cell surface in 2i medium to a more radial orientation in Serum/LIF. Finally, using an optical trapping based technique, we detected micro-rheological differences in the cell periphery between the cells cultured in these two media, with results correlating well with the observed nano-architecture of the ESCs in the two different differentiation stages. These results pave the way for linking physical properties and cytoskeletal architecture to the development from naive stem cells to specialized cells.\n\nStatement of SignificanceCells receive mechanical signals and must provide mechanical feedback, therefore, physical properties are instrumental for cell-cell interactions. Mechanical signals mediated through the cell surface can significantly affect transport of signaling molecules and can influence biological processes like transcriptional regulation. To achieve a deeper insight into how the cytoskeletal structure is responsible for cell shape and material properties at the earliest stages of development, we employ super-resolution microscopy to image actin fibers in clusters of embryonic stem cells mimicking early development. By modification of the culturing conditions, we investigate how the actin cytoskeleton and micro-rheological properties of ESCs change between the naive ground state and the stage primed towards epiblast, thus revealing a correlation between differentiation stage and cytoskeletal structure.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidences has established that in many cases proteins may preserve most of their function and flexibility in a crystalline environment, and several techniques are today capable to detect transiently-populated states of macromolecules in tightly packed lattices. Intriguingly, in the case of amyloidogenic precursors, the presence of these conformations (hidden to conventional crystallographic studies) can be correlated to the pathological fate of the native fold.\n\nIt remains unclear, however, to which extent these minor conformations reflect the protein behaviour that is more commonly studied in solution. Here, we address this question by investigating some biophysical properties of a prototypical amyloidogenic system, {beta}2-microglobulin ({beta}2m) in solution and in microcrystalline state.\n\nBy combining NMR chemical shifts with Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we confirmed that conformational dynamics of {beta}2m native state in the crystal lattice is in keeping with what observed in solution.\n\nA comparative study of protein stability in solution and in crystallo is then carried out, monitoring the change in protein secondary structure at increasing temperature by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The increased structural order of the crystalline state contributes to provide better resolved spectral components compared to those collected in solution and crucially, the crystalline samples display thermal stabilities in good agreement with the trend observed in solution.\n\nOverall, this work shows that protein stability and occurrence of pathological hidden states in crystals parallel their solution counterpart, confirming the interest of crystals as a platform for the biophysical characterisation of processes such as unfolding and aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Pathogens originating from wildlife (zoonoses) pose a significant public health burden, comprising the majority of emerging infectious diseases. Efforts to control and prevent zoonotic disease have traditionally focused on animal-to-human transmission, or \"spillover\". However, in the modern era, increasing international mobility and commerce facilitate the spread of infected humans, non-human animals (hereafter animals), and their products worldwide, thereby increasing the risk that zoonoses will be introduced to new geographic areas. Imported zoonoses can potentially  spill back to infect local wildlife--a danger magnified by urbanization and other anthropogenic pressures that increase contacts between human and wildlife populations. In this way, humans can function as vectors, dispersing zoonoses from their ancestral enzootic systems to establish reservoirs elsewhere in novel animal host populations. Once established, these enzootic cycles are largely unassailable by standard control measures and have the potential to feed human epidemics. Understanding when and why translocated zoonoses establish novel enzootic cycles requires disentangling ecologically complex and stochastic interactions between the zoonosis, the human population, and the natural ecosystem. We address this challenge by delineating potential ecological mechanisms affecting each stage of enzootic establishment--wildlife exposure, enzootic infection, and persistence--applying existing ecological concepts from epidemiology, invasion biology, and population ecology. We ground our study in the neotropics, where four arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of zoonotic origin--yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses--have separately been introduced into the human population. This paper is a step towards developing a framework for predicting and preventing novel enzootic cycles in the face of zoonotic translocations.",

    "abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) provides effective treatment for hematologic malignancies and immune disorders. Monitoring of post-transplant complications is critical, yet current diagnostic options are limited. Here, we show that cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood is a highly versatile analyte for monitoring of the most important complications that occur after HCT: graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a frequent immune complication of HCT; infection; relapse of underlying disease; and graft failure. We demonstrate that these different therapeutic complications can be informed from a single assay, low-coverage bisulfite sequencing of cfDNA, followed by disease-specific bioinformatic analyses. To inform GVHD, we profile cfDNA methylation marks to trace the cfDNA tissues-of-origin and to quantify tissue-specific injury. To inform on infections, we implement metagenomic cfDNA profiling. To inform cancer relapse, we implement analyses of tumor-specific genomic aberrations. Finally, to detect graft failure we quantify the proportion of donor and recipient specific cfDNA. We applied this assay to 170 plasma samples collected from 27 HCT recipients at predetermined time points before and after allogeneic HCT. We found that the abundance of solid-organ derived cfDNA in the blood at one-month after HCT is an early predictor of acute graft-versus-host disease (area under the curve, 0.88). Metagenomic profiling of cfDNA revealed the frequent occurrence of viral reactivation in this patient population. The fraction of donor specific cfDNA was indicative of cell chimerism, relapse and remission, and the fraction of tumor specific cfDNA was informative of cancer relapse. This proof-of-principle study shows that cfDNA has the potential to improve the care of allogeneic HCT recipients by enabling earlier detection and better prediction of the complex array of complications that occur after HCT.",

We also generated analogues of GLP-1, GCG and GIP which in some cases showed selective reduction in {beta}-arrestin-2 recruitment versus cAMP signalling compared to the parent peptide. Despite reduced acute signalling potency and/or efficacy, some biased GLP-1 and GIP analogues increased maximal sustained insulin secretion from INS-1 832/3 clonal beta cells, although only at high agonist concentrations.

Although Pongamia pinnata is reported to be a salt tolerant semiarid tree crop, the adaptive mechanisms to saline environment are elusive. The present investigation describes alterations in hormonal and metabolic responses in correlation with physiological and molecular variations in leaves and roots of Pongamia at sea salinity level (3% NaCl) for 8 days. At physiological level, salinity induced adjustments in plant morphology, leaf gas exchange and ion accumulation patterns were observed. Our study also revealed that phytohormones including JAs and ABA play crucial role in promoting the salt adaptive strategies such as apoplasmic Na+ sequestration and cell wall lignification in leaves and roots of Pongamia. Correlation studies demonstrated that hormones including ABA, JAs and SA showed a positive interaction with selective compatible metabolites (sugars, polyols and organic acids) to aid in maintaining osmotic balance and conferring salt tolerance to Pongamia. At the molecular level, our data showed that differential expression of transporter genes as well as antioxidant genes regulate the ionic and ROS homeostasis in Pongamia. Collectively, these results shed new insights on an integrated physiological, structural, molecular and metabolic adaptations conferring salinity tolerance to Pongamia.\n\nHigh lightOur data, for the first time, provide new insights for an integrated molecular and metabolic adaptation conferring salinity tolerance in Pongamia.

Due to technological advances in sequencing, such as the widely used non-invasive prenatal test, massive datasets of ultra-low coverage sequencing are being generated. These datasets are characterized by having a large amount of missing genotype information. We present EMU, a method for inferring population structure in the presence of rampant non-random missingness.\n\nResultsWe show through simulations that several commonly used PCA methods can not handle missing data arisen from various sources, which leads to biased results as individuals are projected into the PC space based on their amount of missingness. In terms of accuracy, EMU outperforms an existing method that also accommodates missingness while being competitively fast. We further tested EMU on around 100K individuals of the Phase 1 dataset of the Chinese Millionome Project, that were shallowly sequenced to around 0.08x. From this data we are able to capture the population structure of the Han Chinese and to reproduce previous analysis in a matter of CPU hours instead of CPU years.\n\nConclusionsEMUs capability to accurately infer population structure in the presence of missingness will be of increasing importance with the rising number of large-scale genetic datasets.

    "abstract": "The neural basis of behavioural changes in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) remains a controversial issue. One factor contributing to this challenge is the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in ASD, which suggests that several different system disruptions may contribute to diverse patterns of impairment between and within study samples. Here, we took a retrospective approach, using SFARI data to study ASD by focusing on participants with genetic imbalances targeting the dopaminergic system. Using complex network analysis, we investigated the relations between participants, Gene Ontology (GO) and gene dosage related to dopaminergic neurotransmission from a polygenic point of view. We converted network analysis into a machine learning binary classification problem to differentiate ASD diagnosed participants from DD (developmental delay) diagnosed participants. Using 1846 participants to train a Random Forest algorithm, our best classifier achieved on average a diagnosis predicting accuracy of 85.18% (sd 1.11%) on a test sample of 790 participants using gene dosage features. In addition, we observed that if the classifier uses GO features it was also able to infer a correct response based on the previous examples because it is tied to a set of biological process, molecular functions and cellular components relevant to the problem. This yields a less variable and more compact set of features when comparing with gene dosage classifiers. Other facets of knowledge-based systems approaches addressing ASD through network analysis and machine learning, providing an interesting avenue of research for the future, are presented through the study.\n\nLay SummaryThere are important issues in the differential diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders. Gene dosage effects may be important in this context. In this work, we studied genetic alterations related to dopamine processes that could impact brain development and function of 2636 participants. On average, from a genetic sample we were able to correctly separate autism from developmental delay with an accuracy of 85%.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic scores have become a central tool in human genetics research. LDpred is a popular method for deriving polygenic scores based on summary statistics and a matrix of correlation between genetic variants. However, LDpred has limitations that may reduce its predictive performance. Here we present LDpred2, a new version of LDpred that addresses these issues. We also provide two new options in LDpred2: a \"sparse\" option that can learn effects that are exactly 0, and an \"auto\" option that directly learns the two LDpred parameters from data. We benchmark predictive performance of LDpred2 against the previous version on simulated and real data, demonstrating substantial improvements in robustness and predictive accuracy compared to LDpred1. We then show that LDpred2 also outperforms other polygenic score methods recently developed, with a mean AUC over the 8 real traits analyzed here of 65.1%, compared to 63.8% for lassosum, 62.9% for PRS-CS and 61.5% for SBayesR.

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs are non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. In the placenta, the master regulator of fetal growth and development, microRNAs shape the basic processes of trophoblast biology and specific microRNA have been associated with fetal growth. To comprehensively assess the role of microRNAs in placental function and fetal development, we have performed small RNA sequencing to profile placental microRNAs from two independent mother-infant cohorts: the Rhode Island Child Health Study (n=225) and the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (n=317). We modeled microRNA counts on infant birthweight percentile (BWP) in each cohort, while accounting for race, sex, parity and technical factors, using negative binomial generalized linear models. We identified microRNAs that were differentially expressed (DEmiRs) with BWP at false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05 in both cohorts. hsa-miR-532-5p (miR-532) was positively associated with BWP in both cohorts. By integrating parallel whole transcriptome and small RNA sequencing in the RICHS cohort, we identified putative targets of miR-532. These targets are enriched for pathways involved in adipogenesis, adipocytokine signaling, energy metabolism and hypoxia response, and included Leptin, which we further demonstrated to have decreasing expression with increasing BWP, particularly in male infants. Overall, we have shown a robust and reproducible association of miR-532 with BWP, which could influence BWP through regulation of adipocytokines Leptin and Adiponectin.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIncreasing number of gene expression profiles has enabled the use of complex models, such as deep unsupervised neural networks, to extract a latent space from these profiles. However, expression profiles, especially when collected in large numbers, inherently contain variations introduced by technical artifacts (e.g., batch effects) and uninteresting biological variables (e.g., age) in addition to the true signals of interest. These sources of variations, called confounders, produce embeddings that fail to transfer to different domains, i.e., an embedding learned from one dataset with a specific confounder distribution does not generalize to different distributions. To remedy this problem, we attempt to disentangle confounders from true signals to generate biologically informative embeddings.\n\nResultsIn this paper, we introduce the AD-AE (Adversarial Deconfounding AutoEncoder) approach to deconfounding gene expression latent spaces. The AD-AE model consists of two neural networks: (i) an autoencoder to generate an embedding that can reconstruct original measurements, and (ii) an adversary trained to predict the confounder from that embedding. We jointly train the networks to generate embeddings that can encode as much information as possible without encoding any confounding signal. By applying AD-AE to two distinct gene expression datasets, we show that our model can (1) generate embeddings that do not encode confounder information, (2) conserve the biological signals present in the original space, and (3) generalize successfully across different confounder domains. We demonstrate that AD-AE outperforms standard autoencoder and other deconfounding approaches.\n\nAvailabilityOur code and data are available at https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/abdincer/ad-ae.\n\nContactabdincer@cs.washington.edu; suinlee@cs.washington.edu",

    "abstract": "Distinguishing neutral and adaptive genetic variation is one of the main challenges in investigating processes shaping population structure in the wild, and landscape genomics can help identify signatures of adaptation to contrasting environments. Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) is an anadromous salmonid and the most harvested fish species by Inuit people, particularly so in Nunavik (Canada), one of the most recently deglaciated region in the world. Unlike most other anadromous salmonids, Arctic Char occupy coastal habitats near their overwintering rivers during their marine phase. The main objective of this study was to document the putative neutral and adaptive genomic variation of anadromous Arctic Char populations in Nunavik (Quebec, Canada) and bordering regions. A second objective was to interpret our results in the context of fisheries management in Nunavik. We used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to genotype 18,112 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 650 individuals sampled in 23 locations (average sample size per location = 28) along >2,000 km of coastline. Our results reveal a hierarchical genetic structure, whereby neighboring hydrographic systems harbour distinct populations grouping within major oceanographic basins, namely the Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Ungava Bay and Labrador Sea. We found genetic diversity and differentiation to be consistent with both the expected post-glacial recolonization history and patterns of isolation-by-distance reflecting contemporary gene flow. Furthermore, using three gene-environment association (GEA) methods we found genomic evidence for local adaptation to freshwater and marine environmental components, especially in relation to sea-surface and air temperatures during summer, as well as salinity. Our results support fisheries management at a regional level, and other implications on hatchery projects and adaptation to climate change are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Rainbow trout has a male heterogametic (XY) sex determination system controlled by a major sex-determining gene, sdY. Unexpectedly, a few phenotypically masculinised fish are regularly observed in all-female farmed trout stocks. To better understand the genetic determinism underlying spontaneous maleness in XX-rainbow trout, we recorded the phenotypic sex of 20,210 XX-rainbow trout from a French farm at 10 and 15 months post-hatching. The masculinisation rate was 1.45%. We performed two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using both medium-throughput genotyping (31,811 SNPs) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS, 8.7 million SNPs) on a subsample of 1,139 individuals classified as females, intersex or males. The genomic heritability of maleness ranged between 0.48 and 0.62 depending on the method and number of SNPs used for estimation. At the 31K SNPs level, we detected four QTLs on three chromosomes (Omy1, Omy12 and Omy20). Using WGS information, we narrowed down the positions of the two QTLs detected on Omy1 to 96 kb and 347 kb respectively, with the second QTL explaining up to 14% of the total genetic variance of maleness. Within this QTL, we detected three putative candidate genes, fgfa8, cyp17a1 and an uncharacterised protein (LOC110527930), which might be involved in spontaneous maleness of XX-female rainbow trout.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we have analyzed the metagenomic DNA from the pooled sediment sample of the river Ganges to explore the abundance and diversity of phages, microbial community and antibiotic resistance genes. Utilizing data from Illumina platform, 4174 ([~]0.0013%) reads were classified for the 285 different DNA viruses largely dominated by the group of 260 distinctive phages (3602 reads, [~]86.3%). Among all, Microcystis (782 hits), Haemophilus (403), Synechococcus (386), Pseudomonas (279), Enterococcus (232), Bacillus (196), Rhodococcus (166), Caulobacter (163), Salmonella (146), Enterobacteria (143), Mycobacterium (128), Propionibacterium (71), Erwinia (70), Ralstonia (56) phages shows the highest abundance and account for approximately 90% of the total identified phages. Additionally, we have also identified corresponding host pertaining to these phages. Mainly, Proteobacteria ([~]69.3%) dominates the microbial population structure. Primarily orders such as Caulobacterales ([~]28%), Burkholderiales ([~]13.9%), Actinomycetales ([~]13.7%), Pseudomonadales ([~]7.5%) signify the core section. Further, 21869 ([~]0.00695%) reads were classified in 20 ARG types (classes) and 240 ARGs (subtypes) among which 4 ARG types namely multidrug resistance (MDR) (12041 reads, [~]55%), bacitracin (3202 reads, [~]15%), macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) (1744 reads, [~]7.98%), and fosmidomycin (990 reads, [~]4.53%) has the highest abundance. Simultaneously, six resistance mechanisms were also recognized with the dominance of antibiotic efflux (72.8%, 15919 reads). The results unveil the distribution of (pro)-phages; microbial community and various ARGs in the Ganges river sediments. Further research on these identified phage(s) could be used in phage-based therapeutics against pathogenic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Near infrared spectroscopy is increasingly being used as an economical method to monitor mosquito vector populations in support of disease control. Despite this rise in popularity, strong geographical variation in spectra has proven an issue for generalising predictions from one location to another. Here, we use a functional data analysis approach--which models spectra as smooth curves rather than as a discrete set of points--to develop a method that is robust to geographic heterogeneity. Specifically, we use a penalised generalised linear modelling framework which includes efficient functional representation of spectra, spectral smoothing and regularisation. To ensure better generalisation of model predictions from one training set to another, we use cross-validation procedures favouring smoother representation of spectra. To illustrate the performance of our approach, we collected spectra for field-caught specimens of Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes - the most epidemiologically important vector species on the planet - in two sites in Burkina Faso. Using these spectra, we show how models trained on data from one site can successfully classify morphologically identical sibling species in another site, over 250km away. Whilst we apply our framework to species prediction, our unified statistical framework can, alternatively, handle regression analysis (for example, to determine mosquito age) and other types of multinomial classification (for example, to determine infection status). To make our methods readily available for field entomologists, we have created an open-source R package mlevcm. All data used is publicly also available.",

    "abstract": "Complex human diseases are affected by genetic and environmental risk factors and their interactions. Gene-environment interaction (GEI) tests for aggregate genetic variant sets have been developed in recent years. However, existing statistical methods become rate limiting for large biobank-scale sequencing studies with correlated samples. We propose efficient Mixed-model Association tests for GEne-Environment interactions (MAGEE), for testing GEI between an aggregate variant set and environmental exposures on quantitative and binary traits in large-scale sequencing studies with related individuals. Joint tests for the aggregate genetic main effects and GEI effects are also developed. A null generalized linear mixed model adjusting for covariates but without any genetic effects is fit only once in a whole genome GEI analysis, thereby vastly reducing the overall computational burden. Score tests for variant sets are performed as a combination of genetic burden and variance component tests by accounting for the genetic main effects using matrix projections. The computational complexity is dramatically reduced in a whole genome GEI analysis, which makes MAGEE scalable to hundreds of thousands of individuals. We applied MAGEE to the exome sequencing data of 41,144 related individuals from the UK Biobank, and the analysis of 18,970 protein coding genes finished within 10.4 CPU hours.",

    "abstract": "Anthracyclines are among the most used and effective anticancer drugs. Their activity has been attributed to DNA double-strand breaks resulting from topoisomerase II poisoning and to eviction of histones from select sites in the genome. Here we show that the extensively used anthracyclines Doxorubicin, Daunorubicin and Epirubicin, decrease the transcription of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{kappa}B)-dependent gene targets, but not interferon responsive genes. Using an NMR-based structural approach, we demonstrate that anthracyclines disturb the complexes formed between the NF-{kappa}B subunit RelA and its DNA binding sites. The variant anthracyclines Aclarubicin, Doxorubicinone and the newly developed Dimethyl-doxorubicin, which share anticancer properties with the other anthracyclines but do not induce DNA damage, also suppressed inflammation, thus uncoupling DNA damage from the effects on inflammation. These findings have implications for anticancer therapy and for the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs with limited side effects for life-threatening conditions such as sepsis.",

    "abstract": "The escape trajectory (ET) of prey - measured as the angle relative to the predators approach path - plays a major role in avoiding predation. Previous geometric models predict a single ET; however, many species show highly variable ETs with multiple preferred directions. Although such a high ET variability may confer unpredictability to avoid predation, the reasons why animals prefer specific multiple ETs remain unclear. Here, we constructed a novel geometric model that incorporates the time required for prey to turn and the predators position at the end of its attack. The optimal ET was determined by maximizing the time difference of arrival at the edge of the safety zone between the prey and predator. By fitting the model to the experimental data of fish Pagrus major we show that the model can clearly explain the observed multiple preferred ETs. By using the same model, we were able to explain different patterns of ETs empirically observed in other species (e.g., insects and frogs): a single preferred ET and multiple preferred ETs at small (20-50{degrees}) and large (150-180{degrees}) angles from the predator. Our results open new avenues of investigation for understanding how animals choose their ETs from behavioral and neurosensory perspectives.",

    "abstract": "We know little of the proximate mechanisms underlying expression of signaling traits in female vertebrates. Across males the expression of sexual and competitive traits, including ornamentation and aggressive behavior, is often mediated by testosterone. In the White-shouldered Fairywren (Malurus alboscapulatus) of New Guinea, females of different subspecies differ in presence or absence of white shoulder patches and melanic plumage, while males are uniformly ornamented. Previous work has shown that ornamented females circulate more testosterone and exhibit more territorial aggression than do unornamented females. We investigated the degree to which testosterone regulates expression of ornamental plumage and territorial behavior by implanting free-living unornamented females with testosterone. Every testosterone-treated female produced a male-like cloacal protuberance, and 15 of 20 replaced plucked brown feathers with white shoulder patch feathers, but did not produce melanic plumage characteristic of ornamented females. Testosterone treatment did not elevate territorial behavior prior to production of the plumage ornament and exhaustion of the implant. However, females with experimentally induced ornamentation, but exhausted implants, increased the vocal components of territory defense relative to fully unornamented control and also to testosterone-implanted females. Our results suggest that testosterone induces partial acquisition of the ornamental plumage phenotype, and that ornament expression, rather than testosterone alone, results in elevated territorial behavior.\n\nLay SummaryTestosterone regulates expression of a suite of competitive traits in male organisms and could have similar function in females. Empirical tests are needed to determine the extent to which testosterone promotes production of ornamentation and competitive behaviors in female animals. We supplemented testosterone in unornamented females of a species where naturally occurring ornamented females circulate higher testosterone and are more territorially aggressive. Implanted females produced partial ornamentation, which was followed by increased territoriality that was apparently unrelated to testosterone circulation itself.",

The aim of the present study was to clone, express and investigate the selective in vitro anticancer potential of Lp16-PSP in human cell lines. Lp16-PSP was analyzed using bioinformatics tools, cloned in a prokaryotic expression vector pET32a (+) and transformed into E. coli Rosetta gami. It was expressed and solubilized under optimized conditions. The differential scanning fluorometry (DSF)-guided refolding method was used with modifications to identify the proper refolding conditions for the Lp16-PSP protein. In order to determine the selective anticancer potential of Lp16-PSP, a panel of human cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines was used. Lp16-PSP protein was identified as endoribonuclease L-PSP protein and a member of the highly conserved YjgF/YER057c/UK114 protein superfamily. Lp16-PSP was expressed under optimized conditions (37{degrees}C for 4 h following induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl {beta}-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside). Solubilization was achieved with mild solubilization buffer containing 2M urea using the freeze-thaw method. The DSF guided refolding method identified the proper refolding conditions (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 400 mM Arginine, 0.2 mM GSH and 2 mM GSSG; pH 8.0) for Lp16-PSP, with a melting transition of ~58{degrees}C. A final yield of ~16 mg of purified Lp16-PSP from 1 L of culture was obtained following dialysis and concentration by PEG 20,000. A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay revealed the selective cytotoxic effect of Lp16-PSP. The HL-60 cell line was demonstrated to be most sensitive to Lp16-PSP, with an IC50 value of 74.4{+/-}1.07 g/ml. The results of the present study suggest that Lp16-PSP may serve as a potential anticancer agent; however, further investigation is required to characterize this anticancer effect and to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the action of Lp16-PSP.",

Results showed that the free leptin index is decreased in cats with mammary carcinoma (p=0.0006), particularly for those with luminal B and HER2-positive disease that showed significantly lower serum leptin levels (p<0.0001 and p<0.005, respectively). Serum leptin levels above 4.17 pg/mL were associated with ulcerating tumours (p=0.0005) and shorter DFS (p=0.0217). Elevated serum ObR levels were found in all cats with mammary carcinoma (p<0.0001), with levels above 16.89 ng/mL being associated with smaller tumours (p=0.0118), ER-negative status in HER2-positive tumours (p=0.0291) and increased serum levels of CTLA-4 (p=0.0056), TNF- (p=0.0025), PD-1 (p=0.0023) and PD-L1 (p=0.0002).

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is a serious social problem. Recently, several early-life factors have been associated with an increased risk of a clinical diagnosis of AD.\n\nMethodsWe investigated the involvement of early-life stress in AD pathogenesis using heterozygous the amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutant mice (AppNL-G-F/wt) and wild-type (Appwt/wt) mice. Maternal separation was used as an animal paradigm for early-life stress. Object location and fear conditioning tests were performed to measure cognitive functions, in addition to biochemical tests. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed after the behavioral tests.\n\nResultsWe found that maternal-separated Appwt/wt mice showed narrowing of vessels and decreased pericyte coverage of capillaries in prefrontal cortex, while maternal-separated AppNL-G-F/wt mice additionally showed impairment of cognitive function, and earlier formation of A{beta} plaques and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Severe activation of microglia was detected in the maternal-separated AppNL-G-F/wt mice and maternal-separated Appwt/wt mice. At the early stage, morphological changes and inflammatory responses were observed in the microglia of the maternal-separated AppNL-G-F/wt mice and maternal-separated Appwt/wt mice, as well as morphological changes in the microglia of the non-maternal-separated AppNL-G-F/wt mice.\n\nConclusionsMicroglia activation induced by maternal separation in combination with the APP mutation may impairs the vascular system, leading to AD progression. These findings therefore suggest that maternal separation causes early induction of AD pathology via angiopathy.",

    "abstract": "Psychopathology can be viewed as a hierarchy of correlated dimensions. Many studies have supported this conceptualization, but they have used alternative statistical models with differing interpretations. In bifactor models, every symptom loads on both the general factor and one specific factor (e.g., internalizing), which partitions the total explained variance in each symptom between these orthogonal factors. In second-order models, symptoms load on one of several correlated lower-order factors. These lower-order factors load on a second-order general factor, which is defined by the variance shared by the lower-order factors. Thus, the factors in second-order models are not orthogonal. Choosing between these valid statistical models depends on the hypothesis being tested. Because bifactor models define orthogonal phenotypes with distinct sources of variance, they are optimal for studies of shared and unique associations of the dimensions of psychopathology with external variables putatively relevant to etiology and mechanisms. Concerns have been raised, however, about the reliability of the orthogonal specific factors in bifactor models. We evaluated this concern using parent symptom ratings of 9-10 year olds in the ABCD Study. Psychometric indices indicated that all factors in both bifactor and second-order models exhibited at least adequate construct reliability and estimated replicability. The factors defined in bifactor and second-order models were highly to moderately correlated across models, but have different interpretations. All factors in both models demonstrated significant associations with external criterion variables of theoretical and clinical importance, but the interpretation of such associations in second-order models was ambiguous due to shared variance among factors.\n\nGeneral Scientific SummarySome investigators have proposed that viewing the correlated symptoms of psychopathology as a hierarchy in which all symptoms are related to both a general (p) factor of psychopathology and a more specific factor will make it easier to distinguish potential risk factors and mechanisms that are nonspecifically related to all forms of psychopathology versus those that are associated with specific dimensions of psychopathology. Parent ratings of child psychopathology items from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study were analyzed using two alternative statistical models of the proposed hierarchy. All factors of psychopathology defined in both bifactor and second-order models demonstrated adequate psychometric properties and criterion validity, but associations of psychopathology factors with external variables were more easily interpreted in bifactor than in second-order models.",

Here, ivermectin showed inhibition of the in vitro development of Plasmodium cynomolgi schizonts (IC50 = 10.42 M) and hypnozoites (IC50 = 29.24 M) in primary macaque hepatocytes when administered in high-dose prophylactically but not when administered in radical cure mode. The safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of oral ivermectin (0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 mg/kg) with and without chloroquine (10 mg/kg) administered for seven consecutive days was evaluated for prophylaxis or radical cure of Plasmodium cynomolgi liver-stages in Rhesus macaques. No inhibition or delay to blood-stage P. cynomolgi parasitemia was observed at any ivermectin dose (0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 mg/kg). Ivermectin (0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg) and chloroquine (10 mg/kg) in combination were well-tolerated with no adverse events and no significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions observed. Repeated daily ivermectin administration for seven days did not inhibit ivermectin bioavailability. It was recently demonstrated that both ivermectin and chloroquine inhibit replication of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro. Further ivermectin and chloroquine trials in humans are warranted to evaluate their role in Plasmodium vivax control and as adjunctive therapies against COVID-19 infections.",

We show that mice lacking the liver-enriched mitochondrial SOP enzyme thiosulfate sulfur-transferase (Tst-/- mice) exhibit high circulating sulfide, increased gluconeogenesis, hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver, despite whole-body insulin-sensitisation. Unexpectedly, hepatic sulfide levels were normal in Tst-/- mice, a result of homeostatic induction of mitochondrial sulfide disposal and glutathione excretion associated with net suppression of protein persulfidation and nuclear respiratory factor-2 target proteins. Proteomic and persulfidomic profiling converged on gluconeogenesis and hepatic lipid metabolism and revealed a selective deficit in medium-chain fatty acid oxidation in Tst-/- mice. We reveal a critical role for TST in hepatic metabolism that raises implications for sulfide-donor strategies in the context of liver function and metabolic disease.",

    "abstract": "Turbulence is an important determinant of phytoplankton physiology, often leading to cell stress and damage. Turbulence affects phytoplankton migration, both by transporting cells and by triggering switches in migratory behavior, whereby vertically migrating cells can invert their direction of migration upon exposure to turbulent cues. However, a mechanistic link between single-cell physiology and vertical migration of phytoplankton in turbulence is currently missing. Here, by combining physiological and behavioral experiments with a mathematical model of stress accumulation and dissipation, we show that the mechanism responsible for the switch in the direction of migration in the marine raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo is the integration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling generated by turbulent cues. Within timescales as short as tens of seconds, the emergent downward-migrating subpopulation exhibited a two-fold increase of ROS, an indicator of stress, 15% lower photosynthetic efficiency, and 35% lower growth rate over multiple generations compared to the upward-migrating subpopulation. The origin of the behavioral split in a bistable oxidative stress response is corroborated by the observation that exposure of cells to exogenous stressors (H2O2, UV-A radiation or high irradiance), in lieu of turbulence, caused comparable ROS accumulation and an equivalent split into the two subpopulations. By providing a mechanistic link between single-cell physiology, population-scale migration and fitness, these results contribute to our understanding of phytoplankton community composition in future ocean conditions.\n\nSignificance StatementTurbulence has long been known to drive phytoplankton fitness and species succession: motile species dominate in calmer environments and non-motile species in turbulent conditions. Yet, a mechanistic understanding of the effect of turbulence on phytoplankton migratory behavior and physiology is lacking. By combining a method to generate turbulent cues, quantification of stress accumulation and physiology, and a mathematical model of stress dynamics, we show that motile phytoplankton use their mechanical stability to sense the intensity of turbulent cues and integrate these cues in time via stress signaling to trigger switches in migratory behavior. The stress-mediated warning strategy we discovered provides a paradigm for how phytoplankton cope with turbulence, thereby potentially governing which species will be successful in a changing ocean.",

    "abstract": "A decision to express a defensive response or an escape response to a potential threat is crucial for insects to survive. This study investigated an aminergic mechanism underlying defensive responses to unexpected touch in an ant that has powerful mandibles, the so-called trap-jaw. The mandibles close extremely quickly and are used as a weapon during hunting. Tactile stimulation to the abdomen elicited quick forward movements in a \"dart escape\" in 90% of the ants in a colony. Less than 10% of the ants responded with a quick \"defensive turn\" towards the source of stimulation. To reveal the neuronal control mechanisms underlying this defensive behavior, the effects of brain biogenic amines on the responses to tactile stimulus were investigated. The levels of octopamine (OA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT) in the brain were significantly elevated in ants that responded with a defensive turn to the unexpected stimulus compared to ants that responded with a dart escape. Oral administration of DA and 5HT demonstrated that both amines contributed to the initiation of a defensive response to the stimulus. Oral administration of L-DOPA weakly affected the initiation of the defensive turn, while 5HTP strongly affected the initiation of defensive behavior. Oral administration of an antagonist of 5HT, ketanserin, abolished the effect of 5HTP. These results indicate that endogenous 5HT in the brain has a key role to play in modulating the initiation of defensive behavior in the trap-jaw ant.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDispensability of genes in a phylogenetic lineage, e.g. a species, genus, or higher-level clade, is gaining relevance as most genome sequencing projects move to a pangenome level. Most analyses classify genes as core genes, which are present in all investigated individual genomes, and dispensable genes, which only occur in a single or a few investigated genomes. The binary classification as  core or  dispensable is often based on arbitrary cutoffs of presence/absence in the analysed genomes. Even when extended to  conditionally dispensable, this concept still requires the assignment of genes to distinct groups.\n\nResultsHere, we present a new method which overcomes this distinct classification by quantifying gene dispensability and present a dedicated tool for reference-based QUantification Of gene Dispensability (QUOD). As a proof of concept, sequence data of 966 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions (Ath-966) were processed to calculate a gene-specific dispensability score for each gene based on normalised coverage in read mappings. We validated this score by comparison of highly conserved Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs) to all other genes. The average scores of BUSCOs were significantly lower than the scores of non-BUSCOs. Analysis of variation demonstrated lower variation values between replicates of a single accession than between iteratively, randomly selected accessions from the whole dataset Ath-966. Functional investigations revealed defense and antimicrobial response genes among the genes with high-dispensability scores.\n\nConclusionsInstead of classifying a gene as core or dispensable, QUOD assigns a dispensability score to each gene. Hence, QUOD facilitates the identification of candidate dispensable genes, associated with high dispensability scores, which often underlie lineage-specific adaptation to varying environmental conditions.",

We have developed a dedicated web-server,  insectOR, to predict and validate insect OR genes using multiple gene prediction algorithms, accompanied by relevant validations. It is possible to employ this sever nearly automatically and perform rapid prediction of the OR gene loci from thousands of OR-protein-to-genome alignments, resolve gene boundaries for tandem OR genes and refine them further to provide more complete OR gene models. InsectOR outperformed the popular genome annotation pipelines (MAKER and NCBI eukaryotic genome annotation) in terms of overall sensitivity at base, exon and locus level, when tested on two distantly related insect genomes. It displayed more than 95% nucleotide level precision in both tests. Finally, given the same input data and parameters, InsectOR missed less than 2% gene loci, in contrast to 55% loci missed by MAKER for Drosophila melanogaster.

    "abstract": "Epitranscriptome is an exciting area that studies different types of modifications in transcripts and the prediction of such modification sites from the transcript sequence is of significant interest. However, the scarcity of positive sites for most modifications imposes critical challenges for training robust algorithms. To circumvent this problem, we propose MR-GAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based model, which is trained in an unsupervised fashion on the entire pre-mRNA sequences to learn a low dimensional embedding of transcriptomic sequences. MR-GAN was then applied to extract embeddings of the sequences in a training dataset we created for eight epitranscriptome modifications, including m6A, m1A, m1G, m2G, m5C, m5U, 2'-O-Me, Pseudouridine ({Psi}) and Dihydrouridine (D), of which the positive samples are very limited. Prediction models were trained based on the embeddings extracted by MR-GAN. We compared the prediction performance with the one-hot encoding of the training sequences and SRAMP, a state-of-the-art m6A site prediction algorithm and demonstrated that the learned embeddings outperform one-hot encoding by a significant margin for up to 15% improvement. Using MR-GAN, we also investigated the sequence motifs for each modification type and uncovered known motifs as well as new motifs not possible with sequences directly. The results demonstrated that transcriptome features extracted using unsupervised learning could lead to high precision for predicting multiple types of epitranscriptome modifications, even when the data size is small and extremely imbalanced.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the leading bacterial killer disease worldwide, causes Human tuberculosis (TB). Due to the growing problem of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, new anti-TB drugs are urgently needed. Natural sources such as plant extracts have long played an important role in tuberculosis management and can be used as a template to design new drugs. A wide screening of natural sources is time consuming but the process can be significantly sped up using molecular docking. In this study, we used a molecular docking approach to investigate the interactions between selected natural constituents and three proteins MtPanK, MtDprE1 and MtKasA involved in the physiological functions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis which are necessary for the bacteria to survive and cause disease. The molecular docking score, a score that accounts for the binding affinity between a ligand and a target protein, for each protein was calculated against 150 chemical constituents of different classes to estimate the binding free energy. The docking scores represent the binding free energy. The best docking scores indicates the highest ligand protein binding which is indicated by the lowest energy value. Among the natural constituents, Shermilamine B showed a docking score of - 8.5kcal/mol, Brachystamide B showed a docking score of -8.6 kcal/mol with MtPanK, Monoamphilectine A showed a score of -9.8kcal/mol with MtDprE1.These three compounds showed docking scores which were superior to the control inhibitors and represent the opportunity of in vitro biological evaluation and anti-TB drug design. Consequently, all these compounds belonged to the alkaloid class. Specific interactions were studied to further understand the nature of intermolecular bonds between the most active ligands and the protein binding site residues which proved that among the constituents monoamphilectine A and Shermilamine B show more promise as Anti-TB drugs. Furthermore, the ADMET properties of these compounds or ligands showed that they have no corrosive or carcinogenic parameters.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=177 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/067090v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1542087org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@23ade8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6e93dcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ad6c6f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A growing number of studies have shown that machine learning algorithms can be used to accurately predict antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes from bacterial sequence data. In these studies, models are typically trained using input features derived from comprehensive sets of known AMR genes or whole genome sequences. However, it can be difficult to determine whether genomes and their corresponding sets of AMR genes are complete when sequencing contaminated or metagenomic samples. In this study, we explore the possibility of using incomplete genome sequence data to predict AMR phenotypes. Machine learning models were built from randomly-selected sets of core genes that are held in common among the members of a species, and the AMR-conferring genes were removed based on their protein annotations. For Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, and Staphylococcus aureus, we report that it is possible to classify susceptible and resistant phenotypes with average F1 scores ranging from 0.80-0.89 with as few as 100 conserved non-AMR genes, with very major error rates ranging from 0.11-0.23 and major error rates ranging from 0.10-0.20. Models built from core genes have predictive power in the cases where the primary AMR mechanism results from SNPs or horizontal gene transfer. By randomly sampling non-overlapping sets of core genes for use in these models, we show that F1 scores and error rates are stable and have little variance between replicates. Potential biases from strain-specific SNPs, phylogenetic sampling, and imbalances in the phylogenetic distribution of susceptible and resistant strains do not appear to have an impact on this result. Although these small core gene models have lower accuracies and higher error rates than models built from the corresponding assembled genomes, the results suggest that sufficient variation exists in the core non-AMR genes of a species for predicting AMR phenotypes. Overall this study suggests that building models from conserved genes may be a potentially useful strategy for predicting AMR phenotypes when genomes are incomplete.",

    "abstract": "The amount of published papers in biomedical research makes it rather impossible for a researcher to keep up to date. This is where machine processing of scientific publications could contribute to facilitate the access to knowledge. How to make use of text mining capabilities and still preserve the high quality of manual curation, is the challenge we focused on. Here we present the Lisen&Curate system designed to enable current and future NLP capabilities within a curation environment interface used in curation of literature on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacteria. The current version extracts regulatory interactions with the corresponding sentences for curators to confirm or reject accelerating their curation. It also uses an embedded metrics of sentence similarity offering the curator an alternative mechanism of navigating through semantically similar sentences within a given paper as well as across papers of a pre-defined corpus of publications pertinent to the task. We show results of the use of the system to curate literature in E. coli as well as literature in Salmonella. A major advantage of the system is to save as part of the curation work, the precise link for every curated piece of knowledge with the corresponding specific sentence(s) in the curated publication supporting it. We discuss future directions of this type of curation infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Data integration of single-cell measurements is critical for understanding cell development and disease, but the lack of correspondence between different types of measurements makes such efforts challenging. Several unsupervised algorithms can align heterogeneous single-cell measurements in a shared space, enabling the creation of mappings between single cells in different data domains. However, these algorithms require hyperparameter tuning for high-quality alignments, which is difficult in an unsupervised setting without correspondence information for validation. We present Single-Cell alignment using Optimal Transport (SCOT), an unsupervised learning algorithm that uses Gromov Wasserstein-based optimal transport to align single-cell multi-omics datasets. We compare the alignment performance of SCOT with state-of-the-art algorithms on four simulated and two real-world datasets. SCOT performs on par with state-of-the-art methods but is faster and requires tuning fewer hyperparameters. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm for SCOT to use Gromov Wasserstein distance to guide the parameter selection. Thus, unlike previous methods, SCOT aligns well without using any orthogonal correspondence information to pick the hyperparameters. Our source code and scripts for replicating the results are available at https://github.com/rsinghlab/SCOT.",

    "abstract": "Vital biological processes such as genome repair require fast and efficient binding of selected proteins to specific target sites on DNA. Here we propose an active target search mechanism based on \"chromophoresis\", the dynamics of DNA-binding proteins up or down gradients in the density of epigenetic marks, or colours (biochemical tags on the genome). We focus on a set of proteins that deposit marks from which they are repelled - a case which is only encountered away from thermodynamic equilibrium. For suitable ranges of kinetic parameter values, chromophoretic proteins can perform undirectional motion and are optimally redistributed along the genome. Importantly, they can also locally unravel a region of the genome which is collapsed due to self-interactions and \"dive\" deep into its core, for a striking enhancement of the efficiency of target search on such an inaccessible substrate. We discuss the potential relevance of chromophoresis for DNA repair.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneity in phenotypes of malignantly transformed cells and aberrant glycan expression on their surface are two prominent hallmarks of cancers that have hitherto not been linked to each other. In this paper, we identify heterogeneity in a specific glycan linkage: 2,6-linked sialic acids within breast cancer cells in vivo and in culture. Upon sorting out two populations with moderate and relatively higher cell surface 2,6-linked sialic acid levels from the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, both populations (denoted as medium and high-2,6-Sial cells respectively) stably retained their levels in early passages. Upon continuous culturing, medium 2,6-Sial cells recapitulated the heterogeneity of the unsorted line whereas high 2,6-Sial cells showed no such tendency. Compared with the high 2,6-Sial, the medium 2,6-Sial cells showed greater adhesion to reconstituted extracellular matrices (ECM) as well as invaded faster as single cells. The level of 2,6-linked sialic acids in the two sublines was found to be consistent with the expression of a specific glycosyl transferase, ST6GAL1. Stably knocking down ST6GAL1 in the high 2,6-Sial cells, enhanced their invasiveness. When cultured together, medium 2,6-Sial cells differentially migrated to the edge of growing tumoroid-like cultures, whereas high 2,6-Sial cells formed the central bulk. Simulations in a Cellular Potts model-based computational environment that is calibrated to our experimental findings suggest that the heterogeneity of cell-ECM adhesion, likely regulated by 2,6-linked sialic acids facilitates niches of highly invasive cells to efficiently migrate centrifugally as the invasive front of a malignant tumor.\n\nSignificance StatementCell-surface sugars are aberrantly expressed in cancer but their contributions to tumor heterogeneity are not known. In this study, we uncover and separate breast cancer populations with distinct 2,6-linked sialic acid levels. The moderately expressing population shows stronger adhesion to extracellular matrix than the high expressing population. It also invades faster through the matrix as single cells. Combining experiments with computational modelling, we show that the heterogeneity in matrix adhesion is vital to accentuating cell invasion. In some conditions, invasion of heterogeneous populations may compare with, or exceed that of, homogeneous moderately expressing populations. Our findings are vital to furthering our understanding of how cancers spread and potentially qualify efforts to manage the disease through glycan-editing or immunotherapeutic approaches.",

We conducted a field-wide assessment of the availability and state of publicly archived 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data. Using custom-built pattern-based text extraction algorithms, we searched 26,927 publications in 17 microbiology or microbial ecology journals, and identified 2,015 studies which performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We found, for example, that 7.2% of these had not been made public at the time of analysis, a trend which increased over time. Of the 635 studies targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, 40.3% contained data which was not available or not reusable, and for 25.5% of the studies, faults in data formatting or data labelling were likely to create obstacles in data reuse. Taken together, only 34% of these datasets had potentially reusable data.

    "abstract": "Current procedures for inferring population history generally assume complete neutrality - that is, they neglect both direct selection and the effects of selection on linked sites. We here examine how the presence of direct purifying selection and background selection may bias demographic inference by evaluating two commonly-used methods (MSMC and fastsimcoal2), specifically studying how the underlying shape of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) and the fraction of directly selected sites interact with demographic parameter estimation. The results show that, even after masking functional genomic regions, background selection may cause the mis-inference of population growth under models of both constant population size and decline. This effect is amplified as the strength of purifying selection and the density of directly selected sites increases, as indicated by the distortion of the site frequency spectrum and levels of nucleotide diversity at linked neutral sites. We also show how simulated changes in background selection effects caused by population size changes can be predicted analytically. We propose a potential method for correcting for the mis-inference of population growth caused by selection. By treating the DFE as a nuisance parameter and averaging across all potential realizations, we demonstrate that even directly selected sites can be used to infer demographic histories with reasonable accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The naked mole-rat (NMR) is a poikilothermic mammal that forms eusocial colonies consisting of one breeding queen, several breeding kings, and subordinates. Despite their poikilothermic feature, NMRs possess brown adipose tissue (BAT), which in homeothermic mammals induces thermogenesis in cold environments. However, NMR-BAT thermogenic potential is controversial, and its physiological roles are unknown. Here, we show that NMR-BAT has beta-3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3)-dependent thermogenic potential, which contributes to thermogenesis in the isolated queen in non-cold environments. NMR-BAT expressed several brown adipocyte marker genes and showed noradrenaline-dependent thermogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. Although our ADRB3 inhibition experiments revealed that NMR-BAT thermogenesis slightly delays the decrease in body temperature in a cold environment, it was insufficient to maintain the body temperatures of the NMRs. In a non-cold environment, NMRs are known to increase their body temperature by a heat-sharing behavior. Interestingly, we found that the body temperatures of NMRs isolated from the colony were also significantly higher than the ambient temperature. We also show that queens, but not subordinates, induce BAT thermogenesis in isolated, non-cold conditions. Our research provides novel insights into the role and mechanism of thermoregulation in this unique poikilothermic mammal.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 most likely evolved from a bat beta-coronavirus and started infecting humans in December 2019. Since then it has rapidly infected people around the world, with more than 4.5 million confirmed cases by the middle of May 2020. Early genome sequencing of the virus has enabled the development of molecular diagnostics and the commencement of therapy and vaccine development. The analysis of the early sequences showed relatively few evolutionary selection pressures. However, with the rapid worldwide expansion into diverse human populations, significant genetic variations are becoming increasingly likely. The current limitations on social movement between countries also offers the opportunity for these viral variants to become distinct strains with potential implications for diagnostics, therapies and vaccines.\n\nMethodsWe used the current sequencing archives (NCBI and GISAID) to investigate 15,487 whole genomes, looking for evidence of strain diversification and selective pressure.\n\nResultsWe used 6,294 SNPs to build a phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 diversity and noted strong evidence for the existence of two major clades and six sub-clades, unevenly distributed across the world. We also noted that convergent evolution has potentially occurred across several locations in the genome, showing selection pressures, including on the spike glycoprotein where we noted a potentially critical mutation that could affect its binding to the ACE2 receptor. We also report on mutations that could prevent current molecular diagnostics from detecting some of the sub-clades.\n\nConclusionThe worldwide whole genome sequencing effort is revealing the challenge of developing SARS-CoV-2 containment tools suitable for everyone and the need for data to be continually evaluated to ensure accuracy in outbreak estimations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2, a positive-sense RNA virus in the family Coronaviridae, has caused a worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 Coronaviruses generate a tiered series of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) through a process involving homology between transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS) located after the leader sequence in the 5 UTR (the TRS-L) and TRS located near the start of structural and accessory proteins (TRS-B) near the 3 end of the genome. In addition to the canonical sgRNAs generated by SARS-CoV-2, non-canonical sgRNAs (nc-sgRNAs) have been reported. However, the consistency of these nc-sgRNAs across viral isolates and infection conditions is unknown. The comprehensive definition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA products is a key step in understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.\n\nMethodsHere, we report an integrative analysis of eight independent SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes generated using three sequencing strategies, five host systems, and seven viral isolates. Read-mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 genome was used to determine the 5 and 3 coordinates of all identified junctions in viral RNAs identified in these samples.\n\nResultsUsing junctional abundances, we show nc-sgRNAs make up as much as 33% of total sgRNAs in vitro, are largely consistent in abundance across independent transcriptomes, and increase in abundance over time during in vitro infection. By assessing the homology between sequences flanking the 5 and 3 junction points, we show that nc-sgRNAs are not associated with TRS-like homology. By incorporating read coverage information, we find strong evidence for subgenomic RNAs that contain only 5 regions of ORF1a. Finally, we show that non-canonical junctions change the landscape of viral open reading frames.\n\nConclusionsWe identify canonical and non-canonical junctions in SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs and show that these RNA products are consistently generated across many independent viral isolates and sequencing approaches. These analyses highlight the diverse transcriptional activity of SARS-CoV-2 and offer important insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology.",

In this paper we have analysed the spike protein sequences from all these five isolates and also compared for their similarities or differences with other sequences reported in India and with isolates of Wuhan origin. We report one unique mutation at position 723 and the other at 1124 in the S2 domain of spike protein of the isolates from West Bengal only and one mutation downstream of the receptor binding domain at position 614 in S1 domain which was common with the sequence from Gujarat (a state of western part of India). Mutation in the S2 domain showed changes in the secondary structure of the spike protein at region of mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that this mutation decreases the flexibility of S2 domain. Since both S1 and S2 are important in receptor binding followed by entry in the host cells, such mutations may define the affinity or avidity of receptor binding.",

These peptides recapitulate stretches of residues present in the native interface plus novel and highly diverse conformations that preserve the key interactions on the interface.

With the discovery of its closest genetic relatives in African great apes (Plasmodium vivax-like), the origin of P. vivax has been proposed to be located in the sub-Saharan African area. However, the limited number of genetic markers and samples investigated questioned the robustness of this result. Here, we examined the population genomic variation of 447 human P. vivax strains and 19 ape P. vivax-like strains originating from 24 different countries across the world. We identified 2,005,455 high quality single-nucleotide polymorphism loci allowing us to conduct an extensive characterization to date of P. vivax worldwide genetic variation. Phylogenetic relationships between human and ape Plasmodium revealed that P. vivax is a sister clade of P. vivax-like, not included within the radiation of P. vivax-like. By investigating a variety of aspects of P. vivax variation, we identified several striking geographical patterns in summary statistics as function of increasing geographic distance from Southeast Asia, suggesting that P. vivax may derived from serial founder effects from a single origin located in Asia.",

    "abstract": "The Sec translocon moves proteins across lipid bilayers in all cells. The Sec channel enables passage of unfolded proteins through the bacterial plasma membrane, driven by the cytosolic ATPase SecA. Whether SecA generates mechanical force to overcome barriers to translocation posed by structured substrate proteins is unknown. Monitoring translocation of a folded substrate protein with tunable stability at high time resolution allowed us to kinetically dissect Secdependent translocation. We find that substrate unfolding constitutes the rate-limiting step during translocation. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we have also defined the response of the protein to mechanical force. Relating the kinetic and force measurements revealed that SecA generates at least 10 piconewtons of mechanical force to actively unfold translocating proteins, comparable to cellular unfoldases. Combining biochemical and single-molecule measurements has thus allowed us to define how the SecA motor ensures efficient and robust export of proteins that contain stable structure.",

    "abstract": "Shape is an important phenotype of living species that contain different environmental and genetic information. Clustering living cells using their shape information can provide a preliminary guide to their functionality and evolution. Hierarchical clustering and dendrograms, as a visualization tool for hierarchical clustering, are commonly used by practitioners for classification and clustering. The existing hierarchical shape clustering methods are distance based. Such methods often lack a proper statistical foundation to allow for making inference on important parameters such as the number of clusters, often of prime interest to practitioners. We take a model selection perspective to clustering and propose a shape clustering method through linear models defined on Spherical Harmonics expansions of shapes. We introduce a BIC-type criterion, called CLUSBIC, and study consistency of the criterion. Special attention is paid to the notions of over- and under-specified models, important in studying model selection criteria and naturally defined in model selection literature. These notions do not automatically extend to shape clustering when a model selection perspective is adopted for clustering. To this end we take a novel approach using hypothesis testing. We apply our proposed criterion to cluster a set of real 3D images from HeLa cell line.",

Our structures revealed a slight leaning of PA28{beta} towards the 3-4 side of iCP, disturbing the allosteric network of the gate-keeper 2/3/4 subunits, resulting in a partial open iCP gate. We found that the binding and activation mechanism of iCP by PA28{beta} is distinct from those of constitutive CP by the homoheptameric TbPA26 or PfPA28.

    "abstract": "Recessive variants of the SLC26A4 gene are a common cause of hearing impairment worldwide. In the past, cell lines and transgenic mice have been widely used to investigate the pathogenicity associated with the SLC26A4 variants. However, discrepancies in the pathogenicity between humans and cell lines or transgenic mice have been documented for some of the SLC26A4 variants. For instance, the p.C565Y variant, which has been reported to be pathogenic in humans, did not exhibit functional pathogenic consequences in cell lines. To address the pathogenicity of p.C565Y, we used a genotype-based approach in which we generated knock-in mice heterozygous (Slc26a4+/C565Y), homozygous (Slc26a4C565Y/C565Y), and compound heterozygous (Slc26a4919-2A>G/C565Y) for this variant. Subsequent phenotypic characterization revealed that mice segregating these genotypes demonstrated normal auditory and vestibular functions and normal inner ear morphology and expression of pendrin. These findings indicate that the p.C565Y variant is non-pathogenic for mice and that a single p.C565Y allele is sufficient to maintain normal inner ear physiology in mice. Our results highlight the differences in the pathogenicity associated with certain SLC26A4 variants between transgenic mice and humans, which should be taken into consideration while interpreting the results of animal studies for SLC26A4-related deafness.",

    "abstract": "Recent experiments in the developing mammalian visual cortex have revealed that gap junctions couple excitatory cells and potentially influence the formation of chemical synapses. Though gap junctions between inhibitory cells are ubiquitous in the adult cortex, and their presence has been shown to promote synchronous network firing, their function among excitatory, pyramidal cells remains poorly understood. During development, pyramidal cells that were derived from the same progenitor cell, called sister cells, are preferentially connected by a gap junction during the first postnatal week, while chemical synapses are still being formed. Additionally, these sister cells tend to share an orientation preference and a chemical synapse in the adult cortex, a property that is diminished when gap junctions are blocked. In this work, we construct an idealized model of the mouse visual cortex during the first two postnatal weeks of development to analyze the response properties of gap-junction-coupled cells and their effect on synaptic plasticity. Further, as an application of this model, we investigate the interplay of gap-junction coupling and synaptic plasticity on the order, or organization, of the resulting cortical map of orientation preference.\n\nAuthor summaryGap junctions, or sites of direct electrical connections between neurons, have a significant presence in the cortex, both during development and in adulthood. Their primary function during either of these periods, however, is still poorly understood. In the adult cortex, gap junctions between local, inhibitory neurons have been shown to promote synchronous firing, a network characteristic thought to be important for learning, attention, and memory. During development, gap junctions between excitatory, pyramidal cells, have been conjectured to play a role in synaptic plasticity and the formation of cortical circuits. In the visual cortex, where neurons exhibit tuned responses to properties of visual input such as orientation and direction, recent experiments show that excitatory cells are coupled by gap junctions during the first postnatal week and are replaced by chemical synapses during the second week. In this work, we explore the possible contribution of gap-junction coupling during development to the formation of chemical synapses both into the visual cortex from the thalamus and within the visual cortex between cortical cells. Specifically, within a mathematical model of the visual cortex during development, we identify the response properties of gap-junction-coupled cells and their influence on the formation of the cortical map of orientation preference.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, frequently involves the dysregulation of key signaling pathways. Treatment strategies presently target the MAPK/ERK pathway, which is overactive in melanomas due in part to BRAF and NRAS mutations, and involve inhibitors against mutated BRAF (vemurafenib or dabrafenib) or MEK kinases (cobimetinib or trametinib), or a combination of the two. Using an established biochip technology, we assessed base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) activities in a collection of BRAF mutated (A-375, Colo 829, HT-144, Malme-3M, SK-mel5, SK-mel24 and SK-mel28) and NRAS mutated (M18, MZ2 and SK-mel2) melanoma cell lines, as well as wild-type controls (A7, CHL-1). We evaluated both basal activities (i.e., without treatment) and repair capacities after treatment with vemurafenib or cobimetinib alone, or in combination. Our results indicate that globally the DNA repair capacity of the cell lines was determined by the mutation status of the BRAF and NRAS genes, indicating that the MAPK pathway participates in the regulation of both BER and NER. Treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma cells with vemurafenib alone or the vemurafenib/cobimetinib combination, but not cobimetinib alone, led to reduced DNA repair capacity in about 60% of the BRAF mutated samples, indicating that signaling pathway inhibition can alter DNA repair activity. Upregulation of some DNA repair activities was also observed in several of the treated samples, suggesting activation of compensatory signaling pathways upon treatment. The data collectively indicate that mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes exert distinct regulatory effects on the excision/synthesis steps of the BER and NER pathways and that targeted pharmacological inactivation of the signaling mechanism can translate into specific consequences in DNA repair capacity. The heterogeneity of the responses reported herein could help define subtypes of melanoma that are associated with resistance to targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, the fusion of two gametes, an oocyte and a spermatozoon, during fertilization forms a totipotent zygote. There has been no reported case of natural parthenogenesis, in which embryos develop from unfertilized oocytes. The genome and epigenetic information of haploid gametes are crucial for the proper development of embryos. Haploid embryonic stem cells (haESCs) are unique stem cells established from uniparental blastocysts and possess only one set of chromosomes. Previous studies have shown that sperm or oocyte genome can be replaced by haESCs with or without manipulation of genomic imprinting for generation of mice. Recently, these remarkable semi-cloning methods have been applied for screening of key factors of mouse embryonic development. While haESCs have been applied as substitute of gametic genome, the fundamental mechanism how haESCs contribute to the genome of totipotent embryos is unclear. Here, we show the generation of fertile semi-cloned mice by injection of parthenogenetic haESCs (phaESCs) into oocytes after deletions of two differentially methylated regions (DMRs), the IG-DMR and H19-DMR. For characterizing the genome of semi-cloned embryos further we establish ESC lines from semi-cloned blastocysts. We report that polyploid karyotypes are observed frequently in semi-cloned ESCs (scESCs). Our results confirm that mitotically arrested phaESCs provide high efficiency for semi-cloning when the IG-DMR and H19-DMR are deleted. In addition, we highlight the occurrence of polyploidy that needs to be considered for further improvement for development of semi-cloned embryos derived by haESC injection.",

    "abstract": "Hyperiid amphipod species from the Gulf of Ulloa, Baja California, and the adjacent region (from shelf break to 200 km offshore) were analyzed in order to evaluate diversity and abundances in this productive area that supports small-scale commercial fisheries such as barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer), California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus), abalones, clams, and others. Strong coastal upwelling events were observed during summer seasons of the period 2002-2008 between Punta Eugenia and Punta Abreojos. The upwelling plumes at Punta Abreojos are projected southward in slope waters bordering the coastal shelf of the Gulf of Ulloa, contributing to the separation of coastal and oceanic regions, and explain differences in amphipod diversity and abundances. In the offshore region, the most abundant species were Vibilia armata, Lestrigonus schizogeneios, Primno brevidens, and Eupronoe minuta, similar to previous findings in northern regions of Baja California and southern California. However, their abundances were lower (between 10 and 30 individuals/1000 m3), only reaching 20-50% of abundance levels reported off northern Baja California. In the coastal shelf of the Gulf of Ulloa, amphipods were virtually absent during 2002, 2003 and 2006. However, during 2004 and 2005, abundances of P. brevidens increased (54 and 20 ind/1000 m3, respectively). Moreover, during 2007, abundances of L. schizogeneios, P. brevidens, Lycaea nasuta, Lycaea pulex, and Simorhynchotus antennarius increased considerably (261, 39, 31, 68, 416 ind/1000 m3, respectively), indicating occasional utilization of the coastal shelf by pelagic amphipods. Gelatinous organisms paralleled changes in hyperiid populations and were particularly abundant in 2007 in the coastal shelf. Significant correlations of 17 amphipod species with gelatinous taxa, which are often used as host organisms by hyperiid amphipods, suggest that those organisms enhanced hyperiid abundance and promoted the progression onto the coastal shelf during some years of the 2002-2008 period.",

    "abstract": "Motile organisms actively detect environmental signals and migrate to a preferable environment. Especially, small-size animals convert subtle difference in sensory input into orientation behavioral output for directly steering toward a destination, but the neural mechanisms underlying steering behavior remain elusive. Here, we analyze a C. elegans thermotactic behavior in which a small number of neurons are shown to mediate steering toward a destination temperature. We construct a neuroanatomical model and use an evolutionary algorithm to find configurations of the model that reproduce empirical thermotactic behavior. We find that, in all the evolved models, steering rates are modulated by persistent thermal signals sensed through forward locomotion. Persistent temperature increment lessens steering rates resulting in straight movement of model worms, whereas temperature decrement enlarges steering rates resulting in curvy movement. This relationship between temperature change and steering rates reproduces the empirical thermotactic migration up thermal gradients and steering bias toward higher temperature. Further, spectrum decomposition of neural activities in model worms show that thermal signals are transmitted from a sensory neuron to motor neurons on the longer time scale than sinusoidal locomotion of C. elegans. Our results suggest that employments of persistent sensory signals enable small-size animals to steer toward a destination in natural environment with variable, noisy, and subtle cues.\n\nAuthor summaryA free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans memorizes an environmental temperature and steers toward the remembered temperature on a thermal gradient. How does the C. elegans brain, consisting of 302 neurons, achieve this thermotactic steering behavior? Here, we address this question through neuroanatomical modeling and simulation analyses. We find that persistent thermal input modulates steering rates of model worms; worms run straight when they move up to a destination temperature, whereas run crookedly when move away from the destination. As a result, worms steer toward the destination temperature as observed in experiments. Our analysis also shows that persistent thermal signals are transmitted from a thermosensory neuron to dorsal and ventral neck motor neurons, regulating the balance of dorsoventral muscle contractions of model worms and generating steering behavior. This study indicates that C. elegans can steer toward a destination temperature without processing acute thermal input that informs to which direction it should steer. Such indirect mechanism of steering behavior is potentially employed in other motile organisms.",

    "abstract": "Perturbation of spectrin-based membrane mechanics causes hereditary elliptocytosis and spinocerebellar ataxia, but the underlying cellular basis of pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we introduced the conserved disease-associated spectrin mutations into the C. elegans genome and studied the contribution of spectrin to neuronal migration and dendrite formation in developing larvae. The loss of spectrin generates an ectopic actin polymerization outside of the existing front and secondary membrane protrusions, leading to defective neuronal positioning and dendrite morphology in adult animals. Spectrin accumulates in the lateral and the rear of migrating neuroblasts and redistributes from the soma into the newly formed dendrites, indicating that the spectrin-based membrane skeleton is asymmetric and remodels to regulate actin assembly and cell shape during development. We affinity-purified spectrin from C. elegans and showed that its binding partner ankyrin functions with spectrin. Asymmetry and remodeling of membrane skeleton may enable spatiotemporal modulation of membrane mechanics for distinct developmental events.\n\nSignificance StatementThe biomechanical regulation of neural development is largely unknown. The spectrin-based membrane skeleton is essential for the structural integrity of the plasma membrane. This study addresses the function and behavior of spectrin in neuroblast migration and dendrite formation. The loss of spectrin generates an ectopic actin polymerization outside of the existing front, leading to defective neuronal positioning and dendrite morphology. Spectrin is absent from the leading edge but accumulates in the posterior of migrating neuroblasts and redistributes from the soma into the nascent dendrites, indicating that the membrane skeleton is asymmetric and remodels.

    "abstract": "The kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus is a major vector for Chagas disease in the Americas, and also considered as the primary model for functional studies. Prospective transgenic approaches and genome editing strategies hold great promise for controlling insect populations as well as disease propagation. In this context, identifying visible genetic markers for transgenic methodologies is of paramount importance to advance the field. Here we have identified and analyzed the function of putative cuticle and eye color genes by investigating the effect of gene knockdown on fertility, viability, and the generation of visible phenotypes. Synthesis of the dark, yellow and tan pigments present in the cuticle of most insects depends on the function of key genes encoding enzymes in the tyrosine pathway. Knockdown of the R. prolixus yellow and aaNAT/pro orthologs produces striking alterations in cuticle color. Surprisingly, knockdown of ebony does not generate visible phenotypes. Since loss of ebony function results in a dark cuticle in several insect orders, we conclude that R. prolixus evolved alternative strategies for cuticle coloration, possibly including the loss of a pigmentation function for an entire branch of the tyrosine pathway. Knockdown of the scarlet and brown genes - encoding ABC transporters - alters cuticle and eye pigmentation, implying that the transport of pigment into proper organelles is an important process both for cuticle and eye coloration in this species. Therefore, this analysis identifies for the first time potential visible markers for transgenesis in a hemipteran vector for a debilitating human disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe hemipteran Rhodnius prolixus - also known as a kissing bug - is a main vector transmitting the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, a debilitating infection estimated to affect more than 6 million people in Central and South America. In order to limit disease spread, an important measure is insect vector control. However, kissing bugs - like other insects - develop resistance to insecticides. Alternative strategies based on transgenesis and the recently developed CRISPR- based genome edition hold great promise to control vector population or generate parasite-resistant insects. For these approaches to be feasible in R. prolixus, it is critical to identify visible phenotypic markers. Here we identify and describe several genes controlling cuticle and eye pigmentation that are well-suited putative landing sites for transformation strategies. Among these, loss-of-function mutations in the ABC transporter encoding scarlet and the tyrosine pathway enzyme encoding aaNAT/pro generate striking and easily visible phenotypes. Importantly, the knockdown of these genes does not affect insect viability and fertility under laboratory conditions. Our results suggest that R. prolixus has developed alternative strategies for cuticle coloration involving the loss of an entire branch of tanning loci, while the other branch producing cuticle patterns by generating non-pigmented areas has gained critical importance.",

    "abstract": "The pneumonia-causing COVID-19 pandemia has prompt worldwide efforts to understand its biological and clinical traits of newly identified HCoV-19 virus. In this study, post-translational modification (PTM) of recombinant HCoV-19 S and hACE2 were characterized by LC-MSMS. We revealed that both proteins were highly decorated with specific proportions of N-glycan subtypes. Out of 21 possible glycosites in HCoV-19 S protein, 20 were confirmed completely occupied by N-glycans, with oligomannose glycans being the most abundant type. All 7 possible glycosylation sites in hACE2 were completely occupied mainly by complex type N-glycans. However, we showed that glycosylation did not directly contribute to the binding affinity between SARS-CoV spike protein and hACE2. Additionally, we also identified multiple sites methylated in both proteins, and multiple prolines in hACE2 were converted to hydroxylproline. Refined structural models were built by adding N-glycan and PTMs to recently published cryo-EM structure of the HCoV-19 S and hACE2 generated with glycosylation sites in the vicinity of binding surface. The PTM and glycan maps of both HCoV-19 S and hACE2 provide additional structural details to study mechanisms underlying host attachment, immune response mediated by S protein and hACE2, as well as knowledge to develop remedies and vaccines desperately needed nowadays.",

    "abstract": "In December 2019, the first cases of a novel coronavirus infection causing COVID-19 were diagnosed in Wuhan, China. Viral Papain-Like cysteine protease (PLpro, NSP3) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and represents a promising target for the development of antiviral drugs. Here, we used a combinatorial substrate library containing natural and a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids and performed comprehensive activity profiling of SARS-CoV-2-PLpro. On the scaffold of best hits from positional scanning we designed optimal fluorogenic substrates and irreversible inhibitors with a high degree of selectivity for SARS PLpro variants versus other proteases. We determined crystal structures of two of these inhibitors (VIR250 and VIR251) in complex with SARS-CoV-2-PLpro which reveals their inhibitory mechanisms and provides a structural basis for the observed substrate specificity profiles. Lastly, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-PLpro harbors deISGylating activities similar to SARS-CoV-1-PLpro but its ability to hydrolyze K48-linked Ub chains is diminished, which our sequence and structure analysis provides a basis for. Altogether this work has revealed the molecular rules governing PLpro substrate specificity and provides a framework for development of inhibitors with potential therapeutic value or drug repositioning.",

    "abstract": "The dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the cell surface glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate (HS) for the regulation of homeostasis is exploited by many microbial pathogens as a means of adherence and invasion. The closely related polysaccharide heparin, the widely used anticoagulant drug, which is structurally similar to HS and is a common experimental proxy, can be expected to mimic the properties of HS. Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses when added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1 and inhibits cellular invasion by SARS-CoV-2. We have previously demonstrated that unfractionated heparin binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain, induces a conformational change and have reported the structural features of heparin on which this interaction depends. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that enoxaparin, a low molecular weight clinical anticoagulant, also binds the S1 RBD protein and induces conformational change. Here we expand upon these studies, to a wide range of low molecular weight heparins and demonstrate that they induce a variety of conformational changes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These findings may have further implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing low molecular weight heparins, as well as for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents, against SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of the current pandemic COVID-19. Like other coronaviruses, this novel virus relies on the surface Spike glycoprotein to access the host cells, mainly through the interaction of its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, molecular entities able to interfere with binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to ACE2 have a great potential to inhibit viral entry. Starting from the available structural data on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor, we here engineered a mini-protein with the aim of creating a soluble and stable Spike interactor. This mini-protein, which was recombinantly produced in high yields, possesses a stable  helical conformation and is able to interact with the RBD of glycosylated Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 with nanomolar affinity, as measured by microscale thermophoresis. By plugging the Spike protein, our mini-protein constitutes a valid tool for the development of treatments against different types of coronavirus.",

    "abstract": "Lincombian-Ranisian-Jerzmanowician (LRJ) sites are sparse, and Koziarnia Cave in Poland is one of only few such sites situated at the eastern fringe of LRJ. The aim of the recent study was to obtain new chronostratigraphic data for the LRJ industries due to their extreme scarcity in Central Europe. Although the new fieldworks did not bring new fossil directeur such as bifacial leafpoints, a detail debitage analysis enabled identifying a presence of the ventral thinning chips in layer D, which could be identified as the LRJ assemblage-containing stratum. Besides the LRJ assemblage, strata with traces of Late Middle Palaeolithic and Early Gravettian occupation were found at the site. The radiocarbon dates of Koziarnia samples show that the archaeological settlement represent one of the oldest Gravettian stays north to Carpathians. What is more, these dates demonstrate that the cave had been alternately occupied by humans and cave bears. Additionally the radiocarbon dates indicate rather young chronology of the Jerzmanowician occupation in Koziarnia Cave (c.a. 39-36 ky cal. BP). The results confirm the possibility of long chronology of the LRJ technocomplex, exceeding the Campanian Ignimbrite event.",

    "abstract": "There is unmet need for effective stroke therapies. Numerous neuroprotection attempts for acute cerebral ischemia have failed and there is growing interest in developing therapies that widen the treatment initiation window and promote functional recovery through increasing synaptic plasticity. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is an already proven target for acute experimental stroke intervention and was hypothesized to also contribute to neuroinflammation-mediated impairment of recovery during the subacute phase. Neflamapimod, an orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant, potent and selective small molecule p38 inhibitor was evaluated as a subacute phase stroke treatment to promote recovery in this research study. Neflamapimod administration at two clinically relevant dose levels was initiated outside of the previously characterized neuroprotection window of less than 24 hours after stroke for p38 inhibitors to rats after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Continuous administration of neflamapimod, starting at 48 hours after reperfusion, significantly improved behavioral outcomes assessed by the modified neurological severity score at four- and six-weeks post stroke in a dose-dependent manner. Neflamapimod also demonstrated beneficial effects on additional measures of sensory and motor function and resulted in a dose-related increase in the terminal brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein level in both the injured and uninjured brain hemisphere. Variable interleukin-1{beta} levels were detected in the injured brain hemisphere at study termination in a subset of the animals within every test group, implying ongoing, chronic inflammation, however, no clear neflamapimod effect on interleukin-1{beta} production was observable. The dose-related in vivo efficacy of neflamapimod offers the possibility of both expanding the window for initiation of therapy after stroke and for improving recovery after a completed stroke. Since neflamapimod is already in mid-stage clinical trials for Alzheimers disease and related dementias, the current results make it especially attractive for evaluation in a proof-of- concept clinical trial as therapeutic to promote recovery after ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "In Arabidopsis, CONSTANS (CO) integrates light and circadian clock signals to promote flowering under long days (LD). In the grasses, a duplication generated two paralogs designated as CONSTANS 1 (CO1) and CONSTANS 2 (CO2). Here we show that in tetraploid wheat plants grown under LD, combined loss-of-function mutations in the A and B-genome homeologs of CO1 and CO2 (co1 co2) result in a small (3 d) but significant (P<0.0001) acceleration of heading time both in PHOTOPERIOD1 (PPD1) sensitive (Ppd-A1b, functional ancestral allele) and insensitive (Ppd-A1a, functional dominant allele) backgrounds. Under short days (SD), co1 co2 mutants headed 13 d earlier than the wild type (P<0.0001) in the presence of Ppd-A1a. However, in the presence of Ppd-A1b, spikes from both genotypes failed to emerge by 180 d. These results indicate that CO1 and CO2 operate mainly as weak heading time repressors in both LD and SD. By contrast, in ppd1 mutants with loss-of-function mutations in both PPD1 homeologs, the wild type Co1 allele accelerated heading time >60 d relative to the co1 mutant allele under LD. We detected significant genetic interactions among CO1, CO2 and PPD1 genes on heading time, which were reflected in complex interactions at the transcriptional and protein levels. Loss-of-function mutations in PPD1 delayed heading more than combined co1 co2 mutations and, more importantly, PPD1 was able to perceive and respond to differences in photoperiod in the absence of functional CO1 and CO2 genes. Similarly, CO1 was able to accelerate heading time in response to LD in the absence of a functional PPD1. Taken together, these results indicate that PPD1 and CO1 are able to respond to photoperiod in the absence of each other, and that interactions between these two photoperiod pathways at the transcriptional and protein levels are important to fine-tune the flowering response in wheat.\n\nAuthor summaryAn understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of wheat heading time is required to engineer more productive varieties better adapted to new or changing environments. A large proportion of wheats natural variation in heading time is determined by differences in genes controlling the photoperiodic response. In this study, we show that the wheat PHOTOPERIOD1 (PPD1) gene has a stronger effect on heading time than CONSTANS1 (CO1) and CO2 in the regulation of the photoperiodic response, and that complex genetic interactions among these genes are important to fine-tune heading time. Using loss-of-function mutants for both CO1 and CO2, we demonstrate that these genes are not required for PPD1 to perceive differences in photoperiod and regulate heading time. Similarly, we show that in the absence of PPD1, CO1 can accelerate heading time more than 60 days in response to long days. Our results indicate that each of these two wheat photoperiod pathways can respond to differences in photoperiod even in the absence of the other one. Differences in the relative importance of these two pathways and in their epistatic interactions have contributed to the diversity of photoperiodic responses observed in different grass species.",

    "abstract": "With a great diversity in gene composition including multiple putative antibiotic-resistance genes, AbaR islands are potential contributors to multi-drug resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii. However, the effective contribution of AbaR to antibiotic resistance and bacterial physiology remains elusive. To address this, we sought to accurately remove AbaR islands and restore the integrity of their insertion site. To this end, we devised a versatile scarless genome editing strategy. We performed this genetic modification in two recent A. baumannii clinical strains: the strain AB5075 and the nosocomial strain AYE which carry AbaR11 and AbaR1 islands of 19.7 kbp and 86.2 kbp, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibilities were then compared between the parental strains and their AbaR-cured derivatives. As anticipated by the predicted function of the ORF of this island, the antibiotic resistance profiles were identical between the wild type and the AbaR11-cured AB5075 strains. In contrast, AbaR1 carries 25 ORFs with a predicted resistance to several classes of antibiotics and the AYE AbaR1-cured derivative showed restored susceptibility to multiple classes of antibiotics. Moreover, curing of AbaRs restored high levels of natural transformability. Indeed, most AbaR islands are inserted into the comM gene involved in natural transformation. Our data indicate that AbaR insertion effectively inactivates comM and that the restored comM is functional. Curing of AbaR consistently resulted in highly transformable, and therefore, easily genetically tractable strains. Emendation of AbaR provides insight into the functional consequences of AbaR acquisition.",
