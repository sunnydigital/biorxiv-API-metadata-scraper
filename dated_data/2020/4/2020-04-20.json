    "abstract": "Translocation is essential to the anthrax toxin mechanism. Protective antigen (PA), the translocon component of this AB toxin, forms an oligomeric pore with three key clamp sites that aid in the efficient entry of lethal factor (LF) or edema factor (EF), the enzymatic components of the toxin, into the cell. LF and EF translocate through the PA pore (PApore) with the pH gradient between the endosome and the cytosol facilitating rapid translocation in vivo. Structural details of the translocation process have remained elusive despite their biological importance. To overcome the technical challenges of studying translocation intermediates, we developed a novel method to immobilize, transition, and stabilize anthrax toxin to mimic important physiological steps in the intoxication process. Here, we report a cryoEM snapshot of PApore translocating the N-terminal domain of LF (LFN). The resulting 3.3 [A] structure of the complex shows density of partially unfolded LFN near the canonical PApore binding site as well as in the  clamp, the {Phi} clamp, and the charge clamp. We also observe density consistent with an  helix emerging from the 100 [A] {beta} barrel channel suggesting LF secondary structural elements begin to refold in the pore channel. We conclude the anthrax toxin {beta} barrel aids in efficient folding of its enzymatic payload prior to channel exit. Our hypothesized refolding mechanism has broader implications for pore length of other protein translocating toxins.\n\nSignificance StatementToxins like the anthrax toxin aid bacteria in establishing an infection, evading the immune system, and proliferating inside a host. The anthrax toxin, a proteinaceous AB toxin secreted by Bacillus anthracis, consists of lethal factor and protective antigen. In this work, we explore the molecular details of lethal factor translocation through protective antigen pore necessary for cellular entry. Our cryo electron microscopy results provide evidence of lethal factor secondary structure refolding prior to protective antigen pore exit. Similar to the ribosome exit tunnel, the toxin pore channel likely contributes to native folding of lethal factor. We predict other AB toxins with extended pores also initiate substrate refolding inside the translocon for effective intoxication during bacterial infection, evasion, and proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Plants monitor temperatures over long timescales to assess seasons and time developmental transitions. In Arabidopsis thaliana, winter is registered during vernalization through the temperature-dependent repression and epigenetic silencing of floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Natural Arabidopsis accessions show considerable variation in vernalization, however which aspect of the FLC repression mechanism is most important for adaptation to different climates is not clear. By analyzing FLC silencing in natural variants throughout winter in three field sites, we find that FLC starting levels and early phases of silencing are the major variables underlying vernalization response, rather than establishment of epigenetic silencing. This results in an intricate interplay between promotion and delay of flowering to balance survival, and through a post-vernalization effect of FLC, reproductive effort via branch production. These data reveal how non-coding FLC variation aligns vernalization response to different climatic conditions and year-on-year fluctuations in natural temperature profiles.\n\nImpact StatementAlleles of the major floral repressor vary in their initial expression to underpin the ability of Arabidopsis to survive year-on-year climatic fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) results from mutations within the gene encoding the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR), a transmembrane chloride channel found on the apical surface of epithelial cells. The most common CF-causing mutation results in a deletion of phenylalanine 508 ({Delta}F508-CFTR), a residue normally found within the NBD1 domain. Loss of F508 causes NBD1 to be less thermodynamically stable and prevents proper tertiary folding of CFTR. As a result, CFTR is not properly trafficked to the cell surface. Recently, progress has been made towards the development of small molecule \"correctors\" that can restore CFTR tertiary structure and stabilize the channel to overcome the instability inherent in {Delta}F508-CFTR. However, the resultant improvement in channel activity has been modest, and the need for potent correctors remains. To fully inform such efforts, a better understanding of the molecular pathology associated with {Delta}F508-CFTR is required. Here we present a comprehensive study of the impact of F508 deletion on both purified NBD1 and full-length CFTR. Through the use of homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, mutational analysis, biochemical, biophysical and functional characterization studies, we obtained insight into how the {Delta}F508 mutation may lead to helical unraveling of transmembrane domains 10 and 11 (TM10, TM11), and how the known suppressor mutations V510D and R1070W, as well as novel second site suppressor mutations (SSSMs) identified in this work, may act to rescue {Delta}F508-CFTR maturation and trafficking.",

    "abstract": "The Wnt signaling pathway is down-regulated in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) and contributes to the block of myogenic differentiation. Epigenetic mechanisms leading to its suppression are unknown and could pave the way towards novel therapeutic modalities. In this study, we demonstrate that the H3K9 lysine methyltransferase G9a suppresses canonical Wnt signaling by activating expression of the Wnt antagonist DKK1. Inhibition of G9a expression or activity reduced DKK1 expression and elevated canonical Wnt signaling resulting in myogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, G9a impacted Sp1 and p300 enrichment at the DKK1 promoter in a methylation-dependent manner. The reduced tumor growth upon G9a deficiency was reversed by recombinant DKK1 or LGK974, which also inhibits Wnt signaling. Consistently, among thirteen drugs targeting chromatin modifiers, G9a inhibitors were highly effective in reducing ERMS cell viability. Together, our study demonstrates that ERMS cells are vulnerable to G9a inhibitors and suggest that targeting the G9a-DKK1-{beta}-catenin node holds promise for differentiation therapy.",

    "abstract": "The connection from medial habenula (MHb) to interpeduncular nucleus is critical for aversion- and addiction-related behaviors. This pathway is unique in selective expression of R-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Cav2.3) in its terminals, and robust potentiation of release via presynaptic GABAB receptors (GBRs). To understand the mechanism underlying this peculiar GBR effect, we examined the presynaptic localization and function of Cav2.3, GBR, and its auxiliary subunits, K+-channel tetramerization domain-containing (KCTD) proteins. We found selective co-expression of KCTD12b and Cav2.3 at the presynaptic active zone. GBR-mediated potentiation remained intact in KCTD12b KO mice but lasted significantly shorter. This impairment was associated with increased release and an insertion of KCTD8 into the active zone. In heterologous cells, we found direct binding of KCTD8 and KCTD12b to Cav2.3, and potentiation of Cav2.3 currents by KCTD8. The unexpected interaction of Cav2.3 with KCTDs therefore provides a means to scale synaptic strength independent of GBR activation.",

    "abstract": "Ageing is characterized by changes in sensory and cognitive abilities. While there is evidence that decline in sensory acuity and enhanced multisensory integration predict cognitive status in healthy older adults, potential mechanistic links between these age-related alterations remain unclear. In the current study, we assessed performance of younger and older healthy adults in a visuotactile delayed match-to-sample task and related indices of multisensory integration to unisensory perceptual thresholds and cognitive assessment data. Additionally, we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to modulate cortical networks found to underlie visuotactile interactions and working-memory matching in our previous work. Analysing response times and signal detection measures, we found older adults to show enhanced multisensory integration and benefit more from successful working memory matching. Both measures predicted cognitive status and correlated positively with each other, suggesting that they likely reflect a common underlying tendency to integrate information. Sensory capability, however, independently predicted cognitive status. tACS with beta frequency (20 Hz) accelerated task performance and this effect was more pronounced in the older group. We conclude that sensory capability and information integration represent independent predictors of cognitive status. Finally, we discuss a potential role of the parietal cortex in mediating augmented integration in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Telomere shortening is one hallmark of cell ageing that can limit the proliferative capacity of cell populations and increase risk for age-related disease. It has been hypothesized that short telomeres, and subsequently a limited proliferative capacity of hippocampal progenitor cells, could contribute to smaller hippocampal volumes and impaired cognition, amongst psychiatric disorder patients. The current study employed a systematic, multidisciplinary approach which aimed to model the effects of telomere shortening on human hippocampal neurogenesis, and to explore its relationship with cognition and psychiatric disorder risk. We modelled telomere shortening in human hippocampal progenitor cells in vitro using a serial passaging protocol that mimics the end-replication problem. Aged progenitors demonstrated shorter telomeres (p<0.05), and reduced rates of cell proliferation, as marked by bromodeoxyuridine staining (p<0.001), with no changes in the ability of cells to differentiate into neurons or glia. RNA-sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis revealed an effect of cell ageing on gene networks related to neurogenesis, telomere maintenance, cell senescence and cytokine production. Downregulated transcripts showed a significant overlap with genes regulating cognitive function and risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Collectively, our results suggest that reductions in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, caused by telomere shortening, could represent a cellular mechanism contributing to age-related cognitive impairment and psychiatric disorder risk.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn clinical practice, EEGs are assessed visually. For practical reasons, recordings often need to be performed with a reduced number of electrodes and artifacts make assessment difficult. To circumvent these obstacles, different interpolation techniques can be utilized. These techniques usually perform better for higher electrode densities and values interpolated at areas far from electrodes can be unreliable. Using a method that learns the statistical distribution of the cortical electrical fields and predicts values may yield better results.\n\nNew MethodGenerative networks based on convolutional layers were trained to upsample from 4 or 14 channels or to dynamically restore single missing channels to recreate 21 channel EEGs. 5,144 hours of data from 1,385 subjects of the Temple University Hospital EEG database were used for training and evaluating the networks.\n\nComparison with Existing MethodThe results were compared to spherical spline interpolation. Several statistical measures were used as well as a visual evaluation by board certified clinical neurophysiologists. Overall, the generative networks performed significantly better. There was no difference between real and network generated data in the number of examples assessed as artificial by experienced EEG interpreters whereas for data generated by interpolation, the number was significantly higher. In addition, network performance improved with increasing number of included subjects, with the greatest effect seen in the range 5 - 100 subjects.\n\nConclusionsUsing neural networks to restore or upsample EEG signals is a viable alternative to interpolation methods.",

Here, our goal was to tailor these approaches for this purpose: Firstly, we combined in vivo juxtacellular recordings and GCaMP6f-based 2-P calcium imaging in layer II/III of mouse visual cortex to tune our detection algorithm towards a 100 % specific identification of AP-related calcium transients. False-positive-free detection was achieved at a sensitivity of approximately 73 %. To further increase specificity, secondly, we minimized photostimulation artifacts as a potential source for false-positives by using extended-wavelength-spectrum laser sources for optogenetic stimulation of the excitatory opsin C1V1. We achieved artifact-free all-optical experiments performing photostimulations at 1100 nm or higher and simultaneous calcium imaging at 920 nm in mouse visual cortex in vivo. Thirdly, we determined the spectral range for maximizing efficacy of optogenetic control by performing 2-P photostimulations of individual neurons with wavelengths up to 1300 nm. The rate of evoked transients in GCaMP6f/C1V1-co-expressing cortical neurons peaked already at 1100 nm. By refining spike detection and defining 1100 nm as the optimal wavelength for artifact-free and effective stimulations of C1V1 in GCaMP-based all-optical interrogations, we increased the translational value of these approaches, e.g. for the use in preclinical applications of network-based therapies.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe maximize translational relevance of 2-P all-optical physiology by increasing specificity, minimizing artifacts and optimizing stimulation efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of pyramidal cell connections are among the key mechanisms underlying learning and memory in the brain. Despite their important role, only a few of these connections have been characterized in terms of LTP/LTD dynamics, such as the one between layer 5 thick-tufted pyramidal cells (L5-TTPCs). Comparing the available evidence on different pyramidal connection types reveals a large variability of experimental outcomes, possibly indicating the presence of connection-type-specific mechanisms. Here, we show that a calcium-based plasticity rule regulating L5-TTPC synapses holds also for several other pyramidal-to-pyramidal connections in a digital model of neocortical tissue. In particular, we show that synaptic physiology, cell morphology and innervation patterns jointly determine LTP/LTD dynamics without requiring a different model or parameter set for each connection type. We therefore propose that a similar set of plasticity mechanisms is shared by seemingly very different neocortical connections and that only a small number of targeted experiments is required for generating a complete map of synaptic plasticity dynamics in the neocortex.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial deubiquitylase USP30 negatively regulates the selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria. It has been proposed as an actionable target to alleviate the loss of function of the mitophagy pathway governed by the Parkinsons Disease associated genes PINK1 and PRKN. We present the characterisation of a N-cyano pyrrolidine derived compound, FT3967385, with high selectivity for USP30. The compound is well tolerated with no loss of total mitochondrial mass. We demonstrate that ubiquitylation of TOM20, a component of the outer mitochondrial membrane import machinery that directly interacts with USP30, represents a robust biomarker for both USP30 loss and inhibition. We have conducted proteomics analyses on a SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cell line model to directly compare the effects of genetic loss of USP30 with selective inhibition in an unbiased fashion. We have thereby identified a subset of ubiquitylation events consequent to mitochondrial depolarisation that are USP30 sensitive. Within responsive elements of the ubiquitylome, several components of the outer mitochondrial membrane transport (TOM) complex are most prominent. Thus, our data support a model whereby USP30 can regulate the availability of ubiquitin at the specific site of mitochondrial PINK1 accumulation following membrane depolarisation. In this model, USP30 deubiquitylation of TOM complex components dampens the trigger for the Parkin-dependent amplification of mitochondrial ubiquitylation leading to mitophagy. Accordingly, PINK1 generation of phospho-Ser65 Ubiquitin proceeds more rapidly and to a greater extent in cells either lacking USP30 or subject to USP30 inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Opioid use and abuse has reached epidemic proportion in the United States resulting in a significant numbers of deaths due to overdose. While environmental factors are implicated in opioid addiction, less is known about the role of exposure to environmental pollutants on the brain opioid system. Human and preclinical studies have suggested an association between childhood lead (Pb2+) intoxication and proclivity to substance abuse and delinquent behavior. Opioid receptors are involved in the biological effects of opioids and other drugs of abuse. In this study, we examine the effect of chronic developmental Pb2+ exposure on -opioid receptor (MOR) levels in the rat brain using [3H]-D-Ala2-MePhe4-Gly-ol5 enkephalin ([3H]-DAMGO) quantitative receptor autoradiography.\n\nOur results indicate that chronic developmental Pb2+ exposure increases the levels of [3H]-DAMGO specific binding to MOR in several limbic regions of the brain in male and female rats during the pre-adolescence (PN14) and early-adolescence (PN28) period. These changes were less pronounced in late-adolescence (PN50) and adult (PN120) animals. Our findings are important because the pre-adolescence and early adolescence period is a time in which there is higher engagement in reward and drug seeking behaviors in humans.\n\nIn summary, we show that chronic exposure to Pb2+ an ubiquitous and well-known environmental contaminant and neurotoxicant, alters MOR levels in brain regions associated with addiction circuits in the adolescent period with important implications to opioid drug use and abuse.",

    "abstract": "The greatly accelerated economic growth during the Anthropocene has resulted in astonishing improvements in many aspects of human well-being, but has also caused the acceleration of risks, such as the interlinked biodiversity and climate crisis. Here, we report on another risk: the accelerated infectious disease risk associated with the number and geographic spread of human infectious disease outbreaks. Using the most complete, reliable, and up-to-date database on human infectious disease outbreaks (GIDEON), we show that the number of disease outbreaks, the number of diseases involved in these outbreaks, and the number of countries affected have increased during the entire Anthropocene. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of these outbreaks is becoming more globalized in the sense that the overall modularity of the disease networks across the globe has decreased, meaning disease outbreaks have become increasingly pandemic in their nature. This decrease in modularity is associated with tremendous increases in mobility, especially in air traffic. We also show that those countries and regions which are most central within these disease networks tend to be countries and global regions with higher GDPs. Therefore, one cost of greater economic growth and the associated increased global mobility is the increased risk of disease outbreaks and their wider spread. Finally, the recent global outbreaks of Covid-19 and monkeypox allowed us to demonstrate that the time of first occurrence in each country was correlated with each countrys centrality value in the disease network. We briefly discuss three different scenarios of how mobility may develop in the future which decision-makers might discuss in light of our results.",

Here, we tested the role DNA methylation as a hub of integration, linking plasticity and physiological response to water deficit in the shoot apical meristem of the model tree poplar (Populus). Using a reverse genetic approach, we compared hypomethylated RNAi-ddm1 lines to wild-type trees for drought tolerance. An integrative analysis was realized with phytohormone balance, methylomes, transcriptomes and mobilomes.\n\nHypomethylated lines were more tolerant when subjected to moderate water deficit and were intrinsically more tolerant to drought-induced cavitation. The alteration of the DDM1 machinery induced variation in DNA methylation in a cytosine context dependent manner, both in genes and transposable elements. Hypomethylated lines subjected to water deficit showed altered expression of genes involved in phytohormone pathways, such as salicylic acid and modified hormonal balance. Several transposable elements showed stress- and/or line-specific patterns of reactivation, and we could detect copy number variations for two of them in stressed ddm1 lines.\n\nOverall, our data highlight two major roles for DNA methylation in the shoot apical meristem: control of stress response and plasticity through transduction of hormone signaling and maintenance of genome integrity through the control of transposable elements.",

After osmotic stress-enforced cell swelling or shrinkage, the cells regulate intracellular osmolality to recover their volume. However, the mechanisms recognizing osmotic stress remain obscured. We previously clarified that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 3 (ASK3) bidirectionally responds to osmotic stress and regulates cell volume recovery. Here, we report that macromolecular crowding induces liquid-demixing condensates of ASK3 under hyperosmotic stress, which transduce osmosensing signal into ASK3 inactivation. A genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen identified an ASK3 inactivation regulator, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), related to poly(ADP-ribose) signaling. Furthermore, we clarify that poly(ADP-ribose) keeps ASK3 condensates in the liquid phase and enables ASK3 to become inactivated under hyperosmotic stress. Our findings demonstrate that cells rationally incorporate physicochemical phase separation into their osmosensing systems.",

    "abstract": "The cardiac valvular endothelial cells (VECs) are an ideal cell source that could be used for the fabrication of the next generation tissue-engineered cardiac valves (TEVs). However, few studies have been focused on the derivation of this important cell type. Here we describe a chemically defined xeno-free method for generating VEC-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) through an intermediate endocardium stage. HPSCs were initially specified to KDR+/ISL1+ multipotent cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), followed by differentiation into endocardial progenitors under the combined treatment with VEGFA, BMP4 and bFGF. In the presence of VEGFA, BMP4 and TGFb, valve endocardial progenitor cells (VEPs) were efficiently derived from endocardial progenitors without a sorting step. Mechanistically, administration of TGFb and BMP4 may specify the VEP fate by facilitating the expression of key transcription factors ETV2 and NFATc1 at the immediate early stage and by activating Notch signaling at the later stage. Notch activation is likely an important part of VEP induction. HPSC-derived VEPs exhibited morphological, molecular and functional similarities to that of the primary VECs isolated from normal human aortic valves. When hPSC-derived VEPs were seeded onto the surface of the de-cellularized porcine aortic valve (DCV) matrix scaffolds, they exhibited higher proliferation and survival potential than the primary VECs. Our results suggest that hPSC-derived VEPs could serve as as a potential platform for the study of valve development, and as starting materials for the construction of the next generation TEVs.\n\nHighlightsO_LIValve endocardial progenitor cells (VEPs) could be efficiently derived from hPSCs without a sorting step\nC_LIO_LIThe combined treatment with TGFb and BMP4 induce VEP fate by enhancing the expression of ETV2 and NFATc1\nC_LIO_LIHPSC-derived VEPs resemble the isolated primary VECs molecularly, morphologically and functionally\nC_LIO_LIHPSC-derived VEPs exhibit proliferative and functional potential similar to the primary VECs when seeded onto the DCVs\nC_LI",

Here we have determined the stability of acyl-coenzyme A binding protein at pH 5.3 and chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 at pH 3 and pH 6.25 by combined temperature and denaturant unfolding. We used a setup where tryptophan fluorescence is measured in quartz capillaries where only 10 l is needed. Temperature unfolding of a series of 15 samples at increasing denaturant concentrations provided accurate and precise thermodynamic parameters. We find that the number of samples may be further reduced and less than 10 g of protein in total are needed for reliable stability measurements. For assessment of stability of protein purified in small scale e.g. in micro plate format, our method will be highly applicable.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial fission and fusion are highly regulated by energy demand and physiological conditions to control the production, activity, and movement of these organelles. Mitochondria are arrayed in a periodic pattern in Caenorhabditis elegans muscle, but this pattern is disrupted by mutations in the mitochondrial fission component dynamin. Here we show that the dramatically disorganized mitochondria caused by a mitochondrial fission-defective dynamin mutation is strongly suppressed to a more periodic pattern by a second mutation in lysosomal biogenesis or acidification. Vitamin B12 is normally imported from the bacterial diet via lysosomal degradation of B12-binding proteins and transport of vitamin B12 to the mitochondrion and cytoplasm. We show that the lysosomal dysfunction induced by gene inactivations of lysosomal biogenesis or acidification factors causes vitamin B12 deficiency. Growth of the C. elegans dynamin mutant on an E. coli strain with low vitamin B12 also strongly suppressed the mitochondrial fission defect. Of the two C. elegans enzymes that require B12, gene inactivation of methionine synthase suppressed the mitochondrial fission defect of a dynamin mutation. We show that lysosomal dysfunction induced mitochondrial biogenesis which is mediated by vitamin B12 deficiency and methionine restriction. S-adenosylmethionine, the methyl donor of many methylation reactions, including histones, is synthesized from methionine by S-adenosylmethionine synthase; inactivation of the sams-1 S-adenosylmethionine synthase also suppresses the drp-1 fission defect, suggesting that vitamin B12 regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and then affects mitochondrial fission via chromatin pathways.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe balance of mitochondrial fission and fusion, two aspects of mitochondrial dynamics, is important for mitochondrial function. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans lysosomal activity regulates mitochondrial dynamics by affecting mitochondrial fission through interfering the metabolism of a micronutrient, vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is exclusively obtained from diets in animals including C. elegans and humans, and its uptake is mediated by the lysosome. We show that lysosomal dysfunction causes vitamin B12 deficiency that leads to reduction of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine to in turn increase mitochondrial biogenesis and fission. Our study provides an insight on the interactions between mitochondrial function and micronutrient metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Gene prioritisation at GWAS loci necessities careful assembly and examination of different types of molecular evidence to arrive at a set of plausible candidates. In many human traits, common small-effect mutations may subtly dysregulate the function of the very same genes which are impacted by rare, large-effect mutations causing Mendelian disease of similar phenotype. However, information on gene-Mendelian disease associations, rare pathogenic mutations driving the disease, and the disease phenotype ontology is dispersed across many data sources and does not integrate easily with enrichment analysis.\n\nMendelVar is a new webserver facilitating transfer of knowledge from Mendelian disease research into interpretation of genetic associations from GWAS of complex traits. MendelVar allows querying of pre-defined or LD-determined genomic intervals against a comprehensive integrated database to find overlap with genes linked to Mendelian disease. Next, MendelVar looks for enrichment of any Human Phenotype Ontology, Disease Ontology and other ontology/pathway terms associated with identified Mendelian genes. In addition, MendelVar provides a list of all overlapping pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants for Mendelian disease sourced from ClinVar.\n\nInclusion of information obtained from MendelVar in post-GWAS gene annotation pipelines can strengthen the case for causal importance of some genes. Moreover, as genes with Mendelian disease evidence may make for more successful drug targets, this may be particularly useful in drug discovery pipelines. Taking GWAS summary statistics for male-pattern baldness, intelligence and atopic dermatitis, we demonstrate the use of MendelVar in prioritizing candidate genes at these loci which are linked to relevant enriched ontology terms.

    "abstract": "Biodiversity can affect the properties of groups of organisms, such as ecosystem function and the persistence of colonizing populations. Genomic data offer a newly available window to diversity, complementary to other measures like taxonomic or phenotypic diversity. We tested whether native genetic diversity in field experimental stands of Arabidopsis thaliana affected their aboveground biomass and fecundity in their colonized range. We constructed some stands of genotypes that we a priori predicted would differ in performance or show overyielding. We found no relationship between genetic diversity and stand total biomass. However, increasing stand genetic diversity increased fecundity in high resource conditions. Polyculture (multiple genotype) stands consistently yielded less biomass than expected based on the yields of component genotypes in monoculture. This under-yielding was strongest in stands with late-flowering and high biomass genotypes, potentially due to interference competition by these genotypes. Using a new implementation of association mapping, we identified genetic loci whose diversity was associated with stand-level yield, revealing a major flowering time locus associated with under-yielding of polycultures. Our field experiment supports community ecology studies that find a range of diversity-function relationships. Nevertheless, our results suggest diversity in colonizing propagule pools can enhance population fitness. Furthermore, interference competition among genotypes differing in flowering time might limit the advantages of polyculture.",

    "abstract": "Anatomically Modern Humans are the sole survivor of a group of hominins that inhabited our planet during the last ice age and that included, among others, Homo neanderthalensis, Homo denisova, and Homo erectus. Whether previous hominin extinctions were triggered by external factors, such as abrupt climate change, volcanic eruptions or whether competition and interbreeding played major roles in their demise still remains unresolved. Here I present a spatially resolved numerical hominin dispersal model (HDM) with empirically constrained key parameters that simulates the migration and interaction of Anatomically Modern Humans and Neanderthals in the rapidly varying climatic environment of the last ice age. The model simulations document that rapid temperature and vegetation changes associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger events were not major drivers of global Neanderthal extinction between 50-35 thousand years ago, but played important roles regionally, in particular over northern Europe. According to a series of parameter sensitivity experiments conducted with the HDM, a realistic extinction of the Neanderthal population can only be simulated when Homo sapiens is chosen to be considerably more effective in exploiting scarce glacial food resources as compared to Neanderthals.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe brain response to drug-related cues is an important marker in addiction-medicine, however, the temporal dynamics of this response in repeated exposure to the cues are not well known yet. In an fMRI drug cue-reactivity task, the presence of rapid habituation or sensitization was investigated by modeling time and its interaction with condition (drug>neutral) using an initial discovery-sample. Replication of this temporal response was tested in two other clinical populations.\n\nMethodsSixty-five male participants (35.8{+/-}8.4 years-old) with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) were recruited as the discovery-sample. A linear mixed effects model was used to identify areas with a time-by-condition interaction in the discovery-sample. Replication of these effects was tested in two other samples (29 female with MUD and 22 male with opioid use disorder). The second replication-sample was re-tested within two weeks.\n\nResultsIn the discovery-sample, clusters within the VMPFC, amygdala and ventral striatum showed both significant condition and condition-by-time interaction with a habituation response for the drug-related cues but not neutral cues. The estimates for the main effects and interactions were generally consistent between the discovery and replication-samples across all clusters. The re-test data showed consistent lack of drug>neutral and habituation response within all selected clusters in the second cue-exposure session.\n\nConclusionsVMPFC, amygdala and ventral striatum show a habituation in response to drug-related cues which is consistent among different clinical populations. Habituation in response in the first session of cue-exposure and lack of reactivity in the second session of exposure provide foundations for development of cue-desensitization interventions.",

In recent years, human brain mapping has strongly benefited from enhanced computational models and image processing pipelines that could also improve data analyses in animals by using species-specific templates. In this study, we use structural MRI data from the National Chimpanzee Brain Resource (NCBR) to develop the chimpanzee brain reference template Juna.Chimp for spatial registration and the macro-anatomical brain parcellation Davi130 for standardized whole-brain analysis. Additionally, we introduce a ready-to-use image processing pipeline built upon the CAT12 toolbox in SPM12, implementing a standard human image preprocessing framework in chimpanzees. Applying this approach to data from 178 subjects, we find strong evidence for age-related GM atrophy in multiple regions of the chimpanzee brain, as well as, a human-like anterior-posterior pattern of hemi-spheric asymmetry in medial chimpanzee brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Seeing a speakers face benefits speech comprehension, especially in challenging listening conditions. This perceptual benefit is thought to stem from the neural integration of visual and auditory speech at multiple stages of processing, whereby movement of a speakers face provides temporal cues to auditory cortex, and articulatory information from the speakers mouth can aid recognizing specific linguistic units (e.g., phonemes, syllables). However it remains unclear how the integration of these cues varies as a function of listening conditions. Here we sought to provide insight on these questions by examining EEG responses to natural audiovisual, audio, and visual speech in quiet and in noise. Specifically, we represented our speech stimuli in terms of their spectrograms and their phonetic features, and then quantified the strength of the encoding of those features in the EEG using canonical correlation analysis. The encoding of both spectrotemporal and phonetic features was shown to be more robust in audiovisual speech responses then what would have been expected from the summation of the audio and visual speech responses, consistent with the literature on multisensory integration. Furthermore, the strength of this multisensory enhancement was more pronounced at the level of phonetic processing for speech in noise relative to speech in quiet, indicating that listeners rely more on articulatory details from visual speech in challenging listening conditions. These findings support the notion that the integration of audio and visual speech is a flexible, multistage process that adapts to optimize comprehension based on the current listening conditions.\n\nSignificance StatementDuring conversation, visual cues impact our perception of speech. Integration of auditory and visual speech is thought to occur at multiple stages of speech processing and vary flexibly depending on the listening conditions. Here we examine audiovisual integration at two stages of speech processing using the speech spectrogram and a phonetic representation, and test how audiovisual integration adapts to degraded listening conditions. We find significant integration at both of these stages regardless of listening conditions, and when the speech is noisy, we find enhanced integration at the phonetic stage of processing. These findings provide support for the multistage integration framework and demonstrate its flexibility in terms of a greater reliance on visual articulatory information in challenging listening conditions.",

    "abstract": "Acetogenic bacteria are rising in popularity as chassis microbes in biotechnology due to their capability of converting inorganic one-carbon (C1) gases to organic chemicals. To fully uncover the potential of acetogenic bacteria, synthetic-biology tools are imperative to either engineer designed functions or to interrogate the physiology. Here, we report a genome-editing tool at a one-nucleotide resolution, namely base editing, for acetogenic bacteria based on CRISPR-targeted deamination. This tool combines nuclease deactivated Cas9 with activation-induced cytidine deaminase to enable cytosine-to-thymine substitution without DNA cleavage, homology-directed repair, and donor DNA, which are generally the bottlenecks for applying conventional CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria. We designed and validated a modularized base-editing tool in the model acetogenic bacterium Clostridium ljungdahlii. The editing principles were investigated, and an in-silico analysis revealed the capability of base editing across the genome. Moreover, genes related to acetate and ethanol production were disrupted individually by installing premature STOP codons to reprogram carbon flux towards improved acetate production. This resulted in engineered C. ljungdahlii strains with the desired phenotypes and stable genotypes. Our base-editing tool promotes the application and research in acetogenic bacteria and provides a blueprint to upgrade CRISPR-Cas-based genome editing in bacteria in general.\n\nSignificanceAcetogenic bacteria metabolize one-carbon (C1) gases, such as industrial waste gases, to produce fuels and commodity chemicals. However, the lack of efficient gene-manipulation approaches hampers faster progress in the application of acetogenic bacteria in biotechnology. We developed a CRISPR-targeted base-editing tool at a one-nucleotide resolution for acetogenic bacteria. Our tool illustrates great potential in engineering other A-T-rich bacteria and links designed single-nucleotide variations with biotechnology. It provides unique advantages for engineering industrially relevant bacteria without creating genetically modified organisms (GMOs) under the legislation of many countries. This base-editing tool provides an example for adapting CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria, especially those that are highly sensitive to heterologously expressed Cas proteins and have limited ability of receiving foreign DNA.",

    "abstract": "Accurate pulmonary nodule detection plays an important role in early screening of lung cancer. Although there are many presented CAD systems based on deep learning for pulmonary nodule detection, these methods still have some problems in clinical use. The improvement of false negatives rate of tiny nodules, the reduction of false alarms and the optimization of time consumption are some of them that need to be solved as soon as possible. In view of the above problems, in this paper, we first propose a novel full convolution segmentation framework for lung cavity extraction in preprocessing stage to solve the time consumption problem of the existing pulmonary nodule detection systems. Furthermore, a 2D-NestedUNet segmentation network and a 3D-RPN detection network is stacked to get the high recall and low false positive rate on nodule candidate extraction, especially the recall of tiny nodules. Finally, a false positive reduction method based on multi-model ensemble is proposed for the further classification of nodule candidates. Our methods are evaluated on several public datasets, LUNA16, LNDb and ChestCT2019, which demonstrated the superior performance of our CAD system.",

At present, confirmatory diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), typically taking several hours and requiring a molecular laboratory to perform. There is an urgent need for rapid, simplified and cost-effective detection methods. We have developed and analytically validated a protocol for direct rapid extraction-free PCR (DIRECT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for nucleic acid purification. As few as 6 RNA copies per reaction of viral nucleocapsid (N) gene from respiratory samples such as sputum and nasal exudate can be detected directly using our one-step inhibitor-resistant assay. The performance of this assay was validated on a commercially available portable PCR thermocycler. Viral lysis, reverse transcription, amplification and detection are achieved in a single-tube homogeneous reaction within 36 minutes. This minimized hands-on time, reduces turnaround-time for sample-to-result and obviates the need for RNA purification reagents. It could enable wider use of Covid-19 testing for diagnosis, screening and research in countries and regions where laboratory capabilities are limiting.",

Both naive and primed state PSCs can give rise to tissues of all the three germ layers in vitro but differ in their potential to generate germline chimera in vivo. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern these two states of pluripotency in human can open up a plethora of opportunities for studying early embryonic development and in biomedical applications. In this work, we use weighted gene co-expression network (WGCN) approach to identify the key molecular makers and their interactions that define the two distinct pluripotency states. Signed-hybrid WGCN was reconstructed from transcriptomic data (RNA-seq) of naive and primed state pluripotent samples. Our analysis revealed two sets of genes that are involved in establishment and maintenance of naive (4791 genes) and primed (5066 genes) states. The naive state genes were found to be enriched for biological processes and pathways related to metabolic processes while primed state genes were associated with system development.

    "abstract": "The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) is arguably one of the most striking patterns in nature. The global increase in species richness toward the tropics across continents and taxonomic groups stimulated the formulation of many hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of this pattern. We evaluated several of these hypotheses to explain spatial diversity patterns in the butterfly family, Nymphalidae, by assessing the contributions of speciation, extinction, and dispersal to the LDG, and also the extent to which these processes differ among regions at the same latitude. We generated a new, time-calibrated phylogeny of Nymphalidae based on 10 gene fragments and containing ca. 2,800 species ([~]45% of extant diversity). Neither speciation nor extinction rate variations consistently explain the LDG among regions because temporal diversification dynamics differ greatly across longitude. For example, we found that Neotropical nymphalid diversity results from low extinction rates, not high speciation rates, and that biotic interchanges with other regions were rare. Southeast Asia was also characterized by a low speciation rate but, unlike the Neotropics, was the main source of dispersal events through time. Our results suggest that global climate change throughout the Cenozoic, particularly during the Eocene-Oligocene transition, combined with the conserved ancestral tropical niches, played a major role in generating the modern LDG of butterflies.",

    "abstract": "Almost 50 years ago, Michael Rosenzweig pointed out that nutrient addition can destabilize food webs, leading to loss of species and reduced ecosystem function through the paradox of enrichment. Around the same time, David Tilman demonstrated that increased nutrient loading would also be expected to cause competitive exclusion leading to deleterious changes in food web diversity. While both concepts have greatly illuminated general diversity-stability theory, we currently lack a coherent framework to predict how nutrients influence food web stability across a landscape. This is a vitally important gap in our understanding, given mounting evidence of serious ecological disruption arising from anthropogenic displacement of resources and organisms. Here, we combine contemporary theory on food webs and meta-ecosystems to show that nutrient additions are indeed expected to drive loss in stability and function in human-impacted regions. However, this loss in stability occurs not just from wild oscillations in population abundance, but more frequently from the complete loss of an equilibrium due to edible plant species being competitively excluded. In highly modified landscapes, spatial nutrient transport theory suggests that such instabilities can be amplified over vast distances from the sites of nutrient addition. Consistent with this theoretical synthesis, the empirical frequency of these distant propagating ecosystem imbalances appears to be growing. This synthesis of theory and empirical data suggests that human modification of the Earths ecological connectivity is \"entangling\" once distantly separated ecosystems, causing rapid, expansive, and costly nutrient-driven instabilities over vast areas of the planet. The corollary to this spatial nutrient theory, though -- akin to weak interaction theory from food web networks -- is that slow spatial nutrient pathways can be potent stabilizers by moderating flows across a landscape.",

The faunal structure, biomass and trophic composition of the Halfweg was then compared with those from the surrounding seabed sediments, other local artificial structures and a natural rocky reef.\n\nIn total, 65 macrofaunal species were observed on the concrete (52 species), steel legs (32) and surrounding rock dump (44) of Halfweg. Mean Simpson diversity per sample was highest on the rock dump (0.71) but concrete (0.54) and steel (0.60) of the GBS were lower than seabed (0.69). Ten of the species observed on the concrete were not reported on other substrates while 10 of the species were also observed in the surrounding seabed. The GBS structure was numerically dominated by Arthropoda which comprised 98% of the total abundance. Mean ash free dry weight (AFDW) was significantly higher (p<0.001) on the Halfweg substrates (204 g AFDW per m2) than in the surrounding seabed (65 g AFDW per m2). Over 94% of the biomass on Halfweg consisted of the plumose anemone Metridium senile. While common on other reefs, this species was absent from the surrounding seabed. Macrofaunal feeding mechanisms of the concrete and rock dump communities on the GBS were similar to those of nearby sediments, although these differed from those on the Halfweg steel legs. Therefore, the presence of Halfweg alters the local community feeding modes. Multivariate analysis revealed that taxonomic structure of the GBS and other artificial structures significantly differed from that of the sedimentary habitats. Low numbers of non-indigenous species on Halfweg indicated that the structure does not act as a stepping stone for species invasions.\n\nOur data show that the Halfweg structures significantly increase local biodiversity and biomass. Removal of the concrete and steel legs of the GBS (leaving the rock dump) will significantly reduce local macrofauna biodiversity. The long-term impact on macrofaunal biomass is low. Leaving the complete Halfweg structure in place will result in an enriched local macrofaunal biodiversity and feeding mode diversity.",

    "abstract": "Visual systems can exploit spatial correlations in the visual scene by using retinotopy, the organizing principle by which neighboring cells encode neighboring spatial locations. However, retinotopy is often lost, such as when visual pathways are integrated with other sensory modalities. How is spatial information processed in the absence of retinotopy? Here, we focused on visual looming responsive LC6 cells in Drosophila, a population whose dendrites collectively tile the visual field, but whose axons form a single glomerulus--a structure lacking retinotopic organization--in the central brain. We identified multiple glomerulus neurons and found that they respond to looming in different portions of the visual field, unexpectedly preserving spatial information. Through EM reconstruction of all LC6 synaptic inputs to the glomerulus, we found that LC6 and downstream cell types form circuits within the glomerulus that establish spatial readout of visual features and contralateral suppression--mechanisms that transform visual information for behavioral control.",

    "abstract": "In flowering plants, successful germinal cell development and meiotic recombination depend upon a combination of environmental and genetic factors. To gain insights into this specialised reproductive development programme we used short- and long-read RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to study the temporal dynamics of transcript abundance in immuno-cytologically staged barley (Hordeum vulgare) anthers and meiocytes. We show that the most significant transcriptional changes occur at the transition from pre-meiosis to leptotene-zygotene, which is followed by largely stable transcript abundance throughout prophase I. Our analysis reveals that the developing anthers and meiocytes are enriched in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and that entry to meiosis is characterized by their robust and significant down regulation. Intriguingly, only 24% of a collection of putative meiotic gene orthologues showed differential transcript abundance in at least one stage or tissue comparison. Changes in the abundance of numerous transcription factors, representatives of the small RNA processing machinery, and post-translational modification pathways highlight the complexity of the regulatory networks involved. These developmental, time-resolved, and dynamic transcriptomes increase our understanding of anther and meiocyte development and will help guide future research.\n\nOne sentence summaryAnalysis of RNA-seq data from meiotically staged barley anthers and meiocytes highlights the role of lncRNAs within a complex network of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation accompanied by a hiatus in differential gene expression during prophase I.\n\nThe author responsible for distribution of materials integral to the findings presented in this article in accordance with the policy described in the Instructions for Authors (www.plantcell.org) is: Robbie Waugh (robbie.waugh@hutton.ac.uk)",

    "abstract": "RNA structure influences numerous processes in all organisms. In bacteria, these processes include transcription termination and attenuation, small RNA and protein binding, translation initiation, and mRNA stability, and can be regulated via metabolite availability and other stresses. Here we use Structure-seq2 to probe the in vivo RNA structurome of Bacillus subtilis grown in the presence and absence of amino acids. Our results reveal that amino acid starvation results in lower overall dimethyl sulfate (DMS) reactivity of the transcriptome, indicating enhanced protection owing to protein binding or RNA structure. Starvation-induced changes in DMS reactivity correlated inversely with transcript abundance changes. This correlation was particularly pronounced in genes associated with the stringent response and CodY regulons, which are involved in adaptation to nutritional stress, suggesting that RNA structure contributes to transcript abundance change in regulons involved in amino acid metabolism. Structure-seq2 accurately reported on four known amino acid-responsive riboswitches: T-box, SAM, glycine, and lysine riboswitches. Additionally, we discovered a transcription attenuation mechanism that reduces yfmG expression when amino acids are added to the growth medium. We also found that translation of a leader peptide (YfmH) encoded just upstream of yfmG regulates yfmG expression. Our results are consistent with a model in which a slow rate of yfmH translation caused by limitation of the amino acids encoded in YfmH prevents transcription termination in the yfmG leader region by favoring formation of an overlapping antiterminator structure. This novel RNA switch offers a way to simultaneously monitor the levels of multiple amino acids.",

However, no activation domain has been identified that originates from Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolate). In this study, a novel strong activator was identified from the whole Chinese fir cDNA library. This plant conserved activator was named TAC 3 (Transcriptional Activation domain from Chinese fir 3). C-terminal 70 amino acids of TAC (TAC3d) have a stronger ability than the commonly used strong activation domain of the virus protein VP16, or the strong plant activation domain, EDLL, in Chinese fir. Through Dual-luciferase assay, phenomic analysis and FT (Flowering Locus T [FT]) quantification, it was shown that, TAC3d can overcome the transcriptional repression of strong plant repressors (Flowering Locus C [FLC]) when fused to its C-terminal domain, thus inhibit the repression of FT expression. In conclusion, for the first time, an activation domain has been identified from Chinese fir. TAC3, which can be used for precise gene activation in Chinese fir in the future, and its function in the plant is more powerful than the commonly used strong activation domain (such as VP16 and EDLL).\n\nHighlightTAC3 is the first transcriptional activation domain identified from Chinese fir and its function is more powerful than some commonly used strong transcriptional activators (such as VP16 and EDLL)",

    "abstract": "Post-translational protein targeting requires chaperone assistance to direct insertion-competent proteins to integration pathways. Chloroplasts integrate nearly all thylakoid transmembrane proteins post-translationally, but mechanisms in the stroma that assist their insertion remain largely undefined. Here, we investigated how the chloroplast chaperonin (Cpn60) facilitated the thylakoid integration of Plastidic type I signal peptidase 1 (Plsp1) using in vitro targeting assays. Cpn60 bound Plsp1 in the stroma. In isolated chloroplasts, the membrane integration of imported Plsp1 correlated with its dissociation from Cpn60. When the Plsp1 residues that interacted with Cpn60 were removed, Plsp1 did not integrate into the membrane. These results suggested Cpn60 was an intermediate in Plsp1s thylakoid targeting. In isolated thylakoids, the integration of Plsp1 decreased if Cpn60 was present in excess of cpSecA1, the stromal motor of the cpSec1 translocon which inserts unfolded Plsp1 into the thylakoid. An excess of cpSecA1 favored integration. Introducing Cpn60s obligate substrate RbcL displaced Cpn60-bound Plsp1; then, the released Plsp1 exhibited increased accessibility to cpSec1. These in vitro targeting experiments support a model in which Cpn60 captures and then releases insertion-competent Plsp1, while cpSecA1 recognizes free Plsp1 for integration. Thylakoid transmembrane proteins transiting the stroma can interact with Cpn60 to shield from the aqueous environment.\n\nOne-sentence summaryThe chloroplast chaperonin captures and releases Plastidic type I signal peptidase 1 during its targeting to the thylakoid membrane.",

    "abstract": "The ability for plant growth to be optimized, either in the light or dark, depends on the intricate balance between cell division and differentiation in specialized regions called meristems. When Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings are grown in the dark, hypocotyl elongation is promoted, whereas root growth is greatly reduced as a result of changes in hormone transport and a reduction in meristematic cell proliferation. Previous work showed that the microtubule-associated protein CLASP sustains root apical meristem (RAM) size by influencing microtubule (MT) organization and by modulating the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway. Here, we investigated whether CLASP is involved in light-dependent root growth promotion, since dark-grown seedlings have reduced RAM activity that is observed in the clasp-1 null mutant. We showed that CLASP protein levels were greatly reduced in the root tips of dark-grown seedlings, which could be reversed by exposing plants to light. We confirmed that removing seedlings from the light led to a discernible shift in MT organization from bundled arrays, which are prominent in dividing cells, to transverse orientations typically observed in cells that have exited the meristem. BR receptors and auxin transporters, both of which are sustained by CLASP, were largely degraded in the dark. Interestingly, we found that despite the lack of protein, CLASP transcript levels were higher in dark-grown root tips. Together, these findings uncover a mechanism that sustains meristem homeostasis through CLASP, and advances our understanding of how roots modulate their growth according to the amount of light and nutrients perceived by the plant.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe microtubule-associated protein CLASP is regulated at the translational level when root meristem growth is inhibited in dark-grown plants.",

Thought to be an inhibitor of the enzyme thymidylate synthase which plays a role in nucleotide synthesis, 5-FU has been found to induce single- and double-strand DNA breaks. The activation of ATR occurs as a reaction to UV- and chemotherapeutic drug-induced replication stress. In this study, we examined the effect of ATR inhibition on 5-FU sensitivity. Using western blotting, we found that 5-FU treatment led to the phosphorylation of ATR. Surviving fractions were remarkably decreased in 5-FU with ATR inhibitor (ATRi) compared to 5-FU with other major DNA repair kinases inhibitors. ATR inhibition enhanced induction of DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis in 5-FU-treated cells. Using gene expression analysis, we found that 5-FU could induce the activation of intra-S checkpoint. Surprisingly, BRCA2-deficient cells were sensitive to 5-FU in the presence of ATRi. In addition, ATR inhibition enhanced the efficacy of 5-FU treatment, independent of non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination repair pathways. Findings from the present study suggest ATR as a potential therapeutic target for 5-FU chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, creates an urgent need for identifying molecular mechanisms that mediate viral entry, propagation, and tissue pathology. Cell membrane bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and associated proteases, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and Cathepsin L (CTSL), were previously identified as mediators of SARS-CoV2 cellular entry. Here, we assess the cell type-specific RNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL through an integrated analysis of 107 single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq studies, including 22 lung and airways datasets (16 unpublished), and 85 datasets from other diverse organs. Joint expression of ACE2 and the accessory proteases identifies specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells as putative targets of viral infection in the nasal passages, airways, and alveoli. Cells that co-express ACE2 and proteases are also identified in cells from other organs, some of which have been associated with COVID-19 transmission or pathology, including gut enterocytes, corneal epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, heart pericytes, olfactory sustentacular cells, and renal epithelial cells. Performing the first meta-analyses of scRNA-seq studies, we analyzed 1,176,683 cells from 282 nasal, airway, and lung parenchyma samples from 164 donors spanning fetal, childhood, adult, and elderly age groups, associate increased levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in specific cell types with increasing age, male gender, and smoking, all of which are epidemiologically linked to COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes. Notably, there was a particularly low expression of ACE2 in the few young pediatric samples in the analysis. Further analysis reveals a gene expression program shared by ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues, including genes that may mediate viral entry, subtend key immune functions, and mediate epithelial-macrophage cross-talk. Amongst these are IL6, its receptor and co-receptor, IL1R, TNF response pathways, and complement genes. Cell type specificity in the lung and airways and smoking effects were conserved in mice. Our analyses suggest that differences in the cell type-specific expression of mediators of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry may be responsible for aspects of COVID-19 epidemiology and clinical course, and point to putative molecular pathways involved in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis.",

These viruses usually cause a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infection, however, they can also cause more severe symptoms, gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases. These viruses are capable of flexibly adapting to new environments, hence health threats from coronavirus are constant and long-term. Immunogenic spike proteins are glyco-proteins found on the surface of Coronaviridae particles that mediate entry to host cells. The aim of this study was to train deep learning neural networks to produce simulated spike protein sequences, which may be able to aid in knowledge and/or vaccine design by creating alternative possible spike sequences that could arise from zoonotic sources in future.\n\nResultsHere we have trained deep learning recurrent neural networks (RNN) to provide computer-simulated coronavirus spike protein sequences in the style of previously known sequences and examine their characteristics. Training used a dataset of alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronavirus spike sequences. In a test set of 100 simulated sequences, all 100 had most significant BLAST matches to Spike proteins in searches against NCBI non-redundant dataset (NR) and also possessed concomitant Pfam domain matches.\n\nConclusionsSimulated sequences from the neural network may be able to guide us in future with prospective targets for vaccine discovery in advance of a potential novel zoonosis. We may effectively be able to fast-forward through evolution using neural networks to investigate sequences that could arise.",

    "abstract": "The sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of 2019 from the Chinese province of Hubei and its subsequent pandemic spread highlight the importance of understanding the full molecular details of coronavirus infection and pathogenesis. Here, we compared a variety of replication features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and analysed the cytopathology caused by the two closely related viruses in the commonly used Vero E6 cell line. Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 generated higher levels of intracellular viral RNA, but strikingly about 50-fold less infectious viral progeny was recovered from the culture medium. Immunofluorescence microscopy of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells established extensive cross-reactivity of antisera previously raised against a variety of nonstructural proteins, membrane and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. Electron microscopy revealed that the ultrastructural changes induced by the two SARS viruses are very similar and occur within comparable time frames after infection. Furthermore, we determined that the sensitivity of the two viruses to three established inhibitors of coronavirus replication (Remdesivir, Alisporivir and chloroquine) is very similar, but that SARS-CoV-2 infection was substantially more sensitive to pre-treatment of cells with pegylated interferon alpha. An important difference between the two viruses is the fact that - upon passaging in Vero E6 cells - SARS-CoV-2 apparently is under strong selection pressure to acquire adaptive mutations in its spike protein gene. These mutations change or delete a putative  furin-like cleavage site in the region connecting the S1 and S2 domains and result in a very prominent phenotypic change in plaque assays.",

    "abstract": "The infection of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 have caused more than 150,000 deaths, but no vaccine or specific therapeutic antibody is currently available. SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His recombinant protein was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His proteins were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a \"sandwich\" complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 for recognizing RBD at the same or similar epitopes can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of a synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block the binding of RBD to ACE2 protein, and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-overexpressing Hela cells with IC50 values of 12nM. Nevertheless, top 1 lead from the standard biopanning of Lib AB1, can only bind to RBD in vitro but not have the blocking or neutralization activity. Our strategy can efficiently isolate the blocking antibodies of RBD, and it would speed up the discovery of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "PRESENILIN 2 (PSEN2) is one of the genes mutated in early onset familial Alzheimers disease (EOfAD). PSEN2 shares significant amino acid sequence identity with another EOfAD-related gene PRESENILIN 1 (PSEN1), and partial functional redundancy is seen between these two genes. However, the complete range of functions of PSEN1 and PSEN2 is not yet understood. In this study, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the zebrafish psen2 gene to generate a premature termination codon close downstream of the translation start with the intention of creating a null mutation. Homozygotes for this mutation, psen2S4Ter, are viable and fertile, and adults do not show any gross pigmentation defects, arguing against significant loss of {gamma}-secretase activity. Also, assessment of the numbers of Dorsal Longitudinal Ascending (DoLA) interneurons that are responsive to psen2 but not psen1 activity during embryogenesis did not reveal decreased psen2 function. Transcripts containing the S4Ter mutation show no evidence of destabilization by nonsense-mediated decay. Forced expression in zebrafish embryos of fusions of psen2S4Ter 5 mRNA sequences with sequence encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) indicated that the psen2S4Ter mutation permits utilization of cryptic, novel downstream translation start codons. These likely initiate translation of N-terminally truncated Psen2 proteins that obey the \"reading frame preservation rule\" of PRESENILIN EOfAD mutations. Transcriptome analysis of entire brains from a 6-month-old family of wild type, heterozygous and homozygous psen2S4Ter female siblings revealed profoundly dominant effects on gene expression likely indicating changes in ribosomal, mitochondrial, and anion transport functions.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus mutans, considered as principal causative agent of dental caries, maintains a biofilm lifestyle in the dental plaque. The oral cavity harbors numerous S. mutans strains, which displayed remarkable genotypic and phenotypic diversity. This study evaluated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity of 209 S. mutans strains isolated from 336 patients with dental caries and compared with the universal reference strain UA159. Our study has revealed a high degree of genotypic and phenotypic variability among the clinical strains. We observed significant differences in colony morphology, generation time, biofilm formation, bacteriocin and acid production while growing in culture medium. All the clinical isolates were able to lower pH while growing in THY broth. In consistent with phenotypic variations, we also observed tremendous level of genotypic variation by AP-PCR and gene specific PCR. AP-PCR analysis suggested that most of the patients with dental caries have distinct type of S. mutans strains. Genes related to various two component systems were highly conserved among the strains, however, bacteriocin encoding genes such as nlmAB, nlmC were absent in half of the clinical isolates. In sum, our study highlights the genotypic and phenotypic diversity of S. mutans clinical isolates and indicates the presence of diverse mechanism to initiate and establish the biofilm lifestyle which leads to tooth decay.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation is an inherent characteristic of proteins. Risk management strategies to reduce aggregation are critical for cells to survive upon stresses that induce aggregation. Cells cope with protein aggregation by utilizing a variety of chaperones, as exemplified by heat-shock proteins (Hsps). The heat stress-induced expression of IbpA and IbpB, small Hsps in Escherichia coli, is regulated by the {sigma}32 heat-shock transcriptional regulator and the temperature-dependent translational regulation via mRNA heat fluctuation. We found that, even without heat stress, either the expression of aggregation-prone proteins or the ibpA gene deletion profoundly increases the expression of IbpA. Combined with other evidence, we propose novel mechanisms for the regulation of the small Hsp expression. Oligomeric IbpA self-represses the ibpA/ibpB expression at the translational level, but the self-repression is relieved by the sequestration of IbpA into protein aggregates. Thus, the function of IbpA as a chaperone to form co-aggregates is harnessed as an aggregation sensor to tightly regulate the IbpA level. Since the excessive preemptive supply of IbpA in advance of stress is harmful, the prodigious and rapid expression of IbpA/IbpB on demand is necessary for IbpA to function as a first line of defense against acute protein aggregation.\n\nAuthor summaryAll organisms have protein quality control systems against stresses disturbing cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis). The systems have multiple stages: folding, degradation, and sequestration. Sequestration of denatured proteins is the first step to support other maintenance strategies. Small heat shock proteins (sHsps), which are well-conserved chaperones, are representative \"sequestrases\" that co-aggregate with denatured proteins. We found that IbpA, an Escherichia coli sHsp, is a direct mediator for negative feedback regulation at the translational level. Recruitment of IbpA into the protein aggregates relieves the ibpA expression suppression. This novel mechanism of IbpA as an aggregation-sensor tightly regulates the IbpA level, enabling the sHsp to function as a sequestrase upon aggregation stress.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveA meta-analysis was conducted to compare oncologic outcomes for patients of T1 glottic carcinoma who were treated with transoral laser surgery (TLS) or linear accelerator radiotherapy (linac RT).\n\nMethodsAll related studies published up to September 2019 were acquired by searching Pubmed, EMBASE, and Cochrane, with the index words: glottic, vocal, laryngeal, radiation, radiotherapy, irradiation, laser, surgery, cordectomy, carcinoma and cancer. Relative studies which compared oncologic outcomes between linac RT and TLS were included. Sensitivity analysis were performed to evaluate heterogeneity.\n\nResultsA total of twelve eligible studies were included for the analysis, which contained three prospective studies and nine retrospective studies. Patients who underwent TLS had increased overall survival (OR = 1.40, 95% CI=1.02-1.94, P=0.04) and laryngeal preservation (OR = 5.37, 95% CI = 3.05-9.44, P < 0.00001) versus who underwent linac RT. No statistical difference was observed between TLS group and linac RT group in terms of local control (OR=0.88, 95% CI = 0.62-1.24, P = 0.47), disease-specific survival (OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.26-1.43, P = 0.26), and disease-free survival (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 0.70-3.81, P = 0.14).\n\nConclusionsThe results of this meta-analysis indicate that there were clinical benefits for patients with glottic carcinoma after TLS compared with linac RT with respect to overall survival and laryngeal preservation. However, more multi-center randomized controlled trials would be urgently needed to prove these differences.",

We find that the ACE2 gene is under strong selection pressure in bats, the group in which the progenitors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are hypothesized to have evolved, particularly in residues that contact SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We detect positive selection in non-bat mammals in ACE2 but in a smaller proportion of branches than in bats, without enrichment of selection in residues that contact SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we evaluate similarity between humans and other species in residues that contact SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, revealing potential susceptible species but also highlighting the difficulties of predicting spillover events. This work increases our understanding of the relationship between mammals, particularly bats, and coronaviruses, and provides data that can be used in functional studies of how host proteins are bound by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains.",

    "abstract": "Despite evidence that helminths protect from metabolic disease, a major gap exists in understanding the underlying mechanism(s). Here we demonstrate that bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) from S. mansoni infected male ApoE-/- mice have dramatically increased mitochondrial respiration compared to those from uninfected mice. This change associates with increased glucose and palmitate shuttling into TCA cycle intermediates and decreased accumulation of cellular cholesterol esters. Moreover, systemic metabolic modulation by schistosomes is a function of biological sex, where infection protects ApoE-/- male, but not female, mice from obesity and glucose intolerance. Sex-dependence extends to myeloid cells, where reprogramming leads to opposite cholesterol phenotypes in BMDM from females and males. Finally, the metabolic reprogramming of male myeloid cells is transferrable via bone marrow transplantation to an uninfected host, indicating maintenance of reprogramming in the absence of sustained antigen exposure. This work reveals that S. mansoni systemic reprograming of myeloid metabolism is sex-dependent.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected active and latent CCR5 expressing long-lived T-cells are the primary barrier to HIV/AIDS eradication. Broadly neutralizing antibodies and latency-reversing agents are the two most promising strategies emerging to achieve  functional cure against HIV infection. Antiretrovirals (ARVs) have shown to suppress plasma viral loads to non-detectable levels and above strategies have demonstrated a  functional cure against HIV infection is achievable. Both the above strategies are effective at inducing direct or immune-mediated cell death of latent HIV+ T-cells but have shown respective limitations. In this study, we designed a novel targeted ARVs-loaded nanoformulation that combines the CCR5 monoclonal antibody and antiretroviral drugs (ARV) as a dual protection strategy to promote HIV  functional cure. The modified CCR5 monoclonal antibody (xfR5 mAb) surface-coated dolutegravir (DTG) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) loaded nanoformulation (xfR5-D+T NPs) were uniformly sized <250 nm, with 6.5 times enhanced antigen-binding affinity compared to naive xfR5 mAb, and provided prolonged DTG and TAF intracellular retention (t1/2). The multivalent and sustained drug release properties of xfR5-D+T NPs enhance the protection efficiency against HIV by approximately 12, 3, and 5 times compared to naive xfR5 mAb, D+T NP alone, and xfR5 NPs, respectively. Further, the nanoformulation demonstrated high binding-affinity to CCR5 expressing CD4+ cells, monocytes, and other HIV prone/latent T-cells by 25, 2, and 2 times, respectively. Further, the xfR5-D+T NPs during short-term pre-exposure prophylaxis induced a protective immunophenotype, i.e., boosted T-helper (Th), temporary memory (TM), and effector (E) sub-population. Moreover, treatment with xfR5-D+T NPs to HIV-infected T-cells induced a defensive/activated immunophenotype i.e., boosted naive, Th, boosted central memory, TM, EM, E, and activated cytotoxic T-cells population. Therefore, this dual-action targeted mAb-ARV loaded nanoformulation could potentially become a multifactorial/multilayered solution to achieve a \"functional cure.\"",

    "abstract": "Bacterial biofilms represent a challenge to the healthcare system because of their resilience against antimicrobials and immune attack. Biofilms consist of bacterial aggregates embedded in an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) composed of carbohydrate polymers, nucleic acids and proteins. Carbohydrates within P. aeruginosa biofilms include neutral and mannose-rich Psl, and cationic Pel composed of N-acetyl-galactosamine and N-acetyl-glucosamine. Here we show that P. aeruginosa biofilms display ligands for the C-type lectin receptors mannose receptor (MR, CD206) and Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin (DC-SIGN, CD209). Binding of MR and DC-SIGN to P. aeruginosa biofilms is carbohydrate-and calcium-dependent and extends to biofilms formed by clinical isolates. Confocal analysis of P. aeruginosa biofilms shows abundant DC-SIGN ligands among bacteria aggregates while MR ligands concentrate into discrete clusters. DC-SIGN ligands are also detected in planktonic P. aeruginosa cultures and depend on the presence of the common polysaccharide antigen. Carbohydrates purified from P. aeruginosa biofilms are recognised by DC-SIGN and MR; both receptors preferentially bind the high molecular weight fraction (HMW; >132,000Da) with KDs in the nM range. HMW preparations contain 74.9-80.9% mannose, display -mannan segments and alter the morphology of human dendritic cells without causing obvious changes in cytokine responses. Finally, HMW interferes with the endocytic activity of cell-associated MR and DC-SIGN. This work identifies MR and DC-SIGN as receptors for bacterial biofilms and highlights the potential for biofilm-associated carbohydrates as immunomodulators through engagement of C-type lectin receptors.\n\nAuthor SummarySelective engagement of pattern recognition receptors during infection guides the decision-making process during induction of immune responses. This work identifies mannose-rich carbohydrates within bacterial biofilms as novel molecular patterns associated with bacterial infections. P. aeruginosa biofilms and biofilm-derived carbohydrates bind two important lectin receptors, MR (CD206) and DC-SIGN (CD209), involved in recognition of self and immune evasion. Abundance of MR and DC-SIGN ligands in the context of P. aeruginosa biofilms could impact immune responses and promote chronic infection.",

    "abstract": "Since the first reports of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, there have been considerable efforts to sequence the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2 (also referred to as hCoV-19) and to make viral genomic information available quickly on shared repositories. As of 30 March 2020, 7,680 consensus sequences have been shared on GISAID, the principal repository for SARS-CoV-2 genetic information. These sequences are primarily consensus sequences from clinical and passaged samples, but few reports have looked at diversity of virus populations within individual hosts or cultures. Understanding such diversity is essential to understanding viral evolutionary dynamics. Here, we characterize within-host viral diversity from a primary isolate and passaged samples, all originally deriving from an individual returning from Wuhan, China, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and subsequently sampled in Wisconsin, United States. We use a metagenomic approach with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) GridION in combination with Illumina MiSeq to capture minor within-host frequency variants [&ge;]1%. In a clinical swab obtained from the day of hospital presentation, we identify 15 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) [&ge;]1% frequency, primarily located in the largest gene - ORF1a. While viral diversity is low overall, the dominant genetic signatures are likely secondary to population size changes, with some evidence for mild purifying selection throughout the genome. We see little to no evidence for positive selection or ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 within cell culture or in the primary isolate evaluated in this study.\n\nAuthor SummaryWithin-host variants are critical for addressing molecular evolution questions, identifying selective pressures imposed by vaccine-induced immunity and antiviral therapeutics, and characterizing interhost dynamics, including the stringency and character of transmission bottlenecks. Here, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated from a human host and from cell culture on three distinct Vero cell lines using Illumina and ONT technologies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences can remain stable through at least two serial passages on Vero 76 cells, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 can be propagated in cell culture in preparation for in-vitro and in-vivo studies without dramatic alterations of its genotype. However, we emphasize the need to deep-sequence viral stocks prior to use in experiments to characterize sub-consensus diversity that may alter outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans are opportunistic pathogens whose interactions involve the secreted products ethanol and phenazines. Here we describe the focal role of ethanol in mixed-species co-cultures by dual RNA-seq analyses. P. aeruginosa and C. albicans transcriptomes were assessed after growth in mono-culture or co-culture with either ethanol-producing C. albicans or a C. albicans mutant lacking the primary ethanol dehydrogenase, Adh1. Analyses using KEGG-pathways and the previously published eADAGE method revealed several P. aeruginosa responses to C. albicans-produced ethanol including the induction of a non-canonical low phosphate response mediated by PhoB. C. albicans wild-type, but not C. albicans adh1{Delta}/{Delta}, induces P. aeruginosa production of 5-methyl-phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (5-MPCA), which forms a red derivative within fungal cells. We first demonstrate that PhoB is required for this interaction and that PhoB hyperactivity, via deletion of pstB, leads to increased production of 5-MPCA even when phosphate concentrations are high, but only in the presence of ethanol. Second, we show that ethanol is only sufficient to promote 5-MPCA production at permissive phosphate concentrations. The intersection of ethanol and phosphate in co-culture is mirrored in C. albicans; the adh1{Delta}/{Delta} mutant had increased expression of genes regulated by Pho4, the C. albicans transcription factor that responds to low phosphate which we confirmed by showing the adh1{Delta}/{Delta} strain had elevated Pho4-dependent phosphatase activity. The dual-dependence on ethanol and phosphate concentrations for anti-fungal production highlights how environmental factors modulate microbial interactions and dictate antagonisms such as those between P. aeruginosa and C. albicans.\n\nAuthor SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans are opportunistic pathogens that are frequently isolated from co-infections. Using a Dual-Seq approach in combination with genetics approaches, we found that ethanol produced by C. albicans stimulates the PhoB regulon in P. aeruginosa asynchronously with activation of the Pho4 regulon in C. albicans. In doing so, we demonstrate that eADAGE-based analysis can improve the understanding of the P. aeruginosa response to ethanol-producing C. albicans as measured by transcriptomics: we identify a subset of PhoB-regulated genes as differentially expressed in response to ethanol. We validate our result by showing that PhoB is necessary for multiple roles in co-culture including the competition for phosphate and the production of 5-methyl-phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and that the P. aeruginosa response to C. albicans-produced ethanol depends on phosphate availability. The conditional stimulation of virulence production in response to sub-inhibitory concentrations of ethanol only under phosphate limitation highlights the importance of considering nutrient concentrations in the analysis of co-culture interactions.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesSARS-CoV-2 whole-genome analysis has identified three large clades spreading worldwide, designated G, V and S. This study aims to analyze the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain/Europe.\n\nMethodsMaximum likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses have been performed to estimate the most probable temporal and geographic origin of different phylogenetic clusters and the diffusion pathways of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nResultsPhylogenetic analyses of the first 28 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained from patients in Spain revealed that most of them are distributed in G and S clades (13 sequences in each) with the remaining two sequences branching in the V clade. Eleven of the Spanish viruses of the S clade and six of the G clade grouped in two different monophyletic clusters (S-Spain and G-Spain, respectively), with the S-Spain cluster also comprising 8 sequences from 6 other countries from Europe and the Americas. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was estimated in the city of Wuhan, China, around November 24, 2019, with a 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval from October 30-December 17, 2019. The origin of S-Spain and G-Spain clusters were estimated in Spain around February 14 and 18, 2020, respectively, with a possible ancestry of S-Spain in Shanghai.\n\nConclusionsMultiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions have been detected in Spain and at least two resulted in the emergence of locally transmitted clusters, with further dissemination of one of them to at least 6 other countries. These results highlight the extraordinary potential of SARS-CoV-2 for rapid and widespread geographic dissemination.",

    "abstract": "Nearly all mammals have a vibrissal system specialized for tactile sensation, composed of whiskers growing from sensor-rich follicles in the skin. Because a whisker has no sensors along its length, an open question is how mechanoreceptors in the follicle transduce sensory signals. These mechanoreceptors are activated by whisker deflection, so it is essential to understand how the whisker deforms within the follicle and so how it may activate different populations of mechanoreceptors in different ways. During active whisking behaviors, muscle contractions and increases in blood pressure in the ring sinus will likely affect the whisker deformation profile. Directly recording from mechanoreceptors under these conditions is difficult due to their small size, location within intricate and delicate membranes, and movement during sensation. Using data from a previous experimental study on whisker deflection, and from histological analysis of follicle tissue, we develop a mechanical model of the follicle sinus complex. With this model we first simulate passive whisker contact, replicating previous results of ex vivo experiments on deformation of a whisker within the follicle. We then simulate whisker deformation within the follicle during active whisking. Results of these simulations predict that both intrinsic muscle contraction and elevated hydrostatic pressure within the ring sinus may be regulatory mechanisms to enhance tactile sensitivity during active whisking. The mechanical model presented in this study is an important first step in simulating mechanical interactions within whisker follicles, and aids in the development of artificial robotic follicles.\n\nAuthor summaryMany mammals rely on whiskers as a mode of tactile sensation, especially when exploring in darkness. Active, rhythmic protraction and retraction of the whiskers, commonly referred to as whisking, is observed among many whisker specialist animals. Whisker-based sensing requires the forces and moments generated by external stimuli to be transduced into neural signals inside the follicle, which holds the base of the whisker shaft. Within the follicle, the interaction between the whiskers deformation and the surrounding tissue determines how different groups of mechanoreceptors along the inside of a follicle will deformed. However, experimental measurement of this interaction is challenging to perform in active animals. We therefore created a mechanical model for the follicle sinus complex to simulate whisker deformation within the follicle resulting from external whisker deflection. Our simulations replicate results from previous ex vivo experiments that have monitored whisker deformation in the follicle ring sinus. We extend these results by predicting whisker deformation profiles during active whisking. Our results suggest that both intrinsic muscle contraction and an increase in blood pressure will affect the whisker deformation profile within the follicle, and in turn, the tactile sensitivity of the whisker system.",

    "abstract": "Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) are diagnosed based on motor difficulties. However, they also exhibit difficulties in several other cognitive domains, including visuospatial processing, executive functioning and attention. One account of the difficulties seen in DCD proposes an impairment in internal forward modelling, i.e., the ability to (i) detect regularities of a repetitive perceptual or motor pattern, (ii) predict future outcomes of motor actions, and (iii) adapt behaviour accordingly. Using electroencephalographic recordings, the present study aimed to delineate these different aspects of internal forward modelling across several domains. To this end, 24 children with DCD and 23 typically-developing children (aged 7-10 years) completed a serial prediction task in the visual, temporal, spatial and motor domains. This task required them to learn short sequences and to indicate whether a sequence was disrupted towards its end. Analyses revealed that, across all domains, children with DCD showed poorer discrimination between intact and disrupted sequences, accompanied by a delayed late parietal positivity elicited by disrupted sequences. These results indicate an impairment in explicit sequence discrimination in DCD across motor and cognitive domains. However, there is no evidence for an impairment in implicit performance on the motor task in DCD. These results suggest an impairment of the updating of an internal forward model in DCD resulting in a blurred representation of that model and consequently in a reduced ability to detect regularities in the environment (e.g., sequences). Such a detailed understanding of internal forward modelling in DCD could help to explain the wide range of co-occurring difficulties experienced by those with a diagnosis of DCD.",

In this publication we characterize the regional distribution of prostatic cell types in the young intact dog to enable comparisons with human and mice and we examine how the cellular source of procollagen 1A1 changes with age in intact male dogs.Methods A multichotomous decision tree involving sequential immunohistochemical stains was validated for use in dog and used to identify specific prostatic cell types and determine their distribution in the capsule, peripheral, periurethral and urethral regions of the young intact canine prostate. Prostatic cells identified using this technique include perivascular smooth muscle cells, pericytes, endothelial cells, luminal, intermediate, and basal epithelial cells, neuroendocrine cells, myofibroblasts, fibroblasts, fibrocytes, and other hematolymphoid cells. Corresponding images were made freely accessible through the GUDMAP database at https://doi.org/10.25548/16-WMM4.Results The prostatic peripheral region harbors the largest proportion of epithelial cells. Aging does not change the density of hematolymphoid cells, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts in the peripheral region or in the fibromuscular capsule, regions where we previously observed aging- and androgen-mediated increases in prostatic collagen abundance Instead, we observed aging-related changes the procollagen 1A1 positive prostatic cell identity from a myofibroblast to a fibroblast.Conclusions Hematolymphoid cells and myofibroblasts are often identified as sources of collagen in tissues prone to aging-related fibrosis. We show that these are not the likely sources of pathological collagen synthesis in older intact male dogs. Instead, we identify an aging-related shift in the prostatic cell type producing procollagen 1A1 that will help direct development of cell type and prostate appropriate therapeutics for collagen accumulation.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Salmonella species and Escherichia coli are major bacterial enteropathogens of global public health importance that cause foodborne diseases, thereby contributing to increased human morbidity and mortality. Both pathogens have also been found to contribute towards the spread of antimicrobial resistance through the food chain, especially in poultry. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella sp. and E. coli in broiler chickens at farm level, abattoirs and open markets in selected districts of Zambia. A cross-sectional study was undertaken in seven districts of Zambia to determine the resistance profiles of Salmonella sp. and E. coli obtained from broiler chickens at farms, abattoirs and open markets. A total of 470 samples were collected, including litter, cloacal swabs and carcass swabs. Samples were inoculated into buffered peptone water, sub-cultured onto MacConkey and Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate agar plates. Identification of Salmonella sp. and E. coli was done using the API-20E kit and confirmation by 16S rDNA sequencing. Confirmed isolates were tested against a panel of 10 antibiotics using the Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion method and interpreted according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Analysis of the antibiotic susceptibility test results was done using WHONET 2018 software. Overall, 4 Salmonella spp. and 280 E. coli were isolated. One of the Salmonella sp. was resistant to ampicillin (25%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (25%) and cefotaxime (25%). E. coli antibiotic resistance was highest to tetracycline (81.4%) and lowest to imipenem (0.7%). The antibiotic susceptibility profile revealed 55% (154/280) multidrug resistant E. coli, with the highest multidrug resistance profile (20.7%) in the ampicillin-tetracycline-trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole drug combination. Furthermore, 4.3% (12/280) of the isolates showed Extensive Drug resistance. The levels of antimicrobial resistance to E. coli and Salmonella observed in market-ready chickens is of public health concern.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "We studied livestock abortion and various associated risk factors in the Ili region of northwest China. Livestock abortion prevalence was estimated and correlated with infections (Brucellosis, Salmonellosis, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia seropositivity) and management (farming type and contact with other herds/flocks) risk factors. The prevalence of cow and sheep abortion induced by Brucella was 76.8% (P&lt;0.0001) and 84.1% (P&lt;0.0001), and Mycoplasma caused an estimated 15.5% (P=0.025) and 17.6% (P&lt;0.001) abortions, respectively. Abortion-related risk factors included mixed farming (cow P=0.001, sheep P&lt;0.001), contact with other flocks (cow P=0.007, sheep P=0.003), brucellosis positivity (cow P&lt;0.001, sheep P&lt;0.001) and Mycoplasma positivity (cow P=0.031, sheep P&lt;0.001). A total of 2996 serum samples (1402 cow, 1594 sheep) were identified by RBPT (Rose Bengal Plate Test), and they showed the seroprevalence of brucellosis in X county was cow 7.1%, sheep 9.1%; in H county was cow 11.7%, sheep 10.7%; and in Q county was cow 4.2%, sheep 9.1%. The seroprevalence of Mycoplasma in X county was cow 3.4%, sheep 7.9%; in H county was cow 5.3%, sheep 9.9%; and in Q county was cow 2.1%, sheep 4.3%. A total of 54 samples, including aborted cow (22), sheep (30) fetuses and milk samples (2), were identified as Brucella melitensis (B. melitensis) positive. A total of 38 Brucella were isolated from 16 aborted cow, 20 sheep fetuses and 2 milk samples. All of these isolates were identified, and confirmed, as B. melitensis. A phylogenetic tree showed that the Brucella isolates closely matched the B. melitensis biovar 3 isolated in Inner Mongolia, China, and B. melitensis isolated from Norway and India. These results suggest that B. melitensis biovar 3 is the main pathogen responsible for cow and sheep abortion and also pose a human health risk. Additionally, livestock reproduction can also be influenced by Mycoplasma infection and managerial factors (farming type and contact with other herds/flocks), especially in remote areas.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a key regulating factor for physiological functions, when elevated during inflammatory conditions can lower endogenous antioxidant levels. Increased NO interacts with oxygen or other ROS to generate peroxynitrite, a potent oxidant which induces oxidative stress. Analgesic effects of naringenin (NRN), a flavanone has been demonstrated by inducing anti-inflammatory effects in O2-*-mediated inflammation. NRN stimulates antioxidant enzymes and also improves glucose uptake. Hence this study was designed to look for therapeutic effects of NRN and in comparison, to metformin (MET) on inflammation-mediated increased NO and decreased antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) in diabetic rat model with compromised glycemic and lipid profile. After single intraperitoneal injection of alloxan (120 mg/kg), the rats were equally divided as Group 1 and 2 which received normal saline and no-treatment respectively while group 3 and 4 received MET 50 mg/kg/day and NRN 50 mg/kg/day respectively. Blood samples were collected at 0, 15th and 30th day of treatment period. Results showed that alloxan significantly increased serum level of glucose (P<0.001), NO (P<0.001) and inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-, IL-6), however, it expressively decreased serum SOD and insulin level. While, NRN significantly downregulated glucose (P<0.05), lipid profile, TNF-, IL-6 and normalized level of NO (P<0.01). It also improved SOD level as compared to that of MET-treatment. Histopathology of pancreas also showed significant improvement in morphology after NRN treatment. This work delivers that NRN exerts anti-oxidant effect in part by downregulating the inflammation-mediated NO overproduction and improving level of SOD resulting in potentiation of endogenous antioxidant defense.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDecompressive craniectomy is an important surgical treatment for patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Several reports have been published on the efficacy of non-watertight sutures in duraplasty performed in decompressive craniectomy. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of dura closure without sutures (non-suture duraplasty) in decompressive craniectomy for TBI.\n\nMethodsOne hundred and six patients were enrolled at a single trauma center between January 2017 and December 2018. We retrospectively collected the data and classified the patients into non-suture and suture duraplasty craniectomy groups. We compared the characteristics of patients and their intra/post- operative findings such as operative time, blood loss, imaging findings, complications, and Glasgow outcome scale.\n\nResultsThere were 37 patients in the non-suture group and 69 in the suture craniectomy group. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to general characteristics. The operative time was 205 min for the suture duraplasty group and 150 min for the non-suture duraplasty group, and that for the non-suture duraplasty group was significantly lesser (p=0.002). Blood loss was significantly lesser in the non-suture duraplasty group (1000 mL) than in the suture duraplasty group (1500 mL, p=0.028). There were no other significant differences.\n\nConclusionNon-suture duraplasty involved shorter operative time and lesser blood loss when compared to suture duraplasty. Other complications and prognosis were similar in both groups. Therefore, it can be concluded that decompressive craniectomy with non-suture duraplasty is a safe and useful surgical technique in patients with TBI.",

There are open-source programs such as imageJ to analyze images of in vitro scratch wound healing assays, but these tools require manual tuning of various parameters, which is time-consuming and limits image throughput. For that reason, we developed an optimized plugin for imageJ to automatically recognize the wound healing size, correct the average wound width by considering its inclination, and quantify other important parameters such as: area, wound area fraction, average wound width, and width deviation of the wound images obtained from a scratch/ wound healing assay. Our plugin is easy to install and can be used with different operating systems. It can be adapted to analyze both individual images and stacks. Additionally, it allows the analysis of images obtained from bright field, phase contrast, and fluorescence microscopes. In conclusion, this new imageJ plugin is a robust tool to automatically standardize and facilitate quantification of different in vitro wound parameters with high accuracy compared with other tools and manual identification.",

    "abstract": "Commitment to cell division at the end of G1 phase, termed Start in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is strongly influenced by nutrient availability. To identify new dominant activators of Start that might operate under different nutrient conditions, we screened a genome-wide ORF overexpression library for genes that bypass a Start arrest caused by absence of the G1 cyclin Cln3 and the transcriptional activator Bck2. We recovered a hypothetical gene YLR053c, renamed NRS1 for Nitrogen-Responsive Start regulator 1, which encodes a poorly characterized 108 amino acid microprotein. Endogenous Nrs1 was nuclear-localized, restricted to poor nitrogen conditions, induced upon mTORCl inhibition, and cell cycle-regulated with a peak at Start. NRS1 interacted genetically with SWI4 and SWI6, which encode subunits of the main G1/S transcription factor complex SBF. Correspondingly, Nrs1 physically interacted with Swi4 and Swi6 and was localized to G1/S promoter DNA. Nrs1 exhibited inherent transactivation activity and fusion of Nrs1 to the SBF inhibitor Whi5 was sufficient to suppress other Start defects. Nrs1 appears to be a recently evolved microprotein that rewires the G1/S transcriptional machinery under poor nitrogeny conditions.\n\nAuthor SummarUnicellular microorganisms must adapt to ever-changing nutrient conditions and hence must adjust cell growth and proliferation to maximize fitness. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commitment to cell division, termed Start, is heavily influenced by nutrient availability. Our understanding of how Start is activated is based mainly on experiments carried out under rich nutrient conditions. To identify potential new Start regulators specific to poor nutrient environments, we screened for genes able to bypass a genetic Start arrest caused by loss of the G1 cyclin Cln3 and the transcriptional activator Bck2. This screen uncovered YLR053c, which we renamed NRS1 for Nitrogen-Responsive Start regulator. Sequence analysis across yeast species indicated that Nrs1 is a recently-evolved microprotein. We showed that NRS1 is nutrient- and cell cycle-regulated, and directly binds the main G1/S transcription factor complex SBF. We demonstrated that Nrs1 has an intrinsic trans-activation activity and provided genetic evidence to suggest that Nrs1 can bypass the requirement for normal Cln3-dependent activation of G1/S transcription. These results uncover a new mechanism of Start activation and illustrate how microproteins can rapidly emerge to rewire fundamental cellular processes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTo date, no specific vaccine or drug has been proven to be effective for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we implemented immunoinformatics approach to design an efficient multi-epitopes vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nResultsThe designed vaccine construct has several immunodominant epitopes from structural proteins of Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope. These peptides promote cellular and humoral immunity and Interferon gamma responses. In addition, these epitopes have antigenicity ability and no allergenicity probability. To enhance the vaccine immunogenicity, we used three potent adjuvants; Flagellin, a driven peptide from high mobility group box 1 as HP-91 and human beta defensin 3 protein. The physicochemical and immunological properties of the vaccine structure were evaluated. Tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was predicted and refined by I-Tasser and galaxi refine and validated using Rampage and ERRAT. Results of Ellipro showed 242 residues from vaccine might be conformational B cell epitopes. Docking of vaccine with Toll-Like Receptors 3, 5 and 8 proved an appropriate interaction between the vaccine and receptor proteins. In silico cloning demonstrated that the vaccine can be efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli.\n\nConclusionsThe designed multi epitope vaccine is potentially antigenic in nature and has the ability to induce humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine can interact appropriately with the TLR3, 5, and 8. Also, this vaccine has high quality structure and suitable characteristics such as high stability and potential for expression in Escherichia coli.",

The action of EPO on erythroid progenitor cells is well established, but its direct action on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is still debated. Here, using cellular barcoding, we traced the differentiation of hundreds of single murine HSPCs, after ex vivo EPO-exposure and transplantation, in five different hematopoietic cell lineages, and observed the transient occurrence of high-output Myeloid-Erythroid-megaKaryocyte (MEK)-biased and Myeloid-B-cell-Dendritic cell (MBDC)-biased clones. Single-cell RNA sequencing (ScRNAseq) analysis of ex vivo EPO-exposed HSPCs revealed that EPO induced the upregulation of erythroid associated genes in a subset of HSPCs, overlapping with multipotent progenitor (MPP) 1 and MPP2. Transplantation of Barcoded EPO-exposed-MPP2 confirmed their enrichment in Myeloid-Erythroid-biased clones. Collectively, our data show that EPO does act directly on MPP independent of the niche, and modulates fate by remodeling the clonal composition of the MPP pool.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant HOXA9 expression is a hallmark of most aggressive acute leukemias, including human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). HOXA9 overexpression not only predicts poor diagnosis and outcome but also plays a critical role in leukemia transformation and maintenance. However, our current understanding of HOXA9 regulation in leukemia is limited, hindering development of therapeutic strategies to treat HOXA9-driven leukemia. To mitigate these challenges, we generated the first HOXA9-mCherry knock-in reporter in an MLL-rearranged (MLLr) B-ALL cell line to dissect HOXA9 regulation. By utilizing the reporter and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated screens, we identified transcription factors controlling HOXA9 expression, including a novel regulator, USF2 and its homolog USF1. USF1/USF2 depletion significantly down-regulated HOXA9 expression and impaired MLLr leukemia cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of HOXA9-MEIS1 fusion protein rescued the impaired leukemia cell proliferation upon USF2 loss. Cut&Run analysis revealed the direct occupancy of USF2 onto HOXA9 promoter in MLLr leukemia cells. Collectively, the HOXA9 reporter facilitated the functional interrogation of the HOXA9 regulome and has advanced our understanding of the molecular regulation network in HOXA9-driven leukemia.",

    "abstract": "Upon vascular injury, platelets are crucial for thrombus formation and contraction, but do they directly initiate early tissue repair processes? Using 3D super-resolution microscopy, micropost traction force microscopy, and specific integrin or myosin IIa inhibitors, we discovered here that platelets form fibrillar adhesions. They assemble fibronectin nanofibrils using IIb{beta}3 (CD41/CD61, GPIIb-IIIa) rather than 5{beta}1 integrins, in contrast to fibroblasts. Highly contractile platelets in contact with thrombus proteins (fibronectin, fibrin) pull fibronectin fibrils along their apical membrane, whereas platelets on basement membrane proteins (collagen IV, laminin) are less contractile generating less stretched planar meshworks beneath themselves. As probed by vinculin-decorated talin unfolding, platelets on fibronectin generate similar traction forces in apical fibrillar adhesions as fibroblasts do. These are novel mechanobiology mechanisms by which platelets spearhead the fibrillogenesis of the first de novo ECM, including its 2D versus 3D network architectures depending on their ECM environment, and thereby pave the way for cell infiltration.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 enters cells using its Spike protein, which is also the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, assays to measure how antibodies and sera affect Spike-mediated viral infection are important for studying immunity. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 virus, one way to simplify such assays is to pseudotype biosafety-level-2 viral particles with Spike. Such pseudotyping has now been described for single-cycle lentiviral, retroviral and VSV particles, but the reagents and protocols are not widely available. Here we detail how to effectively pseudotype lentiviral particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and infect 293T cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2. We also make all the key experimental reagents available in the BEI Resources repository of ATCC and the NIH. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these pseudotyped lentiviral particles can be used to measure the neutralizing activity of human sera or plasma against SARS-CoV-2 in convenient luciferase-based assays, thereby providing a valuable complement to ELISA-based methods that measure antibody binding rather than neutralization.",

    "abstract": "As antibiotic-resistant infections become increasingly prevalent worldwide, understanding the factors that lead to antimicrobial treatment failure is essential to optimizing the use of existing drugs. Opportunistic human pathogens in particular typically exhibit high levels of intrinsic antibiotic resistance and tolerance1, leading to chronic infections that can be nearly impossible to eradicate2. We asked whether the recalcitrance of these organisms to antibiotic treatment could be driven in part by their evolutionary history as environmental microbes, which frequently produce or encounter natural antibiotics3,4. Using the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model, we demonstrate that the self-produced natural antibiotic pyocyanin (PYO) activates bacterial defenses that confer collateral tolerance to certain synthetic antibiotics, including in a clinically-relevant growth medium. Non-PYO-producing opportunistic pathogens isolated from lung infections similarly display increased antibiotic tolerance when they are co-cultured with PYO-producing P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, we show that beyond promoting bacterial survival in the presence of antibiotics, PYO can increase the apparent rate of mutation to antibiotic resistance by up to two orders of magnitude. Our work thus suggests that bacterial production of natural antibiotics in infections could play an important role in modulating not only the immediate efficacy of clinical antibiotics, but also the rate at which antibiotic resistance arises in multispecies bacterial communities.",

    "abstract": "Phagocytosis and autophagy play critical roles in immune defense. Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn), a fungal pathogen that causes fatal infection, subverts the host autophagy initiation complex (AIC) and its upstream regulatory proteins, to promote its phagocytosis and intracellular parasitism of host cells. The mechanisms by which the pathogen engages host AIC proteins remain obscure. Here, we show that the recruitment of host AIC proteins to forming phagosomes is dependent upon the activity of CD44, a host cell surface receptor that engages fungal hyaluronic acid (HA). This interaction elevates intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and activates CaMKK{beta} and its downstream target AMPK, which results in activation of ULK1 and the recruitment of AIC components. Moreover, we demonstrate that HA-coated beads efficiently recruit AIC components to phagosomes. Taken together, these findings show that fungal HA plays a critical role in directing the internalization and productive intracellular membrane trafficking of a fungal pathogen of global importance.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=160 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/047621v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@72f2b9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d5a2corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8b0218org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3698d0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG In BriefDing et al. reveal that interactions between fungal hyaluronic acid (HA) and host CD44 activate a Ca2+ - CaMKK{beta}-AMPK-ULK1 signaling pathway that recruits autophagy initiation complex components to forming phagosomes to drive fungal internalization.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFungal HA interactions with host cells drive a novel non-canonical, ligand-induced, autophagy pathway in phagocytic cells\nC_LIO_LICryptococcus neoformans recruits host CD44, together with AIC components and regulatory proteins, to forming phagocytic cups to initiate host cell internalization\nC_LIO_LIFungal HA interactions with CD44 on host cell surfaces elevate intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, leading to activation of CaMKK{beta}\nC_LIO_LIA Ca2+-CaMKK{beta}-AMPK-ULK1 signaling axis is involved in HA and CD44 induced autophagy protein recruitment during Cn internalization\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, also called novel coronavirus 2019 (nCoV-19), started to circulate among humans around December 2019, and it is now widespread as a global pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is called COVID-19, which is highly contagious and has an overall mortality rate of 6.96% as of May 4, 2020. There is no vaccine or antiviral available for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report our discovery of inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, and XII were identified to have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay. The mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies, thermal shift binding assays, and native mass spectrometry. Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC50 values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 M. Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known Mpro inhibitors. A complex crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with GC-376, determined at 2.15 [A] resolution with three monomers per asymmetric unit, revealed two unique binding configurations, shedding light on the molecular interactions and protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate and inhibitor binding by Mpro. Overall, the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to estimate nutrient intake, ruminal flow, total apparent and ruminal digestibility, rates of passage and digestion, ruminal and omasal pH, blood metabolite concentrations, and body measurements during gestation of Holstein heifers. Eleven pregnant Holstein heifers, 8 of which fitted with a rumen cannula (450 {+/-} 27.6 kg of body weight and 20 {+/-} 3.5 months of initial age) were used. All heifers received the same diet composed of corn silage, soybean meal, corn meal, minerals and vitamins, with a corn silage:concentrate ratio of 50:50 (on a dry matter basis), aiming an average daily gain of approximately 1.0 kg. The sampling periods were established according to the days of gestation: 145, 200, and 255 with a duration of 10 days per period. Total fecal samples were collected to estimate dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber digestibility. Blood samples were collected to analyze metabolites (non-esterified fatty acids, {beta}-hydroxybutyrate, urea, and glucose). Data were analyzed as a repeated measurements scheme, using MIXED procedure, with differences declared when P < 0.05. Dry matter intake expressed in kg/day increased from d-145 to d-200, and remaining stable until d-255 of gestation. The same results were observed for organic matter and crude protein intake, increasing 15.0 and 35.8% respectively. In contrast, when dry matter intake was evaluated as % body weight, we observed a decrease of 16.7% from d-200 to d-255. Days of gestation did not influence ruminal flow of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber. We observed an increase in the ruminal digestibility of neutral detergent fiber by 20.5%. The apparent total-tract digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein changed over days of gestation, with an increase of 11.9, 8.5, and 9.8%, respectively, when comparing d-145 with d-200. The rate of digestion of neutral detergent fiber increased from 2.0 to 3.5% h-1. Glucose levels decreased, while {beta}-hydroxybutirate and non-esterified fatty acids increased from d-145 to d-255. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a reduction in dry matter intake in % body weight due to pregnancy. It also shows an increase in total apparent digestibility through gestation, which imply a greater efficiency of use of nutrients by pregnant animals. Thus, further research is still needed to consolidate such results and to elucidate the mechanism about nutrient usage during the final third of gestation in heifers.",

Also, the proteins of viral replication hubs were related with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection in the risk individual. Additionally, the hub proteins were closely linked with other viral infection, including MERS and HCoVs which suggest similar infection pattern in SARS-CoV-2. We identified five interconnecting cascades between hubs of both networks that show the preparation of optimal environment in the host for viral replication process upon receptor attachment.
