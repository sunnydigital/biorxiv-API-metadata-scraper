    "abstract": "Since SARS-CoV-2 became a pandemic event in the world, it has not only caused huge economic losses, but also a serious threat to global public health. Many scientific questions about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 were raised and urgently need to be answered, including the susceptibility of animals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we tested whether tree shrew, an emerging experimental animal domesticated from wild animal, is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No clinical signs were observed in SARS-CoV-2 inoculated tree shrews during this experiment except the increasing body temperature (above 39{degrees} C) particular in female animals during infection. Low levels of virus shedding and replication in tissues occurred in all three age groups, each of which showed his own characteristics. Histopathological examine revealed that pulmonary abnormalities were mild but the main changes although slight lesions were also observed in other tissues. In summary, tree shrew is not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may not be a suitable animal for COVID-19 related researches.",

    "abstract": "Molecular mimicry of host proteins is an evolutionary strategy adopted by viruses to evade immune surveillance and exploit host cell systems. We report that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a unique S1/S2 cleavage site (RRARSVAS), absent in any previous coronavirus sequenced, that results in mimicry of an identical FURIN-cleavable peptide on the human epithelial sodium channel -subunit (ENaC-). Genetic truncation at this ENaC- cleavage site causes aldosterone dysregulation in patients, highlighting the functional importance of the mimicked SARS-CoV-2 peptide. Single cell RNA-seq from 65 studies shows significant overlap between the expression of ENaC- and ACE2, the putative receptor for the virus, in cell types linked to the cardiovascular-renal-pulmonary pathophysiology of COVID-19. Triangulating this cellular fingerprint with amino acid cleavage signatures of 178 human proteases shows the potential for tissue-specific proteolytic degeneracy wired into the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. We extrapolate that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 into a global coronavirus pandemic may be in part due to its targeted mimicry of human ENaC and hijack of the associated host proteolytic network.",

This study generated Whole Genome data to determine the origin and pattern of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the first six cases tested in The Gambia. Total RNA from SARS-CoV-2 was extracted from inactivated nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs of six cases and converted to cDNA following the ARTIC COVID-19 sequencing protocol. Libraries were constructed with the NEBNext ultra II DNA library prep kit for Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Ligation sequencing kit and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq and Nanopore GridION, respectively. Sequencing reads were mapped to the Wuhan reference genome and compared to eleven other SARS-CoV-2 strains of Asian, European and American origins. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with the consensus genomes for local and non-African strains. Three of the Gambian strains had a European origin (UK and Spain), two strains were of Asian origin (Japan). In The Gambia, Nanopore and Illumina sequencers were successfully used to identify the sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 cases.",

    "abstract": "Queuosine is a naturally occurring modified ribonucleoside found in the first position of the anticodon of the transfer RNAs for Asp, Asn, His and Tyr. Eukaryotes lack pathways to synthesize queuine, the nucleobase precursor to queuosine, and must obtain it from diet or gut microbiota. Here we describe the effects of queuine on the physiology of the eukaryotic parasite, Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amebic dysentery. Queuine is efficiently incorporated into E. histolytica tRNAs by a tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (EhTGT) and this incorporation stimulates the methylation of C38 in tRNAAspGUC. Queuine protects the parasite against oxidative stress (OS) and antagonizes the negative effect that oxidation has on translation by inducing the expression of genes involved in OS response, such as heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70), antioxidant enzymes, and enzymes involved in DNA repair. On the other hand, queuine impairs E. histolytica virulence by downregulating the expression of genes previously associated with virulence, including cysteine proteases, cytoskeletal proteins, and small GTPases. Silencing of EhTGT prevents incorporation of queuine into tRNAs and strongly impairs methylation of C38 in tRNAAspGUC, parasite growth, resistance to OS, and cytopathic activity. Overall, our data reveal that queuine plays a dual role in promoting OS resistance and reducing parasite virulence.\n\nImportanceEntamoeba histolytica is a unicellular parasite that causes amebiasis. The parasite resides in the colon and feeds on the colonic microbiota. The gut flora is implicated in the onset of symptomatic amebiasis due to alterations in the composition of the bacteria. These bacteria modulate the physiology of the parasite and affect the virulence of the parasite through unknown mechanisms. Queuine, a modified nucleobase of queuosine, is exclusively produced by the gut bacteria and leads to tRNA modification at the anticodon loops of specific tRNAs. We found that queuine induces a mild oxidative stress resistance in the parasite and attenuates its virulence. Our study highlights the importance of bacterially derived products in shaping the physiology of the parasite. The fact that queuine inhibits the virulence of E. histolytica may lead to new strategies for preventing and/or treating amebiasis by providing to the host queuine directly or via probiotics.",

    "abstract": "Mumps cases continue to occur, also in countries with a relatively high vaccination rate. The last major outbreaks of mumps in the Netherlands were from 2009-2012 and thereafter, only small clusters and single cases were reported. Molecular epidemiology can provide insights in the circulation of mumps viruses. The aims of the present study were to analyze the molecular epidemiology of mumps viruses in the Netherlands in 2017-2019 and to elucidate whether complete genome sequencing adds to the molecular resolution of mumps viruses when compared to sequencing of the mumps SH gene and non-coding regions (SH+NCRs). To this end, Sanger sequence data from the SH+NCRs were analyzed from 82 mumps genotype G viruses. In addition, the complete genomes were obtained from 10 mumps virus isolates using next-generation sequencing. Analysis of SH+NCRs of mumps viruses revealed the presence of two major lineages in the Netherlands, which was confirmed by analysis of complete genomes. Comparison of molecular resolution obtained with SH+NCRs and complete genomes clearly indicated that additional molecular resolution can be obtained by analyzing complete genomes. In conclusion, analysis of SH + NCRs sequence data from recent mumps genotype G viruses indicate that mumps viruses continue to circulate in the Netherlands and surrounding countries. However, to understand exact transmission trees and to compare mumps viruses on a large geographic scale, analysis of complete genomes is a very useful approach.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that we are currently experiencing is exerting a massive toll both in human lives and economic impact. One of the challenges we must face is to try to understand if and how different variants of the virus emerge and change their frequency in time. Such information can be extremely valuable as it may indicate shifts in aggressiveness, and it could provide useful information to trace the spread of the virus in the population. In this work we identified and traced over time 7 amino acid variants that are present with high frequency in Italy and Europe, but that were absent or present at very low frequencies during the first stages of the epidemic in China and the initial reports in Europe. The analysis of these variants helps defining 6 phylogenetic clades that are currently spreading throughout the world with changes in frequency that are sometimes very fast and dramatic. In the absence of conclusive data at the time of writing, we discuss whether the spread of the variants may be due to a prominent founder effect or if it indicates an adaptive advantage.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic and reversible regulation roles of m6A modification, and the characterization of m6A readers have provided new insights into spermatogenesis at post-transcriptional level. YTHDF2 has been reported to recognize and mediate the m6A-containing transcripts decay during the mouse oocyte mature, embryonic stem cell differentiation, neural development, and zebrafish maternal-to-zygotic transition. However, the roles of YTHDF2 in mammalian spermatogenesis are uncertain. Here, we generated germ cell-specific Ythdf2 mutants (Ythdf2-vKO) at a C57BL/6J background, and demonstrated that YTHDF2 was essential for mouse spermatogenesis and fertility. Ythdf2-vKO provided oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) phenotype with increased apoptosis in germ cells. High-throughput RNA-seq of the testis tissue showed the failure of the degradation of a wave of YTHDF2 target mRNA. Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis combined with our previous single-cell transcriptomics data of mouse spermatogenesis pointed out the failure of a wave of transcript transition during the spermatogenesis of Ythdf2-vKO, which was confirmed by gene expression analysis of diplotene spermatocytes and round spermatids obtained through fluorescence-activated cell sorting using qPCR. Our study demonstrates the fundamental role of YTHDF2 during mouse spermatogenesis and provides a potential candidate for the diagnosis of male infertility with OAT syndrome.\n\nAuthor summaryMale infertility is becoming a worldwide health problem. Male gamete is generated through spermatogenesis, which is a complicated developmental process with dynamic transcriptome changes. RNA m6A modification has been reported as the most prominently internal mRNA modification, which control the tune of gene expression through mRNA splicing, export, translation and decay. RNA m6A modification is catalyzed by \"writers\", and could be removed by \"erasers\". The m6A modification enzymes are reported to play important roles during spermatogenesis. Given that the biological function of m6A modification are mediated through its \"readers\", its readers might be proposed to be involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis. YTHDF2, as a reader of m6A modification, has been reported to mediate the m6A-containing transcripts decay. To explore the roles of YTHDF2 in spermatogenesis, we used germ cell-specific mutation strategy to knock out the mouse Ythdf2. The mutants provided oligoasthenoteratozoospermia phenotype. Our study demonstrate that YTHDF2 is essential for mouse spermatogenesis. YTHDF2 could be a potential candidate for the diagnosis of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Dengue viruses are classified into four serotypes (DENV1[~]4), and the severe forms of dengue disease, the dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome, are caused by sero-cross-reacting antibodies. However, the residue determinants of the serospecificity and sero-cross-reactivity are yet to be identified. Here, we report an epitope grafting mutational analysis of the serospecificity and cross-serospecificity of the envelope protein domain 3 (ED3; 107 residues, [~]11.6kDa), which contains two major putative epitopes of DENVs. To this end, we constructed ED3 from DENV3 (3ED3) and DENV4 (4ED3), and six epitope-grafted variants, where we transferred epitope 1 (L304I, K305D, V309M, and S310A) and/or epitope 2 (D383N, K384S, K387T, and N389H) of 4ED3 onto 3ED3 and vice versa. Mice immunization using 3ED3 and 4ED3 generated serotype-specific antisera, as expected. Similarly, most epitope-grafted ED3s produced antisera serospecific to the template ED3 with little or no cross-recognition of ED3 of the serotype from which the epitopes were taken. This result indicated that a mere grafting of the epitope was not sufficient to transfer serospecificity, contrary to our expectations. However, one epitope grafted ED3 mutant, where epitope 1 of 3ED3 was grafted onto 4ED3 (4ED3epi1), generated antisera that was serospecific to both 4ED3 and 3ED3. The 4ED3epi1 is thus a chimeric ED3 that produces antisera possessing serospecificity to both 3ED3 and 4ED3. The 4ED3epi1 provides a unique tool for analyzing serospecificity and cross-reactivity in dengue, and we hope it will serve as a template for trivalent and eventually tetravalent antisera.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between hemiparasites and their host plants is an important structuring mechanism for plant communities. The mistletoe Struthanthus flexicaulis (Loranthaceae) is widely distributed in the campo rupestre ecosystem and likely has an important role in structuring the communities of which its hosts are part. The main goals of this study were to investigate the effects of parasitism by S. flexicaulis on host plants in a degraded area of campo rupestre and to determine how parasitism affects characteristics of the structure of this plant community over time. We found that parasitized plants had smaller crowns and branch growth, and suffered lower mortality compared to non-parasitized plants. Parasitism by S. flexicaulis decreased dominance and increased the diversity and evenness of plants in the community over time. Parasitism leads to competition with the host for water and nutrients, which may decrease the performance of the host and, consequently, leading to host death. The high mortality of the most abundant plant species led to a restructured woody plant community. These results reinforce the importance of parasitic plants as key species for maintaining species diversity in plant communities.",

    "abstract": "Keratin intermediate filaments form dynamic polymer networks that organize in specific ways dependent on the cell type, the stage of the cell cycle, and the state of the cell. In differentiated cells of the epidermis, they are organized by desmosomes, cell-cell adhesion complexes which provide essential mechanical integrity to this tissue. Despite this, we know little about how keratin organization is controlled and whether desmosomes actively promote keratin assembly in addition to binding pre-assembled filaments. We recently discovered that Ndel1 is a desmosome-associated protein in differentiated epidermis. Here, we show that Ndel1 binds directly to keratin subunits through a motif conserved in all intermediate filament proteins. Further, Ndel1 is necessary for robust desmosome-keratin association and sufficient to reorganize keratins to distinct cellular sites. Lis1, a Ndel1 binding protein, is required for desmosomal localization of Ndel1, but not for its effects on keratin filaments. Finally, we use mouse genetics to demonstrate that loss of Ndel1 results in desmosome defects in the epidermis. Our data thus identify Ndel1 as a desmosome-associated protein which promotes local assembly/organization of keratin filaments and is essential for both robust cell adhesion and epidermal barrier function.",

    "abstract": "The precise spatiotemporal control of cell proliferation is key to the morphogenesis of epithelial tissues. Epithelial cell divisions lead to tissue crowding and local changes in force distribution, which in turn suppress the rate of cell divisions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this mechanical feedback are largely unclear. Here, we identify a critical requirement of B-plexin transmembrane receptors in the response to crowding-induced mechanical forces during embryonic skin development. Epidermal stem cells lacking B-plexins fail to sense mechanical compression, resulting in disinhibition of the transcriptional coactivator YAP, hyperproliferation, and tissue overgrowth. Mechanistically, we show that B-plexins mediate mechanoresponses to crowding through stabilization of adhesive cell junctions and lowering of cortical stiffness. Finally, we provide evidence that the B-plexin-dependent mechanochemical feedback is also pathophysiologically relevant to limit tumor growth in basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer. Our data uncover a central role of B-plexins in mechanosensation to couple cell density and cell division in development and disease.",

    "abstract": "Within the pericentric regions of human chromosomes reside large arrays of tandemly repeated satellite sequences. Expression of the human pericentric satellite HSATII is prevented by extensive heterochromatin silencing in normal cells, yet in many cancer cells, HSATII RNA is aberrantly expressed and accumulates in large nuclear foci in cis. Expression and aggregation of HSATII RNA in cancer cells is concomitant with recruitment of key chromatin regulatory proteins including methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). While HSATII expression has been observed in a wide variety of cancer cell lines and tissues, the effect of its expression is unknown. We tested the effect of stable expression of HSATII RNA within cells that do not normally express HSATII. Ectopic HSATII expression in HeLa and primary fibroblast cells leads to focal accumulation of HSATII RNA in cis and triggers the accumulation of MeCP2 onto nuclear HSATII RNA bodies. Further, long-term expression of HSATII RNA leads to cell division defects including lagging chromosomes, chromatin bridges, and other chromatin defects. Thus, expression of HSATII RNA in normal cells phenocopies its nuclear accumulation in cancer cells and allows for the characterization of the cellular events triggered by aberrant expression of pericentric satellite RNA.",

    "abstract": "-Synuclein and family members {beta}-, and {gamma}-synuclein, are presynaptic proteins that sense and generate membrane curvature, properties important for synaptic vesicle (SV) cycling. {beta}{gamma}-synuclein triple knockout (KO) neurons exhibit SV endocytosis (SVE) deficits. Here, we investigate how SVE is regulated by -synuclein. Immuno-electron microscopy (EM) of synaptosomes reveals that -synuclein relocalizes from SVs to the synaptic membrane upon stimulation, allowing -synuclein to function on presynaptic membranes during or after stimulation. On cell membranes, we observe that -synuclein is colocalized with clathrin and its adaptor AP180. Clathrin patches that contain both -synuclein and AP180 were significantly larger than clathrin patches containing either protein alone. We also find that recruitment of clathrin and AP180 recruitment to membranes are altered in the absence of synucleins. Visualizing clathrin assembly on membranes using an in vitro endocytosis reconstitution system reveals that -synuclein increases clathrin patch size and enhances clathrin lattice curvature, facilitating normal clathrin coated pit maturation. Thus, -synuclein is an endocytic accessory protein that acts at early stages of SVE to controls the size and curvature of clathrin structures on the membrane.",

    "abstract": "An individual neuron hosts up to 10,000 individual synapses that can be made stronger or weaker by local and cell-wide plasticity mechanisms, both of which require protein synthesis. To address over what spatial scale a neuron allocates synaptic resources, we quantified the distribution of newly synthesized proteins after global homeostatic upscaling using metabolic labeling and single-molecule localization (DNA-PAINT). Following upscaling, we observed a global increase in locally synthesized nascent protein in synapses and at dendrites, with a high degree of variability between individual synapses. We determined the smallest spatial scale over which nascent proteins were evenly distributed and found that it is best described by synaptic neighborhoods (~ 10 microns in length)-smaller than a dendritic branch and larger than an individual synapse. Protein allocation at the level of neighborhoods thus represents a solution to the problem of protein allocation within a neuron that balances local autonomy and global homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "A wealth of in vivo evidence demonstrates the physiological importance of histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 (H3K36me3), to which chromodomain-containing proteins, such as MRG15, bind preferentially compared to their dimethyl (H3K36me2) counterparts. However, in vitro studies using isolated H3 peptides have failed to recapitulate a causal interaction. Here, we show that MRG15 can clearly discriminate between synthetic, fully intact model nucleosomes containing H3K36me2 and H3K36me3. MRG15 docking studies, along with experimental observations and nucleosome structure analysis suggest a model where the H3K36 side chain is sequestered in intact nucleosomes via a hydrogen bonding interaction with the DNA backbone, which is abrogated when the third methyl group is added to form H3K36me3. Hence, this mechanism provides a  methyl-switch for contextdependent reader selectivity. These results highlight the importance of such intra-chromatin interactions in understanding epigenetic regulation, a feature which is absent in commonly-used peptide or histone-only models.",

As an essential class of polycationic metabolites ubiquitously present in all living organisms, the polyamine pool is tightly regulated by biosynthesis and salvage pathway. We demonstrated that arginine is a major carbon donor and glutamine is a minor carbon donor for polyamine biosynthesis in T cells. Accordingly, the dependence of T cells can be partially relieved by replenishing the polyamine pool. In response to the blockage of de novo synthesis, T cells can rapidly restore the polyamine pool through a compensatory increase in polyamine uptake from the environment, indicating a layer of metabolic plasticity. Simultaneously blocking synthesis and uptake depletes the intracellular PA pool, inhibits T cell proliferation, suppresses T cell inflammation, indicating the potential therapeutic value of targeting the polyamine for managing inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Thiocyanate (SCN-) contamination threatens aquatic ecosystems and pollutes vital fresh water supplies. SCN- degrading microbial consortia are commercially deployed for remediation, but the impact of organic amendments on selection within SCN- degrading microbial communities has not been investigated. Here, we tested whether specific strains capable of degrading SCN- could be reproducibly selected for based on SCN- loading and the presence or absence of added organic carbon. Complex microbial communities derived from those used to treat SCN- contaminated water were exposed to systematically increased input SCN concentrations in molasses-amended and -unamended reactors and in reactors switched to unamended conditions after establishing the active SCN- degrading consortium. Five experiments were conducted over 790 days and genome-resolved metagenomics was used to resolve community composition at the strain level. A single Thiobacillus strain proliferated in all reactors at high loadings. Despite the presence of many Rhizobiales strains, a single Afipia variant dominated the molasses-free reactor at moderately high loadings. This strain is predicted to breakdown SCN- using a novel thiocyanate dehydrogenase, oxidize resulting reduced sulfur, degrade product cyanate (OCN-) to ammonia and CO2 via cyanase, and fix CO2 via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Removal of molasses from input feed solutions reproducibly led to dominance of this strain. Neither this Afipia strain nor the thiobacilli have the capacity to produce cobalamin, a function detected in low abundance community members. Although sustained by autotrophy, reactors without molasses did not stably degrade SCN- at high loading rates, perhaps due to loss of biofilm-associated niche diversity. Overall, convergence in environmental conditions led to convergence in the strain composition, although reactor history also impacted the trajectory of community compositional change.",

    "abstract": "Negative regulation of exocytosis from secretory cells throughout the body is accomplished through inhibitory signals from Gi/o G protein-coupled receptors by G{beta}{gamma} subunit inhibition of two common mechanisms: (i) decreased calcium entry and (ii) direct interaction of G{beta}{gamma} with the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment Protein (SNAP) Receptor (SNARE) plasma membrane fusion machinery. We have previously shown that disabling the second mechanism with a truncation of SNAP25 (SNAP25{Delta}3/{Delta}3) decreases the affinity of G{beta}{gamma} for the SNARE complex, leaving exocytotic fusion as well as modulation of calcium entry intact but disabling GPCR inhibition of exocytosis. Here we report significant beneficial metabolic remodeling in mice carrying this mutation. Chow-fed SNAP25{Delta}3/{Delta}3 mice exhibit enhanced insulin sensitivity and increased beiging of white fat. In response to a high fat diet, the metabolic protection was amplified in SNAP25{Delta}3/{Delta}3 mice. Glucose homeostasis, whole body insulin action, and insulin-mediated glucose uptake into white adipose tissue were improved along with resistance to diet-induced obesity. This metabolic protection in SNAP25{Delta}3/{Delta}3 mice occurred without compromising the physiological response to fasting or cold. All metabolic phenotypes were reversed at thermoneutrality, suggesting basal autonomic activity is required. Direct electrode stimulation of sympathetic neurons exocytosis from SNAP25{Delta}3/{Delta}3 inguinal adipose depot resulted in enhanced and prolonged norepinephrine release. Thus, the G{beta}{gamma}-SNARE interaction represents a cellular mechanism that deserves further exploration as a new avenue for combatting metabolic disease.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/069138v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2c1fa0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d076ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@27e351org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bce219_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Stem cell differentiation is accompanied by an increase in mRNA translation. The rate of protein biosynthesis is influenced by the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine that are essential for cell growth and stem cell maintenance. However, the role of polyamines as endogenous effectors of stem cell fate and whether they act through translational control remains obscure. Here, we investigated the function of polyamines in stem cell fate decisions using hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) organoids. HFSCs showed lower translation rates than progenitor cells, and a forced suppression of translation by direct targeting of the ribosome or through specific depletion of natural polyamines elevated stemness. In addition, we identified N1-acetylspermidine as a novel parallel regulator of cell fate decisions, increasing proliferation without reducing translation. Overall, this study delineates the diverse routes of polyamine metabolism-mediated regulation of stem cell fate decisions.\n\nKey PointsO_LILow mRNA translation rates characterize hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) state\nC_LIO_LIDepletion of natural polyamines enriches HFSCs via reduced translation\nC_LIO_LIN1-acetylspermidine promotes HFSC state without reducing translation\nC_LIO_LIN1-acetylspermidine expands the stem cell pool through elevated proliferation\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The asymmetric distribution of microtubule (MT) dynamics in migrating cells is important for cell polarization, yet the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain underexplored. Here, we addressed this question by studying the role of the MT depolymerase, MCAK, in the highly persistent migration of RPE-1 cells. MCAK knockdown leads to slowed migration and poor directional movement. Fixed and live cell imaging revealed that MCAK knockdown results in excessive membrane ruffling as well as defects in cell polarization and the maintenance of a major protrusive front. Additionally, loss of MCAK increases the lifetime of focal adhesions by decreasing their disassembly rate. These defects are due in part to the loss of the spatial distribution of MCAK activity, wherein activity is higher in the trailing edge of cells compared to the leading edge. Overexpression of Rac1 has a dominant effect over MCAK activity, placing it downstream or in a parallel pathway to MCAK function in migration. Together, our data support a model that places MCAK at a key nexus of a feedback loop, in which polarized distribution of MCAK activity and subsequent differential regulation of MT dynamics contributes to cell polarity and directional migration.",

    "abstract": "Research has demonstrated the transdiagnostic importance of irritability in psychopathology pathways but the contribution of developmentally-unfolding patterns has only recently been explored. To address this question, irritability patterns of 110 youth from a large and diverse early childhood cohort were assessed at preschool age and at school age ([~]2.5 years later) with a dimensional irritability scale designed to capture the normal:abnormal spectrum. Participants then returned at Pre-adolescence ([~]6 years later) for an assessment with a structured clinical interview (internalizing/externalizing symptoms) and a magnetic resonance imaging scan. When only preschool age irritability was considered, this was a transdiagnostic predictor of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. However, a model including both preschool and school age irritability provided a more nuanced picture. A high preschool and decreasing school age profile of irritability predicted elevated pre-adolescence internalizing symptoms, potentially reflecting emerging coping/internalizing behavior in pre-adolescence. In contrast, a stable irritability profile across these timepoints predicted increased pre-adolescence externalizing symptoms. Further, preschool irritability (a period of rapid growth) did not predict pre-adolescent gray matter volume abnormality, an indicator of transdiagnostic clinical risk. However, irritability at school age (when gray matter volume growth is largely finished) demonstrated an interactive effect among regions; increased school age irritability predicted reduced volume in pre-adolescence emotional regions (e.g., amygdala, medial orbitofrontal cortex) and increased volume in other regions (e.g., cerebellum). Expanding the impact of RDoCs approach yielding transdiagnostic phenotypes and multiple units of analysis, a developmentally informed approach provides critical new insights into the complex unfolding of mechanisms underlying emerging psychopathology.",

Infant airway microbiota occupying the nasopharynx have been associated with respiratory disease risk and severity. The extent to which interactions between RSV and microbiota occur in the airway, and their impact on respiratory disease severity and infection susceptibility, are not well understood.\n\nObjectivesTo characterize associations between the nasal microbiota and RSV infection before, during, and after infants first respiratory illness.\n\nMethodsNasal 16S rRNA microbial community profiling of two cohorts of infants in the first year of life: 1) a cross-sectional cohort of 89 RSV infected infants sampled during illness and 102 population matched healthy controls, and 2) an individually matched longitudinal cohort of 12 infants who developed RSV infection and 12 who did not, sampled at time points before, during, and after infection.\n\nMeasurements and Main ResultsWe identified 12 taxa significantly associated with RSV infection. All 12 were differentially abundant during infection, with seven differentially abundant prior to infection, and eight differentially abundant after infection. Eight of these taxa were associated with disease severity. Nasal microbiota composition was more discriminative of healthy vs. infected than of disease severity.\n\nConclusionsOur findings elucidate the chronology of nasal microbiota dysbiosis and suggest an altered developmental trajectory associated with first-time RSV infection. Microbial temporal dynamics reveal indicators of disease risk, correlates of illness and severity, and the impact of RSV infection on microbiota composition.

    "abstract": "Rgg family proteins, such as Rgg2 and Rgg3, have emerged as primary quorum-sensing regulated transcription factors in Streptococcus species, controlling virulence, antimicrobial resistance, and biofilm formation. Rgg2 and Rgg3 function is regulated by their interaction with oligopeptide quorum-sensing signals called short hydrophobic peptides (SHPs). The molecular basis of Rgg-SHP and Rgg-target DNA promoter specificity was unknown. To close this gap, we determined the cryo-EM structure of Streptococcus thermophilus Rgg3 bound to its quorum-sensing signal, SHP3, and the X-ray crystal structure of Rgg3 alone. Comparison of these structures to that of an Rgg in complex with cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of SHP-induced Rgg activity, reveals the molecular basis of CsA function. Furthermore, to determine how Rgg proteins recognize DNA promoters, we determined X-ray crystal structures of both S. dysgalactiae Rgg2 and S. thermophilus Rgg3 in complex with their target DNA promoters. The physiological importance of the observed Rgg-DNA interactions was dissected using in vivo genetic experiments and in vitro biochemical assays. Based on these structure-function studies, we present a revised unifying model of Rgg regulatory interplay. In contrast to existing models, where Rgg2 proteins are transcriptional activators and Rgg3 proteins are transcriptional repressors, we propose that both are capable of transcriptional activation. However, when Rgg proteins with different activation requirements compete for the same DNA promoters, those with more stringent activation requirements function as repressors by blocking promoter access of the SHP-bound conformationally active Rgg proteins. While a similar gene expression regulatory scenario has not been previously described, in all likelihood it is not unique to streptococci.\n\nSignificance StatementSecreted peptide pheromones regulate critical biological processes in Gram-positive bacteria. In streptococci such as the human pathogen S. pyogenes, oligopeptide pheromones, like the short hydrophobic peptides (SHPs), regulate virulence, antimicrobial resistance, and biofilm formation. SHPs directly regulate the activity of transcription factors called Rgg2 and Rgg3. We present the cryo-EM structure of Rgg3 in complex with SHP3, as well as X-ray crystal structures of Rgg2 bound to target promoter DNA, Rgg3 bound to target promoter DNA, and Rgg3 alone. Based on the cryo-EM, X-ray crystallographic, biochemical, and genetic studies presented here, we provide not only detailed mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of Rgg3-SHP3, Rgg2-DNA, and Rgg3-DNA binding specificity, but also a new model of transcription factor regulatory interplay.",

Yet, the determinants of niche partitioning in this habitat are yet to be fully understood, especially among the taxa that belong to recently discovered branches of microbial life. Here we assembled metagenomes from daily tongue and dental plaque samples from multiple individuals and reconstructed 790 non-redundant genomes, 43 of which resolved to TM7 that formed six monophyletic clades distinctly associated either with plaque or with tongue. Both pangenomic and phylogenomic analyses grouped tongue-specific TM7 clades with other host-associated TM7 genomes. In contrast, plaque-specific TM7 grouped together with environmental TM7 genomes. Besides offering deeper insights into the ecology, evolution, and the mobilome of the cryptic members of the oral microbiome, our study reveals an intriguing resemblance between dental plaque and non-host environments indicated by the TM7 evolution, suggesting that plaque may have served as a stepping stone for environmental microbes to adapt to host environments for some clades of human associated microbes. Additionally, we report that prophages are widespread amongst oral-associated TM7, while absent from environmental TM7, suggesting that prophages may have played a role in adaptation of TM7 to the host environment.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms and regulation of neurotransmitter release is a complex process involving many co-factors and proteins. One critical interaction is the regulation of exocytosis when G-protein {beta}{gamma} (G{beta}{gamma}) dimers bind to the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein complex. The complex is comprised of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein-25 (SNAP-25), syntaxin 1A, and synaptobrevin. Herein we probe across the entire family of human G{beta} and G{gamma} proteins for residues critical for the interaction with SNARE, by systematically screening peptide sequences for their ability to bind to tSNARE. The coiled-coil region of G{beta}{gamma} showed high affinity to tSNARE, along with the propeller region of G{beta} on the opposite side from the coiled-coil region. Peptides based on G{beta}1{gamma}2, shown to have high affinity to SNARE, tSNARE were screened further by alanine scanning to probe for residues critical for binding to tSNARE. Full length G{beta}1{gamma}2 and SNARE were docked computationally using Rosetta, to examine the experimentally determined binding sites. Docking converged on two possible sites of interaction using two distinct regions of both G{beta}1{gamma}2 and SNARE.",

    "abstract": "Coat protein complex II (COPII) factors mediate cargo export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but bulky collagens and lipoproteins are too large for traditional COPII vesicles. Mammalian CTAGE5 and TANGO1 have been well characterized individually as specialized cargo receptors at the ER that function with COPII coats to facilitate trafficking of bulky cargoes. Here, we present a genetic interaction study in zebrafish of deletions in ctage5, tango1, or both to investigate their potential distinct and complimentary functions. We found that Ctage5 and Tango1 have different roles related to organogenesis, collagen versus lipoprotein trafficking, stress-pathway activation, and survival. While deletion of both ctage5 and tango1 compounded phenotype severity, deletion of either factor alone revealed novel tissue specific defects in the building of heart, muscle, lens, and intestine, in addition to the previously described roles in the development of neural and cartilage tissues. Together, our results suggest that Ctage5 and Tango1 have overlapping, but also divergent roles in tissue development and homeostasis.\n\nSummaryIn this genetic study Ctage5 and Tango1 endoplasmic reticulum cargo receptors were investigated together in vivo for the first time. Cell differentiation, survival, trafficking, and stress pathway activation were investigated.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells exploit a variety of migration modes to leave primary tumors and establish metastases, including amoeboid cell migration facilitated by bleb formation. Here we demonstrate that thrombin induces dynamic blebbing in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, and confirm that PAR2 activation is sufficient to induce this effect. Cell confinement has been implicated as a driving force in bleb-based migration. Unexpectedly, we find that gentle contact compression, exerted using a \"Cell Press\" to mechanically stimulate cells, attenuated thrombin-induced blebbing with an associated increase in cytosolic calcium. Thrombin-induced blebbing was similarly attenuated using Yoda1, an agonist of the mechanosensitive calcium channel Piezo1, and its capacity to attenuate blebbing was impaired in Piezo1 depleted cells. Additionally, Piezo1 activation suppressed and reversed the thrombin-induced phosphorylation of ERM proteins, which are implicated in the blebbing process, and this activity was in part mediated through activation of the PP1A/PP2A family of serine/threonine phosphatases. Our results provide mechanistic insights into Piezo1 activation as a suppressor of dynamic blebbing, specifically that which is induced by thrombin.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive commensal bacterium native to the gastrointestinal tract and an opportunistic pathogen of increasing clinical concern. E. faecalis also colonizes the female reproductive tract and reports suggest vaginal colonization increases following antibiotic treatment or in patients with aerobic vaginitis. Currently, little is known about specific factors that promote E. faecalis vaginal colonization and subsequent infection. We modified an established mouse vaginal colonization model to explore E. faecalis vaginal carriage and demonstrate that both vancomycin resistant and sensitive strains colonize the murine vaginal tract. Following vaginal colonization, we observed E. faecalis in vaginal, cervical and uterine tissue. A mutant lacking endocarditis- and biofilm-associated pili (Ebp) exhibited a decreased ability to associate with human vaginal and cervical cells in vitro, but did not contribute to colonization in vivo. Thus, we screened a low-complexity transposon (Tn) mutant library to identify novel genes important for E. faecalis colonization and persistence in the vaginal tract. This screen revealed 383 mutants that were underrepresented during vaginal colonization at 1, 5 and 8 days post-inoculation compared to growth in culture medium. We confirmed that mutants deficient in ethanolamine catabolism or in the type VII secretion system were attenuated in persisting during vaginal colonization. These results reveal the complex nature of vaginal colonization and suggest that multiple factors contribute to E. faecalis persistence in the reproductive tract.\n\nIMPORTANCEDespite increasing prevalence and association of E. faecalis with aerobic vaginitis, essentially nothing is known about the bacterial factors that influence E. faecalis vaginal colonization. We have adapted an animal model of vaginal colonization that supports colonization of multiple E. faecalis strains. Additionally, we determined that ethanolamine utilization and type VII secretion system genes contribute to vaginal colonization and persistence. Identification of factors important for vaginal colonization and persistence provides potential targets for the development of therapeutics. This study is the first to identify key determinants that promote vaginal colonization by E. faecalis, which may represent an important reservoir for antibiotic resistant enterococci.",
