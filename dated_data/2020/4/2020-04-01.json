    "abstract": "How ecological and evolutionary processes interact and together determine species and community responses to climate change is poorly understood. We studied long-term dynamics (over approximately 200 asexual generations) in two phytoplankton species, a coccolithophore (Emiliania huxleyi) and a diatom (Chaetoceros affinis), to increased CO2 growing alone or competing with one another in co-occurrence. To allow for rapid evolutionary responses, the experiment started with a standing genetic variation of nine genotypes in each of the species. Under co-occurrence of both species, we observed a dominance shift from C. affinis to E. huxleyi after about 120 generations in both CO2 treatments, but more pronounced under high CO2. Associated with this shift, we only found weak adaptation to high CO2 in the diatom and none in the coccolithophore in terms of species growth rates. In addition, no adaptation to interspecific competition could be observed by comparing the single to the two-species treatments in reciprocal assays, regardless of the CO2 treatment. Nevertheless, highly reproducible genotype sorting left only one genotype remaining for each of the species among all treatments. This strong evolutionary selection coincided with the dominance shift from C. affinis to E. huxleyi. Since all other conditions were kept constant over time, the most parsimonious explanation for the dominance shift is that the strong evolutionary selection potentially altered competitive ability of the two species. Thus, here observed changes in the simplest possible two-species phytoplankton \"community\" demonstrated that eco-evolutionary interactions can be critical for predicting community responses to climate change in rapidly dividing organisms such as phytoplankton.",

    "abstract": "Wearable devices have been increasingly used in research to provide continuous physical activity monitoring, but how to effectively extract features remains challenging for researchers. To analyze the generated actigraphy data in large-scale population studies, we developed computationally efficient methods to derive sleep and activity features through a Hidden Markov Model-based sleep/wake identification algorithm, and circadian rhythm features through a Penalized Multi-band Learning approach adapted from machine learning. Unsupervised feature extraction is useful when labeled data are unavailable, especially in large-scale population studies. We applied these two methods to the UK Biobank wearable device data and used the derived sleep and circadian features as phenotypes in genome-wide association studies. We identified 53 genetic loci with p<5x10-8 including genes known to be associated with sleep disorders and circadian rhythms as well as novel loci associated with Body Mass Index, mental diseases and neurological disorders, which suggest shared genetic factors of sleep and circadian rhythms with physical and mental health. Further cross-tissue enrichment analysis highlights the important role of the central nervous system and the shared genetic architecture with metabolism-related traits and the metabolic system. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of our unsupervised methods for wearable device data when additional training data cannot be easily acquired, and our study further expands the application of wearable devices in population studies and genetic studies to provide novel biological insights.",

    "abstract": "Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is an autosomal dominant disorder with specific clinical signs and neurodevelopmental impairment. The two known proteins altered in the majority of RSTS patients are the histone acetylation regulators CBP and p300. For assessing possible ameliorative effects of exogenous and endogenous HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), we exploited in vivo and in vitro RSTS models. First, HDACi effects were tested on Drosophila melanogaster, showing molecular rescue. In the same model, we observed a shift in gut microbiota composition. We then studied HDACi effects in RSTS cell lines compared to healthy donor cells. We observed patients-specific molecular rescue of acetylation defects at subtoxic concentrations. Finally, we assessed commensal gut microbiota composition in a cohort of RSTS patients compared to healthy siblings. Intriguingly, we observed a significant depletion in butyrate-producing bacteria in RSTS patients. In conclusion, this study reports the possibility of modulating acetylation equilibrium by HDACi treatments and the importance of microbiota composition in a chromatinopathy.",

    "abstract": "Gammaherpesviruses (GHVs) are DNA tumor viruses that establish life-long, chronic infections in lymphocytes of humans and other mammals. GHV infections are associated with numerous cancers, especially in immune compromised hosts. While it is known that GHVs utilize host germinal center (GC) B cell responses during latency establishment, an understanding of how viral gene products function in specific B cell subsets to regulate this process is incomplete. Using murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) as a small-animal model to define mechanisms of GHV pathogenesis in vivo, we generated a virus in which the M2 gene was flanked by loxP sites (M2.loxP), enabling the use of Cre-lox technology to define M2 function in specific cell types in infection and disease. The M2 gene encodes a protein that is highly expressed in GC B cells that promotes plasma cell differentiation and viral reactivation. M2 was efficiently deleted in Cre-expressing cells, and the presence of loxP sites flanking M2 did not alter viral replication or latency in mice that do not express Cre. In contrast, M2.loxP MHV68 exhibited a deficit in latency establishment and reactivation that resembled M2-null virus, following intranasal (IN) infection of mice that express Cre in all B cells (CD19-Cre). Nearly identical phenotypes were observed for M2.loxP MHV68 in mice that express Cre in germinal center (GC) B cells (AID-Cre). However, neither colonization of draining lymph nodes after IN infection nor the spleen after intraperitoneal (IP) infection required M2, although the reactivation defect was retained. Together, these data confirm that M2 function is B cell-specific and demonstrate that M2 primarily functions in AID-expressing cells to facilitate MHV68 dissemination to distal latency reservoirs within the host and reactivation from latency. Our study reveals that a viral latency gene functions within a distinct subset of cells to facilitate host colonization.\n\nIMPORTANCEGammaherpesviruses establish life-long chronic infections in cells of the immune system that can lead to lymphomas and other diseases. To facilitate colonization of a host, gammaherpesviruses encode gene products that manipulate processes involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation. Whether and how these viral gene products function in specific cells of the immune system is poorly defined. We report here the use of a viral genetic system that allows for deletion of specific viral genes in discrete populations of cells. We employ this system in an in vivo model to demonstrate cell-type-specific requirements for a particular viral gene. Our findings reveal that a viral gene product can function in distinct cellular subsets to direct gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the world. Although most cases occur in stiff, cirrhotic livers, and stiffness is a significant risk factor, HCC can also arise in non-cirrhotic livers in the setting of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We hypothesized that lipid droplets in NAFLD might apply mechanical forces to the nucleus, functioning as mechanical stressors akin to stiffness. We investigated the effect of lipid droplets on cellular mechanosensing and found that primary human hepatocytes loaded with the fatty acids oleate and linoleate exhibited decreased stiffness-induced cell spreading and disrupted focal adhesions and stress fibers. The presence of large lipid droplets in hepatocytes resulted in increased nuclear localization of the mechano-sensor Yes-associated protein (YAP). In cirrhotic livers from patients with NAFLD, hepatocytes filled with large lipid droplets showed significantly higher nuclear localization of YAP as compared to cells with small lipid droplets. This work suggests that lipid droplets induce a mechanical signal that disrupts the ability of the hepatocyte to sense its underlying matrix stiffness, and that the presence of lipid droplets can induce intracellular mechanical stresses.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=85 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/017319v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10b69d5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@515c02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16f8ea5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fe33ff_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Wolffia is the fastest growing plant genus on Earth with a recorded doubling time of less than a day. Wolffia has a dramatically reduced body plan, primarily growing through a continuous, budding-type asexual reproduction with no obvious phase transition. Most plants are bound by the 24-hour light-dark cycle with the majority of processes such as gene expression partitioned or phased to a specific time-of-day (TOD). However, the role that TOD information and the circadian clock plays in facilitating the growth of a fast-growing plant is unknown. Here we generated draft reference genomes for Wolffia australiana (Benth.) Hartog & Plas to monitor gene expression over a two-day time course under light-dark cycles. Wolffia australiana has the smallest genome size in the genus at 357 Mb and has a dramatically reduced gene set at 15,312 with a specific loss of root (WOX5), vascular (CASP), circadian (TOC1), and light-signaling (NPH3) genes. Remarkably, it has also lost all but one of the NLR genes that are known to be involved in innate immunity. In addition, only 13% of its genes cycle, which is far less than in other plants, with an overrepresentation of genes associated with carbon processing and chloroplast-related functions. Despite having a focused set of cycling genes, TOD cis-elements are conserved in W. australiana, consistent with the overall conservation of transcriptional networks. In contrast to the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, the reduction in cycling genes correlates with fewer pathways under TOD control in Wolffia, which could reflect a release of functional gating. Since TOD networks and the circadian clock work to gate activities to specific times of day, this minimization of regulation may enable Wolffia to grow continuously with optimal economy. Wolffia is an ideal model to study the transcriptional control of growth and the findings presented here could serve as a template for plant improvement.",

    "abstract": "Recent computational advancements in the simulation of biochemical processes allow investigating the mechanisms involved in protein regulation with realistic physics-based models, at an atomistic level of resolution. Using these techniques to study the negative regulation of the androgen receptor (AR), we discovered a key functional role played by non-native metastable states appearing along the folding pathway of this protein. This unexpected observation inspired us to design a completely novel drug discovery approach, named Pharmacological Protein Inactivation by Folding Intermediate Targeting (PPI-FIT), based on the rationale of negatively regulating protein expression by targeting folding intermediates. Here, PPI-FIT was tested for the first time on the cellular prion protein (PrP), a cell surface glycoprotein playing a key role in fatal and transmissible neurodegenerative pathologies known as prion diseases. We predicted the all-atom structure of an intermediate appearing along the folding pathway of PrP, and identified four different small molecule ligands for this conformer, all capable of selectively lowering the expression of the protein by promoting its degradation. Our data support the notion that the level of target proteins could be modulated by acting on their folding pathways, implying a previously unappreciated role for folding intermediates in the biological regulation of protein expression.",

    "abstract": "Home health monitoring technologies promise to improve care and reduce costs, yet they are limited by the need for adherence to self-monitoring, usage of an app, or application of a wearable. While implantable sensors overcome the adherence barrier, they are expensive and require invasive procedures. Here, we describe a non-invasive, non-contact, adherence-independent sensor, that when placed beneath the legs of a patients home bed, longitudinally monitors total body weight, detailed respiratory signals, and ballistocardiograms for months, without requiring any active patient participation. Accompanying algorithms demix weight and respiratory signals when the bed is shared by a partner or a pet. Validation studies during overnight clinical sleep studies exhibit quantitative equivalence to commercial sensors and allow discrimination of obstructive and central sleep apneas. In-home studies discriminate atrial fibrillation from normal sinus rhythm. To demonstrate real-world feasibility, we performed 3 months of continuous in-home monitoring in a patient with heart failure as he awaited and recovered from coronary artery bypass surgery.

By compiling existing data from multiple original studies, it is possible to build powerful new datasets capable of exploring many questions in ecology, evolution and conservation biology. One key question that these data can help inform is what happened in a species demographic past. However, compiling data in this manner is not trivial, there are many complexities associated with data extraction, data quality and data handling.

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent studies have demonstrated that phylogenomics is an important basis for answering many fundamental evolutionary questions. With more high-quality whole genome sequences published, more efficient phylogenomics analysis workflows are required urgently.\n\nResultsTo this end and in order to capture putative differences among evolutionary histories of gene families and species, we developed a phylogenomics workflow for gene family classification, gene family tree inference, species tree inference and duplication/loss events dating. Our analysis framework is on the basis of two guiding ideas: 1) gene trees tend to be different from species trees but they influence each other in evolution; 2) different gene families have undergone different evolutionary mechanisms. It has been applied to the genomic data from 64 vertebrates and 5 out-group species. And the results showed high accuracy on species tree inference and few false-positives in duplication events dating.\n\nConclusionsBased on the inferred gene duplication and loss event, only 9[~]16% gene families have duplication retention after a whole genome duplication (WGD) event. A large part of these families have ohnologs from two or three WGDs. Consistent with the previous study results, the gene function of these families are mainly involved in nervous system and signal transduction related biological processes. Specifically, we found that the gene families with ohnologs from the teleost-specific (TS) WGD are enriched in fat metabolism, this result implyng that the retention of such ohnologs might be associated with the environmental status of high concentration of oxygen during that period.",

    "abstract": "In advanced prostate cancer, resistance to androgen deprivation therapy is achieved through numerous mechanisms, including loss of the androgen receptor (AR) allowing for AR-independent growth. Therapeutic options are limited for AR-independent castration-resistant prostate cancer, and defining mechanisms critical for its survival is of utmost importance for targeting this lethal disease. Our studies have focused on defining the telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM) required for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell survival. TMMs are responsible for telomere elongation to instill replicative immortality and prevent senescence, with the two TMM pathways available being telomerase and alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Here, we show that AR-independent CRPC exhibits ALT hallmarks and limited telomerase expression and activity, whereas AR-dependent models use telomerase for telomere maintenance. AR-independent CRPC exhibited elevated levels of SLX4IP, a protein implicated in TMM switching. SLX4IP overexpression in AR-dependent CRPC C4-2B cells promoted ALT hallmarks in vitro. SLX4IP knockdown in AR-independent CRPC cells (DU145 and PC-3) led to the loss of ALT hallmarks, dramatic telomere shortening, induction of senescence, and reduced tumor volume. Using an in vitro model of CRPC progression, induction of neuroendocrine differentiation in AR-dependent CRPC cells promoted ALT hallmarks in an SLX4IP-dependent manner. Lack of sufficient SLX4IP expression prevented ALT hallmarks rendering a TMM deficient environment, thus inducing senescence.

    "abstract": "Cellular stress leads to reprogramming of mRNA translation and formation of stress granules (SGs), membraneless organelles consisting of mRNA and RNA-binding proteins. Although the function of SGs remains largely unknown, it is widely assumed they contain exclusively nontranslating mRNA. Here we re-examine this hypothesis using single-molecule imaging of mRNA translation in living cells. While our data confirms that non-translating mRNAs are preferentially recruited to SGs, we find unequivocal evidence for translation of mRNA localized to SGs. Our data indicate that SG-associated translation is not rare and that the entire translation cycle (initiation, elongation and termination) can occur for these transcripts. Furthermore, translating mRNAs can be observed transitioning between the cytosol and SGs without changing their translational status. Together, these results argue against a direct role for SGs in inhibition of mRNA translation.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria initially respond to nutrient starvation by eliciting large-scale transcriptional changes. The accompanying changes in gene expression and metabolism allow the bacterial cells to effectively adapt to the nutrient starved state. How the transcriptome subsequently changes as nutrient starvation ensues is not well understood. We used nitrogen (N) starvation as a model nutrient starvation condition to study the transcriptional changes in Escherichia coli experiencing long-term N starvation. The results reveal that the transcriptome of N starved E. coli undergoes changes that are required to maximise chances of viability and to effectively recover growth when N starvation conditions become alleviated. We further reveal that, over time, N starved E. coli cells rely on the degradation of allantoin for optimal growth recovery when N becomes replenished. This study provides insights into the temporally coordinated adaptive responses that occur in E. coli experiencing sustained N starvation.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacteria in their natural environments seldom encounter conditions that support continuous growth. Hence, many bacteria spend the majority of their time in states of little or no growth due to starvation of essential nutrients. To cope with prolonged periods of nutrient starvation, bacteria have evolved several strategies, primarily manifesting themselves through changes in how the information in their genes is accessed. How these coping strategies change over time under nutrient starvation is not well understood and this knowledge is not only important to broaden our understanding of bacterial cell function, but also to potentially find ways to manage harmful bacteria. This study provides insights into how nitrogen starved Escherichia coli bacteria rely on different genes during long term nitrogen starvation.",

Strategies that reduce enhanced permeability and vascular inflammation are promising therapeutic targets. Activation of the Angiopoietin-1 (Angpt1)-Tie2 tyrosine kinase signaling pathway is an important regulator of vascular quiescence. Here we describe the design and construction of a new soluble ANGPT1 mimetic that is a potent activator of endothelial Tie2 in vitro and in vivo. Using a chimeric fusion strategy, we replaced the extracellular matrix (ECM) binding and oligomerization domain of ANGPT1 with a heptameric scaffold derived from the C-terminus of serum complement protein C4-binding protein  (C4BP). We refer to this new fusion protein biologic as C4BP-ANG1, which forms a stable heptamer and induces TIE2 phosphorylation in cultured cells, and in the lung following i.v. injection of mice. Injection of C4BP-ANG1 ameliorates VEGF- and lipopolysaccharide-induced vascular leakage, in keeping with the known functions of Angpt1-Tie2 in maintaining quiescent vascular stability, and therefore is a promising candidate treatment for inflammatory endothelial dysfunction.",

On the basis of our previous tool CPPred, we develop CPPred-sORF by adding two features and using non-AUG as the starting codon, which makes a comprehensive evaluation of sORF. The database of CPPred-sORF are constructed by small coding RNA and lncRNA as positive and negative data, respectively. Compared to the small coding RNAs and small ncRNAs, lncRNAs and small coding RNAs are less distinguishable. This is because the longer the sequences, the easier to include open reading frames. We find that the sensitivity, specificity and MCC value of CPPred-sORF on the independent testing set can reach 88.22%, 88.84% and 0.768, respectively, which shows much better prediction performance than the other methods.",

These findings suggest a high degree of lipid order, which raises the question of how membrane proteins function in such an environment. The yeast PM is segregated into the Micro-Compartment-of-Can1 (MCC) and Pma1 (MCP), which have different lipid compositions. We extracted proteins from these microdomains via stoichiometric capture of lipids and proteins in styrene-maleic-acid-lipid-particles (SMALPs). We purified SMALP-lipid-protein complexes by chromatography and quantitatively analyzed periprotein lipids located within the diameter defined by one SMALP. Phospholipid and sterol concentrations are similar for MCC and MCP, but sphingolipids are enriched in MCP. Ergosterol is depleted from this periprotein lipidome, whereas phosphatidylserine is enriched relative to the bulk of the plasma membrane. Direct detection of PM lipids in the  periprotein space supports the conclusion that proteins function in the presence of a locally disordered lipid state.",

Here we describe how paracetamol augments the effects of DAC on cancer cell proliferation and differentiation, without enhancing DNA damage. Firstly, DAC specifically upregulates cyclooxygenase-2-prostaglandin E2 pathway, inadvertently increasing cancer cell survival, while the addition of paracetamol offsets this effect. Secondly, combined treatment leads to glutathione depletion and ROS accumulation with oxidative stress further enhanced by DAC suppressing anti-oxidant and thioredoxin responses. The benefits of combined treatment are demonstrated here in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and acute myeloid leukaemia cell lines, further corroborated in a HNSCC xenograft mouse model and through mining of publicly available DAC and paracetamol responses. In summary, the addition of paracetamol could allow for DAC dose reduction, widening its clinical usability and providing a strong rationale for consideration in cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Convergent evolution is observed broadly across the web of life, but the degree of evolutionary constraint during adaptation of core intracellular processes is not known. High constraint has been assumed for conserved processes, such as cell division and DNA repair, but reports of nimble evolutionary shifts in these processes have confounded this expectation. Whole genome duplication (WGD) necessitates the concerted adjustment of a wide range of fundamental intracellular functions but nevertheless has been repeatedly survived in all kingdoms. Given this repeated adaptation to WGD despite obvious intracellular challenges to core processes such as meiosis, we asked: how do lineages not only survive WGD, but sometimes ultimately thrive? Are the solutions employed constrained or diverse? Here we detect genes and processes under selection following WGD in the Cochlearia species complex by performing a scan for selective sweeps following WGD in a large-scale survey of 73 resequenced individuals from 23 populations across Europe. We then contrast our results from two independent WGDs in Arabidopsis arenosa and Cardamine amara. We find that while WGD does require the adaptation of particular functional processes in all three cases, the specific genes recruited to respond are highly flexible. We also observe evidence of varying degrees of convergence between different cases. Our results point to a polygenic basis for the distributed adaptive systems that control meiotic crossover number, ionomic rewiring, cell cycle control, and nuclear regulation. Given the sheer number of loci under selection post-WGD, we surmise that this polygenicity may explain the general lack of convergence between these species that are ~30 million years diverged. Based on our results, we speculate that adaptive processes themselves - such as the rate of generation of structural genomic variants--may be altered by WGD in nascent autopolyploids, contributing to the occasionally spectacular adaptability of autopolyploids observed across kingdoms.",

We have characterised the CPA locus from P. syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa). This locus has a modular structure with genes for both L- and D- rhamnose (Rha) biosynthesis and that of an unknown sugar. It also contains an operon coding for ABC transporter subunits, a bifunctional glycosyltransferase and an O-methyltransferase. This operon is predicted to have a role in transport, elongation and termination of the Rha backbone of the CPA oligosaccharide and is referred to as the TET operon. This is the first report of the identification of this operon in P. syringae. Two alleles of the TET operon were present amongst the different biovars of Psa and lineages of the closely related pathovar P. syringae pv. actinidifoliorum. This allelic variation was reflected in the electrophoretic properties of purified LPS from the different isolates. Gene knockout of the TET operon allele from biovar 1 and replacement with that from biovar 3, demonstrated the link between the genetic locus and the electrophoretic and immunogenic properties of the LPS molecules in Psa. Sequence analysis of the TET operon from a wide range of P. syringae and P. viridiflava isolates displayed a phylogenetic history which is incongruent with core gene phylogeny, but correlates with previously reported tailocin sensitivity, suggesting a functional relationship between LPS structure and tailocin susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Transcription is the process that allows the simultaneous folding of RNA molecules, known as co-transcriptional folding. This folding determines the functional properties of RNA molecules and possibly having a critical role during the synthesis as well. This functioning includes the characterized properties of riboswitches and ribozymes as well, which is significant when the transcription rate is comparable to the cellular environment. This study aims to discover a novel non-coding region that is important in the genetic expression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In this work, we identified a novel non-coding element of polyphosphate glucokinase (ppgk) gene that undergoes cleavage activity during the transcriptional process in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We revealed that cleavage occurs within the nascent RNA, and the resultant cleaved 3RNA fragment carries the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and expression platform. Site-specific mutations provide a strong correlation between the disruption of cleavage activity and expression of ppgk gene. We concluded that co-transcriptional processing at the noncoding region as the required mechanism for ppgk expression that remains constitutive within the bacterial environment. The underlying reason for ppgk mRNA processing and expression is correlated because the non-coding counterpart adopts a hairpin domain that sequesters ribosomal binding site. Thus, the mRNA processing at the immediate upstream of Shine-Dalgarno sequence is required to prevent this sequestration and subsequent expression as well. This study defines the molecular mechanism that is dependent on the transient but highly active structural features of the nascent RNA.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromin gene (NF1) mutation causes Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a disorder in which brain white matter deficits identified by neuroimaging are common, yet of unknown cellular etiology. In mice, Nf1 loss in adult oligodendrocyte causes myelin decompaction, and increases oligodendrocyte nitric oxide (NO) levels. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors rescue this pathology. Whether oligodendrocyte pathology is sufficient to affect brainwide structure and account for NF1 imaging findings is unknown. Here, we show that Nf1 gene inactivation in adult oligodendrocytes (Plp-Nf1fl/+ mice) results in a motor coordination deficit. Magnetic resonance imaging in awake mice shows that fractional anisotropy is reduced in Plp-Nf1fl/+ corpus callosum and that interhemispheric functional connectivity in motor cortex is also reduced, consistent with disrupted myelin integrity. Further, NOS-specific inhibition rescued both measures. These results demonstrate that oligodendrocyte defects account for aspects of brain dysfunction in NF1, which can be identified by neuroimaging and ameliorated by NOS inhibition.\n\nSignificance statementThis study assesses the effects of myelin decompaction on motor behavior and brain-wide structural and functional connectivity, and the effect of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition by N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) on these imaging measures. We report that inducible oligodendrocyte-specific inactivation of the Nf1 gene, which causes myelin decompaction, results in reduced motor coordination. Using diffusion-based MRI we show reduced myelin integrity and using functional MRI we show reduced functional connectivity in awake passive mice. L-NAME administration results in rescue of the pathology at the mesoscopic level using imaging procedures that can be directly applied to humans to study treatment efficacy in clinical trials.",

Here we investigated the effects of genetically reducing insulin production on uncoupling and oxidative mitochondrial proteins in liver, skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue (WAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT). Male Ins1+/+ or Ins1+/- littermates were fed either a low-fat diet (LFD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks, starting at 8 weeks of age. Replicating our previous observations, HFD increased fasting hyperinsulinemia, and Ins1+/- mice had significantly lower circulating insulin compared with Ins1+/+ littermates. Fasting glucose and body weight were not different between genotypes. We did not observe significant differences in liver in skeletal muscle. In mesenteric WAT, Ins1+/- mice had reduced Ndufb8 and Sdhb. Ucp1 was increased in the context of the HFD, and HFD alone had a dramatic inhibitory effect on Pparg abundance. In inguinal WAT, Ins1+/- mice exhibited significant increases in oxidative complex proteins, independent of diet, without affecting Ucp1, Pparg, or Prdm16:Pparg association. In BAT, lowered insulin increased Sdhb protein levels that had been reduced by HFD. Ucp1 protein, Prdm16:Pparg association, and Sirt3 abundance were all increased in the absence of diet-induced hyperinsulinemia. Our data show that reducing insulin upregulates oxidative proteins in inguinal WAT without affecting Ucp1, while in mesenteric WAT and BAT, reducing insulin upregulates Ucp1 in the context of HFD. Preventing hyperinsulinemia has early depot-specific effects on adipose tissue metabolism and help explain the increased energy expenditure previously reported in Ins1+/- mice.",

    "abstract": "Genome editing by RNA-guided nucleases, such as SpCas9, has been used in numerous different plant species. However, to what extent multiple independent loci can be targeted simultaneously by multiplexing has not been well-documented. Here, we developed a toolkit, based on a highly intron-optimized zCas9i gene, which allows assembly of nuclease constructs expressing up to 32 sgRNAs. We used this toolkit to explore the limits of multiplexing in two major model species, and report on isolation of transgene-free octuple Nicotiana benthamiana and duodecuple (12x) Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines in a single generation (T1 and T2, respectively). We developed novel counter-selection markers for N. benthamiana, most importantly Sl-FAST2, comparable to the well-established Arabidopsis seed fluorescence marker, and FCY-UPP, based on production of toxic 5-fluorouracyl in presence of a precursor. Targeting eight genes with an array of nine different sgRNAs and relying on FCY-UPP for selection of non-transgenic T1, we identified N. benthamiana mutant lines with astonishingly high efficiencies: All analyzed plants carried mutations in all genes (~112/116 target sites edited). Furthermore, we targeted 12 genes by an array of 24 sgRNAs in A. thaliana. Efficiency was significantly lower in A. thaliana, and our results indicate Cas9 availability is the limiting factor in such higher order multiplexing applications. We identify a duodecuple mutant line by a combination of phenotypic screening and amplicon sequencing. The resources and results presented provide new perspectives for how multiplexing can be used to generate complex genotypes or to functionally interrogate groups of candidate genes.",

    "abstract": "Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) emerged in 2014 as an important pathogen linked to severe lower respiratory disease and acute flaccid myelitis outbreaks. Historically associated with mild common-cold-like symptoms, clusters of severe disease attributed to EV-D68 appeared during a series of outbreaks in 2014, 2016, and 2018. Previous studies of historic EV-D68 strains demonstrated attenuated replication at temperatures of the lower respiratory tract (37{degrees}C), when compared to the upper respiratory tract (32{degrees}C). By testing a panel of historic and contemporary EV-D68 strains at 32{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C, we demonstrate that contemporary strains of EV-D68 undergo little to no attenuation at increased temperatures. Contemporary strains produced higher levels of viral proteins at 32{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C than historic strains, although both strains infected similar numbers of cells and had comparable amounts of replication complexes. IRES activity assays with dual-luciferase reporter plasmids demonstrated enhanced translation in recent EV-D68 strains mapped to regions of variability in the 5 UTR found only in contemporary strains. Using an infectious clone system, we demonstrate that the translation advantage dictated by the 5 UTR does not solely mediate temperature sensitivity. The strain-dependent effects of temperature on the EV-D68 life cycle gives insight into the susceptibility of the lower respiratory system to contemporary strains.\n\nIMPORTANCEEnterovirus-D68 (EV-D68) emerged in 2014 as a causative agent of biannual severe pediatric respiratory disease and acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). We show that recent EV-D68 viruses have gained the ability to replicate at 37{degrees}C. Enhanced virus protein translation seemed to correlate with enhanced virus replication at 37{degrees}C but other genetic factors are also contributing to this phenotype. An enhanced ability to replicate at core body temperature may have allowed EV-D68 to penetrate both lower in the respiratory tract and into the central nervous system, explaining the recent surge in severe disease associated with virus infection.",

    "abstract": "We have made insertion mutants in 9 of HXB2 gp41 and observed similar phenotypes like recent JRFL mutants: insertion of alanine (653+A), but not glutamine (653+Q), severely attenuated membrane fusion. To understand the underlying mechanism, we performed the fusion inhibition assay by corresponding mutant C34 peptides. Both mutant C34 peptides added at the beginning of the coculture of the effector and target cells showed less efficient inhibition of membrane fusion, which was similar to wildtype C34 added after 30 min of coculture, indicating slow association of mutant C34 peptides with the N-terminal heptad region of gp41. Due to uninterpretable CD profiles of C34 and N36, we tested the longer peptide pairs (N46 and C42) and observed CD profiles indicative of weak -helix formation. The melting temperatures for N46-C42 pairs of 653+A, 653+Q, and wild type were 56.8 {degrees}C, 59.8{degrees}C, and 96{degrees}C, respectively. Taken together, our data suggested that the phenotypic difference in membrane fusion between 653+A and 653+Q (or wild type) was not based on the stability of the six-helix bundle (6HB), but due to differences in the kinetics of 6HB formation. Further, we examined additional insertions (E, R, I, and L) at position 653, for which only I and L showed fusion recovery similar to Q, suggesting that the polar nature of glutamine was not a phenotypic determinant.",

    "abstract": "The ability to selectively propagate specific cells is fundamentally important to the development of clonal cell populations. Current methods rely on techniques such as limiting dilution, colony picking, and flow cytometry to transfer single cells into single wells, resulting in workflows that are low-throughput, slowed by propagation kinetics, and susceptible to contamination. Here, we developed a method, called selective laser gelation (SLG), to micropattern hydrogels in cell culture media in order to encapsulate specific cells to selectively arrest their growth. This process relies on the inverse gelation of methylcellulose, which forms a hydrogel when heated rather than cooled. Local heating using an infrared laser enables hydrogel micropatterning, while phase transition hysteresis retains the hydrogel after laser excitation. As a demonstration, we used this approach to selectively propagate transgenic CHO cells with increased antibody productivity. More generally, hydrogel micropatterning provides a simple and non-contact method to selective propagation of cells based on features identified by imaging.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryInverse gelation of methylcellulose enables hydrogel micropatterning to selectively propagate cells identified by microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Identification and study of human-essential genes has become of practical importance with the realization that disruption or loss of nearby essential genes can introduce latent-vulnerabilities to cancer cells. Essential genes have been studied by copy-number-variants and deletion events, which are associated with introns. The premise of our work is that introns of essential genes have characteristic properties that are distinct from the introns of nonessential genes. We provide support for the existence of characteristic properties by training a deep learning model on introns of essential and nonessential genes and demonstrated that introns alone can be used to classify essential and nonessential genes with high accuracy (AUC of 0.846). We further demonstrated that the accuracy of the same deep-learning model limited to first introns will perform at an increased level, thereby demonstrating the critical importance of introns and particularly first introns in gene essentiality. Using a computational approach, we identified several novel properties of introns of essential genes, finding that their structure protects against deletion and intron-loss events, and that these traits are especially centered on the first intron. We showed that GC density is increased in the first introns of essential genes, allowing for increased enhancer activity, protection against deletions, and improved splice-site recognition. Furthermore, we found that first introns of essential genes are of remarkably smaller size than their nonessential counterparts, and to protect against common 3 end deletion events, essential genes carry an increased number of (smaller) introns. To demonstrate the importance of the seven features we identified, we trained a feature-based model using only information from these features and achieved high accuracy (AUC of 0.787).",

    "abstract": "The remarkable plasticity of Schwann cells (SCs) enables the acquisition of repair-specific functions essential for peripheral nerve regeneration. We hypothesized that this plastic potential is manifested in stromal SCs found within mostly benign-behaving peripheral neuroblastic tumors. To shed light on the cellular state and impact of stromal SCs, we combined transcriptome and proteome profiling of human ganglioneuromas and neuroblastomas, rich and poor in SC-stroma, respectively, as well as human injured nerve explants, rich in repair SCs. The results revealed a nerve repair-characteristic gene expression signature of stromal SCs. In turn, primary repair SCs had a pro-differentiating and anti-proliferative effect on aggressive neuroblastoma cell lines after direct and trans-well co-culture. Within the pool of secreted stromal/repair SC factors, we identified EGFL8, a matricellular protein with so far undescribed function, to induce neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cell lines. This study indicates that human SCs undergo a similar adaptive response in two patho-physiologically distinct situations, peripheral nerve injury and tumor development. This response is mediated by EGFL8 and other SC derived factors, which might be of therapeutic value for neuroblastic tumors and nerve regeneration.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/019422v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14cb89forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ecd06aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@66f08corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3a9962_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG In order to investigate the nature of stromal Schwann cells in benign peripheral neuroblastic tumors (ganglioneuromas), we compared the cellular state of stromal Schwann cells with repair-associated Schwann cells emerging in peripheral nerves after injury.\n\nO_LIStromal Schwann cells in ganglioneuromas and repair Schwann cells in injured nerves share the expression of nerve repair-associated genes.\nC_LIO_LINeuroblastoma cell lines, derived from high-risk metastatic peripheral neuroblastic tumors (neuroblastomas), respond to primary repair Schwann cells and their secretome with increased neuronal differentiation and reduced proliferation.\nC_LIO_LIStromal and repair Schwann cells express the matricellular protein EGFL8, which is capable to induce neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cell lines in recombinant form.\nC_LI\n\nTHE PAPER EXPLAINEDO_ST_ABSProblemC_ST_ABSIn response to peripheral nerve damage, Schwann cells (SCs) are able to transform into specialized repair cells essential for nerve cell regeneration. Our previous studies indicated that this reactive/adaptive potential of human SCs is not restricted to injured nerve cells but also emerges in response to peripheral neuroblastic tumor cells. The usually benign subtypes of peripheral neuroblastic tumors, i.e. ganglioneuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas, contain neuronal differentiating tumor cells and are pervaded by various portions of stromal SCs. Of note, the amount of stromal SCs correlates with a favorable tumor behavior and increased patient survival, whereas aggressive subtypes of peripheral neuroblastic tumors, i.e. neuroblastomas, usually lack stromal SCs and have bad prognosis. This enigma prompted us to investigate the molecular wiring and functional state of stromal SCs versus injury-associated repair SCs and how SC signals could be leveraged as therapeutics.\n\nResultOur study revealed that the cellular state of stromal SCs in ganglioneuromas is in many aspects very similar to human repair SCs in injured nerves as both, stromal SCs and repair SCs, are equipped with distinct nerve repair-associated functions. Hence, we exposed different cell lines, derived from high-risk metastatic neuroblastomas, to primary repair SCs or their secretome. The results demonstrated that repair SCs had a pro-differentiating and anti-proliferative effect of on neuroblastoma cell lines upon direct and/or indirect contact. Searching for secreted anti-tumor factors by transcriptome and proteome analyses identified that the matricellular protein EGFL8 was highly expressed in injured nerves and ganglioneuromas. EGFL8 gene expression in peripheral neuroblastic tumors further correlated with increased patient survival. Indeed, treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with recombinant EGFL8 promoted neuronal differentiation and present EGFL8 as a novel neuritogen.\n\nImpactThese findings demonstrate that stromal SCs are equipped with the tools to exert nerve repair-associated functions on peripheral neuroblastic tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. We further show that the pool of secreted stromal/repair SC molecules contains yet uncharacterized factors with a therapeutic potential for aggressive neuroblastomas. We conclude that the inherent plasticity (reactive/adaptive potential) of SCs is responsible for the development of usually benign ganglioneuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas and, thus, is of utmost interest to be exploited in future treatment approaches for aggressive neuroblastoma subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Staufen1 (STAU1) is an RNA-binding protein involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of mRNAs. We report that a large fraction of STAU1 localizes to the mitotic spindle in the colorectal cancer HCT116 and in the non-transformed hTERT-RPE1 cells. Spindle-associated STAU1 partly co-localizes with ribosomes and active sites of translation. We mapped the molecular determinant required for STAU1/spindle association within the first 88 N-terminal amino acids, a domain that is not required for RNA binding. Interestingly, transcriptomic analysis of purified mitotic spindles reveals that 1054 mRNAs as well as the precursor ribosomal RNA and lncRNAs and snoRNAs involved in ribonucleoprotein assembly and processing are enriched on spindles compared to cell extracts. STAU1 knockout causes the displacement of the pre-rRNA and of 154 mRNAs coding for proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and cell growth, highlighting a role for STAU1 in mRNA trafficking to spindle. These data demonstrate that STAU1 controls the localization of sub-populations of RNAs during mitosis and suggests a novel role of STAU1 in pre-rRNA maintenance during mitosis, ribogenesis and/or nucleoli reassembly.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTProper localization and functions of macromolecules during cell division are crucial to ensure survival and proliferation of daughter cells.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of highly sensitive DNA sequencing techniques has detected large numbers of missense mutations of genes, including NOTCH1 and 2, in ageing normal tissues. Driver mutations persist and propagate in the tissue through a selective advantage over both wild-type cells and alternative mutations. This process of selection can be considered as a large scale, in vivo screen for mutations that increase clone fitness. It follows that the specific missense mutations that are observed in individual genes may offer us insights into the structure-function relationships. Here we show that the positively selected missense mutations in NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 in human oesophageal epithelium cause inactivation predominantly through protein misfolding. Once these mutations are excluded, we further find statistically significant evidence for selection at the ligand binding interface and calcium binding sites. In this, we observe stronger evidence of selection at the ligand interface on EGF12 over EGF11, suggesting that in this tissue EGF12 may play a more important role in ligand interaction. Finally, we show how a mutation hotspot in the NOTCH1 transmembrane helix arises through the intersection of both a high mutation rate and residue conservation. Together these insights offer a route to understanding the mechanism of protein function through in vivo mutant selection.",

To investigate the dispensability of FoxA factors for maintaining this regulatory network, we ablated all FoxA genes in the adult mouse liver. Remarkably, loss of FoxA caused rapid hepatocyte dedifferentiation manifested by a massive reduction in the expression of key liver genes. Interestingly, expression of these genes was reduced back to the low levels of the fetal prehepatic endoderm stage, leading to necrosis and lethality within days. Mechanistically, we found FoxA proteins to be required for maintaining enhancer activity, chromatin accessibility, nucleosome positioning and binding by HNF4. Thus, the FoxA factors act continuously, guarding hepatic enhancer activity throughout life.",

    "abstract": "Museum specimens are the main source of information on organisms\u2019 morphological features. Although access to this information was commonly limited to researchers able to visit collections, it is now becoming freely available thanks to the digitization of museum specimens. With these images, we will be able to collectively build large-scale morphological datasets, but these will only be useful if the limits to this approach are well-known. To establish these limits, we used two-dimensional images of plant specimens to test the precision and accuracy of image-based data and analyses.To test measurement precision and accuracy, we compared leaf measurements taken from specimens and images of the same specimens. Then we used legacy morphometric datasets to establish differences in the quality of datasets and multivariate analyses between specimens and images. To do so, we compared the multivariate space based on original legacy data to spaces built with datasets simulating image-based data.We found that trait measurements made from images are as precise as those obtained directly from specimens, but as traits diminish in size, the accuracy drops as well. This decrease in accuracy, however, has a very low impact on dataset and analysis quality. The main problem with image-based datasets comes from missing observations due to image resolution or organ overlapping. Missing data lowers the accuracy of datasets and multivariate analyses. Although the effect is not strong, this decrease in accuracy suggests caution is needed when designing morphological research that will rely on digitized specimens.As highlighted by images of plant specimens, 2D images are reliable measurement sources, even though resolution issues lower accuracy for small traits. At the same time, the impossibility of observing particular traits affects the quality of image-based datasets and, thus, of derived analyses. Despite these issues, gathering phenotypic data from two-dimensional images is valid and may support large-scale studies on the morphology and evolution of a wide diversity of organisms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Cohesion of biofilms made by Yersinia pestis and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb) has been attributed solely to an extracellular polysaccharide matrix encoded by the hms genes (Hms-ECM). However, mutations in the Yptb BarA/UvrY/CsrB regulatory cascade enhance biofilm stability without dramatically increasing Hms-ECM production. We found that treatment with proteinase K enzyme effectively destabilized Yptb csrB mutant biofilms, suggesting that cell-cell interactions might be mediated by protein adhesins or extracellular matrix proteins. We identified an uncharacterized trimeric autotransporter lipoprotein (YPTB2394), repressed by csrB, which has been referred to as YadE. Biofilms made by a {Delta}yadE mutant strain were extremely sensitive to mechanical disruption. Overexpression of yadE in wild-type Yptb increased biofilm cohesion, similar to biofilms made by csrB or uvrY mutants. We found that the Rcs signaling cascade, which represses Hms-ECM production, activated expression of yadE. The yadE gene appears to be functional in Yptb but is a pseudogene in modern Y. pestis strains. Expression of functional yadE in Y. pestis KIM6+ altered the production of Hms-ECM and weakened biofilms made by these bacteria. This suggests that although the YadE autotransporter protein increases Yptb biofilm stability, it may be incompatible with Hms-ECM production that is essential for Y. pestis biofilm production in fleas. Inactivation of yadE in Y. pestis may be another instance of selective gene loss in the evolution of flea-borne transmission by this species.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe evolution of Yersinia pestis from its Y. pseudotuberculosis (Yptb) ancestor involved gene acquisition and gene losses, leading to differences in biofilm production. Characterizing the unique biofilm features of both species may provide better understanding of how each adapts to its specific niches. This study identifies a trimeric autotransporter YadE that promotes biofilm stability of Yptb but which has been inactivated in Y. pestis, likely because it is not compatible with Hms polysaccharide that is crucial for biofilms inside fleas. We also reveal that the Rcs signaling cascade, which represses Hms expression in Y. pestis, activates YadE in Yptb. The ability of Yptb to use polysaccharide or YadE protein for cell-cell adhesion may help it produce biofilms in different environments.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio campbellii BB120 (previously classified as Vibrio harveyi) is a fundamental model strain for studying quorum sensing in vibrios. A phylogenetic evaluation of sequenced Vibrio strains in Genbank revealed that BB120 is closely related to the environmental isolate V. campbellii DS40M4. We exploited DS40M4s competence for exogenous DNA uptake to rapidly generate >30 isogenic strains with deletions of genes encoding BB120 quorum-sensing system homologs. Our results show that the quorum-sensing circuit of DS40M4 is distinct from BB120 in three ways: 1) DS40M4 does not produce an acyl homoserine lactone autoinducer but encodes an active orphan LuxN receptor, 2) the quorum regulatory small RNAs (Qrrs) are not solely regulated by autoinducer signaling through the response regulator LuxO, and 3) the DS40M4 quorum-sensing regulon is much smaller than BB120 (~100 genes vs ~400 genes, respectively). Using comparative genomics to expand our understanding of quorum-sensing circuit diversity, we observe that conservation of LuxM/LuxN proteins differs widely both between and within Vibrio species. These strains are also phenotypically distinct: DS40M4 exhibits stronger interbacterial cell killing, whereas BB120 forms more robust biofilms and is bioluminescent. These results underscore the need to examine wild isolates for a broader view of bacterial diversity in the marine ecosystem.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementWild bacterial isolates yield important information about traits that vary within species. Here, we compare environmental isolate Vibrio campbellii DS40M4 to its close relative, the model strain BB120 that has been a fundamental strain for studying quorum sensing for >30 years. We examine several phenotypes that define this species, including quorum sensing, bioluminescence, and biofilm formation. Importantly, DS40M4 is naturally transformable with exogenous DNA, which allows for the rapid generation of mutants in a laboratory setting. By exploiting natural transformation, we genetically dissected the functions of BB120 quorum-sensing system homologs in the DS40M4 strain, including two-component signaling systems, transcriptional regulators, and small RNAs.",

    "abstract": "Antiviral therapies are urgently needed to treat infections with flaviviruses such as Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) virus. Repurposing FDA-approved compounds could provide the fastest route to alleviate the burden of flaviviral diseases. In this study, three fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, difloxacin and ciprofloxacin, curtailed replication of flaviviruses ZIKV, DENV, Langat (LGTV) and Modoc (MODV) in HEK-293 cells at low micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition assays revealed that enoxacin suppressed ZIKV replication when added at 6 hours post-infection, suggesting inhibition of an intermediate step in the virus life cycle, whereas ciprofloxacin and difloxacin had a wider window of efficacy of 2, 6, and 8 hours post-infection for difloxacin and 2 to 8 hours post-infection for ciprofloxacin. The efficacy of enoxacin to suppress ZIKV replication in 5-week-old A129 mice was evaluated in two experiments. First, mice were infected with 1x105 plaque-forming units (pfu) ZIKV FSS13025 (n=20) or PBS (n=11) on day 0 and subsets were treated with enoxacin at 10mg/kg or 15mg/kg or diluent orally twice daily on days 1-5. Treated and control mice did not differ in weight change or virus titer in serum or brain. Mice treated with enoxacin showed a significant, 5-fold decrease in ZIKV titer in testes relative to controls. Second, mice were infected with 1x102 pfu ZIKV (n=13) or PBS (n=13) on day 0 and subsets were treated with 15mg/kg oral enoxacin or diluent twice daily on days 0 (pre-treatment) and 1-5. Mice treated with enoxacin showed a significant, 2.5-fold decrease in ZIKV titer in testes relative to controls, while weight and viral load in the serum, brain, and liver did not differ between treated and control mice. Enoxacin efficacy in cultured murine Sertoli cells was not enhanced compared to efficacy in HEK-293 cells. ZIKV can be sexually transmitted, so reduction of titer in the testes by enoxacin should be further investigated.\n\nAuthor SummaryFlaviviruses such as Zika and dengue virus pose a significant threat to public health worldwide, and there are currently no antiviral therapies to treat any flaviviral infection. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs as anti-flaviviral therapies can accelerate clinical use. We demonstrated that fluoroquinolone antibiotics exhibit anti-flaviviral efficacy, suppressing flavivirus replication in cultured human cells. Additionally, we found that the fluoroquinolone enoxacin suppressed Zika virus replication in mouse testes. While Zika virus is primarily transmitted via mosquitoes, the virus also undergoes sexual transmission. The importance of sexual transmission for the overall epidemiology of the virus remains unclear; nonetheless all routes of potential transmission to pregnant women are of concern as fetal infection in utero can have devastating effects. Thus, our data indicate that fluoroquinolones hold promise for treatment of flaviviral infections, particularly infection of the testes by Zika virus, and that this class of drugs warrants further study.",

    "abstract": "Mucus is a densely populated ecological niche that coats all epithelia, and plays a critical role in protecting the human body from infections. Although traditionally viewed as a physical barrier, emerging evidence suggests that mucus can directly suppress virulence traits in opportunistic pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the molecular mechanisms by which mucus affords this protection are unclear. Here, we show that mucins, and particularly their associated glycans, activate the sensor kinase RetS via its Dismed2 domain in P. aeruginosa. We find that this RetS-dependent signaling leads to the direct inhibition of the GacS-GacA two-component system, the activity of which is associated with a chronic infection state. This signaling includes the downregulation of the type VI secretion system (T6SS), and prevents T6SS-dependent bacterial killing by P. aeruginosa. Overall, these results shed light on how mucus impacts P. aeruginosa behavior in the human host, and may inspire novel approaches for controlling P. aeruginosa infections.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is increasingly recognized as a major cause of soft tissue and invasive diseases in the elderly and diabetic populations. Antibiotics like penicillin are used with great frequency to treat these infections, although antimicrobial resistance is increasing among GBS strains and underlines a need for alternative methods not reliant on traditional antibiotics. GBS hemolysin/cytolysin and granadaene pigment are two major linked virulence factors that contribute to GBS pathogenicity. Here we show that photobleaching of the antioxidant granadaene renders the pathogen more susceptible to killing by mouse macrophages and to hydrogen peroxide killing. Photo-treatment also leads to loss of activity of the linked hemolysin/cytolysin although photobleaching disproportionally affected the activity of the two factors. Treatment with light also affected GBS membrane permeability and contribute to increased susceptibility to the cell membrane active antibiotic daptomycin and to penicillin. Overall our study demonstrates a dual effect of photobleaching on the virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility of GBS and suggests a novel approach for the treatment of GBS infection. Our findings further provide new insight on the relationship between GBS hemolysin and the granadaene pigment.\n\nImportanceFor elderly individuals or those with chronic underlying conditions (such as diabetes), skin infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae represent a significant risk for the development of invasive disease. S. agalactiae strains are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. By utilizing blue light to neutralize the granadaene pigment present in S. agalactiae, this paper presents a non-invasive and non-antibiotic reliant process capable of reducing GBS virulence while increasing the antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterium. The differential effect of blue light on the linked GBS hemolysin/cytolysin and granadene pigment further provides new insight on the relationship between the two virulence factors. Overall photo-treatment represents a novel strategy for the treatment of S. agalactiae infections.",

    "abstract": "The bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri forms a mutually beneficial symbiosis with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, in which the bacteria, housed inside a specialized light organ, produce light used by the squid in its nocturnal activities. Upon hatching, E. scolopes juveniles acquire V. fischeri from the seawater through a complex process that requires, among other factors, chemotaxis by the bacteria along a gradient of N-acetylated sugars into the crypts of the light organ, the niche in which the bacteria reside. Once inside the light organ, V. fischeri transitions into a symbiotic, sessile state in which the quorum-signaling regulator LitR induces luminescence. In this work we show that expression of litR and luminescence are repressed by a homolog of the V. cholerae virulence factor TcpP, which we have named HbtR. Further, we demonstrate that LitR represses genes involved in motility and chemotaxis into the light organ and activates genes required for exopolysaccharide production.\n\nImportanceTcpP homologs are widespread throughout the Vibrio genus; however, the only protein in this family described thus far is a V. cholerae virulence regulator. Here we show that HbtR, the TcpP homolog in V. fischeri, has both a biological role and regulatory pathway completely unlike that in V. cholerae. Through its repression of the quorum-signaling regulator LitR, HbtR affects the expression of genes important for colonization of the E. scolopes light organ. While LitR becomes activated within the crypts, and upregulates luminescence and exopolysaccharide genes and downregulates chemotaxis and motility genes, it appears that HbtR, upon expulsion of V. fischeri cells into seawater, reverses this process to aid the switch from a symbiotic to a planktonic state. The possible importance of HbtR to the survival of V. fischeri outside of its animal host may have broader implications for the ways in which bacteria transition between often vastly different environmental niches.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial carboxyl-terminal processing proteases (CTPs) are widely conserved and have been linked to important processes including signal transduction, cell wall metabolism, and virulence. However, the features that target proteins for CTP-dependent cleavage are unclear. Studies of the Escherichia coli CTP Prc suggested that it cleaves proteins with non-polar and/or structurally unconstrained C-termini, but it is not clear if this applies broadly. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a divergent CTP, CtpA, which is required for virulence. CtpA works in complex with the outer membrane lipoprotein LbcA to degrade cell wall hydrolases. Here, we investigated if the C-termini of two non-homologous CtpA substrates are important for their degradation. We determined that these substrates have extended C-termini, compared to their closest E. coli homologs. Removing seven amino acids from these extensions was sufficient to inhibit their degradation by CtpA both in vivo and in vitro. Degradation of one truncated substrate was restored by adding the C-terminus from the other, but not by adding an unrelated sequence. However, modification of the C-terminus of non-substrates, by adding the C-terminal amino acids from a substrate, did not cause their degradation by CtpA. Therefore, the C-termini of CtpA substrates are required but not sufficient for degradation. Although C-terminal truncated substrates were not degraded, they still associated with the LbcA*CtpA complex in vivo. Therefore, degradation of a protein by CtpA requires a C-terminal-independent interaction with the LbcA*CtpA complex, followed by C-terminal-dependent degradation, perhaps because CtpA must initiate cleavage at a specific C-terminal site.\n\nIMPORTANCECarboxyl-terminal processing proteases (CTPs) are found in all three domains of life, but exactly how they work is poorly understood, including how they recognize substrates. Bacterial CTPs have been associated with virulence, including CtpA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which works in complex with the outer membrane lipoprotein LbcA to degrade potentially dangerous peptidoglycan hydrolases. We report an important advance by revealing that degradation by CtpA requires at least two separable phenomena, and that one of them depends on information encoded in the substrate C-terminus. A C-terminal-independent association with the LbcA*CtpA complex is followed by C-terminal-dependent cleavage by CtpA. Increased understanding of how CTPs target proteins is significant, due to their links to virulence, peptidoglycan remodeling, and other important processes.",

    "abstract": "The Sulfolobus Spindle-shaped Virus (SSV) system has become a model for studying thermophilic virus biology, including archaeal host-virus interactions and biogeography. Several factors make the SSV system amenable to studying archaeal genetic mechanisms (e.g., CRISPRs) as well as virus-host interactions in high temperature acidic environments. First, it has been shown that endemic populations of Sulfolobus, the reported SSV host, exhibit biogeographic structure. Second, the acidic (pH<4.5) high temperature (65-88{degrees}C) SSV habitats have low biodiversity, thus, diminishing opportunities for host switching. Third, SSVs and their hosts are readily cultured in liquid media and on gellan gum plates. Fourth, given the wide geographic separation between the various SSV-Sulfolobus habitats, the system is amenable for studying allopatric versus sympatric virus-host interactions. Previously, we reported that SSVs exhibit differential infectivity on allopatric and sympatric hosts. We also noticed a wide host range for virus strain SSV9 (a.k.a., SSVK1). For decades, SSVs have been described as \"non-lytic\" dsDNA viruses that infect species of the genus Sulfolobus and release virions via \"blebbing\" or \"budding\" as a preferred strategy over host lysis. Here, we show that SSVs infect more than one genus of the family Sulfolobaceae and, in allopatric hosts, SSV9 does not appear to release virions by blebbing. Instead, SSV9 appears to lyse all susceptible allopatric hosts tested, while exhibiting canonical non-lytic viral release via \"blebbing\" (historically reported for all other SSVs), on a single sympatric host. Lytic versus non-lytic virion release does not appear to be driven by multiplicity of infection (MOI). Greater relative stability of SSV9 compared to other SSVs (i.e., SSV1) in high temperature, low pH environments may contribute to higher transmission rates. However, neither higher transmission rate nor relative virulence in SSV9 infection drives replication profile (i.e., lytic versus non-lytic) in susceptible hosts. Although it is known that CRISPR-Cas systems offer protection against viral infection in prokaryotes, CRISPRS are not reported to be a determinant virus replication strategy. Thus, the genetic/molecular mechanisms underlying SSV9-induced lysis are unknown. These results suggest that there are unknown genetic elements, resulting from allopatric evolution, that drive virion release strategy in specific host strain-SSV strain pairings.",

Using high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of over 450,000 single nuclei in human, marmoset monkey, and mouse, we demonstrate a broadly conserved cellular makeup of this region, whose similarity mirrors evolutionary distance and is consistent between the transcriptome and epigenome. The core conserved molecular identity of neuronal and non-neuronal types allowed the generation of a cross-species consensus cell type classification and inference of conserved cell type properties across species. Despite overall conservation, many species specializations were apparent, including differences in cell type proportions, gene expression, DNA methylation, and chromatin state. Few cell type marker genes were conserved across species, providing a short list of candidate genes and regulatory mechanisms responsible for conserved features of homologous cell types, such as the GABAergic chandelier cells. This consensus transcriptomic classification allowed the Patch-seq identification of layer 5 (L5) corticospinal Betz cells in non-human primate and human and characterization of their highly specialized physiology and anatomy. These findings highlight the robust molecular underpinnings of cell type diversity in M1 across mammals and point to the genes and regulatory pathways responsible for the functional identity of cell types and their species-specific adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Under-sampling RNA molecules and low-coverage sequencing in some single cell sequencing technologies introduce zero counts (also known as drop-outs) into the expression matrices. This issue may complicate the processes of dimensionality reduction and clustering, often forcing distinct cell types to falsely resemble one another, while eliminating subtle, but important differences. Considering the wide range in drop-out rates from different sequencing technologies, it can also affect the analysis at the time of batch/sample alignment and other downstream analyses. Therefore, generating an additional harmonized gene expression matrix is important. To address this, we introduce two separate batch alignment methods: Combined Coverage Correction Alignment (CCCA) and Combined Principal Component Alignment (CPCA). The first method uses a coverage correction approach (analogous to imputation) in a combined or joint fashion between multiple samples for batch alignment, while also correcting for drop-outs in a harmonious way. The second method (CPCA) skips the coverage correction step and uses k nearest neighbors (KNN) for aligning the PCs from the nearest neighboring cells in multiple samples. Our results of nine scRNA-seq PBMC samples from different batches and technologies shows the effectiveness of both these methods. All of our algorithms are implemented in R, deposited into CRAN, and available in the iCellR package.",

    "abstract": "Population declines of the critically endangered Sociable Lapwing are probably due to high mortality along its migration routes or on its wintering grounds, both of which are very poorly known. We therefore undertook a long-term study of the species movements using satellite tagging, colour-ringing and targeted field surveys. We also compiled a database of historical and recent sightings of the species from published and unpublished sources. There were two migration flyways from the breeding grounds in Kazakhstan, along which birds used different staging strategies. A longer western route (c. 5200 km) takes birds west to southern Russia, then south through the Caucasus and the Levant to wintering areas in Saudi Arabia and eastern Sudan. A shorter eastern route (c. 2800 km) takes birds south to Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, then over the mountains of northern Afghanistan to wintering areas in Pakistan and north-western India. In spring, birds of the western flyway cut out the Caucasus by making a direct crossing of the Caspian Sea from Azerbaijan. The migration strategy is characterised by infrequent long-distance movements followed by often lengthy stopovers in a small number of staging areas that are used consistently across years, and by high individual and low between-individual consistency in patterns of movement, both spatially and temporally. At least four main autumn stopover areas and one additional spring stopover area were identified along the longer western route, but only one autumn and one spring staging area along the eastern route. There was no relationship between latitude or longitude of capture for tagging or colour ringing and the subsequent migration route used, and the same breeding colonies could contain breeding adults and produce chicks of both flyway populations, suggesting that no clear migratory divide exists within the breeding range. Sociable Lapwings spend around a third of the year on their breeding grounds, a third on their wintering grounds and a third moving between them. Birds were highly faithful to their passage and wintering sites, but showed low fidelity to breeding sites. The migration stopover areas and the wintering sites are usually located at the interface of agriculture, particularly irrigated cropland along rivers, and dry steppe-like or desert habitats. This species selects, and perhaps relies upon, agricultural habitats throughout its entire life cycle, and its heavy reliance on some of the worlds most anciently cultivated regions suggests that this synanthropic relationship may have evolved over many millennia. The recent emergence of irrigated cropfields in Arabia is likely to have allowed birds using the western route to winter well north of their previous wintering range and maybe to spread into new wintering areas along the coasts of the Arabian Gulf. The concentration of large numbers of birds at a small number of traditional but unprotected migration stopover areas offers the opportunity to quantify and monitor the global population size, for which we derive a tentative estimate of c. 24,000 individuals (95% CL: 13,700 - 55,560). However, it also makes the species particularly vulnerable to hunting and small-scale habitat change. Illegal hunting along the western flyway is identified as the most plausible driver of the species decline.",

    "abstract": "Current crop protection strategies against the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea rely on a combination of conventional fungicides and host genetic resistance. However, due to pathogen evolution and legislation in the use of fungicides, these strategies are not sufficient to protect plants against this pathogen. Defence elicitors can stimulate plant defence mechanisms through a phenomenon known as priming. Priming results in a faster and/or stronger expression of resistance upon pathogen recognition by the host. This work aims to study priming of a commercial formulation of the elicitor chitosan. Treatments with chitosan result in induced resistance in solanaceous and brassicaceous plants. In tomato plants, enhanced resistance has been linked with priming of callose deposition and accumulation of the plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA). Large-scale transcriptomic analysis revealed that chitosan primes gene expression at early time-points after infection. In addition, two novel tomato genes with a characteristic priming profile were identified, Avr9/Cf-9 rapidly-elicited protein 75 (ACRE75) and 180 (ACRE180). Transient and stable overexpression of ACRE75, ACRE180 and their Nicotiana benthamiana homologs, revealed that they are positive regulators of plant resistance against B. cinerea. This provides valuable information in the search for strategies to protect Solanaceae plants against B. cinerea.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), nearly all patients ultimately relapse and many become refractory to their previous therapies. Although many therapies exist with diverse mechanisms of action, it is not yet clear how the differences in MM biology across patients impacts the likelihood of success for existing therapies and those in the pipeline. Therefore, we not only need the ability to predict which patients are at high risk for disease progression, but also a means to understand the mechanisms underlying their risk. We hypothesized that knowledge of the biological networks that give rise to MM, specifically the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) and the mechanisms by which mutations impact gene regulation, would enable improved predictions of disease progression and actionable insights for treatment. Here we present a method to infer TRNs from multi-omics data and apply it to the generation of a MM TRN that links chromosomal abnormalities and somatic mutations to downstream effects on gene expression via perturbation of transcriptional regulators. We find that 141 genetic programs underlie the disease and that the activity profile of these programs fall into one of 25 distinct transcriptional states. These transcriptional signatures prove to be more predictive of outcomes than do mutations and reveal plausible mechanisms for relapse, including the establishment of an immuno-suppressive microenvironment. Moreover, we observe subtype-specific vulnerabilities to interventions with existing drugs and motivate the development of new targeted therapies that appear especially promising for relapsed refractory MM.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSMotivationC_ST_ABSThe majority of the previous methods for identifying cancer driver modules output non-overlapping modules. This assumption is biologically inaccurate as genes can participate in multiple molecular pathways. This is particularly true for cancer-associated genes as many of them are network hubs connecting functionally distinct set of genes. It is important to provide combinatorial optimization problem definitions modeling this biological phenomenon and to suggest efficient algorithms for its solution.\n\nResultsWe provide a formal definition of the Overlapping Driver Module Identification in Cancer (ODMIC) problem. We show that the problem is NP-hard. We propose a seed-and-extend based heuristic named DriveWays that identifies overlapping cancer driver modules from the graph built from the IntAct PPI network. DriveWays incorporates mutual exclusivity, coverage, and the network connectivity information of the genes.\n\nWe show that DriveWays outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in recovering well-known cancer driver genes performed on TCGA pan-cancer data. Additionally, DriveWayss output modules show a stronger enrichment for the reference pathways in almost all cases. Overall, we show that enabling modules to overlap improves the recovery of functional pathways filtered with known cancer drivers, which essentially constitute the reference set of cancer-related pathways.\n\nAvailabilityThe data, the source code, and useful scripts are available at: https://github.com/abu-compbio/DriveWays\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Biorxiv.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma is a highly plastic tumor characterized by dynamic interconversion of different cell identities depending on the biological context. For example, melanoma cells with high expression of the H3K4 demethylase KDM5B (JARID1B) rest in a slow-cycling, yet reversible persister state. Over time, KDM5Bhigh cells can promote rapid tumor repopulation with equilibrated KDM5B expression heterogeneity. The cellular identity of KDM5Bhigh persister cells has not been studied so far, missing an important cell state-directed treatment opportunity in melanoma. Here, we have established a doxycycline-titratable system for genetic induction of permanent intratumor expression of KDM5B and screened for chemical agents that phenocopy this effect. Transcriptional profiling and cell functional assays confirmed that the dihydropyridine phenoxyethyl 4-(2-fluorophenyl)-2,7,7-trimethyl-5-oxo-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexa-hydro-quinoline-3-carboxylate (termed Cpd1) supports high KDM5B expression and directs melanoma cells towards differentiation along the melanocytic lineage and to cell cycle-arrest. The high KDM5B state additionally prevents cell proliferation through negative regulation of cytokinetic abscission. Moreover, treatment with Cpd1 promoted the expression of the melanocyte-specific tyrosinase gene specifically sensitizing melanoma cells for the tyrosinase-processed antifolate prodrug 3-O-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)-(-)-epicatechin (TMECG). In summary, our study provides proof-of-concept for a new dual hit strategy in melanoma, in which persister state-directed transitioning limits tumor growth and plasticity and primes melanoma cells towards lineage-specific elimination.",

This study investigated whether inter-individual variability to tDCS was in-part genetically mediated. In sixty-one healthy males, anodal-tDCS (a-tDCS) and sham-tDCS were administered to the primary motor cortex at 1mA for 10-minutes via 6x4cm active and 7x5cm return electrodes. Twenty-five single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded to represent corticospinal excitability (CSE).\n\nTwenty-five paired-pulse MEPs were recorded with 3ms inter-stimulus interval (ISI) to assess intracortical inhibition (ICI) via short-interval intracranial inhibition (SICI) and 10ms ISI for intracortical facilitation (ICF). Saliva samples tested for specific genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding for excitatory and inhibitory neuroreceptors. Individuals were sub-grouped based on a pre-determined threshold and via statistical cluster analysis. Two distinct subgroups were identified, increases in CSE following a-tDCS (i.e. Responders) and no increase or even reductions in CSE (i.e. Non-responders). No changes in ICI or ICF were reported. No relationships were reported between genetic polymorphisms in excitatory receptor genes and a-tDCS responders. An association was reported between a-tDCS responders and GABRA3 gene polymorphisms encoding for GABA-A receptors suggesting potential relationships between GABA-A receptor variations and capacity to undergo tDCS-induced cortical plasticity. In the largest tDCS study of its kind, this study presents an important step forward in determining the contribution genetic factors play in previously observed inter-individual variability to tDCS.",

Evidence suggests that multiple control systems span the FPCN whose operations are poorly understood. Previously (Nee and DEsposito, 2016; 2017), we detailed frontal dynamics that support control processing, but left open their role in broader cortical function. Here, I show that the FPCN consists of an external/present-oriented to internal/future-oriented cortical gradient extending outwardly from sensory-motor cortices. Areas at the ends of this gradient act in a segregative manner, exciting areas at the same level, but suppressing areas at different levels. By contrast, areas in the middle of the gradient excite areas at all levels, promoting integration of control processing. Individual differences in integrative dynamics predict higher-level cognitive ability and amenability to neuromodulation. These data suggest that an intermediary zone within the FPCN underlies integrative processing that supports cognitive control.\n\nImpact StatementThis study shows that intermediary areas within the FPCN are critical for integrating control processing, cognitive ability, and amenability to neuromodulation.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown how MEG can reveal spatial patterns of functional connectivity using frequency-specific oscillatory coupling measures and that these may be modified in disease. However, there is a need to understand both how repeatable these patterns are across participants and how these measures relate to the moment-to-moment variability (or  irregularity) of neural activity seen in healthy brain function. In this study, we used Multi-scale Rank-Vector Entropy (MRVE) to calculate the dynamic timecourses of signal variability over a range of temporal scales. The correlation of MRVE timecourses was then used to detect functional connections in resting state MEG recordings that were robust over 183 participants and varied with temporal scale. We then compared these MRVE connectivity patterns to those derived using more standard amplitude-amplitude coupling measures, using methods designed to quantify the consistency of these patterns across participants.\n\nUsing oscillatory amplitude envelope correlation (AEC), the most consistent connectivity patterns, across the cohort, were seen in the alpha and beta frequency bands. At fine temporal scales (corresponding to  scale frequencies, fS = 30-150Hz), MRVE correlation detected mostly occipital and parietal connections and these showed high similarity with the networks identified by AEC in the alpha and beta frequency bands. The most consistent connectivity profiles between participants were given by MRVE correlation at fS = 75Hz and AEC in the beta band.\n\nIt was also found that average mid-to fine scale variability within each region (fS [~] 10-150Hz) negatively correlated with the regions overall connectivity strength with other brain areas, as measured by fine scale MRVE correlation (fS [~] 30-150Hz) and by alpha and beta band AEC. These findings suggest that local activity at frequencies fS {gtrsim} 10Hz becomes more regular when a region exhibits high levels of resting state connectivity.",

We also calculate the signal-to-noise ratio of USEA and iEMG recordings and quantify the stimulation amplitude necessary to evoke detectable sensory percepts. Furthermore, we quantify the consistency of the sensory modality, receptive field location, and receptive field size of USEA-evoked percepts.\n\nMain ResultsIn the most recent subject, involving USEAs with technical improvements, neural recordings persisted for 502 days (entire implant duration) and the number of functional recording electrodes for one USEA increased over time. However, for six out of seven USEAs the number of functional recording electrodes decreased within the first two months after implantation. The signal-to-noise ratio of neural recordings and electromyographic recordings stayed relatively consistent over time. Sensory percepts were consistently evoked over the span of 14 months, were not significantly different in size, and highlighted the nerves fascicular organization. The percentage of percepts with consistent modality or consistent receptive field location between sessions (~1 month apart) varied between 0-86.2% and 9.1-100%, respectively. Stimulation thresholds and electrode impedances increased initially but then remained relatively stable over time.\n\nSignificanceThis work demonstrates improved performance of USEAs, and provides a basis for comparing the longevity and stability of USEAs to that of other neural interfaces. Although USEAs provide a rich repertoire of neural recordings and sensory percepts, performance still generally declines over time. Future work should leverage the results presented here to further improve USEA design or to develop adaptive algorithms that can maintain a high level of performance.",

In this study, biosynthesis and chemical composition of cuticular wax in wild type (WT) bilberry fruit was studied during development and compared with its natural glossy type (GT) mutant. The cuticular wax load in GT fruit was comparable to WT fruit. In both fruits, triterpenoids were the dominant wax compounds with decreasing proportion during the fruit development accompanied with increasing proportion of aliphatic compounds. Gene expression studies supported the pattern of compound accumulation during fruit development. Genes CER26-like, FAR2, CER3-like, LTP, MIXTA, and BAS exhibited prevalent expression in fruit skin indicating role in cuticular wax biosynthesis and secretion. In GT fruit, higher proportion of triterpenoids in cuticular wax was accompanied by lower proportion of fatty acids and ketones compared to WT fruit as well as lower density of crystalloid structures on berry surface. Our results suggest that a marked reduction in ketones in cuticular wax may play a significant role in the formation of glossy phenotype leading to the loss of rod-like structures in epicuticular wax layer of GT fruit.\n\nHighlightChemical composition and morphology of cuticular wax along with gene expression for wax biosynthetic genes varied between glossy type mutant (GT) and wild type (WT) fruit.",

    "abstract": "Peritonitis is a leading cause of severe sepsis in surgical intensive care units, as over 70% of patients diagnosed with peritonitis develop septic shock. A critical role of the immune system is to return to homeostasis after combating infection. S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) is an antimicrobial, pro-inflammatory protein complex often used as a biomarker for diagnosis of disease activities in many inflammatory disorders. Here we describe the role of S100A8/A9 on inflammatory collateral tissue damage (ICTD).\n\nWe performed an in vivo Candida albicans disseminated peritonitis mouse model using WT and S100A9-deficient mice and stimulated primary macrophages with recombinant S100A8/A9 in the presence or absence of the compound paquinimod, a specific inhibitor of S100A9. In addition, the effects on ICTD and fungal clearance were investigated. S100A9-deficient mice developed less ICTD than wildtype mice. Restoration of S100A8/A9 in S100A9 knockout mice resulted in increased ICTD and fungal clearance comparable to wildtype levels. Treatment with paquinimod abolished ICTD.\n\nThe data indicated that S100A8/A9 controls ICTD levels and host antimicrobial modulation at a systemic level during intra-abdominal candidiasis (IAC).",

How each glycan unit interacts to shape the Env protein-sugar complex and affects Env function is not well understood. Here, high-resolution glycomics analysis of two Env variants from the same donor, with differing functional characteristics and N-glycosylation-site composition, revealed that changes to key N-glycosylation-site not only affected the Env structure at distant locations, but also had a ripple effect on Env-wide glycan processing, virus infectivity, and antibody recognition and virus neutralization. Specifically, the N262 glycan, although not located in the CD4-binding site, controlled Env binding to the CD4 receptor, affected the recognition of Env by several glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing antibodies, and altered heterogeneity of glycosylation at several sites, with N156, N160, and N448 displaying limited glycan processing. Molecular dynamic simulations visualized how specific oligosaccharide positions can move to compensate for loss of a glycan. This study demonstrates how changes in individual glycan units can alter molecular dynamics and processing of the Env-glycan shield and, consequently, Env function.",

    "abstract": "The development of new strategic therapies for multidrug-resistant bacteria, like the use of non-antimicrobial approaches and/or drugs repurposing to be used as monotherapies or in combination with clinically relevant antibiotics, has become an urgent need. A therapeutic alternative for infections by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) is immune system modulation to improve the infection clearance. We showed that immunocompetent mice infected by Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli in peritoneal sepsis models and treated with tamoxifen at 80 mg/kg/d for three days reduced the release of MCP-1 and its signalling pathway IL-18 and phosphorylated ERK1/2. This reduction of MCP-1 induced the reduction of migration of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils from bone marrow to blood. Indeed, the treatment with tamoxifen in murine peritoneal sepsis models reduced the bacterial load in tissues and blood; and increased the mice survival from 0% to 60-100%. Tamoxifen treatment of neutropenic mice infected by these pathogens increased mice survival up to 20-60%. Furthermore, susceptibility and time-kill assays showed that the metabolites of tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen, hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen, the three together exhibited MIC90 values of 16 mg/L and were bactericidal against clinical isolates of A. baumannii and E. coli. This antimicrobial activity of tamoxifen metabolites parallels an increased membrane permeability of A. baumannii and E. coli without affecting their outer membrane proteins profiles. Together, these data showed that tamoxifen present a therapeutic efficacy against MDR A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa and E. coli in experimental models of infections and can be repurposed as new treatment for GNB infections.\n\nImportanceAntimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) is a global health treat. Drug repurposing, a novel approach involving the search of new indications for FDA approved drugs is gaining interest. Among them, we found the anti-cancer drug tamoxifen, which presents very promising therapeutic efficacy. The current study showed that tamoxifen presents activity in animal models of infection with MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli by modulating the traffic of innate immune system cells and the antibacterial activity presented by its three major metabolites produced in vivo against these GNB. Our results offer a new candidate to be repurposed to treat severe infections caused by these pathogens.",

    "abstract": "N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E) plays a central role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by inducing apoptosis, angiogenesis and inflammation. It has been proposed that A2E effects are mediated at least partly via the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-. Here we show that A2E binds and transactivates not only RARs, but also peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). Norbixin, which protects retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells against apoptosis induced by combined blue light illumination and A2E exposure, is also a ligand of these nuclear receptors (NRs) but does not induce their transactivation. Norbixin inhibits RXRs and PPARs but enhances RARs transactivation induced by A2E. Norbixin also inhibits PPAR-{gamma} transactivation induced by its high affinity ligand troglitazone. Photoprotection of RPE cells by norbixin correlates with maintained levels of the antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) protein. Moreover, norbixin reduces protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, NF-{kappa}B and activator protein 1 (AP-1) transactivation, and the mRNA expression of the inflammatory interleukins (IL) 6 and 8 and of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that are enhanced by A2E. By contrast, norbixin increases matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) mRNA expression but has neither effect on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, nor on IL-18 mRNA expression in response to A2E. Altogether, we show for the first time that A2E deleterious biological effects appear to be mediated through RARs, PPARs and RXRs. Moreover, we report that the modulation of these NRs by norbixin may open new avenues for the treatment of AMD.",

We identified 368,145 unique combinations of peptide-HLA complexes (pMHCs) with a predicted binding affinity less than 500nM, and observed significant overlap between class I and II predicted pMHCs. Using simulated populations derived from worldwide HLA frequency data, we identified sets of epitopes predicted in at least 90% of the population in 57 countries. We also developed a method to prioritize pMHCs for specific populations.

    "abstract": "Novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic condition world-wide and has been declared as public health emergency of International concern by WHO in a very short span of time. The community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of China, Italy, Spain and USA among others. The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 with high antigenicity, safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants were utilized to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans. Various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental SARS-CoV-2 strain with high efficacy. The vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor TLR3 with high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity. Further, the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product. Thus, this present study provides an initial platform of the rapid generation of an efficacious protective vaccine for combating COVID-19.",

These post-translational modifications are pivotal to regulate gene expression, making BDs promising targets to treat several diseases. While the general structure of BDs is well known, their dynamical features and their interplay with other macromolecules are poorly understood, hampering the rational design of potent and selective inhibitors. Here we combine extensive molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state modeling and structural data to reveal a novel and transiently formed state that is conserved across all BD families. It involves the breaking of two backbone hydrogen bonds that anchor the ZA-loop with the A helix, opening a cryptic pocket that partially occludes the one associated with histone binding. Our results suggest that this novel state is an allosteric regulatory switch for BDs, potentially related to a recently unveiled BD-DNA binding mode.",

    "abstract": "One of the causal mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) is chromatin modification, and genes that regulate chromatin modify and control events regulating the formation of neural connections. AT-Rich Interactive Domain 1B (ARID1B), a chromatin modifier, has been shown to be reduced in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to affect rare and inherited genetic variation in a broad set of NDDs. For this work, a novel preclinical mouse model of Arid1b deficiency was created and molecularly validated to characterize and define neuroanatomical, behavioural and transcriptional phenotypes. Brains of adult Arid1b+/- mice had a smaller cerebellum along with a larger hippocampus and corpus callosum. In addition, a notable sex dependence was observed throughout development; males had an early emergence of the neuroanatomical phenotype around postnatal day 7, whereas females had a delayed emergence of the phenotype around postnatal day 40. Behavioural assays relevant to NDD were conducted during neonatal development and adulthood to evaluate general health, anxiety-like, motor, cognitive, and social behaviours in Arid1b+/- mice. During neonatal development, Arid1b+/- mice exhibited robust impairments in ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and metrics of developmental growth. As adults, Arid1b+/- mice showed low motor skills in open field exploration and normal three chambered approach. Arid1b+/- mice had learning and memory deficits in novel object recognition but surprisingly not in visual discrimination and reversal touchscreen tasks. Social interactions in the male-female social dyad with USVs revealed social deficits on some but not all parameters. No repetitive behaviours were observed. This study represents a full investigation of Arid1b+/- haploinsufficiency throughout development and highlights the importance of examining both sexes throughout development in NDDs.",

However, murine cell models suffer from technical and biological constraints. Human cell lines might be more useful, but they are much more biohazardous and are often poorly infectible. Here we describe the human clonal cell line hovS, which lacks the human PRNP gene and expresses instead the ovine PRNP VRQ allele. HovS cells were highly susceptible to the PG127 strain of sheep-derived murine prions, reaching up to 90% infected cells in any given culture, and were maintained in a continuous infected state for at least 14 passages. Infected hovS cells produced proteinase K-resistant prion protein (PrPSc), pelletable PrP aggregates and bona fide infectious prions capable of infecting further generations of naive hovS cells and mice expressing the VRQ allelic variant of ovine PrPC. Infection in hovS led to prominent cytopathic vacuolation akin to the spongiform changes observed in individuals suffering from prion diseases. In addition to expanding the toolbox for prion research to human experimental genetics, the hovS cell line provides a human-derived system that does not require human prions. Hence, the manipulation of scrapie-infected hovS cells may present fewer biosafety hazards than that of genuine human prions.",

    "abstract": "Death awareness influences multiple aspects of human lives, but its psychological constructs and underlying brain mechanisms remain unclear. We address these by measuring behavioral and brain responses to images of human skulls. We show that skulls relative to control stimuli delay responses to life-related words but speed responses to death-related words. Skulls compared to the control stimuli induce early deactivations in the posterior ventral temporal cortex followed by activations in the posterior and anterior ventral temporal cortices. The early and late neural modulations by perceived skulls respectively predict skull-induced changes of behavioral responses to life- and death-related words and the early neural modulation further predicts death anxiety. Our findings decompose skull-induced death awareness into two-stage neural processes of a lifeless state of a former life.\n\nOne sentence summaryBehavioral and brain imaging findings decompose skull-induced death awareness into two-stage neural processes of a lifeless state of a former life.",

    "abstract": "Linking plant phenotype to genotype, i.e., identifying genetic determinants of phenotypic traits, is a common goal of both plant breeders and geneticists. While the ever-growing genomic resources and rapid decrease of sequencing costs have led to enormous amounts of genomic data, collecting phenotypic data for large numbers of plants remains a bottleneck. Many phenotyping strategies rely on imaging plants, which makes it necessary to extract phenotypic measurements from these images rapidly and robustly. Common image segmentation tools for plant phenotyping mostly rely on color information, which is error-prone when either background or plant color deviate from the underlying expectations. We have developed a versatile, fully open-source pipeline to extract phenotypic measurements from plant images in an unsupervised manner. O_SCPLOWARAC_SCPLOWO_SCPLOWDEEPC_SCPLOWO_SCPLOWOPSISC_SCPLOW was built around the deep-learning model DeepLabV3+ that was re-trained for segmentation of Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes. It uses semantic segmentation to classify leaf tissue into up to three categories: healthy, anthocyanin-rich, and senescent. This makes O_SCPLOWARAC_SCPLOWO_SCPLOWDEEPC_SCPLOWO_SCPLOWOPSISC_SCPLOW particularly powerful at quantitative phenotyping from early to late developmental stages, of mutants with aberrant leaf color and/or phenotype, and of plants growing in stressful conditions where leaf color may deviate from green. Using our tool on a panel of 210 natural Arabidopsis accessions, we were able to not only accurately segment images of phenotypically diverse genotypes but also to map known loci related to anthocyanin production and early necrosis using the O_SCPLOWARAC_SCPLOWO_SCPLOWDEEPC_SCPLOWO_SCPLOWOPSISC_SCPLOW output in genome-wide association analyses. Our pipeline is able to handle images of diverse origins, image quality, and background composition, and could even accurately segment images of a distantly related Brassicaceae. Because it can be deployed on virtually any common operating system and is compatible with several high-performance computing environments, O_SCPLOWARAC_SCPLOWO_SCPLOWDEEPC_SCPLOWO_SCPLOWOPSISC_SCPLOW can be used independently of bioinformatics expertise and computing resources. O_SCPLOWARAC_SCPLOWO_SCPLOWDEEPC_SCPLOWO_SCPLOWOPSISC_SCPLOW is available at https://github.com/Gregor-Mendel-Institute/aradeepopsis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt has been well defined that tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) play critical roles in pancreatic cancer (PAAD) progression. The aim of this research was to comprehensively explore the composition of TIICs in PAAD and their potential clinical significance.\n\nMethods178 samples from TCGA and 63 samples from GSE57495 dataset were enrolled into our study. ImmuCellAI was applied to calculate the infiltrating abundance of 24 immune cell types in PAAD and further survival analysis revealed the prognostic values of TIICs in PAAD. Moreover, Gene ontology (GO) enticement analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between low- and high-risk groups was performed as well.\n\nResultsDifferent kinds of TIICs had distinct infiltrating features. Besides, Specific TIICs subsets had notable prognostic values in PAAD. We further established a 6-TIICs signature to assess the prognosis of PAAD patients. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses both suggested the significant prognostic value of the signature in PAAD. We next extracted 1,334 DEGs based on the risk model, and the hub modules in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs were involved in regulating immune-related biological processes.\n\nConclusionsOverall, the current study illuminated the immune cells infiltrating landscape in PAAD and developed a TIICs-dependent prognostic signature, which could be used as an effective prognostic classifier for PAAD patients.",

    "abstract": "Conjugation of RNAs with nanoparticles is of significant importance for its numerous applications in biology and medicine, which however remains challenging, especially for large ones. So far, the majority of RNA labeling rely on solid-phase chemical synthesis, which is generally limited to RNAs smaller than 100 nts. We here present an efficient and generally applicable labeling strategy for site-specific covalent conjugation of large RNAs with gold nanoparticle (AuNP) empowered by expanded genetic alphabet transcription. We synthesize an amine-derivatized TPT3 (TPT3A), which are site-specifically incorporated into a 97-nt 3SL RNA and a 719-nt mini genomic RNA (DENV-mini) from Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) by standard in vitro transcription with expanded genetic alphabet containing the A-T, G-C natural base pairs and the TPT3-NaM unnatural base pair. TPT3 modification cause minimal structural perturbations to the RNAs by small angle X-ray scattering. The purified TPT3A-modified RNAs are covalently conjugated with mono-Sulfo-NHS-Nanogold nanoparticles via the highly selective amine-NHS ester reaction and purified under non-denaturing conditions. We demonstrate the application of the AuNP-RNA conjugates in large RNA structural biology by an emerging molecular ruler, X-ray scattering interferometry (XSI). The inter-nanoparticle distance distributions in the 3SL and DENV-mini RNAs derived from XSI measurements support the hypothetical model of flavivirus genome circularization, thus validate the applicability of this novel labeling strategy. The presented strategy overcomes the size constraints in conventional RNA labeling strategies, and is expected to have wide applications in large RNA structural biology and RNA nanotechnology.\n\nSignificance StatementWe present a site-specific labeling strategy for large RNAs by T7 transcription with expanded genetic alphabet containing TPT3-NaM unnatural base pair. The applicability of this labeling strategy is validated by X-ray scattering interferometry measurements on a 97-nt and a 719-nt RNAs. This strategy can be applicable to natural RNAs or artificial RNA nanostructures with sizes from tens up to thousands of nucleotides, or covalent conjugation of RNAs with other metal nanoparticles. The usage of a far upstream forward primer during PCR enables easy purification of RNA from DNA templates, the non-denaturing conditions for conjugation reactions and purification avoids potential large RNA misfolding. This labeling strategy expands our capability to site-specifically conjugate RNA with nanoparticles for many applications.",

    "abstract": "During mitosis chromosomes reorganise into highly compact, rod-shaped forms, thought to consist of consecutive chromatin loops around a central protein scaffold. Condensin complexes are involved in chromatin compaction, but the contribution of other chromatin proteins, DNA sequence and histone modifications is less understood. A large region of fission yeast DNA inserted into a mouse chromosome was previously observed to adopt a mitotic organisation distinct from that of surrounding mouse DNA. Here we show that a similar distinct structure is common to a large subset of insertion events in both mouse and human cells and is coincident with the presence of high levels of heterochromatic H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). Hi-C and microscopy indicate that the heterochromatinised fission yeast DNA is organised into smaller chromatin loops than flanking euchromatic mouse chromatin. We conclude that heterochromatin alters chromatin loop size, thus contributing to the distinct appearance of heterochromatin on mitotic chromosomes, such as at centromeres.",

    "abstract": "Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques delivered to cortical motor areas have been shown previously to: modulate cortical motor excitability; entrain brain oscillations; and influence motor behavior; and have therefore attracted considerable interest as potential therapeutic approaches targeted for the treatment of movement disorders. However, these techniques are most often not suitable for treatment outside of the clinic, or for use with young children. We therefore investigated directly whether rhythmic pulses of median nerve stimulation (MNS) could be used to entrain brain oscillations linked to the suppression of movement. Using electroencephalography techniques together with concurrent MNS we demonstrate that 10 pulses of rhythmic MNS, delivered at 19Hz, is sufficient to entrain Beta-band brain oscillations within the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, whereas 10-pulse trains of arrhythmic MNS does not. This approach has potential in our view to be developed into a non-drug therapeutic device suitable for use outside of the research laboratory or the clinic with brain health conditions associated by excessive movements.",

We use PCA techniques in the space of codon bias indices (compAI, compAI_w, tAI, NC) and GC content to show that genes with similar patterns of codon usage feature have a significantly higher probability that their encoded proteins interact within the PPI. And vice-versa, we show that interacting in the PPI have a coherent codon usage.
