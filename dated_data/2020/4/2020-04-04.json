    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas genome editing technologies have revolutionized the fields of functional genetics and genome engineering, but with the recent discovery and optimization of RNA-targeting Cas ribonucleases, we may soon see a similar revolution in the study of RNA function and transcriptome engineering. However, to date, successful proof-of-principle for Cas ribonuclease RNA targeting in eukaryotic systems has been limited. Only recently has successful modification of RNA expression by a Cas ribonuclease been demonstrated in animal embryos. This previous work, however, did not evaluate endogenous expression of Cas ribonucleases and only focused on Cas ribonuclease function in early developmental stages. A more comprehensive evaluation of this technology is needed to assess its potential impact in the field. Here we report on our efforts to develop a programmable platform for RNA-targeting using a Cas ribonuclease, CasRx, in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. By genetically encoding CasRx in flies, we demonstrate moderate transcript targeting of known phenotypic genes in addition to unexpected toxicity and lethality. We also report on the off-target effects following on-target transcript cleavage by CasRx. Taken together, our results present the current state and limitations of a genetically encoded programmable RNA-targeting Cas system in Drosophila melanogaster, paving the way for future optimization of the system.",

    "abstract": "Sensors for detecting ultra-low concentrations are limited by the efficient transport of target molecules from large sample volumes to small detection regions. We here report a small-format digital DNA sensor in the shape of a microporous membrane that electrically detects DNA substrates with a concentration as low as 790 zM. This ultra-high sensitivity follows from optimising the mass transport of target DNA to specific receptors on the membrane across multiple spatial scales. mm-sized membranes support the rapid convection of a large sample volume to the detection zone; {micro}m-sized pores ensure that DNA diffusion to the surface-based receptors dominates over convective loss through the pores (low Peclet number), and; at the nm-scale, target-receptor binding dominates over diffusive transport (high Damkohler number). After their efficient capture, the DNA molecules are converted with high specificity into trans-membrane gold nanowires that are detected using a simple, high signal-to-noise, electrical resistance measurement. This sensor design is of interest for detecting low-abundant target molecules without the need for sample amplification or up-concentration, and the mass-transport strategy could be adapted to other surface-based sensing schemes.",

    "abstract": "Cell motility is essential in a variety of biological phenomena ranging from early development to organ homeostasis and diseases. This phenomenon was so far mainly studied and characterized on flat surfaces in vitro whereas this situation is rarely seen in vivo. Recently, cell motion in 3D microfabricated channels was reported to be possible, and it was shown that confined cells push on walls. However, rules setting cell directions in this context were not characterized yet. Here, we show by using assays that ratchetaxis operates in 3D ratchets on fibroblasts and on epithelial cancerous cells. Open ratchets rectify cell motion, whereas closed ratchets impose a direct cell migration along channels set by the cell orientation at the channel entry point. We also show that nuclei are pressed at constrictions zones through mechanisms involving dynamic asymmetries of focal contacts, stress fibers, and intermediate filaments. Interestingly, cells do not pass these constricting zones when defective in the keratin fusion implicated in squamous cancer. By combining ratchetaxis with chemical gradients, we finally report that cells are sensitive to local asymmetries in confinement and that topological and chemical cues may be encoded differently by cells. Altogether our ratchet channels could mimic small blood vessels where cells are confined: cells would probe local asymmetries which would determine their entry into tissues and direction. Our results could shed light on invasions mechanisms in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Far-red light (FRL) Photosystem II (PSII) isolated from Chroococcidiopsis thermalis is studied using parallel analyses of low-temperature absorption, circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopies in conjunction with fluorescence measurements. This extends earlier studies (Nurnberg et al 2018 Science 360 (2018) 1210-1213). We confirm that the chlorophyll absorbing at 726 nm is the primary electron donor. At 1.8 K efficient photochemistry occurs when exciting at 726 nm and shorter wavelengths; but not at wavelengths longer than 726 nm. The 726 nm absorption peak exhibits a 21 {+/-} 4 cm-1 electrochromic shift due to formation of the semiquinone anion, QA*-. Modelling indicates that no other FRL pigment is located among the 6 central reaction center chlorins: PD1, PD2 ChlD1, ChlD2, PheoD1 and PheoD2. Two of these chlorins, ChlD1 and PD2, are located at a distance and orientation relative to QA*- so as to account for the observed electrochromic shift. Previously, ChlD1 was taken as the most likely candidate for the primary donor based on spectroscopy, sequence analysis and mechanistic arguments. Here, a more detailed comparison of the spectroscopic data with exciton modelling of the electrochromic pattern indicates that PD2 is at least as likely as ChlD1 to be responsible for the 726 nm absorption. The correspondence in sign and magnitude of the CD observed at 726 nm with that predicted from modelling favors PD2 as the primary donor. The pros and cons of PD2 vs ChlD1 as the location of the FRL-primary donor are discussed.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/021097v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@159ea46org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@23c04forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@126c235org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1982d58_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIPrimary Donor confirmed at 726 nm\nC_LIO_LIDetermination of far-red chl pigment Qy excitation positions, widths, CD and MCD amplitudes\nC_LIO_LIQuantification of electrochromic shifts and QA*- photoconversion yield\nC_LIO_LIElectrochromic shift consistent with primary donor at either ChlD1 or PD2\nC_LIO_LIThe CD amplitude favors the primary donor at PD2\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-associated death in men with therapy resistance acquisition to androgen deprivation treatment and metastasis progression. Understanding the mechanisms of tumor progression to metastatic stage is necessary for the design of therapeutic and prognostic schemes. The main objective of the current study is to determine, using transcriptomic and proteomic analyses on patient derived-xenograft models, whether differentially aggressive PCa tumors predispose their microenvironment (stroma) to a metastatic gene expression pattern, and how this information could be applied in prognostics. Transcriptomic profiling (RNA Sequencing) was performed on PCa PDX models representing different disease stages; BM18 (androgen dependent bone metastasis) and LAPC9 (androgen independent bone metastasis). Using organism-specific reference databases, the human-specific transcriptome, representing the tumor, was identified and separated from the mouse-specific transcriptome (representing the contributing stroma counterpart) from the same PDX tumor samples. To identify proteome changes in the tumor (human) versus the stroma (mouse), we performed human and mouse cell separation using the MACS mouse depletion sorting kit, and subjected protein lysates to quantitative TMT labeling and mass spectrometry. We show that tenascin C is one of the most abundant stromal genes in bone metastasis PCa PDXs, is modulated by androgen levels in vivo and is highly expressed in castration resistant LAPC9 PDX compared to castration sensitive BM18 PDX. Tissue microarray of primary PCa samples (N=210) was used to evaluate the potential of TNC to act as a metastasis prognosis marker. Low number of TNC-positive cells were associated with statistically significant clinical progression to local recurrence or metastasis, compared to high TNC-positive group. Our data showed that metastatic PCa PDXs that differ in androgen sensitivity trigger a differential stroma response suggesting that stroma was influenced by tumor cues. Selected stromal markers of osteoblastic PCa induced bone metastases, were induced in the microenvironment of the host organism in metastatic xenografts, although implanted in a non-bone site, indicating a conserved mechanism of tumor cells to induce a stromal pre-metastatic signature with high potential prognostic or diagnostic value.",

Tumor recurrence is a clinical expectation of this disease and usually occurs along the resection cavity wall. However, previous clinical observations have suggested that in cases of ischemia following surgery, tumors are more likely to recur distally. Through the use of a previously established mechanistic model of GBM, the Proliferation Invasion Hypoxia Necrosis Angiogenesis (PIHNA) model, we explore the phenotypic drivers of this observed behavior. We have extended the PIHNA model to include a new nutrient-based vascular efficiency term that encodes the ability of local vasculature to provide nutrients to the simulated tumor. The extended model suggests sensitivity to a hypoxic microenvironment and the inherent migration and proliferation rates of the tumor cells are key factors that drive distal recurrence.",

However, the dynamics and mechanisms of eDNA degradation are largely unknown, especially when considering different eDNA sources, e.g., cells and fragmental DNA. We experimentally evaluated the degradation rates of eDNA derived from multiple sources, including fragmental DNA, free cells, and inhabiting species. We conducted the experiment with pond and seawater to evaluate the differences between freshwater and marine habitats. We quantified the eDNA copies of free cells, fragmental DNA, and inhabiting species (Cyprinus carpio in the pond and Trachurus japonicus in the sea). Our results show that eDNA derived from both cells and fragmental DNA decreased exponentially in both the sea and pond samples. The degradation of eDNA from inhabiting species showed similar behavior to the cell-derived eDNA. We evaluated three degradation models with different assumptions and degradation steps and found that a simple exponential model is effective in most cases. Our findings on cell- and fragmental DNA-derived eDNA provide fundamental information about the eDNA degradation process and can be applied to elucidate eDNA behavior in natural environments.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic Leptospira spp. are the causative agents of the waterborne zoonotic disease leptospirosis. During infection, Leptospira are confronted with dramatic adverse environmental changes such as deadly reactive oxygen species (ROS). Withstanding ROS produced by the host innate immunity is an important strategy evolved by pathogenic Leptospira for persisting in and colonizing hosts. In L. interrogans, genes encoding defenses against ROS are repressed by the peroxide stress regulator, PerR. In this study, RNA sequencing was performed to characterize both the L. interrogans adaptive response to low and high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and the PerR regulon. We showed that Leptospira solicit three main peroxidase machineries (catalase, cytochrome C peroxidase and peroxiredoxin) and heme to detoxify oxidants produced during a peroxide stress. In addition, canonical molecular chaperones of the heat shock response and DNA repair proteins from the SOS response were required for Leptospira recovering from oxidative damages. Determining the PerR regulon allowed to identify the PerR-dependent mechanisms of the peroxide adaptive response and has revealed a PerR-independent regulatory network involving other transcriptional regulators, two-component systems and sigma factors as well as non-coding RNAs that putatively orchestrate, in concert with PerR, this adaptive response. In addition, we have identified other PerR-regulated genes encoding a TonB-dependent transport system, a lipoprotein (LipL48) and a two-component system (VicKR) involved in Leptospira tolerance to superoxide and that could represent the first defense mechanism against superoxide in L. interrogans, a bacterium lacking canonical superoxide dismutase. Our findings provide a comprehensive insight into the mechanisms required by pathogenic Leptospira to overcome infection-related oxidants during the arm race with a host. This will participate in framing future hypothesis-driven studies to identify and decipher novel virulence mechanisms in this life-threatening pathogen.\n\nAuthor summaryLeptospirosis is a zoonotic infectious disease responsible for over one million of severe cases and 60 000 fatalities annually worldwide. This neglected and emerging disease has a worldwide distribution, but it mostly affects populations from developing countries in sub-tropical areas. The causative agents of leptospirosis are pathogenic bacterial Leptospira spp. There is a considerable deficit in our knowledge of these atypical bacteria, including their virulence mechanisms. During infection, Leptospira are confronted with the deadly oxidants produced by the host tissues and immune response. Here, we have identified the cellular factors necessary for Leptospira to overcome the oxidative stress response. We found that Leptospira solicit peroxidases to detoxify oxidants as well as chaperones of the heat shock response and DNA repair proteins of the SOS response to recover from oxidative damage. Moreover, our study indicates that adaptation to oxidative stress is orchestrated by a regulatory network involving PerR and other transcriptional regulators, sigma factors, two component systems, and putative non-coding RNAs. These findings provide a comprehensive insight into the mechanisms required by pathogenic Leptospira to tolerate infection-related oxidants, helping identify novel virulence factors, developing new therapeutic targets and vaccines against leptospirosis.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to analyze in piglets the impact of weaning on the production of metabolites by gut bacteria and to determine whether early life environment influences the functional maturation of the gut microbiota. Fecal metabolome and microbiome were analyzed in piglets raised in two separate maternity farms and mixed at weaning. In piglets from both maternity farms, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and of the predicted function \"Fucose degradation\" decreased after weaning while the relative abundance of Ruminococcus 2 and of the predicted function \"Starch degradation\" increased. In piglets from the first maternity farm, the relative concentration of biogenic amines and the relative abundance of Escherichi-Shigella decreased after weaning while the relative concentration of short chain fatty acids and the relative abundance of Christensenellaceae R-7 group and Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 increased. These changes were not observed at weaning in piglets from the second maternity farm probably because they already had high relative concentration of short chain fatty acids and higher relative abundance of Christensenellaceae R-7 group and Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 during the suckling period. In conclusion, the functional maturation of the microbiota at weaning is highly dependent on the maternal environment in piglets.\n\nORIGINALITY - SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBacterial metabolites are key molecular intermediates between the gut microbiota and host cells. Our study in piglets reveals that the metabolic activity of the gut microbiota shifts at weaning, a key developmental period for intestinal and immune health. We also show that this functional maturation of the gut microbiota is strongly influenced by maternal environment. Thus, targeting early life environmental factors is a promising strategy to program health trough the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites at the suckling-to-weaning transition.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive brain/neural controlled robots are promising tools to improve autonomy and quality of life in severe paralysis, but require biosignal recordings, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG), from various sites distributed over the users head. This limits the applicability and practicality of noninvasive brain/neural robot control on an everyday basis. It would thus be very desirable to minimize the number of necessary recording sites paving the way for miniaturized, headset-like EEG/EOG systems that users with hemiplegia can mount by themselves. Here, we introduce a novel EEG/EOG brain/neural robot control strategy using only scalp electrodes placed near cortical sensorimotor areas. The strategy was tested across 16 healthy volunteers engaging in an EEG/EOG brain/neural control task. Classification accuracies were compared using scalp electrodes only vs. the conventional electrode placements across the scalp and face. To evaluate whether cranial muscle artifacts impede classification accuracy, participants were asked to chew during the task. We found that brain/neural classification accuracy was comparable and that chewing did not impact classification accuracies when using scalp electrodes only. Our results suggest that the proposed new strategy allows for reliable EEG/EOG-based brain/neural robot control, a critical prerequisite to broaden the use of noninvasive brain/neural assistive and rehabilitative technologies.",

    "abstract": "Ascending dopaminergic projections from neurons located in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) are key to the etiology, dysfunction, and control of motivation, learning, and addiction. Due to evolutionary conservation of this nucleus and the extensive use of mice as disease models, establishing an assay for VTA dopaminergic signalling in the mouse brain is crucial for the translational investigation of motivational control as well as of neuronal function phenotypes for diseases and interventions. In this article we use optogenetic stimulation directed at VTA dopaminergic neurons in combination with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), a method widely used in human deep brain imaging. We present a comprehensive assay producing the first whole-brain opto-fMRI map of dopaminergic activation in the mouse, and show that VTA dopaminergic system function is consistent with its structural VTA projections, diverging only in a few key aspects. While the activation map predominantly highlights target areas according to their relative projection densities (e.g. strong activation of the nucleus accumbens and low activation of the hippocampus), it also includes areas for which a structural connection is not well established (such as the dorsomedial striatum). We further detail the variability of the assay with regard to multiple experimental parameters, including stimulation protocol and implant position, and provide evidence-based recommendations for assay reuse, publishing both reference results and a reference analysis workflow implementation.",

    "abstract": "In each genome synonymous codons are used with different frequencies; this phenomenon is known as codon usage bias. The preferred codons tend to correspond to the most highly expressed tRNAs. It had been known that codon usage bias can influence the cellular fitness and that might be associated with the lifestyle of the organism. To test the impact of environments on genome evolution we studied the relationship between codon usage bias and the phenotypic traits of 615 prokaryotic organisms. Principal component analysis revealed that prokaryotes with a specific phenotypic characteristic and living in similar environmental conditions have similar codon preferences, accessed by the Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU), and a similar tRNA availability gauged by the tRNA gene copy number (tGCN). In addition, by measuring the average tRNA adaptation index (tAI) for each genome, we discovered that organisms able to live in multiple habitats, including facultative organisms, mesophiles and pathogenic bacteria, exhibit lower extents of translational efficiency, consistent with their need to adapt to different environments.\n\nThis is the first large-scale study that examines the role of translational efficiency in the environmental adaptation of prokaryotes. Our results show that synonymous codon choices might be under strong translational selection, adapting the codons to the tRNA pool to different extents depending on the organisms lifestyle needs.",

    "abstract": "Cellular identity is ultimately controlled by transcription factors (TFs), which bind to specific regulatory elements (REs) within the genome to regulate gene expression and cell fate changes. While recent advances in genome-wide epigenetic profiling techniques have significantly increased our understanding of which REs are utilized in which cell type, it remains largely unknown which TFs and cofactors interact with these REs to modulate gene expression. A major hurdle in dissecting the whole composition of a multi-protein complex formed at a specific RE is the shortage of appropriate techniques. We have developed a novel method termed TALE-mediated Isolation of Nuclear Chromatin (TINC). TINC utilizes epitope-tagged TALEs to isolate a specific genomic region from the mammalian genome and includes a nuclei isolation and chromatin enrichment step for increased specificity. Upon cross-linking of the cells and isolation of the chromatin, the target region is purified based on affinity purification of the TALE and associated nucleic acid and protein molecules can be subjected to further analyses. A key TF in the pluripotency network and therefore in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is NANOG. It is currently not fully understood how Nanog expression is regulated and consequently it remains unclear how the ESC state is maintained. Using TINC we dissected the protein complex formed at the Nanog promoter in mouse ESCs and identified many known and numerous novel factors.",

Here, in unprecedented spatial resolution, we analysed the socioeconomic determinants of influenza transmission in a European city. We combined geographical and epidemiological data with whole genome sequencing of influenza viruses at the scale of urban quarters and statistical blocks, the smallest geographic subdivisions within a city. We observed annually re-occurring geographic clusters of influenza incidences, mainly associated with net income, and independent of population density and living space. Vaccination against influenza was also mainly associated with household income and was linked to the likelihood of influenza-like illness within an urban quarter. Transmissions patterns within and between quarters were complex. High-resolution city-level epidemiological studies combined with social science surveys such as this will be essential for understanding seasonal and pandemic transmission chains and delivering tailored public health information and vaccination programs at the municipal level.",

Lack of suitable nanoscopic methods has hampered our ability to meet this challenge in an experimental manner. Here, we use for the first time the interplay between atomic force microscopy, steered molecular dynamics and functional assays to elucidate the complex ligand-binding mechanism of C5a with the human G protein-coupled C5a receptor (C5aR). We have identified two independent binding sites acting in concert where the N-terminal C5aR serves as kinetic trap and the transmembrane domain as functional site. Our results corroborate the two-site binding model and clearly identify a cooperative effect between two binding sites within the C5aR. We anticipate that our methodology could be used for development and design of new therapeutic agents to negatively modulate C5aR activity.",

Using synthetic templates, we demonstrate that our method can distinguish the most common epigenetic marks on DNA and RNA with high sensitivity, specificity and precision. We also developed a highly specific CRISPR-Cas enrichment strategy to target genomic regions in native DNA without amplification. We then used this method to enrich native DNA from E. coli and characterized the differential levels of adenine and cytosine base modifications together in molecules of up to 5 kb in length. Finally, we enriched the 5 UTR of FMR1 from cells derived from a Fragile X carrier and precisely measured the repeat expansion length and methylation status of each molecule. These results demonstrate that our platform can detect a variety of genetic, epigenetic and base modification changes concomitantly within the same single molecules.",

However, this could also index compulsive behaviour, and the increased whisker barbering seen in Grb10+/p mice has been suggested to be indicative of a trichotillomania-type behaviour. Here we test whether compulsive behaviour is a more general phenotype in Grb10+/p mice by examining marble burying. We also examined the mice for potentially confounding anxiety phenotypes using the elevated plus maze (EPM). Grb10+/p mice showed no difference from wild-type littermate controls on any measure in the marble burying test at any age. However, Grb10+/p mice were more willing to enter, spend time on, and head-dip on the open arm of the EPM than wild-type mice. These data suggest that Grb10+/p mice are not generally more compulsive, and that the enhanced allogrooming is probably indicative of altered social behaviour. Furthermore, the altered behaviours seen on the EPM adds to other published findings suggesting that Grb10 has a role in mediating risk-taking.",

High-resolution structures often fail to capture the coupling between proton and ligand binding, and conformational changes associated with transport. We combine HDX-MS with mutagenesis and MD simulations to dissect the molecular mechanism of the prototypical transporter XylE. We show that protonation of a conserved aspartate triggers conformational transition from outward-facing to inward-facing state. This transition only occurs in the presence of substrate xylose, while the inhibitor glucose locks the transporter in the outward-facing state. MD simulations corroborate the experiments by showing that only the combination of protonation and xylose binding, and not glucose, sets up the transporter for conformational switch. Overall, we demonstrate the unique ability of HDX-MS to distinguish between the conformational dynamics of inhibitor and substrate binding, and show that a specific allosteric coupling between substrate binding and protonation is a key step to initiate transport.",

Better understanding the neuronal underpinnings of such network alterations could offer mechanistic insight into AD progression. Here, we examined a mouse model (early-tauopathy 3xTgAD mice) recapitulating this early AD stage. We found resting functional connectivity loss within ventral networks, including the entorhinal cortex, aligning with the spatial distribution of tauopathy reported in humans. Unexpectedly, in contrast to decreased connectivity at rest, 3xTgAD mice show enhanced fMRI signal within several projection areas following optogenetic activation of the entorhinal cortex. We corroborate this finding by demonstrating neuronal facilitation within ventral networks and synaptic hyperexcitability in projection targets. 3xTgAD mice thus reveal a dichotomic hypo-connected resting/hyper-responsive active phenotype. The strong homotopy between the areas affected supports the translatability of this pathophysiological model to tau-related deficits in humans.",

However, the unpredictable efficiency of CRISPR gRNA (CrRNA) activity is a limiting factor. Here we describe how to resolve this by prescreening CrRNAs for high activity in vivo, using a simple standardised assay based on restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP). We targeted 350 genomic sites with synthetic RNA Oligo guide RNAs (sCrRNAs) in zebrafish embryos and found that almost half exhibited > 90% efficiency in our RFLP assay. Having the ability to preselect highly active sCrRNAs (haCRs), we carried out a focussed phenotypic screen of 30 macrophage-related genes in spinal cord regeneration and found 10 genes whose disruption impaired axonal regeneration. Four (tgfb1a, tgfb3, tnfa, sparc) out of 5 stable mutants subsequently analysed retained the acute haCR phenotype, validating the efficiency of this approach. Mechanistically, lack of tgfb1a leads to a prolonged immune response after injury, which inhibits regeneration. Our rapid and scalable screening approach has identified functional regulators of spinal cord regeneration, and can be applied to study any biological function of interest.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS- Synthetic CRISPR gRNAs are highly active\n- in vivo pre-screening allows rapid assessment of CRISPR gRNA activity\n- Phenotypic CRISPR screen reveals crucial genes for spinal cord regeneration\n- tgfb1a promotes spinal regeneration by controlling inflammation",

    "abstract": "A region within songbird cortex, AId (dorsal intermediate arcopallium), is functionally analogous to motor cortex in mammals and has been implicated in vocal learning during development. AId thus serves as a powerful model for investigating motor cortical contributions to developmental skill learning. We made extracellular recordings in AId of freely behaving juvenile zebra finches and evaluated neural activity during diverse motor behaviors throughout entire recording sessions, including song production as well as hopping, pecking, preening, fluff-ups, beak interactions with cage objects, scratching, and stretching. A large population of single neurons showed significant modulation of activity during singing relative to quiescence. In addition, AId neurons demonstrated heterogeneous response patterns that were evoked during multiple movements, with single neurons often demonstrating excitation during one movement type and suppression during another. Lesions of AId do not disrupt vocal motor output or impair generic movements, suggesting that the responses observed during active behavior do not reflect direct motor drive. Consistent with this idea, we found that some AId neurons showed differential activity during pecking movements depending on the context in which pecks occurred, suggesting that AId circuitry encodes diverse inputs beyond generic motor parameters. Moreover, we found evidence of neurons that did not respond during discrete movements but were nonetheless modulated during active behavioral states compared to quiescence. Taken together, our results support the idea that AId neurons are involved in sensorimotor integration of external sensory inputs and/or internal feedback cues to help modulate goal-directed behaviors.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMotor cortex across taxa receives highly integrated, multi-modal information and has been implicated in both execution and acquisition of complex motor skills, yet studies of motor cortex typically employ restricted behavioral paradigms that target select movement parameters, preventing wider assessment of the diverse sensorimotor factors that can affect motor cortical activity. Recording in AId of freely behaving juvenile songbirds that are actively engaged in sensorimotor learning offers unique advantages for elucidating the functional role of motor cortical neurons. The results demonstrate that a diverse array of factors modulate motor cortical activity and lay important groundwork for future investigations of how multi-modal information is integrated in motor cortical regions to contribute to learning and execution of complex motor skills.",

    "abstract": "Brain oscillations, e.g. measured by electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG), are causally linked to brain functions that are fundamental for perception, cognition and learning. Recent advances in neurotechnology provide means to non-invasively target these oscillations using frequency-tuned amplitude-modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS). However, online adaptation of stimulation parameters to ongoing brain oscillations remains an unsolved problem due to stimulation artifacts that impede such adaptation, particularly at the target frequency. Here, we introduce a real-time compatible artifact rejection algorithm (Stimulation Artifact Source Separation, SASS) that overcomes this limitation. SASS is a spatial filter (linear projection) removing EEG signal components that are maximally different in the presence versus absence of stimulation. This enables the reliable removal of stimulation-specific signal components, while leaving physiological signal components unaffected. For validation of SASS, we evoked brain activity with known phase and amplitude using 10 Hz visual flickers across 7 healthy human volunteers. 64-channel EEG was recorded during and in absence of 10 Hz AM-tACS targeting the visual cortex. Phase differences between AM-tACS and the visual stimuli were randomized, so that steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were phase-locked to the visual stimuli but not to the AM-tACS signal. For validation, distributions of single-trial amplitude and phase of EEG signals recorded during and in absence of AM-tACS were compared for each participant. When no artifact rejection method was applied, AM-tACS stimulation artifacts impeded assessment of single-trial SSVEP amplitude and phase. Using SASS, amplitude and phase of single trials recorded during and in absence of AM-tACS were comparable. These results indicate that SASS can be used to establish adaptive (closed-loop) AM-tACS, a potentially powerful tool to target various brain functions, and to investigate how AM-tACS interacts with electric brain oscillations.\n\nHighlights- Stimulation Artifact Source Separation (SASS), a real-time compatible signal decomposition algorithm for separating electric brain activity and stimulation signal artifacts related to amplitude-modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS), is introduced\n- Employing SASS, phase and amplitude of single-trial steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were reliably recovered from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings at the frequency targeted with AM-tACS\n- SASS enables assessment of single-trial oscillatory brain activity at the target frequency during stimulation and paves the way for online adaptation of stimulation parameters to ongoing brain oscillations",
