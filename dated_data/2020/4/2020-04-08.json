    "abstract": "To reach towards a seen object, visual information has to be transformed into motor commands. Visual information such as the objects colour, shape, and size is processed and integrated within numerous brain areas, then ultimately relayed to the motor periphery. In some instances we must react as fast as possible. These fast visuomotor transformations, and their underlying neurological substrates, are poorly understood in humans as they have lacked a reliable biomarker. Stimulus-locked responses (SLRs) are short latency (<100 ms) bursts of electromyographic (EMG) activity representing the first wave of muscle recruitment influenced by visual stimulus presentation. SLRs provide a quantifiable output of rapid visuomotor transformations, but SLRs have not been consistently observed in all subjects in past studies. Here we describe a new, behavioural paradigm featuring the sudden emergence of a moving target below an obstacle that consistently evokes robust SLRs. Human participants generated visually-guided reaches toward or away from the emerging target using a robotic manipulandum while surface electrodes recorded EMG activity from the pectoralis major muscle. In comparison to previous studies that investigated SLRs using static stimuli, the SLRs evoked with this emerging target paradigm were larger, evolved earlier, and were present in all participants. Reach reaction times (RTs) were also expedited in the emerging target paradigm. This paradigm affords numerous opportunities for modification that could permit systematic study of the impact of various sensory, cognitive, and motor manipulations on fast visuomotor responses. Overall, our results demonstrate that an emerging target paradigm is capable of consistently and robustly evoking activity within a fast visuomotor system.\n\nSUMMARYWe present a new behavioual paradigm that elicits robust fast visuomotor responses on human upper limb muscles during visually guided reaches.",

    "abstract": "Neonicotinoids have been implicated in the large declines observed in flying insects such as bumblebees, an important group of pollinators[1]. Neonicotinoids are agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are found throughout the insect central nervous system, and are the main mediators of synaptic neurotransmission[2]. These receptors are important for the function of the insect central clock and circadian rhythms[3, 4]. The clock allows pollinators to coincide their activity with the availability of floral resources, favourable flight temperatures, as well as impacting learning, navigation and communication[5]. Here we show that exposure to the field relevant concentration of 10 {micro}g/L of imidacloprid can cause a reduction in foraging activity and reduce both locomotor and foraging rhythmicity in Bombus terrestris. Foragers showed an increase in daytime sleep and an increase in the proportion of activity occurring at night. This would likely negatively impact foraging and pollination opportunities, reducing the ability of the colony to grow and reproduce, endangering crop yields.",

    "abstract": "Globally, neonicotinoids are still the most used insecticides, despite their well-documented sub-lethal effects on beneficial insects1. Neonicotinoids are agonists at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the main mediator of synaptic transmission in the insect brain2-5, making them highly potent neurotoxins and insecticides6,7. Memory, circadian rhythmicity and sleep are essential for efficient foraging in many pollinating insects, and involve nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signalling2,4,8-10. The effect of field-relevant concentrations of European Union-banned neonicotinoids: imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam, as well as the currently unbanned thiacloprid were tested on Drosophila memory, circadian rhythms and sleep. Field-relevant concentrations of imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam disrupted learning, behavioural rhythmicity and sleep whilst thiacloprid exposure only affected sleep. Exposure to imidacloprid and clothianidin directly affected neurophysiology, preventing the day/night remodelling and accumulation of pigment dispersing factor neuropeptide in the dorsal terminals of clock neurons. Knockdown of the neonicotinoid susceptible D1 and D{beta}2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits in the mushroom bodies or clock neurons recapitulated the neonicotinoid like deficits in memory or circadian/sleep behaviour demonstrating that neonicotinoid effects are likely mediated in the mushroom body and clock circuitry. Disruption to learning, circadian rhythmicity and sleep are likely to have far-reaching detrimental effects on beneficial insects in the field.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome analysis has mainly relied on analyzing RNA sequencing data from whole cells, overlooking the impact of subcellular RNA localization and its influence on our understanding of gene function, and interpretation of gene expression signatures in cells. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of cytosolic and nuclear transcriptomes in human fetal and adult brain samples. We show significant differences in RNA expression for protein-coding and lncRNA genes between cytosol and nucleus. Transcripts displaying differential subcellular localization belong to particular functional categories and display tissue-specific localization patterns. We also show that transcripts encoding the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins are significantly enriched in the cytosol compared to the rest of protein-coding genes. Further investigation of the use of the cytosolic or the nuclear transcriptome for differential gene expression analysis indicates important differences in results depending on the cellular compartment. These differences were manifested at the level of transcript types and the number of differentially expressed genes. Our data provide a resource of RNA subcellular localization in the human brain and highlight differences in using the cytosolic or the nuclear transcriptomes for differential expression analysis.",

Approximately 19,907 hepatic genes were detected across 16,015 sequenced nuclei from control and treated samples. Eleven cell-(sub)types were identified including distinct hepatocyte sub-populations, consistent with the cell diversity of the liver. TCDD increased macrophages from 0.5% to 24.7%, while neutrophils were only present in treated samples. The number of differentially expressed genes correlated with the basal expression level of Ahr. In addition to expected functional enrichments within each cell-(sub)type, RAS signaling was enriched in nonparenchymal cells. snSeq also identified a Kupffer cell subtype highly expressing Gpnmb, consistent with a dietary NASH model. Overall, snSeq distinguished cell-specific transcriptional changes and population shifts consistent with the hepatotoxicity of TCDD.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgency to identify novel vaccine targets for protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with observations for SARS-CoV, a closely related coronavirus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, early reports identify a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for SARS CoV-2.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we leveraged HLA-I and HLA-II T cell epitope prediction tools from RECON(R) (Real-time Epitope Computation for ONcology), our bioinformatic pipeline that was developed using proteomic profiling of individual HLA-I and HLA-II alleles to predict rules for peptide binding to a diverse set of such alleles. We applied these binding predictors to viral genomes from the Coronaviridae family, and specifically to identify SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes.\n\nResultsTo test the suitability of these tools to identify viral T cell epitopes, we first validated HLA-I and HLA-II predictions on Coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. We then use our HLA-I and HLA-II predictors to identify 11,776 HLA-I and 7,991 HLA-II candidate binding peptides across all 12 open reading frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2. This extensive list of identified candidate peptides is driven by the length of the ORFs and the significant number of HLA-I and HLA-II alleles that we are able to predict (74 and 83, respectively), providing over 99% coverage for the US, European and Asian populations, for both HLA-I and HLA-II. From our SARS-CoV-2 predicted peptide-HLA-I allele pairs, 368 pairs identically matched previously reported pairs in the ViPR database, originating from other forms of coronaviruses. 320 of these pairs (89.1%) had a positive MHC-binding assay result. This analysis reinforces the validity our predictions.\n\nConclusionsUsing this bioinformatic platform, we identify multiple putative epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells whose HLA binding properties cover nearly the entire population and thus may be effective when included in prophylactic vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to induce broad cellular immunity.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND3-dimensional imaging modalities for optically dense connective tissues such as tendons are limited and typically have a single imaging methodological endpoint. Here, we have developed a bimodal procedure that utilises fluorescence-based confocal microscopy and x-ray micro-computed tomography for the imaging of adult tendons to visualise and analyse extracellular sub-structure and cellular composition in small and large animal species.\n\nRESULTSUsing fluorescent immunolabelling and optical clearing, we visualised the expression of the basement membrane protein laminin-4 in 3D throughout whole rat Achilles tendons and equine superficial digital flexor tendon 5 mm segments. This revealed a complex network of laminin-4 within the tendon core that predominantly localises to the interfascicular matrix compartment. Furthermore, we implemented a chemical drying process capable of creating contrast densities enabling visualisation and quantification of both fascicular and interfascicular matrix volume and thickness by x-ray micro-computed tomography. We also demonstrated that both modalities can be combined using reverse clarification of fluorescently labelled tissues prior to chemical drying to enable bimodal imaging of a single sample.\n\nCONCLUSIONSWhole-mount imaging of tendon allowed us to identify the presence of an extensive network of laminin-4 within tendon, the complexity of which cannot be appreciated using traditional 2D imaging techniques. Creating contrast for x-ray micro-computed tomography imaging of tendon using chemical drying is not only simple and rapid, but also markedly improves on previously published methods. Combining these methods provides the ability to gain spatio-temporal information and quantify tendon substructures to elucidate the relationship between morphology and function.",

    "abstract": "The single-cell green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii possesses two -tubulin genes (tua1 and tua2) and two {beta}-tubulin genes (tub1 and tub2), with the two genes in each pair encoding identical amino acid sequences. Here, we used an aphVIII gene cassette insertional library to establish eight disruptants with defective tua2, tub1, or tub2 expression. None of the disruptants exhibited apparent defects in cell growth, flagellar length, or flagellar regeneration after amputation. Because few tubulin mutants of C. reinhardtii have been reported to date, we then used our disruptants, together with a tua1 disruptant obtained from the Chlamydomonas Library Project (CLiP), to isolate novel tubulin-mutants resistant to the anti-tubulin agents propyzamide and oryzalin. As a result of several trials, we obtained 8 strains bearing 7 different -tubulin mutations and 24 strains bearing 12 different {beta}-tubulin mutations. Some of these mutations are known to confer drug resistance in human cancer cells. Thus, single-tubulin-gene disruptants are an efficient means of isolating novel C. reinhardtii tubulin mutants.\n\nIMPORTANCEChlamydomonas reinhardtii is a useful organism for the study of tubulin function; however, only five kinds of tubulin mutations have been reported to date. This scarcity is partly due to C. reinhardtii possessing two tubulin genes each for - and {beta}-tubulin. Here, we obtained several strains in which one of the - or {beta}-tubulin genes was disrupted, and then used those disruptants to isolate 32 strains bearing 19 mostly novel tubulin mutations that conferred differing degrees of resistance to two anti-tubulin compounds. The majority of the tubulin mutations were located outside of the drug-binding sites in the three-dimensional tubulin structure, suggesting that structural changes underlie the drug resistance conferred by these mutations. Thus, single-tubulin-gene disruptants are an efficient means of generating tubulin mutants for the study of the structure-function relationship of tubulin and for the development of novel therapies based on anti-tubulin agents.",

    "abstract": "Elevated plasma glucagon is an early symptom of diabetes, occurring in subjects with impaired glucose regulation. Here we explored alpha-cell function in female mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) - a widely used mouse model of pre-diabetes. In vivo, HFD-fed mice have increased fed plasma glucagon levels that are unaffected by elevation of plasma glucose. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we conducted experiments on isolated islets and in the perfused pancreas. In both experimental models, glucagon secretion under both hypo- and hyperglycaemic conditions was elevated. Because Ca2+ is an important intracellular regulator of glucagon release in alpha-cells, we fed mice expressing the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP3 specifically in alpha-cells the HFD. In mice fed a control (CTL) diet, increasing glucose reduced intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) (oscillation frequency and amplitude). This effect was not observed in HFD mice where both the frequency and amplitude of the [Ca2+]i oscillations were higher than in CTL alpha-cells. Given that alpha-cells are under strong paracrine control from neighbouring somatostatin-secreting delta-cells, we hypothesised that this elevation of alpha-cell output was due to a lack of somatostatin (SST) secretion. Indeed, SST secretion in isolated islets from HFD mice was reduced but exogenous SST also failed to suppress glucagon secretion and Ca2+ activity from HFD alpha-cells, in contrast to observations in CTL mice. These findings suggest that reduced delta-cell function, combined with intrinsic changes in alpha-cell sensitivity to somatostatin, accounts for the hyperglucagonaemia in mice fed a HFD.",

    "abstract": "Performing gene function analyses in a broad range of research organisms is crucial for understanding the biological functions of genes and their evolution. Recent studies have shown that short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) can induce gene-specific knockdowns in two cnidarian species. We have developed a detailed, straightforward, and scalable method to deliver shRNAs into fertilized eggs of the hydrozoan cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus via electroporation, yielding gene-targeted knockdowns that can be assessed throughout embryogenesis, larval settlement, and metamorphosis. Our electroporation protocol allows for the transfection of shRNAs into hundreds of fertilized H.symbiolongicarpus eggs simultaneously with minimal embryo death and no long-term harmful consequences on the developing animals. We show RT-qPCR and detailed phenotypic evidence of our method successfully inducing significant knockdowns of an exogenous gene (eGFP) and an endogenous gene (Nanos2). We also provide visual confirmation of successful shRNA transfection inside embryos through electroporation. This is the first time that electroporation as a delivery system has been developed for Hydractinia. Our detailed protocol for electroporation of shRNAs in H. symbiolongicarpus embryos constitutes an important experimental resource for the hydrozoan community while also serving as a successful model for the development of similar methods for interrogating gene function in other marine invertebrates.",

This knowledge opened up new possibilities for the design of new strategies to obtain HSCs in vitro from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Previous advances in this field have shown that the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway plays a key role in PSC-derived HSC formation. In this work, we identified lithium, a GSK3 inhibitor, as an element capable of stabilizing {beta}-catenin and inducing ESC differentiation in the mesoderm lineage and subsequently in the HE, highly consistent with the role of Wnt agonists on ESC differentiation. ESCs treated with 10 mM lithium express CD31+, Sca-1+, Nkx2-5+ and Runx1+ cells characteristic of HE cells. The ability of lithium-treated ESCs to further derive into HSCs was confirmed after defined maturation, resulting in rounded cell aggregates positive for fetal and mature HSCs markers, confirming the endothelial to hematopoietic transition. Our results represent a novel strategy for generating HSC in vitro as a multipotent source of stem cells for blood and muscle disease therapies.",

We recovered a mouse mutant from a forward genetic screen that developed all the phenotypes of PCD. Whole exome sequencing identified this primary ciliary dyskinesia only (Pcdo) allele to be a nonsense mutation (c.5236A>T) in the Spag17 coding sequence creating a premature stop codon at position 1746 (K1746*). The Pcdo variant abolished different isoforms of SPAG17 in the Pcdo mutant testis but not in the brain. Our data indicate differential requirements for SPAG17 in different motile cilia cell types. SPAG17 is required for proper development of the sperm flagellum, and is essential for either development or stability of the C1 microtubule structure within cilia, but not the brain ependymal cilia. We identified changes in ependymal cilia beating frequency but these did not apparently alter lateral ventricle cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. Aqueductal (Aq) stenosis resulted in significantly slower and abnormally directed CSF flow and we suggest this is the root cause of the hydrocephalus. The Spag17Pcdo homozygous mutant mice are generally viable to adulthood, but have a significantly shortened life span with chronic morbidity. Our data indicate that the c.5236A>T Pcdo variant is a hypomorphic allele of Spag17 gene that causes phenotypes related to motile, but not primary, cilia. Spag17Pcdo is a novel and useful model for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying development of PCD in the mouse.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to background white noise, the detrimental effects of background speech on verbal working memory (WM) were often explained by speech interference in the same verbal modality. Yet, those results were confounded with potential differences between arousal levels induced by speech and white noise. To address the role of arousal, in the present study, we minimized the verbal interference and used a visual WM task to test the influence of background speech or white noise. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and Electromyography (EMG) were recorded simultaneously to indicate the arousal levels of participants. Results showed that both background speech and white noise significantly improved visual WM performance. The change of performance further correlated with the change of physiological signals linked with arousal. Taken together, our results suggest that both background speech and white noise facilitate visual WM through raising the arousal level.",

We develop a voltage imaging platform for analyzing functional connectivity changes using simultaneous voltage recordings in small populations of neurons. We validate this platform using a culture model of development as well as with several pharmacological interventions. Using this platform, we show that ablation of SNA-binding glycans results in loss of functional connectivity in mouse hippocampal neurons, while ablation of MAL II binding glycans minimally perturbs functional connectivity. Altogether, our data reveal that subpopulations of glycans play different roles in maintenance of electrophysiology and provide a platform for modeling changes in functional connectivity with simultaneous voltage recordings.",

    "abstract": "It has become increasingly apparent that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) localization is a master regulator of cell signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are not well understood. To date, observations of intracellular GPCR activation can be organized into two categories: a dependence on OCT3 cationic channel-permeable ligands or the necessity of endocytic trafficking. Using CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) as a model, we identified a third mechanism of intracellular GPCR signaling. We show that independent of membrane permeable ligands and endocytosis, upon stimulation, plasma membrane and internal pools of CXCR4 are post-translationally modified and collectively regulate EGR1 transcription. We found that {beta}-arrestin-1 (arrestin 2) is necessary to mediate communication between plasma membrane and internal pools of CXCR4. Notably, these observations may explain that while CXCR4 overexpression is highly correlated with cancer metastasis and mortality, plasma membrane localization is not. Together these data support a model were a small initial pool of plasma membrane-localized GPCRs are capable of activating internal receptor-dependent signaling events.",

    "abstract": "The soil physicochemical properties were affected by different fertilizer managements, and the soil microbial communities were changed. Fertilizer regimes were closely relative to the soil texture and nutrient status in a double-cropping paddy field of southern China. However, there was limited information about the influence of different long-term fertilizer management practices on the soil microbial communities in a double-cropping rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields. Therefore, the 39-year long-term fertilizer regimes on soil bacterial and fungal diversity in a double-cropping paddy field of southern China were studied by using Illumina sequencing and quantitative PCR technology in the present paper. The filed experiment were including chemical fertilizer alone (MF), rice straw residue and chemical fertilizer (RF), 30% organic manure and 70% chemical fertilizer (OM), and without fertilizer input as a control (CK). The results showed that diversity indices of soil microbial communities with application of organic manure and rice straw residue treatments were higher than that without fertilizer input treatment. Application of organic manure and rice straw residue managements increase soil bacterial abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria, and soil fungi abundance of the phylum Basidiomycota, Zygomycota and Tremellales were also increased. Compared with CK treatment, the value of Richness, Shannon and McIntosh indices, and taxonomic diversity were increased with RF and OM treatments. This finding demonstrated that RF and OM treatments modify soil bacterial and fungal diversity. Therefore, the combined application of organic manure or rice straw residue with chemical fertilizer managements could significantly increase the abundance of profitable functional bacteria and fungi species in double-cropping rice fields of southern China.",

    "abstract": "An Eritrean patient was admitted with suspected tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis. While no mycobacteria were detected in pus from this process, culture yielded PVL-positive, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Microarray hybridisation assigned the isolate to clonal complex (CC) 80 but revealed unusual features, including the presence of the ORF-CM14 enterotoxin homologue and of an ACME-III element as well as the absence of etD and edinB. The isolate was subjected to both, Illumina and Nanopore sequencing allowing characterisation of deviating regions within the strains genome. Atypical features of this strain were attributable to the presence of two genomic regions that originated from other S. aureus lineages and that comprised, respectively, 3% and 1.4% of the genome. One deviating region extended from walJ to sirB. It comprised ORF-CM14 and the ACME-III element. A homologous, but larger fragment was also found in an atypical S. aureus CC1/ST567 strain whose lineage might have served as donor of this genomic region. This region itself is a chimera comprising fragments from CC1 as well as fragments of unknown origin. The other region of another 3% of the genome comprised the region from htsB to ecfA2. It was very similar to CC1 sequences. This suggests either an incorporation of CC1 DNA into the study strain, or it might alternatively suggest a recombination event affecting \"canonical\" CC80. As the study strain bears witness of several recombination events, such complex and large-scale events cannot be rare and exceptional, despite a mainly clonal nature of S. aureus. Although the exact mechanism is not yet clear, chimerism seems to be an additional pathway in the evolution of S. aureus, possibly being responsible for the transmission also of virulence and resistance factors. An organism that can shuffle, swap or exchange major parts of its genome by a yet unknown mechanism would have an evolutionary advantage compared to a strictly clonal organism.",

    "abstract": "A pervasive characteristic of malaria parasite infection in mosquito vector populations is their tendency to be overdispersed. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the overdispersed distribution of parasites is of key importance as it may drastically impact the transmission dynamics of the pathogen. The small fraction of heavily infected individuals might serve as superspreaders and cause a disproportionate number of subsequent infections. Although multiple factors ranging from environmental stochasticity to inter-individual heterogeneity may explain parasite overdispersion, Plasmodium infection has also been observed to be highly overdispersed in inbred mosquito population maintained under standardized laboratory conditions, suggesting that other mechanisms may be at play. Here, we show that the aggregated distribution of Plasmodium within mosquito vectors is partially explained by a temporal heterogeneity in parasite infectivity triggered by the bites of blood-feeding mosquitoes. Several experimental blocks carried out with three different Plasmodium isolates have consistently shown that the transmission of the parasite increases progressively with the order of mosquito bites. Surprisingly the increase in transmission is not associated with an increase in Plasmodium replication rate or higher investment in the production of the transmissible stage (gametocyte). Adjustment of the physiological state of the gametocytes could be, however, an adaptive strategy to respond promptly to mosquito bites. Overall our data show that malaria parasite appears to be able to respond to the bites of mosquitoes to increase its own transmission at a much faster pace than initially thought (hours rather than days). Further work needs to be carried out to elucidate whether these two strategies are complementary and, particularly, what are their respective underlaying mechanisms. Understanding the processes underlying the temporal fluctuations in Plasmodium infectivity throughout vertebrate host-to-mosquito transmission is essential and could lead to the development of new approaches to control malaria transmission.\n\nAuthor summaryPlasmodium parasites are known for being the etiological agents of malaria and for the devastating effects they cause on human populations. A pervasive characteristic of Plasmodium infection is their tendency to be overdispersed in mosquito vector populations: the majority of mosquitoes tend to harbour few or no parasites while a few individuals harbor the vast majority of the parasite population. Understanding the mechanisms underlying Plasmodium overdispersed distribution is of key importance as it may drastically impact the transmission dynamics of the pathogen. Here, we show that the aggregated distribution of Plasmodium parasites within mosquito vectors is partially explained by a temporal heterogeneity in Plasmodium infectivity triggered by the bites of blood-feeding mosquitoes. In other words, mosquitoes that bite at the beginning of a 3h feeding session have significantly fewer parasites than those that bite towards the end. Malaria parasite is therefore capable of responding to the bites of mosquitoes to increase its own transmission at a much faster pace than thought (hours rather than days). Understanding the processes underlying the temporal fluctuations in Plasmodium infectivity throughout vertebrate host-to-mosquito transmission is essential and could lead to the development of new approaches to control malaria transmission.",

    "abstract": "Can neural rhythms reflect purely internal syntactic processes in multi-word constructions? To test this controversial conjecture - relevant to language in particular and cognition more broadly - we recorded electroencephalographic and behavioural data as participants listened to isochronously presented sentences of varying in syntactic complexity. Each trial comprised ten concatenated sentences and was either fully grammatical (regular) or rendered ungrammatical via randomly distributed word order violations. We found that attending the regular repetition of abstract syntactic categories (phrases and sentences) generates neural rhythms whose harmonics are mathematically independent of word rate. This permits to clearly separate endogenous syntactic rhythms from exogenous speech rhythms. We demonstrate that endogenous but not exogenous rhythms predict participants grammaticality judgements, and allow for the neural decoding of regular vs. irregular trials. Neural harmonic series constitute a new form of behaviourally relevant evidence for syntactic competence.",

    "abstract": "Mouse models are frequently used to study mechanisms of human diseases. Recently, we observed a spontaneous bimodal variation in liver weight in C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice fed a semisynthetic diet. We now characterized the spontaneous variation in liver weight and its relationship with parameters of hepatic lipid and bile acid (BA) metabolism. In male C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice fed AIN-93G from birth to postnatal day (PN)70, we measured plasma BA, lipids, Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride (TG) secretion, and hepatic mRNA expression patterns. Mice were sacrificed at PN21, PN42, PN63 and PN70. Liver weight distribution was bimodal at PN70. Mice could be subdivided into two nonoverlapping groups based on liver weight: 0.6 SD 0.1 g (approximately one-third of mice, small liver; SL), and 1.0 SD 0.1 g (normal liver; NL; p<0.05). Liver histology showed a higher steatosis grade, inflammation score, more mitotic figures and more fibrosis in the SL versus the NL group. Plasma BA concentration was 14-fold higher in SL (p<0.001). VLDL-TG secretion rate was lower in SL mice, both absolutely (-66%, p<0.001) and upon correction for liver weight (-44%, p<0.001). Mice that would later have the SL-phenotype showed lower food efficiency ratios during PN21-28, suggesting the cause of the SL phenotype is present at weaning (PN21). Our data show that approximately one-third of C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice fed semisynthetic diet develop spontaneous liver disease with aberrant histology and parameters of hepatic lipid, bile acid and lipoprotein metabolism. Study designs involving this mouse strain on semisynthetic diets need to take the SL phenotype into account. Plasma lipids may serve as markers for the identification of the SL phenotype.",

Short-hairpin RNA silencing of CDK9 in Multiple Myeloma (MM) cell lines reduced cell viability compared to control cells showing the dependency of MM cells on CDK9. In order to explore synergy with the CDK9 inhibitor, proteolysis targeting chimeric molecule (PROTAC) ARV 825 was added.

Combination treatment synergistically inhibited multiple myeloma cells both in vitro and in vivo with insignificant weight loss. The combination also resulted in marked increase of apoptotic cells at low dose compared to single agent alone.

    "abstract": "The vasculature within a tumor is highly disordered both structurally and functionally. Endothelial cells that comprise the vasculature are poorly connected causing vessels to be leaky and exposing the endothelium to a hypoxic microenvironment. Therefore, most anti-angiogenic therapies are generally inefficient and result in acquired resistance to increased hypoxia due to elimination of the vasculature. Recent studies have explored the efficacy of targeting metabolic pathways in tumor cells in combination with anti-angiogenic therapy. However, the metabolic alterations of endothelial cells in response to hypoxia has been relatively unexplored. Here, we measured polar metabolite levels in microvascular endothelial cells exposed to short- and long-term hypoxia with the goal of identifying metabolic vulnerabilities that can be targeted to normalize tumor vasculature and improve drug delivery. Many amino acid-related metabolites were altered by hypoxia exposure, especially within alanine-aspartate-glutamate, serine-threonine, and cysteine-methionine metabolism. Additionally, there were significant changes in de novo pyrimidine synthesis as well as glutathione and taurine metabolism. These results provide key insights into the metabolic alterations that occur in endothelial cells in response to hypoxia, which serve as a foundation for future studies to develop therapies that lead to vessel normalization and more efficient drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "Axonal connections are widely regarded as faithful transmitters of neuronal signals with fixed delays. The reasoning behind this is that extra-cellular potentials caused by spikes travelling along axons are too small to have an effect on other axons. Here we devise a computational framework that allows us to study the effect of extracellular potentials generated by spike volleys in axonal fibre bundles on axonal transmission delays. We demonstrate that, although the extracellular potentials generated by single spikes are of the order of microvolts, the collective extracellular potential generated by spike volleys can reach several millivolts. As a consequence, the resulting depolarisation of the axonal membranes increases the velocity of spikes, and therefore reduces axonal delays between brain areas. Driving a neural mass model with such spike volleys, we further demonstrate that only ephaptic coupling can explain the reduction of stimulus latencies with increased stimulus intensities, as observed in many psychological experiments.\n\nAuthor summaryAxonal fibre bundles that connect distant cortical areas contain millions of densely packed axons. When synchronous spike volleys travel through such fibre bundles, the extracellular potential within the bundles is perturbed. We use computer simulations to examine the magnitude and shape of this perturbation, and demonstrate that it is sufficiently strong to affect axonal transmission speeds. Since most spikes within a spike volley are positioned in an area where the extracellular potential is negative (relative to a distant reference), the resulting depolarisation of the axonal membranes accelerates the spike volley on average. This finding is in contrast to previous studies of ephaptic coupling effects between axons, where ephaptic coupling was found to slow down spike propagation. Our finding has consequences for information transmission and synchronisation between cortical areas.",
