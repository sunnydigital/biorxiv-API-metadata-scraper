    "abstract": "In human lung cancer progression, the EMT process is characterized by the transformation of cancer cells into invasive forms that migrate to other organs. Targeting to EMT-related molecules is emerging as a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention of lung cancer cell migration and invasion. Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) has recently been considered as an anti-proliferative target molecule to regulate the Wnt signaling pathway in several types of cancer cells. In the present study, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib and the integrin-V{beta}3 targeted cyclic peptide (cRGDfK) on EMT in human lung cancer cells. Sunitinib strongly inhibited the TGF-{beta}1-activated EMT through suppression of Wnt signaling, Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways. In addition, the cRGDfK also inhibited the expression of TGF{beta}1-induced mesenchymal marker genes and proteins. The anti-EMT effect of sunitinib was enhanced when cRGDfK was treated together. When sunitinib was treated with cRGDfK, the mRNA and protein expression levels of mesenchymal markers were decreased compared to the treatment with sunitinib alone. Co-treatment of cRGDfK has shown the potential to improve the efficacy of anticancer agents in combination with therapeutic agents that may be toxic at high concentrations. These results provide new and improved therapies for treating and preventing EMT-related disorders, such as lung fibrosis and cancer metastasis, and relapse.",

    "abstract": "We studied similarities of collapses and concluded that dominant species have a universal effect on the pattern of collapses. We used open paleoecological and modern data to detect  early warning signals of collapses. We tested and ranked collapse indicators at the community level (abundance, species richness, constancy, dominance, Shannons H, standard deviation, variance, lag-1 autocorrelation of community abundance, lag-1 autocorrelation of Shannons H) and at the level of the dominant species (total changes of pre-collapse and collapse dominant species, lag-1 autocorrelation of pre-collapse and collapse dominant species) based on their performances. We distinguished between small-scale signals (sharp drops and peaks) and large-scale signals (trend changes). Small-scale signals and large-scale signals can be at the same time, however, small-scale signals can also precede large-scale signals. Small-scale signals indicate environmental events. Large-scale trend changes refer to the decline and eventually the collapse of the community. Our results show that the collapse indicators of the dominant species outperform community-level critical slowing down indicators, which suggests that the dominant species probably have an important role in community-level collapses triggered by environmental events. We also concluded that unusual environmental events might be the number one cause of collapses therefore small-scale signals should be involved in analyses.",

    "abstract": "Understanding global soil bacterial diversity is important because of the key roles soil bacteria play in the global ecosystem. Given the effects of environmental changes (e.g., climate change and human effect) on the diversity of animals and plants, effects on soil bacterial diversity are expected; however, they have been poorly evaluated to date. Thus, in this study, we focused on the soil dominant bacteria because of their global importance and investigated the effects of warming velocity and human activities on their diversity. Using a global dataset of bacteria, we performed spatial analysis to evaluate the effects, while statistically controlling for the potential confounding effects of current climate and geographic parameters with global climate and geographic data. It was demonstrated that the diversity of the dominant soil bacteria was influenced globally by warming velocity (showing significant increases) in addition to aridity index (dryness) and pH. The effects of warming velocity were particularly significant in forests and grasslands. An effect from human activity was also observed, but it was secondary to warming velocity. These findings provide robust evidence, and advance our understanding of the effects of environmental changes (particularly global warming) on soil bacterial diversity at the global scale.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the influence environmental drivers on understory vegetation is important for conservation efforts under climate change. Bryophytes are one of the most diverse groups in temperate forests but also the least known. In addition, the environmental drivers (e.g., forest structure, microclimate, soil conditions or substrate) influencing over bryophyte community among Nothofagus forest types are poorly known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of forest canopy-layer composition on the structure (cover) and the composition (richness and diversity) of bryophyte communities (mosses and liverworts) in two contrast landscape types (coast and mountain) in southern Patagonia. Three natural Nothofagus forest types (pure deciduous, pure evergreen, and mixed deciduous-evergreen) in two landscapes (coast < 100 m.a.s.l.; mountain > 400 m.a.s.l.) were selected (N = 60 plots). In each forest plot, we established one linear transect (10 m length) to measure bryophyte cover (point-intercept method). The data were evaluated using ANOVAs, Chi-square test and multivariate analyses. The mosses were mostly austral-antarctic origin, and the liverworts were all endemics. The principal substrates for the bryophytes development in the forest floor were litter and decaying woods. Moreover, many bryophytes species act as a substrate for natural tree regeneration. The forest structure was the main driver of bryophytes community in the coast landscape, while the slope was the principal driver of bryophytes in the mountain landscape. These differences were mainly explained for the microclimate into the forests (e.g., soil moisture and air temperature), and for the regional climate in the landscapes (e.g., air temperature and soil conditions). Notably, the mixed forest, mainly in the coast, presented exclusive species that were not present in the deciduous and evergreen pure forests. The conservation efforts should include management considerations both the stand and landscape levels based on the potential climate-change impact over bryophyte communities.",

Here we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 sequence diversity across 5,700 sequences sampled since December 2019. The Spike protein, which is the target immunogen of most vaccine candidates, showed 93 sites with shared polymorphisms; only one of these mutations was found in more than 1% of currently circulating sequences. The minimal diversity found among SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be explained by drift and bottleneck events as the virus spread away from its original epicenter in Wuhan, China. Importantly, there is little evidence that the virus has adapted to its human host since December 2019. Our findings suggest that a single vaccine should be efficacious against current global strains.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe limited diversification of SARS-CoV-2 reflects drift and bottleneck events rather than adaptation to humans as the virus spread.",

    "abstract": "To determine the differential profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) among acute gout (AG) patients, intercritical gout (IG) patients and healthy control subjects, and to explore the specific biomarkers for acute gout diagnosis and treatment in future. Human lncRNA microarrays were used to identify the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in primary AG (n=3), IG (n=3) and healthy subjects (n=3). For comparison Bioinformatics analyses were performed to predict the roles of abberrantly expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to validate the results in 32 AG, 32 IG patients and 32 healthy control subjects. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to evaluate the diagnostic value of the lncRNAs identified in gout. The microarray analysis identified 3421 and 1739 differentially expressed lncRNAs, 2240 and 1027 differentially expressed mRNAs in AG and IG (fold change>1.5, P<0.05; respectively), respectively. qRT-PCR results of 9 dysregulated genes were consistent with the microarray data. The bioinformatic analysis indicated that the differentially expressed lncRNAs regulated the abnormally expressed mRNAs, which were involved in the pathogenesis of gout through several different pathways. The expression levels of TCONS_00004393 and ENST00000566457 were significantly increased in the AG group than those in the IG group or healthy subjects (P<0.01, respectively). Moreover, the areas under the ROC curve were 0.955 and 0.961 for TCONS_00004393 and ENST00000566457,respectively. Our results provide novel insight into the mechanisms of the primary gout, and reveal that TCONS_00004393 and ENST00000566457 might be as candidate diagnostic biomarkers and targets for the treatment of acute gout.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 2019 as the causative agent of the novel pandemic viral disease COVID-19. With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the urgent need for safe, broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging CoVs. We report that remdesivir (RDV), a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures (EC50 = 0.01 M). Weaker activity was observed in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 1.65 M) due to their low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, of SARS-CoV-2. In mice infected with chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminished lung viral load and improved pulmonary function as compared to vehicle treated animals. These data provide evidence that RDV is potently active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo, supporting its further clinical testing for treatment of COVID-19.",

Here we present the cryo-electron microscopic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in its replicating form. The structure comprises the viral proteins nsp12, nsp8, and nsp7, and over two turns of RNA template-product duplex. The active site cleft of nsp12 binds the first turn of RNA and mediates RdRp activity with conserved residues. Two copies of nsp8 bind to opposite sides of the cleft and position the RNA duplex as it exits. Long helical extensions in nsp8 protrude along exiting RNA, forming positively charged  sliding poles that may enable processive replication of the long coronavirus genome.

    "abstract": "Since its emergence in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and become a major public health burden. Despite its close phylogenetic relationship to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits increased human-to-human transmission dynamics, likely due to efficient early replication in the upper respiratory epithelium of infected individuals. Since different temperatures encountered in the human respiratory tract have been shown to affect the replication kinetics of several viruses, as well as host immune response dynamics, we investigated the impact of temperatures during SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection in the human airway epithelial cell culture model. SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated more efficiently at temperatures encountered in the upper respiratory tract, and displayed higher sensitivity to type I and type III IFNs. Time-resolved transcriptome analysis highlighted a temperature-dependent and virus-specific induction of the IFN-mediated antiviral response. These data reflect clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, as well as their associated transmission efficiencies, and provide crucial insight on pivotal virus - host interaction dynamics.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has recently caused a global health crisis and an effective interventional therapy is urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a promising but challenging drug target due to its intrinsic proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN). Remdesivir targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp exerts high drug efficacy in vitro and in vivo. However, its underlying inhibitory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 24 microseconds to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of Remdesivir. We found that Remdesivirs 1-cyano group of possesses the dual role of inhibiting nucleotide addition and proofreading. The presence of its polar 1-cyano group at an upstream site in RdRp causes instability and hampers RdRp translocation. This leads to a delayed chain termination of RNA extension, which may also subsequently reduce the likelihood for Remdesivir to be cleaved by ExoN acting on the 3-terminal nucleotide. In addition, our simulations suggest that Remdesivirs 1-cyano group can also disrupt the cleavage active site of ExoN via steric interactions, leading to a further reduced cleavage efficiency. Our work provides plausible molecular mechanisms on how Remdesivir inhibits viral RNA replication and may guide rational design for new treatments of COVID-19 targeting viral replication.",

Sequence analyses of ORF1ab unravelled emergence of mutations especially in the viral RdRp and helicase at specific positions, both of which are important in mediating viral RNA replication. Since proteins are dynamic in nature and their functions are governed by the molecular motions, we performed normal mode analyses of the SARS-CoV2 wild type and mutant RdRp and helicases to understand the effect of mutations on their structure, conformation, dynamics and thus function. Structural analyses revealed that mutation of RdRp (at position 4715 in the context of the polyprotein/ at position 323 of RdRp) leads to rigidification of structure and that mutation in the helicase (at position 5828 of polyprotein/ position 504) leads to destabilization increasing the flexibility of the protein structure. Such structural modifications and protein dynamics alterations might alter unwinding of complex RNA stem loop structures, the affinity/ avidity of polymerase RNA interactions and in turn the viral RNA replication.

    "abstract": "During the current outbreak of COVID-19, research labs around the globe submit sequences of the local SARS-CoV-2 genomes to the GISAID database to provide a comprehensive analysis of the variability and spread of the virus during the outbreak. We explored the variations in the submitted genomes and found a significant number of variants that can be seen only in one submission (singletons). While it is not completely clear whether these variants are erroneous or not, these variants show lower transition/transversion ratio. These singleton variants may influence the estimations of the viral mutation rate and tree topology. We suggest that genomes with multiple singletons even marked as high-covered should be considered with caution. We also provide a simple script for checking variant frequency against the database before submission.",
