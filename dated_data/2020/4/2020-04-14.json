    "abstract": "Vaccines based on live attenuated viruses often induce broad, multifaceted immune responses. However, they also usually sacrifice immunogenicity for attenuation. It is particularly difficult to elicit an effective vaccine for herpesviruses due to an armament of immune evasion genes and a latent phase. Here, to overcome the limitation of attenuation, we developed a rational herpesvirus vaccine in which viral immune evasion genes were deleted to enhance immunogenicity while also attaining safety. To test this vaccine strategy, we utilized murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) as a proof-of-concept model for the cancer-associated human {gamma}-herpesviruses, Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. We engineered a recombinant MHV-68 virus by targeted inactivation of viral antagonists of type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway and deletion of the latency locus responsible for persistent infection. This recombinant virus is highly attenuated with no measurable capacity for replication, latency, or persistence in immunocompetent hosts. It stimulates robust innate immunity, differentiates virus-specific memory T cells, and elicits neutralizing antibodies. A single vaccination affords durable protection that blocks the establishment of latency following challenge with the wild type MHV-68 for at least six months post-vaccination. These results provide a novel approach to effective vaccination against cancer-associated herpesviruses through the elimination of latency and key immune evasion mechanisms from the pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Monophosphate prodrug analogs of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-2-C-methylguanosine have been reported as potent inhibitors of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These prodrugs also display potent anti-dengue activities in cellular assays although their prodrug moieties were designed to produce high levels of triphosphate in the liver. Since peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are one of the major targets of dengue virus, different prodrug moieties were designed to effectively deliver 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-2-C-methylguanosine monophosphate prodrugs and their corresponding triphosphates into PBMCs after oral administration. We identified a cyclic phosphoramidate prodrug 17 demonstrating a well-balanced anti-dengue cellular activity and in vitro stability profiles. In dogs, oral administration of 17 resulted in high PBMC triphosphate level, exceeding TP50 (the intracellular triphosphate concentration at which 50% of virus replication is inhibited) at 10 mg/kg. Compound 17 demonstrated 1.6- and 2.2 log viremia reduction in the dengue mouse model at 100 and 300 mg/kg twice daily, respectively. At 100 mg/kg twice daily, the terminal triphosphate concentration in PBMCs reached above TP50, defining for the first time the minimum efficacious dose for a nucleos(t)ide prodrug. In the two-week dog toxicity studies at 30 to 300 mg/kg/day, no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) could not be achieved due to pulmonary inflammation and hemorrhage. The preclinical safety results suspended further development of 17. Nevertheless, present work has proven the concept that an efficacious monophosphate nucleoside prodrug could be developed for the potential treatment of dengue infection.",

However, our understanding of the factors that favor efficient excision is limited by the lack of a rapid, accurate measurement of DNA excision outcomes that is free of amplification bias. Here, we introduce ddXR (droplet digital PCR eXcision Reporter), a method that enables the accurate and sensitive detection of excisions and inversions independent of length. The method can be completed in a few hours without the need for next-generation sequencing. The ddXR method uncovered unexpectedly high rates of large (>20 kb) excisions and inversions, while also revealing a surprisingly low dependence on linear distance, up to 170 kb. We further modified the method to measure precise repair of excision junctions and allele-specific excision, with important implications for disease modeling and therapeutic gene editing.",

    "abstract": "As their illness progresses, patients with the semantic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA) frequently exhibit peculiar behaviors indicative of altered visual attention or an increased interest in artistic endeavors. In the present study, we examined changes within and between large-scale functional brain networks that may explain this altered visual behavior. We first examined the connectivity of the visual association network, the dorsal attention network, and the default mode network in healthy young adults (n=89) to understand the typical architecture of these networks in the healthy brain. We then compared the large-scale functional connectivity of these networks in a group of svPPA patients (n=12) to a group of age-matched cognitively normal controls (n=30). Our results showed that the between-network connectivity of the dorsal attention and visual association networks was elevated in svPPA patients relative to controls. We further showed that this heightened between-network connectivity was associated with a decrease in the within-network connectivity of the default mode network, possibly due to progressive degeneration of the anterior temporal lobes in svPPA. These results suggest that focal neurodegeneration can lead to the reorganization of large-scale cognitive networks beyond the primarily affected network(s), possibly contributing to cognitive or behavioral changes that are commonly present as part of the clinical phenotype of svPPA.",

    "abstract": "Lesion symptom mapping (LSM) tools are used on brain injury data to identify the neural structures critical for a given behavior or symptom. Univariate lesion-symptom mapping (ULSM) methods provide statistical comparisons of behavioral test scores in patients with and without a lesion on a voxel by voxel basis. More recently, multivariate lesion-symptom mapping (MLSM) methods have been developed that consider the effects of all lesioned voxels in one model simultaneously. However, very little work has been done to empirically compare the advantages and disadvantages of these two different methods. In the current study, we provide a needed systematic comparison of 5 ULSM and 8 MLSM methods, using both synthetic and real data to identify the potential strengths and weaknesses of both approaches. We tested power and spatial precision of each LSM method for both single and dual (network type) anatomical target simulations across anatomical target location, sample size, noise level, and lesion smoothing. Additionally, we performed false positive simulations to identify the characteristics associated with each methods spurious findings. Simulations showed no clear superiority of either ULSM or MLSM methods overall, but rather highlighted specific advantages of different methods. No single method produced a thresholded LSM map that exclusively delineated brain regions associated with the target behavior. Thus, different LSM methods are indicated, depending on the particular study design, specific hypotheses, and sample size. Overall, we recommend the use of both ULSM and MLSM methods in tandem to enhance confidence in the results: Brain foci identified as significant across both types of methods are unlikely to be spurious and can be confidently reported as robust results.",

Here we demonstrate a new approach for chronic Neuropixels recordings over a period of months in freely moving rats. Our approach allows multiple probes per rat and multiple cycles of probe reuse. We found that hundreds of units could be recorded for multiple months, but that yields depended systematically on anatomical position. Explanted probes displayed a small increase in noise compared to unimplanted probes, but this was insufficient to impair future single-unit recordings. We conclude that cost-effective, multi-region, and multi-probe Neuropixels recordings can be carried out with high yields over multiple months in rats or other similarly sized animals. Our methods and observations may facilitate the standardization of chronic recording from Neuropixels probes in freely moving animals.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are dynamic molecules which perform diverse molecular functions by adopting different three-dimensional structures. Recent progress in residue-residue contacts prediction opens up new avenues for the de novo protein structure prediction from sequence information. However, it is still difficult to predict more than one conformation from residue-residue contacts alone. This is due to the inability to deconvolve the complex signals of residue-residue contacts, i.e. spatial contacts relevant for protein folding, conformational diversity, and ligand binding. Here, we introduce a machine learning based method, called FingerprintContacts, for extending the capabilities of residue-residue contacts. This algorithm leverages the features of residue-residue contacts, that is, (1) a single conformation outperforms the others in the structural prediction using all the top ranking residue-residue contacts as structural constraints, and (2) conformation specific contacts rank lower and constitute a small fraction of residue-residue contacts. We demonstrate the capabilities of FingerprintContacts on eight ligand binding proteins with varying conformational motions. Furthermore, FingerprintContacts identifies small clusters of residue-residue contacts which are preferentially located in the dynamically fluctuating regions. With the rapid growth in protein sequence information, we expect FingerprintContacts to be a powerful first step in structural understanding of protein functional mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Plant biotrophic pathogen disease resistances rely on immunity receptor-mediated programmed cell death (PCD) responses, but specialized necrotrophic/hemi-biotrophic pathogens hijack these mechanisms to colonize the resulting dead tissue in their necrotrophic phase. Thus, immunity receptors can become necrotrophic pathogen dominant susceptibility targets but resistance mechanisms that resist necrotroph manipulation are recessive resistance genes. The barley rcs5 QTL imparts recessive resistance against the disease spot blotch caused by the hemi-biotrophic fungal pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana. The rcs5 genetic interval was delimited to ~0.23 cM, representing an ~234 kb genomic region containing four wall-associated kinase (WAK) genes, designated HvWak2, Sbs1, Sbs2 (susceptibility to Bipolaris sorokiniana 1&2), and HvWak5. Post-transcriptional gene silencing of Sbs1&2 in susceptible barley cultivars resulted in resistance showing dominant susceptibility function. Allele analysis of Sbs1&2 from resistant and susceptible barley cultivars identified sequence polymorphisms associated with phenotypes in their primary coding sequence and promoter regions, suggesting differential transcriptional regulation may contribute to susceptibility. Transcript analysis of Sbs1&2 showed nearly undetectable expression in resistant and susceptible cultivars prior to pathogen challenge; however, upregulation of both genes occurred specifically in susceptible cultivars post-inoculation with a virulent isolate. Apoplastic wash fluids collected from barley infected with a virulent isolate induced Sbs1, suggesting regulation by an apoplastic-secreted effector. Thus, Sbs1&2 function as B. sorokiniana susceptibility targets and non-functional alleles or alleles that resist induction by the pathogen mediate rcs5-recessive resistance. The sbs1&2 alleles underlying the rcs5 QTL that the pathogen is unable to manipulate are the first resistance genes identified against spot blotch.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe rcs5 locus in barley confers a high level of seedling resistance and a moderate level of adult plant resistance to spot blotch. It is part of a complex that has provided durable spot blotch resistance in many North American barley cultivars (cv) for more than 50 years. Genetic characterization and positional cloning of rcs5 identified the dominant susceptibility genes, Sbs1 and Sbs2 (susceptibility to Bipolaris sorokiniana 1 and 2) as wall-associated kinases. These genes are hijacked by the hemibiotrophic pathogen in its necrotrophic phase to induce programmed cell death, facilitating disease development. We report the first spot blotch resistance/susceptibility genes cloned that function via alleles that cannot be specifically induced and hijacked by virulent isolates of the pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Chloroquine is an anti-malarial and immunosuppressant drug that has cationic amphipathic chemical properties. We performed genome-wide screens in human cells with chloroquine and several other widely used cationic amphipathic drugs (CADs) including the anti-depressants, sertraline (Zoloft) and fluoxetine (Prozac), the analgesic nortriptyline (Pamelor), the anti-arrhythmic amiodarone (Cordarone), and the anti-hypertensive verapamil (Calan) to characterize their molecular similarities and differences. Despite CADs having different disease indications but consistent with them sharing key chemical properties, we found CADs to have remarkably similar phenotypic profiles compared with non-CADs we and others have previously screened (1-5). The most significant genetic interaction for all CADs was the initiating step in sphingolipid biosynthesis catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). A comparison of genome-wide screens performed with diverse pathogens from viruses, bacteria, plants, and parasites including Ebola (6), adeno-associated virus AAV2 (7), HIV (8), Rotavirus (9), Influenza A (10), Zika virus (11), Picornavirus (12), Exotoxin A (13), Cholera toxin (14), Type III secretion system and Shiga toxin (15, 16), Ricin toxin (17), and Toxoplasma gondii (18) showed SPT as a top common host factor and 80% overlap overall in top hits specifically with CADs. Potential sphingolipid-mediated mechanisms for the host response- and virulence-modulating effects of CADs involve autophagy and SERPINE1/PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1). Chloroquine has recently shown potential as an anti-viral agent for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease (19, 20). Our study demonstrates that numerous readily available drugs molecularly function highly similar to chloroquine, which suggests they might be considered for further pre-clinical investigation in the context of SARS-CoV-2. More generally, our work suggests the diverse pathogen mitigating potential of drugs that inhibit host sphingolipid biosynthesis such as CADs.\n\nBrief SummaryOur study demonstrates that numerous readily available drugs molecularly function highly similar to chloroquine, which suggests they might be considered for further pre-clinical investigation in the context of SARS-CoV-2.",

Genetic studies imply that NTMT1 regulates cell mitosis and DNA damage repair. Herein, we report the rational design and development of the first potent peptidomimetic inhibitors for NTMT1. Biochemical and co-crystallization studies manifest that BM30 (IC50 of 0.89 {+/-} 0.10 {micro}M) is a competitive inhibitor to the peptide substrate and noncompetitive to the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine. BM30 exhibits over 100-fold selectivity to NTMT1/2 among a panel of 41 methyltransferases, indicating the potential to achieve high selectivity when targeting the peptide substrate binding site of NTMT1/2. Its cell-permeable analog DC432 (IC50 of 54 {+/-} 4 nM) decreases the N-terminal methylation level of SET protein in HCT116 cells. This proof-of principle study provides valuable probes for NTMT1/2 and highlights the opportunity to develop more cell-potent inhibitors to elucidate the function of NTMTs in future.",

    "abstract": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry is an analytical method that detects macromolecules that can be used as biomarkers for taxonomic identification in arthropods. The conventional MALDI approach uses fresh laboratory-reared arthropod specimens to build a reference mass spectra library with high-quality standards required to achieve reliable identification. However, this may not be possible to accomplish in some arthropod groups that are difficult to rear under laboratory conditions, or for which only alcohol preserved samples are available. Here, we generated MALDI mass spectra of highly abundant proteins from the legs of 18 Neotropical species of adult field-collected hard ticks, several of which had not been analyzed by mass spectrometry before. We then used their mass spectra as fingerprints to identify each tick species by applying machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms that combined unsupervised and supervised clustering approaches. Both principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification algorithms were able to identify spectra from different tick species, with LDA achieving the best performance when applied to field-collected specimens that did have an existing entry in a reference library of arthropod protein spectra. These findings contribute to the growing literature that ascertains mass spectrometry as a rapid and effective method for taxonomic identification of disease vectors, which is the first step to predict and manage arthropod-borne pathogens.Author Summary Hard ticks (Ixodidae) are external parasites that feed on the blood of almost every species of terrestrial vertebrate on earth, including humans. Due to a complete dependency on blood, both sexes and even immature stages, are capable of transmitting disease agents to their hosts, causing distress and sometimes death. Despite the public health significance of ixodid ticks, accurate species identification remains problematic. Vector species identification is core to developing effective vector control schemes. Herein, we provide the first report of MALDI identification of several species of field-collected Neotropical tick specimens preserved in ethanol for up to four years. Our methodology shows that identification does not depend on a commercial reference library of lab-reared samples, but with the help of machine learning it can rely on a self-curated reference library. In addition, our approach offers greater accuracy and lower cost per sample than conventional and modern identification approaches such as morphology and molecular barcoding.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.List of abbreviationsMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationPCAprincipal component analysisLDAlinear discriminant analysisDNAdeoxyribonucleic acidINDICASATInstitute for Scientific Research and High Technology ServicesSTRISmithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSNINational System of InvestigationUTPTechnological University of PanamaTOFtime-of-flightMiAmbienteMinistry of Environment.View Full Text",

In this study, we investigated potential epigenetic inhibitors against HMTases through in silico approaches, including ensembled molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS).We identified three candidate compounds, including echinomycin, emetine, and streptonigrin, which showed interactions with HMTases. Echinomycin showed similar binding affinity with H3K4-HMTase NSD3 and H3K9-HMTase SETDB1 but streptonigrin and emetine had preferential binding affinity with NSD3 and SETDB1, respectively. The binding of NSD3 to streptonigrin and echinomycin and binding of SETDB1 to emetine and echinomycin were further confirmed by the results of hydrogen bonding profile and MM/PBSA calculations. Together, our results uncover the binding affinities of echinomycin, emetine, and streptonigrin with histone methyltransferases, and suggest that these compounds are potential epigenetic inhibitors regulating cell activities.",

Our results indicate that a 2-C to 4-C atom linker enables its respective bisubstrate analog to occupy both substrate and cofactor binding sites of NTMT1, but the bisubstrate analog with a 5-C atom linker only interacts with the substrate binding site and functions as a substrate. Furthermore, the 4-C atom linker is the optimal and produces the most potent inhibitor (Ki, app = 130 {+/-} 40 pM) for NTMT1 to date, displaying over 100,000-fold selectivity over other methyltransferases and 3,000-fold even to its homolog NTMT2.

The proportion of female fellows and keynote speakers was similar to that of the field overall. However, names of East Asian origin have been persistently underrepresented among fellows and keynote speakers. Moreover, fellows and keynote speakers with an affiliation in the United States were overrepresented by a factor of 2.1; almost two thirds of this excess was accounted for by a deficit of 101 fellows and keynote authors from China, India, France and Italy. Within the US, we found an excess of white fellows and keynote speakers and a depletion of Asian fellows and keynote speakers.",

    "abstract": "A major barrier to the successful application of nanotechnology for cancer treatment is the efficient delivery of therapeutic payloads to metastatic tumor deposits. We have previously discovered that cabozantinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, triggers neutrophil-mediated anti-cancer innate immunity, resulting in tumor regression in an aggressive PTEN/p53-deficient genetically engineered murine model of advanced prostate cancer. Here, we specifically investigated the potential of cabozantinib-induced neutrophil activation and recruitment to enhance delivery of bovine serum albumin (BSA)-coated polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) into murine PTEN/p53-deficient prostate tumors. Based on the observation that BSA-coating of NPs enhanced association and internalization by activated neutrophils in vitro, relative to uncoated NPs, we systemically injected BSA-coated, dye-loaded NPs into prostate-specific PTEN/p53-deficient mice that were pre-treated with cabozantinib. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a 4-fold increase of neutrophil-associated NPs within the tumor microenvironment (TME) of mice pre-treated with cabozantinib relative to untreated controls. At steady-state, following 3 days of cabozantinib/NP administration, 1% of systemically injected dye-loaded NPs selectively accumulated within the TME of mice that were pre-treated with cabozantinib, compared to 0.11% uptake for mice that did not receive cabozantinib pre-treatment. Strikingly, neutrophil depletion with Ly6G antibody abolished NP accumulation in tumors to baseline levels, demonstrating targeted neutrophil-mediated NP delivery to the prostate TME. In summary, we have discovered a novel nano-immunotherapeutic strategy for enhanced intratumoral delivery of injected NPs, which results in significantly higher NP accumulation than reported strategies in the nanotechnology literature to-date.",

To address this issue, we built upon published methods to develop an improved protocol with our discovery that doxycycline dramatically enhances the iPSC to endoderm differentiation efficiency by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting proliferation via the AKT pathway. We tested this new protocol in more than 70 iPSC lines with consistent formation of complete sheets of endoderm in 90%. Endoderm generated by our method achieves similar transcriptomic profiles, including FOXA2, HNF1{beta}, CXCR4, and SOX17 positive cells, and the ability to be further differentiated. Furthermore this method achieves a four-fold increase in endoderm cell number and will accelerate studies of human diseases in vitro and facilitate the expansion of iPSC-derived cells for transplantation studies.",

But to what extent does their aetiology also vary from place to place?\n\nMethodsWe applied a novel spatial approach to data on autistic traits from two large twin studies, the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS; N=16,677, including 8,307 twin pairs) and the Twins Early Development Study in the UK (TEDS; N=11,594, including 5,796 twin pairs), to explore how the influence of nature and nurture on autistic traits varies from place to place.\n\nResultsWe present maps of gene- and environment-by geography interactions in Sweden and the United Kingdom (UK), showing geographical variation in both genetic and environmental influences across the two countries. In Sweden genetic influences appear higher in the far south and in a band running across the centre of the country. Environmental influences appear greatest in the south and north, with reduced environmental influence across the central band. In the UK genetic influences appear greater in the south, particularly in more central southern areas and the southeast, the Midlands and the north of England. Environmental influences appear greatest in the south and east of the UK, with less influence in the north and the west.\n\nConclusionsWe hope this systematic approach to identifying aetiological interactions will inspire research to examine a wider range of previously unknown environmental influences on the aetiology of autistic traits. By doing so, we will gain greater understanding of how these environments draw out or mask genetic predisposition and interact with other environmental influences in the development of autistic traits.",

Both show deficits in inhibitory control, which are associated with altered functioning and glutamate concentrations in the fronto-striatal circuitry. These parameters have never been examined together. Here we, for the first time, used a multi-center, longitudinal approach to investigate fronto-striatal functioning during an inhibitory control task and its association with fronto-striatal glutamate concentrations across these two disorders.\n\nMethods74 adolescents with ASD (24) or OCD (15) and controls (35) aged 8-17 were recruited across three sites of the European TACTICS consortium. They underwent two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sessions with a one-year interval. This included proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS; n=74) and functional MRI during an inhibitory control task (n=57). We used linear mixed effects models to investigate, over time, the relationship between fronto-striatal functioning and glutamate concentrations across these groups and continuous measures of overlapping compulsivity symptoms.\n\nResultsDuring failed inhibitory control, in OCD increased striatal glutamate was associated with increased neural activation of ACC, an effect that decreased over time. During successful inhibitory control, higher ACC glutamate was positively associated with striatal activation in OCD and compulsivity across time. ACC glutamate levels decreased over time in the ASD group compared to controls, while striatal glutamate decreased over time, independent of diagnosis.\n\nConclusionsSignificant differences in fronto-striatal glutamate were observed in ASD and OCD, affecting functional activity during failed- and successful inhibitory control differently, especially in OCD, with effects changing over time.",

Adult mosquitoes surviving through this season must dramatically extend their typical lifespan (averaging 2-3 weeks) to 7 months. Previous work has found evidence that the malaria mosquito An. coluzzii, survives over 200 days in the wild between rainy seasons in a presumed state of aestivation (hibernation), but this state has so far not been replicated in laboratory conditions. The inability to recapitulate aestivation in the lab hinders addressing key questions such as how this state is induced, how it affects malaria vector competence, and its impact on disease transmission.\n\nMethodsWe compared survivorship of mosquitoes in climate-controlled incubators that adjusted humidity (40-85% RH), temperature (18-27 {degrees}C), and light conditions (8-12 hours of light). A range of conditions were chosen to mimic the late rainy and dry seasons as well as relevant extremes these mosquitoes may experience during aestivation.\n\nResultsWe found that by priming mosquitoes in conditions simulating the late wet season in Mali, and maintaining mosquitoes in reduced light/temperature, mean mosquito survival increased from 18.34 +/- 0.65 to 48.02 +/- 2.87 days, median survival increased from 19 (95% CI: 17-21) to 50 days (95% CI: 40-58), and the maximum longevity increased from 38 to 109 days (p-adj < 0.001). While this increase falls short of the 200+ day survival seen in field mosquitoes, this extension is substantially higher than previously found through environmental or dietary modulation and is hard to reconcile with states other than aestivation. Future work will expand on these findings, looking to further extend the gains in life span while also investigating transcriptional changes in genes affecting aging, metabolism, and epigenetic regulation; hormone and nutrient levels; and vector competence for malaria causing parasites.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=94 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/031799v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7dc905org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@189bd4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19ea253org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b32a3d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "RationaleMonocytes and macrophages have a critical and dual role in post-ischemic cardiac repair, as they can foster both tissue healing and damage. To decipher how monocytes/macrophages acquire heterogeneous functional phenotypes in the ischemic myocardium, we profiled the gene expression dynamics at the single-cell level in circulating and cardiac monocytes/macrophages following experimental myocardial infarction (MI) in mice.\n\nMethods and resultsUsing time-series single-cell transcriptome and cell surface epitope analysis of blood and cardiac monocytes/macrophages, as well as the integration of publicly available and independently generated single-cell RNA-seq data, we tracked the transitions in circulating and cardiac monocyte/macrophage states from homeostatic conditions up to 11 days after MI in mice. We show that MI induces marked and rapid transitions in the cardiac mononuclear phagocyte population, with almost complete disappearance of tissue resident macrophages 1 day after ischemia, and rapid infiltration of monocytes that locally acquire discrete and time-dependent transcriptional states within 3 to 7 days. Ischemic injury induced a shift of circulating monocytes towards granulocyte-like transcriptional features (Chil3, Lcn2, Prtn3). Trajectory inference analysis indicated that while conversion to Ly6Clow monocytes appears as the default fate of Ly6Chi monocytes in the blood, infiltrated monocytes acquired diverse gene expression signatures in the injured heart, notably transitioning to two main MI-associated macrophage populations characterized by MHCIIhi and Trem2hiIgf1hi gene expression signatures. Minor ischemia-associated macrophage populations with discrete gene expression signature suggesting specialized functions in e.g. iron handling or lipid metabolism were also observed. We further identified putative transcriptional regulators and new cell surface markers of cardiac monocyte/macrophage states.\n\nConclusionsAltogether, our work provides a comprehensive landscape of circulating and cardiac monocyte/macrophage states and their regulators after MI, and will help to further understand their contribution to post-myocardial infarction heart repair.",

    "abstract": "When choosing between options, such as food items presented in plain view, people tend to choose the option they spend longer looking at. The prevailing interpretation is that visual attention increases value. However, in previous studies,  value was coupled to a behavioural goal, since subjects had to choose the item they preferred. This makes it impossible to discern if visual attention has an effect on value, or, instead, if attention modulates the information most relevant for the goal of the decision-maker. Here we present the results of two independent studies--a perceptual and a value-based task--that allow us to decouple value from goal-relevant information using specific task-framing. Combining psychophysics with computational modelling, we show that, contrary to the current interpretation, attention does not boost value, but instead it modulates goal-relevant information. This work provides a novel and more general mechanism by which attention interacts with choice.",

    "abstract": "Steroidogenesis in adrenals and gonads starts from cholesterol transport to mitochondria by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein STARD1, containing a mitochondrial import sequence followed by a cholesterol-binding START domain. Although mutations in this protein have been linked to lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the mechanism of steroidogenesis regulation by the STARD1 remains debatable, hypothetically involving a molten-globule structural transition and interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. We show that, while the isolated START domain does not interact with 14-3-3, interaction is enabled by STARD1 phosphorylation at Ser57, close to the mitochondrial peptide cleavage site. Biochemical analysis of the STARD1 affinity towards 14-3-3 and crystal structures of 14-3-3 complexes with Ser57 and Ser195 phosphopeptides, suggest distinct roles of site-specific phosphorylations in recruiting 14-3-3, to modulate STARD1 activity, processing and import to mitochondria. Phosphorylation at Ser195 creates a unique conditional site, that could only bind to 14-3-3 upon partial unfolding of the START domain.",

A convolutional autoencoder (CAE) was trained on defined pictures and successfully used to identify apoptotic cells in vivo. However, unexpectedly, these analyses also revealed that the great majority of PS+ cells were not apoptotic, but rather live cells associated with PS+ extracellular vesicles (EVs). During acute viral infection apoptotic cells increased slightly, while up to 30% of lymphocytes were decorated with PS+ EVs of Dendritic cell exosomal origin.

We demonstrate its remarkable performance across different coverages and human populations. It achieves imputation of a full genome for less than $1, outperforming existing methods by orders of magnitude, with an increased accuracy of more than 20% at rare variants.

Single-targeted knockdown of miR-21 and CXCR4, as well as double-targeted knockdown of miR-21 and CXCR4 lentiviral vectors were constructed and they were transfected to U87 and U251 cells. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration from different treatment groups were assessed by MTT assay, Flow Cytometry analysis, Transwell analysis, and Scratch assay, respectively. U87 xenograft mice were constructed to detect roles and potential mechanisms of miR-21 and CXCR4 in malignant glioma tumor growth.\n\nResultsThe expression of miR-21 and CXCR4 was increased in tumor tissues and cell lines. Inhibition of miR-21, CXCR4, and miR-21 and CXCR4 together all reduced the migration, invasiveness, proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in glioma cells, as well as reduced tumor volume and mass in xenograft model.

    "abstract": "Understanding how species are non-randomly distributed in space, as well as how the resulting spatial structure of diversity responds to ecological, biogeographic and anthropogenic drivers is a critical piece of the biodiversity puzzle. However, most metrics that quantify the spatial structure of diversity (i.e., community differentiation), such as Whittakers classical {beta}-diversity metric are influenced by sampling effects. As a result, these measures are influenced by species pool size, species abundance distributions and numbers of individuals. Null models have been proposed to evaluate the degree of differentiation among communities due to spatial structuring relative to that expected from sampling effects. However, to date, these null models do not accommodate the influence of sample completeness (i.e. the proportion of the species pool in the sample). Here, we develop an approach that makes use of individual- and coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation. Using spatially explicit simulations, we show that our derived metric, {beta}C, captures changes in intraspecific aggregation independently of changes in the species pool size. We then provide two case studies examining spatial structure in forest plots spanning latitudinal gradients: (1) a re-analysis of the \"Gentry\" plot dataset, and (2) comparing a high diversity plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama with a low diversity plot in Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. We find no evidence for systematic changes in spatial structure with latitude in these datasets. As it is rooted in biodiversity sampling theory and explicitly controls for sample completeness, our approach represents an important advance over existing null models for spatial aggregation. Potential applications of the approach range from better descriptors of biogeographic diversity patterns to the consolidation of local and regional diversity trends in the current biodiversity crisis.\n\nOpen research statementThe novel code for the calculation of {beta}C can be found in supplementary material S4. Empirical data sets utilized for this research are as follows: Phillips & Miller (2002), Orwig et al. (2015), Condit et al. (2019).

    "abstract": "Nairobi Sheep Disease virus (NSDv) is a zoonotic and tick-borne disease that can cause over 90% mortality in small ruminants. NSDv has historically circulated in East Africa and has recently emerged in the Asian continent. Despite efforts to control the disease, some regions, mostly in warmer climates, persistently report disease outbreaks. Consequently, it is necessary to understand how environmental tolerances and factors that influence transmission may shed light on its possible emergence in other regions. In this study, we quantified the available literature of NSDv from which occurrence data was extracted. In total, 308 locations from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia, India, Sri Lanka and China were coupled with landscape conditions to reconstruct the ecological conditions for NSDv circulation and identify areas of potential disease transmission risk. Our results identified areas suitable for NSDv in Ethiopia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Southeastern China, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Unsuitable areas included Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and Southern Somalia. In summary, soil moisture, livestock density, and precipitation predispose certain areas to NSDv circulation. It is critical to investigate the epidemiology of NSDv in order to promote better allocation of resources to control its spread in regions that are more at risk. This will help reduce disease impact worldwide as climate change will favor emergence of such vector-borne diseases in areas with dense small ruminant populations.",

The use of Colorado potato beetles (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) as a model insect species has shown that the changing dimensions of cuticular ridges on plant leaves during ontogeny have a significant impact on insect traction forces and act as an effective indirect defence mechanism. The traction forces of walking insects are significantly lower on mature leaf surfaces compared with young leaf surfaces. The measured walking traction forces exhibit a strong negative correlation with the dimensions of the cuticular ridges.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFleas (Insecta: Siphonaptera) are small flightless parasites of birds and mammals; their blood-feeding can transmit many serious pathogens (i.e. the etiological agents of bubonic plague, endemic and murine typhus). The lack of flea genome assemblies has hindered research, especially comparisons to other disease vectors. Accordingly, we sequenced the genome of the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, an insect with substantial human health and veterinary importance across the globe.\n\nResultsBy combining Illumina and PacBio sequencing with Hi-C scaffolding techniques, we generated a chromosome-level genome assembly for C. felis. Unexpectedly, our assembly revealed extensive gene duplication across the entire genome, exemplified by [~]38% of protein-coding genes with two or more copies and over 4,000 tRNA genes. A broad range of genome size determinations (433-551 Mb) for individual fleas sampled across different populations supports the widespread presence of fluctuating copy number variation (CNV) in C. felis. Similarly broad genome sizes were also calculated for individuals of Xenopsylla cheopis (Oriental rat flea), indicating that this remarkable \"genome-in-flux\" phenomenon could be a siphonapteran-wide trait. Finally, from the C. felis sequence reads we also generated closed genomes for two novel strains of Wolbachia, one parasitic and one symbiotic, found to co-infect individual fleas.\n\nConclusionRampant CNV in C. felis has dire implications for gene-targeting pest control measures and stands to complicate standard normalization procedures utilized in comparative transcriptomics analysis. Coupled with co-infection by novel Wolbachia endosymbionts - potential tools for blocking pathogen transmission - these oddities highlight a unique and underappreciated disease vector.",

    "abstract": "Schistosome eggs provoke the formation of granulomas, organized immune aggregates, around them. For the host, the granulomatous response can be both protective and pathological. Granulomas are also postulated to facilitate egg extrusion through the gut lumen, a necessary step for parasite transmission. We used zebrafish larvae to visualize the granulomatous response to Schistosoma mansoni eggs and inert egg-sized beads. Mature eggs rapidly recruit macrophages, which form granulomas within days. Egg-sized inert beads also induce granulomas rapidly, through a foreign body response. Strikingly, immature eggs evade macrophage recruitment altogether, revealing that the eggshell is immunological inert. These findings suggest that the parasite modulates the timing of granuloma formation to its advantage, inhibiting foreign body granuloma formation until it reaches the optimal maturation and location for extrusion. At this point, the parasite secretes specific antigens through the eggshell to trigger granulomas that might facilitate egg extrusion.",

    "abstract": "Diverse aerobic bacteria persist by consuming atmospheric hydrogen (H2) using group 1h [NiFe]-hydrogenases. However, other hydrogenase classes are also distributed in aerobes, including the group 2a [NiFe]-hydrogenase. Based on studies focused on Cyanobacteria, the reported physiological role of the group 2a [NiFe]-hydrogenase is to recycle H2 produced by nitrogenase. However, given this hydrogenase is also present in various heterotrophs and lithoautotrophs lacking nitrogenases, it may play a wider role in bacterial metabolism. Here we investigated the role of this enzyme in three species from different phylogenetic lineages and ecological niches: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (phylum Proteobacteria), Chloroflexus aggregans (phylum Chloroflexota), and Gemmatimonas aurantiaca (phylum Gemmatimonadota). qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the group 2a [NiFe]-hydrogenase of all three species is significantly upregulated during exponential growth compared to stationary phase, in contrast to the profile of the persistence-linked group 1h [NiFe]-hydrogenase. Whole-cell biochemical assays confirmed that all three strains aerobically respire H2 to sub-atmospheric levels, and oxidation rates were much higher during growth. Moreover, the oxidation of H2 supported mixotrophic growth of the carbon-fixing strains C. aggregans and A. ferrooxidans. Finally, we used phylogenomic analyses to show that this hydrogenase is widely distributed and is encoded by 13 bacterial phyla. These findings challenge the current persistence-centric model of the physiological role of atmospheric H2 oxidation and extends this process to two more phyla, Proteobacteria and Gemmatimonadota. In turn, these findings have broader relevance for understanding how bacteria conserve energy in different environments and control the biogeochemical cycling of atmospheric trace gases.",

    "abstract": "Little knowledge exists on whether soil bacteria are impacted by cropping systems and disease status in current and predicted climate scenarios. We assessed the impact of soil moisture and temperature, weed communities, and disease status on soil bacterial communities across three cropping systems: conventional no-till (CNT) utilizing synthetic pesticides and herbicides, 2) USDA-certified tilled organic (OT), and 3) USDA-certified organic with sheep grazing (OG). Sampling date within the growing season, and associated soil temperature and moisture, exerted the greatest effect on bacterial communities, followed by cropping system, Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) infection status, and weed community. Soil temperature was negatively associated with bacterial richness and evenness, while soil moisture was positively associated with bacterial richness and evenness. Both soil temperature and moisture altered soil bacterial community similarity. Inoculation with WSMV altered community similarity, and there was a date x virus interaction on bacterial richness in CNT and OT systems, as well as an interaction between WSMV x climate. In May and July, cropping system altered the effect of climate change on the bacterial community composition in hotter, and hotter and drier conditions not treated with WSMV, as compared to ambient conditions. In areas treated with WSMV, there were interactions between cropping system, sampling date, and climate conditions, indicating the effect of multiple stressors on bacterial communities in soil. Overall, this study indicates that predicted climate modifications as well as biological stressors play a fundamental role in the impact of cropping systems on soil bacterial communities.\n\nIMPORTANCEClimate change is affecting global moisture and temperature patterns and its impacts are predicted to worsen over time, posing progressively larger threats on food production. In the Northern Great Plains of the United States, climate change is forecasted to increase temperature and decrease precipitation during the summer, and is expected to negatively affect cereal crop production and pest management. In this study, temperature, soil moisture, weed communities, and disease status had interactive effects with cropping system on bacterial communities. As local climates continue to shift, so too will the dynamics of above- and below-ground associated bio-diversity which will impact food production and the need for more sustainable practices.",

    "abstract": "Between 2017 and 2018, several farms across Bulgaria reported outbreaks of H5 HPAI viruses. In this study we use genomic and traditional epidemiological analyses to trace the origin and subsequent spread of these outbreaks within Bulgaria. Both methods indicate two separate incursions, one restricted to the North-Eastern region of Dobrich, and another largely restricted to Central and Eastern Bulgaria including places such as Plovdiv, Sliven and Stara Zagora, as well as one virus from the Western region of Vidin. Both outbreaks likely originate from different European 2.3.4.4b virus ancestors circulating in 2017. The viruses were likely introduced by wild birds or poultry trade links in 2017 and have continued to circulate, but due to lack of contemporaneous sampling and sequences from wild bird viruses in Bulgaria, the precise route and timing of introduction cannot be determined. Analysis of whole genomes indicates complete lack of reassortment in all segments but the MP, which presents as multiple smaller clusters associated with different European 2.3.4.4b viruses. Ancestral reconstruction of host states of the HA gene of viruses involved in the outbreaks suggests that transmission is driven by domestic ducks into galliform poultry. Thus, according to present evidence we suggest that surveillance of domestic ducks as epidemiologically relevant species for subclinical infection. Monitoring spread due to movement between farms within regions and links to poultry production systems in European countries can help to predict and prevent future outbreaks.",

Previously we found that Serratia, a gut symbiont that alters vector competence and is being considered for vector control, poorly colonized Aedes aegypti yet was abundant in Culex quinquefasciatus reared under identical conditions. To investigate the incompatibility between Serratia and Ae. aegypti, we characterized two distinct strains of Serratia marcescens from Cx. quinquefasciatus and examined their ability to infect Ae. aegypti. Both Serratia strains poorly infected Ae. aegypti, but when microbiome homeostasis was disrupted, the prevalence and titers of Serratia were similar to the infection in its native host. Examination of multiple genetically diverse Ae. aegypti lines found microbial interference to S. marcescens was commonplace, however one line of Ae. aegypti was susceptible to infection. Microbiome analysis of resistant and susceptible lines indicated an inverse correlation between Enterobacteriaceae bacteria and Serratia, and experimental co-infections in a gnotobiotic system recapitulated the interference phenotype. Furthermore, we observed an effect on host behaviour; Serratia exposure to Ae. aegypti disrupted their feeding behaviour, and this phenotype was also reliant on interactions with their native microbiota. Our work highlights the complexity of host-microbe interactions and provides evidence that microbial interactions influence mosquito behaviour.",

Evidence suggested that Nogo-66 exert its neurite inhibition effect via a Nogo-66/Protein kinase B (PKB)/Glycogen synthase kinase-3{beta} (GSK-3{beta})/tau signaling pathway. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a serine/threonine kinase mediating axon upstream growth of PKB and GSK-3{beta}. However, the contribution of ILK to the Nogo-66-induced inhibition of neurite, is not clear. In this study, we set out to reveal the role of ILK on Nogo-66 signaling in vitro and in vivo. To deteremine this directly, Recombinant adenoviruses were constructed to upregulate or downregulate the expresioon of ILK in Neuro 2a (N2a)and analysis the change of downstream molecule and neurite length. The results showed that Nogo-66 inhibited the phosphorylation of ILK, while ILK regulated the phosphorylation of PKB and GSK-3{beta}, and the expression of tau in Nogo-66-treated N2a cells. ILK overexpression through lentivirus vector transfection reduced the inhibitory effect of neurite outgrowth induced by Nogo-66 in cortical neurons. The Tau expression in the complete spinal cord transection rat model was promoted by the overexpression of ILK. Our findings indicated that ILK is a key signal factor involved in Nogo-66-induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth. The mechanism of Nogo-66 signaling pathway was further explained and a proper target for the promotion of neural regeneration was also provided by this study.",

Cold acclimation comprises and affects numerous molecular and physiological processes and the maintenance of sugar supply of sink tissue by photosynthetically active source tissue is preliminary for plant survival. Here, we analysed the correlation of changes in vascular bundle structure at the leaf petiole and sucrose exudation rates before and after cold acclimation. We compared six natural Arabidopsis accessions originating from southern and northern Europe. Photosynthetic capacities, i.e. maximum and effective quantum yield of photosystem II, revealed a significant effect of condition but not of genotype. Only for northern accessions we observed a highly significant negative correlation between leaf sucrose exudation rates, xylem and petiole cross section areas. Further, only for northern accessions we observed a significant increase of vascular bundle and leaf petiole cross section area during cold acclimation. In contrast, variance of cross section areas of cold acclimated southern accessions was strongly reduced compared to control plants while mean areas remained similar under both conditions. In summary, our findings suggest that natural Arabidopsis accessions from northern Europe significantly adjust sink strength and leaf vascular bundle structure to stabilize plant growth and photosynthesis for survival under low and freezing temperature.",

We experimentally tested the differences in feather structure, primarily stiffness and size, between (a) wild and captive Barnacle Geese Branta leucopsis, and (b) primary feathers dropped during the annual flight feather moult, and those feathers freshly regrown during the moult process. We found that, despite having undergone a 5,000km round-trip migration, flight feathers dropped during moult in the wild geese were stiffer than those measured in the captive geese, both for those dropped during moult and those re-grown.

    "abstract": "Molecular motors are cellular machines that drive the spatial organisation of the cells by transporting cargoes along intracellular filaments. Although the mechanical properties of single molecular motors are relatively well characterised, it remains elusive how the three-dimensional geometry of a load imposed on a motor affects its processivity, i.e., the average distance that a motor moves per interaction with a filament. Here, we theoretically explore this question for a single kinesin molecular motor by analysing the load-dependence of the stepping and detachment processes. We find that the processivity of kinesin increases with lowering the load angle between kinesin and microtubule filament, due to the deceleration of the detachment rate. When the load angle is large, the processivity is predicted to enhance with accelerating the stepping rate, through an optimal distribution of the load over the kinetic transition rates underlying a mechanical step of the motor. These results provide new insights into understanding of the design of potential synthetic biomolecular machines that can travel long distances with high velocities.",

    "abstract": "Viral genetic variants are widely known to influence disease progression among infected humans. Given the recent and rapid emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of COVID-19 disease, viral protein variants have attracted research interest. However, little has yet been written about genetic risk factors among human hosts. Human genetic variation has proven to affect disease progression and outcome for important diseases such as HIV infection and malaria infestation. The fact that the human ACE2 protein is encoded on the X chromosome means that males who carry rare ACE2 coding variants will express those variants in all ACE2-expressing cells, whereas females will typically express those variants in a mosaic distribution determined by early X-inactivation events. This sex-based difference in ACE2 expression has unique implications for epidemiological studies designed to assess host genetic factors influencing progression from asymptomatic SARS-coV-2 infection to COVID-19. Here we present theoretical modelling of rare ACE2 coding variants documented to occur naturally in several human superpopulations and subpopulations, and show that rare variants predicted to affect the binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exist in people. Though the rs4646116 (p.Lys26Arg) allele is found in 1 in 70 Ashkenazi Jewish males, and in 1 in 172 non-Finnish European males, this allele is found at higher frequencies in females. Furthermore, the class of missense ACE2 alleles predicted to affect SARS-CoV-2 binding are found in aggregate among 1.43% and 2.16% of Ashkenazi males and females, respectively, as well as in 0.58% and 1.24% of European males and females outside of Finland. These alleles are rarer in other population groups, and almost absent from East Asians genotyped to date.\n\nThough we are aware that full genome-wide and exome-wide sequencing studies may ultimately be required to assess human genetic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 fully, we argue on the basis of strong prior probabilities that genotyping of this class of alleles is justified in cases of atypical SARS-CoV-2 diseases, such as asymptomatic super-spreaders (if any are identified), and in neonatal/paediatric-onset COVID-19 disease. Even relatively rare susceptibility factors (1% or fewer carriers) may become quantitatively important in the context of hundreds of thousands of infections. A small number of asymptomatic carriers, or a small number of super-spreaders, or a small segment of the population that is disproportionately likely to require intensive care, can magnify the medical, social and economic impacts of a pandemic of this size. The speed of the pandemic and the large number of affected cases worldwide justify efforts to identify all possible risk factors for adverse outcomes, including efforts to identify genetic susceptibility factors in human hosts.",

We devised a quantitative measure to estimate genetic determinants of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and applied this measure to >2,500 individuals. Our data show significant variability in genetic determinants of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression among individuals and between populations, and demonstrate a genetic predisposition for lower expression levels of both key viral entry genes in African populations. These data suggest that genetic factors might lead to lower susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection in African populations and that host genetics might help explain inter-individual variability in disease susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Human infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and there is currently no cure. The 3C-like protease (3CLpro), a highly conserved protease indispensable for replication of coronaviruses, is a promising target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. To advance the speed of drug discovery and development, we investigated the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by natural products derived from Chinese traditional medicines. Baicalin and baicalein were identified as the first non-covalent, non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system. Remarkably, the binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro determined by X-ray protein crystallography is distinctly different from those of known inhibitors. Baicalein is perfectly ensconced in the core of the substrate-binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues, the crucial S1/S2 subsites and the oxyanion loop, acting as a \"shield\" in front of the catalytic dyad to prevent the peptide substrate approaching the active site. The simple chemical structure, unique mode of action, and potent antiviral activities in vitro, coupled with the favorable safety data from clinical trials, emphasize that baicalein provides a great opportunity for the development of critically needed anti-coronaviral drugs.",

    "abstract": "The entire world has recently witnessed the commencement of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. It is caused by a novel coronavirus (n-CoV) generally distinguished as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has exploited human vulnerabilities to coronavirus outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 promotes fatal chronic respiratory disease followed by multiple organ failure which ultimately puts an end to human life. No proven vaccine for n-CoV is available till date in spite of significant research efforts worldwide. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has reached to a consensus that the virus SARS-CoV-2 is highly genetically similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak of 2003. It has been reported that SARS-CoV has [~]89% genetic similarities with n-CoV. With this hypothesis, the current work focuses on the identification of spreader nodes in SARS-CoV protein interaction network. Various network characteristics like edge ratio, neighborhood density and node weight have been explored for defining a new feature spreadability index by virtue of which spreader nodes and edges are identified. The selected top spreader nodes having high spreadability index have been also validated by Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) disease model. Initially, the proposed method is applied on a synthetic protein interaction network followed by SARS-CoV-human protein interaction network. Hence, key spreader nodes and edges (ranked edges) are unmasked in SARS-CoV proteins and its connected level 1 and level 2 human proteins. The new network attribute spreadability index along with generated SIS values of selected top spreader nodes when compared with the other network centrality based methodologies like Degree centrality (DC), Closeness centrality (CC), Local average centrality (LAC) and Betweeness centrality (BC) is found to perform relatively better than the existing-state-of-art.",

    "abstract": "One of the challenges in the current COVID-19 crisis is the time and cost of performing tests especially for large-scale population surveillance. Since, the probability of testing positive in large population studies is expected to be small (<15%), therefore, most of the test outcomes will be negative. Here, we propose the use of agglomerative sampling which can prune out multiple negative cases in a single test by intelligently combining samples from different individuals. The proposed scheme builds on the assumption that samples from the population may not be independent of each other. Our simulation results show that the proposed sampling strategy can significantly increase testing capacity under resource constraints: on average, a saving of ~40% tests can be expected assuming a positive test probability of 10% across the given samples. The proposed scheme can also be used in conjunction with heuristic or Machine Learning guided clustering for improving the efficiency of large-scale testing further.

The COVID-19 is the etiologic agent of a recently arose disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Presently, there is no vaccine available against this emerged viral disease. Therefore, it is indeed a need of the hour to develop an effectual and safe vaccine against this decidedly pandemic disease. In the current study, we collected SARS-CoV-2 genome which is prominent in India against human host, further more using reverse vaccinology here we claim effective vaccine candidates that can be mile stone in battle against COVID19. This novel study divulged one promising antigenic peptide GVYFASTEK from surface glycoprotein (protein accession no. - QIA98583.1) of SARS-CoV-2, which was predicated to be interacted with MHC alleles and showed up to 90% conservancy and high value of antigenicity. Subsequently, the molecular docking and simulation studies were verified molecular interaction of this prime antigenic peptide with the residues of HLA-A*11-01 allele for MHC Class I. After vigorous analysis, this peptide was predicted to be suitable epitope which is capable to induce the strong cell-mediated immune response against the SARS-CoV-2. Consequences from the current study could facilitate selecting SARS-CoV-2 epitopes for vaccine production pipelines in the immediate future. This novel research will certainly pave the way for a fast, reliable and virtuous platform to provide timely countermeasure of this dangerous pandemic disease, COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The spread of SARS-CoV-2 since December 2019 has become a pandemic and impacted many aspects of human society. Here, we analyzed genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 and its related coronavirus and found the evidence of intergenomic recombination. After correction for mutational bias, analysis of 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of 2/23/2020 revealed the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites which is consistent with recent origin of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection. The sequence similarity of the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being recently noticed. Data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and reveal critical steps required for effective spreading. Two mutations, 84S in orf8 protein and 251V in orf3 protein, occurred coincidentally with human intervention. The 84S first appeared on 1/5/2020 and reached a plateau around 1/23/2020, the lockdown of Wuhan. 251V emerged on 1/21/2020 and rapidly increased its frequency. Thus, the roles of these mutations on infectivity need to be elucidated. Genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 collected from China was two time higher than those derived from the rest of the world. In addition, in network analysis, haplotypes collected from Wuhan city were at interior and have more mutational connections, both of which are consistent with the observation that the outbreak of cov-19 was originated from China.\n\nSUMMARYIn contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief epidemic, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection.

Focusing on genes implicated in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, we observed an increase in the proportion of alveolar epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in adult compared to young lungs. Consistent with expression dynamics, 10 chromatin peaks linked to TMPRSS2 exhibited significantly increased activity with age and harbored IRF and STAT binding sites. Furthermore, we identified 14 common sequence variants in age-increasing peaks with predicted regulatory function, including several associated with respiratory traits and TMPRSS2 expression. Our findings reveal a plausible contributor to why children are more resistant to COVID-19 and provide an epigenomic basis for transferring this resistance to older populations.",

    "abstract": "The rising threat of pandemic viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, requires development of new preclinical discovery platforms that can more rapidly identify therapeutics that are active in vitro and also translate in vivo. Here we show that human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture devices lined by highly differentiated human primary lung airway epithelium and endothelium can be used to model virus entry, replication, strain-dependent virulence, host cytokine production, and recruitment of circulating immune cells in response to infection by respiratory viruses with great pandemic potential. We provide a first demonstration of drug repurposing by using oseltamivir in influenza A virus-infected organ chip cultures and show that co-administration of the approved anticoagulant drug, nafamostat, can double oseltamivirs therapeutic time window. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Airway Chips were used to assess the inhibitory activities of approved drugs that showed inhibition in traditional cell culture assays only to find that most failed when tested in the Organ Chip platform. When administered in human Airway Chips under flow at a clinically relevant dose, one drug - amodiaquine - significantly inhibited infection by a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus. Proof of concept was provided by showing that amodiaquine and its active metabolite (desethylamodiaquine) also significantly reduce viral load in both direct infection and animal-to-animal transmission models of native SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. These data highlight the value of Organ Chip technology as a more stringent and physiologically relevant platform for drug repurposing, and suggest that amodiaquine should be considered for future clinical testing.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAT), such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), are good alternatives to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification assays, especially for point-of-care and low resource use, in part because they can be carried out with relatively simple instrumentation. However, iNATs can generate spurious amplicons, especially in the absence of target sequences, resulting in false positive results. This is especially true if signals are based on non-sequence-specific probes, such as intercalating dyes or pH changes. In addition, pathogens often prove to be moving, evolving targets, and can accumulate mutations that will lead to inefficient primer binding and thus false negative results. Internally redundant assays targeting different regions of the target sequence can help to reduce such false negatives. Here we describe rapid conversion of three previously described SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assays that relied on non-sequence-specific readout into assays that can be visually read using sequence-specific fluorogenic oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes. We evaluate one-pot operation of both individual and multiplex LAMP-OSD assays and demonstrate detection of SARS-CoV-2 virions in crude human saliva.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

This study aimed to use a pressure-sensing walkway to identify characteristics of species-specific quadrupedal locomotion in rhesus monkeys. A total of nine healthy adult female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were used for gait analysis. We measured the temporo-spatial and kinetic parameters of quadrupedal gait using a custom-built pressure-sensing walkway and compared the left- and right-side parameters to assess the symmetry of the gait pattern. All temporo-spatial and kinetic parameter values showed no significant differences among the nine rhesus monkeys for both the forelimbs and hindlimbs. However, significant differences were observed between forelimb and hindlimb kinetic parameters such as peak vertical force, vertical impulse, and the percentage of body weight distribution. All kinetic parameter values were higher for the forelimbs than for the hindlimbs. These data indicated that the center of gravity in healthy rhesus monkeys is located at the forelimbs rather than at the hindlimbs while walking. Furthermore, the symmetry indices considered for symmetric gait pattern showed a low variability. Most median symmetry index values were nearly zero, indicating no difference between the right and left sides. This study described valid methods for assessing gait parameters and demonstrated rhesus-specific characteristics of quadrupedal locomotion, providing a basis for the assessment of gait normality in rhesus monkeys.",

Proliferation among the cells that will functionally restore injured tissues is a fundamental biological process underlying regeneration. Midkine-a is a cytokine growth factor, whose expression is strongly induced by injury in a variety of tissues across a range of vertebrate classes. Using a zebrafish Midkine-a loss of function mutant, we evaluated regeneration of caudal fin, extraocular muscle and retinal neurons to investigate the function of Midkine-a during epimorphic regeneration. In wildtype zebrafish, injury among these tissues induces robust proliferation and rapid regeneration. In Midkine-a mutants, the initial proliferation in each of these tissues is significantly diminished or absent. Regeneration of the caudal fin and extraocular muscle is delayed; regeneration of the retina is nearly completely absent. These data demonstrate that Midkine-a is universally required in the signaling pathways that convert tissue injury into the initial burst of cell proliferation. Further, these data highlight differences in the molecular mechanisms that regulate epimorphic regeneration in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Mapping of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) reads to a single arbitrary reference genome is a frequently used approach in microbial genomics. However, the choice of a reference may represent a source of errors that may affect subsequent analyses such as the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phylogenetic inference. In this work, we evaluated the effect of reference choice on short-read sequence data from five clinically and epidemiologically relevant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens). Publicly available whole-genome assemblies encompassing the genomic diversity of these species were selected as reference sequences, and read alignment statistics, SNP calling, recombination rates, dN/dS ratios, and phylogenetic trees were evaluated depending on the mapping reference. The choice of different reference genomes proved to have an impact on almost all the parameters considered in the five species. In addition, these biases had potential epidemiological implications such as including/excluding isolates of particular clades and the estimation of genetic distances. These findings suggest that the single reference approach might introduce systematic errors during mapping that affect subsequent analyses, particularly for data sets with isolates from genetically diverse backgrounds. In any case, exploring the effects of different references on the final conclusions is highly recommended.\n\nAuthor summaryMapping consists in the alignment of reads (i.e., DNA fragments) obtained through high-throughput genome sequencing to a previously assembled reference sequence. It is a common practice in genomic studies to use a single reference for mapping, usually the  reference genome of a species --a high-quality assembly. However, the selection of an optimal reference is hindered by intrinsic intra-species genetic variability, particularly in bacteria. Biases/errors due to reference choice for mapping in bacteria have been identified. These are mainly originated in alignment errors due to genetic differences between the reference genome and the read sequences. Eventually, they could lead to misidentification of variants and biased reconstruction of phylogenetic trees (which reflect ancestry between different bacterial lineages). However, a systematic work on the effects of reference choice in different bacterial species is still missing, particularly regarding its impact on phylogenies. This work intended to fill that gap. The impact of reference choice has proved to be pervasive in the five bacterial species that we have studied and, in some cases, alterations in phylogenetic trees could lead to incorrect epidemiological inferences. Hence, the use of different reference genomes may be prescriptive to assess the potential biases of mapping.",

Antibody structures have become an integral part of predicting the behavior of potential therapeutics, either directly or as the basis of modeling. Structures of Fab:antigen complexes have even greater value. While the crystallization and structure determination of Fabs is easy relative to many other protein classes, especially membrane proteins, broad screening and optimization of crystalline hits is still necessary. Through a comprehensive review of rabbit Fab crystal contacts and their incompatibility with human Fab structures, we identified a small secondary structural element from the rabbit light chain constant domain potentially responsible for hindering the crystallization of human Fabs. Upon replacing the human kappa constant domain FG loop (HQGLSSP) with the two residue shorter rabbit loop (QGTTS), we dramatically improved the crystallization of human Fabs and Fab:antigen complexes. Our design, which we call \"Crystal Kappa\", enables rapid crystallization of human fabs and fab complexes in a broad range of conditions, with less material in smaller screens or from dilute solutions.",

    "abstract": "In the mammalian gut CD103+ve myeloid DCs are known to suppress inflammation threatened by luminal bacteria, but stimuli driving DC precursor differentiation towards this beneficial phenotype are incompletely understood. We isolated CD11+ve DCs from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of healthy mice; CD103+ve DCs were 8-24 fold more likely than CD103-ve DCs to exhibit extensive of prior phagocytosis of apoptotic intestinal epithelial cells. However, CD103+ve and CD103-ve MLN DCs exhibited similar ex vivo capacity to ingest apoptotic cells, indicating that apoptotic cells might drive immature DC differentiation towards the CD103+ve phenotype. When cultured with apoptotic cells, myeloid DC precursors isolated from murine bone marrow and characterised as lineage-ve CD103-ve, displayed enhanced expression of CD103 and {beta}8 integrin and acquired increased capacity to induce Tregs after 7d in vitro. However, DC precursors isolated from v-tie2 mice lacking v integrins in the myeloid line exhibited reduced binding of apoptotic cells and complete deficiency in the capacity of apoptotic cells and/or latent TGF-{beta}1 to enhance CD103 expression in culture, whereas active TGF-{beta}1 increased DC precursor CD103 expression irrespective of v expression. Fluorescence microscopy revealed clustering of v integrin chains and latent TGF-{beta}1 at points of contact between DC precursors and apoptotic cells. We conclude that myeloid DC precursors can deploy v integrin to orchestrate binding of apoptotic cells, activation of latent TGF-{beta}1 and acquisition of the immunoregulatory CD103+ve {beta}8+ve DC phenotype. This implies that a hitherto unrecognised consequence of apoptotic cell interaction with myeloid phagocytes is programming that prevents inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) that cause severe disease predominantly carry the toxin gene variant stx2a. However, the role of Shiga toxin in the ruminant reservoirs of this zoonotic pathogen is poorly understood and strains that cause severe disease in humans (HUSEC) likely constitute a small and atypical subset of the overall STEC flora. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of stx2a in samples from cattle and to isolate and characterize stx2a-positive E. coli. In nationwide surveys in Sweden and Norway samples were collected from individual cattle or from cattle herds, respectively. Samples were tested for Shiga toxin genes by real-time PCR and amplicon sequencing and stx2a-positive isolates were whole genome sequenced. Among faecal samples from Sweden, stx1 was detected in 37%, stx2 in 53% and stx2a in 5% and in skin samples in 64%, 79% and 2% respectively. In Norway, 79% of the herds were positive for stx1, 93% for stx2 and 17% for stx2a. Based on amplicon sequencing the most common stx2 types in samples from Swedish cattle were stx2a and stx2d. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of 39 stx2a-positive isolates collected from both countries revealed substantial diversity with 19 different sequence types. Only a few classical LEE-positive HUSEC were found among the stx2a-positive isolates, notably a single O121:H19 and an O26:H11. Known LEE-negative HUSEC lineages were also recovered including O113:H21 (ST-223), O130:H11 (ST-297), and O101:H33 (ST-330). We conclude that E. coli encoding stx2a in cattle are ranging from well-known HUSEC to unknown STEC variants. Comparison of isolates from human HUS cases to related STEC from the ruminant reservoirs can help identify combinations of virulence attributes necessary to cause HUS, as well as provide a better understanding of the routes of infection for rare and emerging pathogenic STEC.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition due to a dysregulated immunological response to infection. Apart from source control and broad-spectrum antibiotics, management is based on fluid resuscitation and vasoactive drugs. Fluid resuscitation implicates the risk of volume overload, which in turn is associated with longer stay in intensive care, prolonged use of mechanical ventilation and increased mortality.\n\nAntisecretory factor (AF), an endogenous protein, is detectable in most tissues and in plasma. The biologically active site of the protein is located in an 8-peptide sequence, contained in a synthetic 16-peptide fragment, named AF-16. The protein as well as the peptide AF-16 has multiple modulatory effects on abnormal fluid transport and edema formation/resolution as well as in a variety of inflammatory conditions. Apart from its anti-secretory and anti-inflammatory characteristics, AF is an inhibitor of capillary leakage in intestine. It is not known whether the protein AF or the peptide AF-16 can ameliorate symptoms in sepsis. We hypothesized that AF-16 decreases the degree of hemodynamic instability, the need of fluid resuscitation, vasopressor dose and tissue edema in fecal peritonitis.\n\nTo test the hypothesis, we induced peritonitis and sepsis by injecting autologous fecal solution into abdominal cavity of anesthetized pigs, and randomized (in a blind manner) the animals to intervention (AF-16, n=8) or control (saline, n=8) group. After onset of hemodynamic instability (defined as mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg maintained for > 5 minutes), resuscitation was initiated by an infusion of AF-16 or saline. We recorded respiratory and hemodynamic parameters hourly for twenty hours and collected post mortem tissue samples at the end of the experiment.\n\nNo differences between the groups were observed regarding hemodynamics, fluid balance, lung mechanics, gas exchange or histology. This experimental study suggests that AF-16 does not modulate sepsis symptoms in peritonitis induced sepsis.",

All 22 pairs (100%) exhibited differences. Eighteen pairs (82%) showed differences in at least six methodological sections, while 21 pairs (95%) involved completed difference in at least one section. The median number of differences per review was 8.00 (upper quartile = 6.00, lower quartile = 9.75). The differences involved all 13 compared methodology-related sections. Only 5 (3%) of all differences were explained in the systematic reviews.Conclusions We observed widespread differences between non-Cochrane reviews of nursing and their protocols recorded in PROSPERO, with relatively few explanations for the changes.

    "abstract": "Shear stress induces directed endothelial cell (EC) migration in blood vessels leading to vessel diameter increase and induction of vascular maturation. Other factors, such as EC elongation and interaction between ECs and non-vascular areas are also important. Computational models have previously been used to study collective cell migration. These models can be used to predict EC migration and its effect on vascular remodelling during embryogenesis. We combined live time-lapse imaging of the remodelling vasculature of the quail embryo yolk sac with flow quantification using a combination of micro-Particle Image Velocimetry and computational fluid dynamics. We then used the flow and remodelling data to inform a model of EC migration during remodelling. To obtain the relation between shear stress and velocity in vitro for EC cells, we developed a flow chamber to assess how confluent sheets of ECs migrate in response to shear stress. Using these data as an input, we developed a multiphase, self-propelled particles (SPP) model where individual agents are driven to migrate based on the level of shear stress while maintaining appropriate spatial relationship to nearby agents. These agents elongate, interact with each other, and with avascular agents at each time-step of the model. We compared predicted vascular shape to real vascular shape after 4 hours from our time-lapse movies and performed sensitivity analysis on the various model parameters. Our model shows that shear stress has the largest effect on the remodelling process. Importantly, however, elongation played an especially important part in remodelling. This model provides a powerful tool to study the input of different biological processes on remodelling.\n\nAuthor summaryShear stress is known to play a leading role in endothelial cell (EC) migration and hence, vascular remodelling. Vascular remodelling is, however, more complicated than only EC migration. To achieve a better understanding of this process, we developed a computational model in which, shear stress mediated EC migration has the leading role and other factors, such as avascular regions and EC elongation, are also accounted for. We have tested this model for different vessel shapes during remodelling and could study the role that each of these factors play in remodelling. This model gives us the possibility of addition of other factors such as biochemical signals and angiogenesis which will help us in the study of vascular remodelling in both development and disease.",

    "abstract": "Schistosome infection showed protective effects against allergic airway inflammation (AAI). However, controversial findings exist especially regarding the timing of helminth infection and the underlying mechanisms. Moreover, most previous studies focused on understanding the preventive effect of schistosome infection on asthma (infection before allergen sensitization), while its therapeutic effects (infection after allergen sensitization) were rarely investigated. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of schistosome infection on AAI using a mouse model of OVA induced asthma. To explore how the timing of schistosome infection influences its therapeutic effect, the mice were percutaneously infected with cercaria of Schistosoma japonicum at either 1 day before OVA induced asthma attack (infection at lung-stage during AAI) or 14 days before OVA induced asthma attack (infection at post lung-stage during AAI). We found that lung-stage schistosome infection significantly ameliorated OVA-induced AAI, whereas post lung-stage infection showed no therapeutic effect. Mechanistically, the lung-stage schistosome infection significantly upregulated the frequency of Treg, especially OVA specific Treg, in lung tissue, which negatively correlated with the level of OVA specific IgE. Depletion of Treg in vivo counteracted the therapeutic effect. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of lung tissue showed that lung-stage schistosome infection during AAI shaped the microenvironment to favor Treg induction. In conclusion, our data showed that lung-stage schistosome infection could relieve OVA induced asthma in a mouse model. The therapeutic effect was mediated by the upregulated OVA specific Treg which suppressed IgE production and Th2 cytokine secretion. Our results may facilitate the discovery of a new therapy for AAI.\n\nAuthor SummaryAsthma is an increasingly common disease especially in industrialized countries, which is still lack of an optimal therapy. The protective effect of schistosome infection against allergic asthma has been shown in previous studies, which represents a promising candidate immune intervention approach. However, controversial findings exist especially regarding the timing of helminth infection and the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrate that lung-stage schistosome infection could upregulate the frequency of allergen specific Treg, which significantly alleviated OVA induced allergic airway inflammation via inhibiting the production of IgE and Th2 cytokines. Our results proved the therapeutic effect of schistosome infection on allergic asthma. Moreover, we highlighted that lung-stage infection is essential for inducing allergen specific regulatory T cells in lung, which is the key mediator of the observed therapeutic effect. These findings shed new light on exploiting helminths or their derivatives to treat asthma and other allergic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Campylobacter is the leading cause of bacterial foodborne gastroenteritis in many countries. Source attribution studies unequivocally identify the handling or consumption of contaminated poultry meat as the primary risk factor. One potential strategy to control Campylobacter is to select poultry with increased resistance to colonisation. We conducted genomic and transcriptomic analyses of commercial pedigree broilers exposed to Campylobacter to examine persistent colonisation of the caecum as a quantitative trait. 3,000 broilers were genotyped using a 50K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and imputed to 600K SNPs. Genotypes were analysed for associations with the number of viable Campylobacter in the caeca. Heritability of the trait was modest but significantly greater than zero (h2=0.11 {+/-} 0.03). Genome-wide association analyses confirmed quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 14 and 16 previously identified using the progeny of crosses of inbred lines differing in resistance, and detected two additional genome-wide significant QTLs on chromosomes 19 and 26. RNA-Seq analysis of the transcriptome of caecal tonsils from birds at the low and high extremes of C. jejuni colonisation phenotype identified differentially transcribed genes, mainly located within the QTL on chromosome 16 and proximal to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus. We also identified strong cis-QTLs located within the MHC suggesting the presence of cis-acting variation in both MHC class I, class II and BG genes. Multiple other cis-acting variants were identified in association with key immune genes (COPS3, CCL4, CR1L, C4BP, PLGR) in the other QTLs. Pathway and network analysis implicated cooperative functional pathways and networks in colonisation, including those related to antigen presentation, innate and adaptive immune responses, calcium, and renin-angiotensin signalling. While co-selection for enhanced resistance and other breeding goal traits is feasible, the frequency of resistance-associated alleles was high in the population studied and non-genetic factors significantly influence Campylobacter colonisation in poultry.\n\nAuthor summaryCampylobacter infection is estimated to cause 95 million illnesses in people worldwide each year. Human infections mostly involve gastroenteritis, but can have severe complications. The handling or consumption of contaminated poultry meat is a key risk factor for human campylobacteriosis. The bacteria reach high numbers in the intestines of chickens reared for meat (broilers) and are frequently found on carcasses after slaughter. Effective vaccines against Campylobacter are not yet available, and treatments to reduce carcass contamination (e.g. chlorination) are not acceptable in some markets. One alternative is to breed for chickens with improved resistance to Campylobacter colonisation. To test the feasibility of this option in commercial birds, we analysed the genetic make-up of 3,000 pedigree broilers and determined the number of Campylobacter in their gut. There were associations between specific regions of the chicken genome and resistance to Campylobacter. Within some of these regions, expression of certain genes differed between birds at the low and high extremes of Campylobacter colonisation, providing a potential explanation for genetic variation in resistance. Selection of poultry with increased resistance to Campylobacter colonisation may be a complementary strategy to improved biosecurity, management, handling and processing procedures to reduce the burden of Campylobacter on human health.",

    "abstract": "In the absence of national control programmes against Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis, farmer-led treatment of cattle with pyrethroid-based insecticides may be an effective strategy for foci at the edges of wildlife areas, but there is limited evidence to support this.\n\nWe combined data on insecticide use by farmers, tsetse abundance and trypanosome prevalence with mathematical models to quantify the likely impact of insecticide-treated cattle.\n\nSixteen percent of farmers reported treating cattle with a pyrethroid, and chemical analysis indicated 18% of individual cattle had been treated, in the previous week. Treatment of cattle was estimated to increase daily mortality of tsetse by 5 - 14%. Trypanosome prevalence in tsetse, predominantly from wildlife areas, was 1.25% for T. brucei s.l. and 0.03% for T. b. rhodesiense. For 750 cattle sampled from 48 herds, 2.3% were PCR positive for T. brucei s.l. and none for T. b. rhodesiense. Using mathematical models, we estimated there was 8 - 29% increase in mortality of tsetse in farming areas and this increase can explain the relatively low prevalence of T. brucei s.l. in cattle.\n\nFarmer-led treatment of cattle with pyrethroids is likely, in part, to be limiting the spill-over of human-infective trypanosomes from wildlife areas.\n\nAuthor summaryThe acute form of sleeping sickness in Africa is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. It is transmitted by tsetse flies and can be maintained in cycles involving both livestock and wildlife as hosts. Humans are incidentally infected and are particularly at risk of infection near protected areas where there are both wildlife and suitable habitat for tsetse. In these regions, the tsetse vector cannot be eradicated, nor can infection be prevented in wildlife. Here we use field studies of tsetse and livestock in combination with mathematical models of tsetse population change and trypanosome transmission to show that use of pyrethroid-based insecticides on cattle by farmers at the edge of protected areas could be contributing to lowering the risk of sleeping sickness in Serengeti District, Tanzania. To our knowledge, our study is the first to report farmer-led tsetse control, co-incident with tsetse decline and relatively low prevalence of T. brucei s.l. in cattle.",

For this purpose, A total of 72 piglets with uniform sizes were randomly assigned to four dietary treatment groups consisted of a negative control group (NCG), a fermented citrus reticulata \"Chachi\" pulp group (FCRPG), a Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium group (CRPG) and a positive control group (PCG) in a 21-day feeding trial. After the raising experiment, fresh feces of piglets were analyzed systematically using multi-omics technologies. Metagenomics method with high-throughput compositional characterization indicated that the architecture and diversity of fecal microbiome were both influenced by these two additives and compound antibiotics. Metabolite analysis showed that FCRPG have an significant effects on fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) among four treatment groups. Results of functional proteomics approaches found that FCRPG presented the highest butyrate metabolic level, and CRPG showed the highest flavone and flavonol biosynthesis level in feces. In addition, NCP produced an effective effect on adjusting fecal microbiota profile. Consequently, our findings demonstrate that dietary supplementation with FCRP or CRP modulates the microbial taxa, metabolic and proteomic alterations in fecal microbiota of weaned piglets for health maintaining.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTsetse flies transmit trypanosomes that cause the debilitating diseases human African trypanosomosis (HAT) or sleeping sickness in humans and animal African trypanosomosis (AAT) or nagana in livestock. The riverine tsetse species Glossina palpalis gambiensis Vanderplank (Diptera: Glossinidae) inhabits riparian forests along river systems in West Africa. The Government of Senegal has embarked on a project to eliminate a population of this tsetse species from the Niayes area with the objective to manage AAT in this area. The project is implemented following an area-wide integrated pest management approach with an SIT component. The SIT can only be successful when the sterile males that are released in the field are of high biological quality, i.e. have the same dispersal capacity, survival and competitiveness as their wild counterparts. To date, sterile tsetse males have been released by air using biodegradable cardboard cartons that were manually dropped from a fixed-wing aircraft or gyrocopter. The cardboard boxes are however expensive, and the system is rather cumbersome to implement.\n\nMethodsA new prototype of an automated chilled adult release system (Bruno Spreader Innovation, (BSI)) for tsetse flies was tested for its accuracy (in counting numbers of sterile males as loaded into the machine), release rate consistency and impact on quality of the released males. The impact of the release process was evaluated on several performance indicators of the irradiated male flies such as flight propensity, survival, mating competitiveness, premating and mating duration, and insemination rate of mated females.\n\nResultsThe BSI release system counted with a consistent accuracy and released homogenously tsetse flies at the lowest motor speed (0.6 rpm). In addition, the chilling conditions (6 {+/-} 1 {degrees}C) and the release process (passing of flies through the machine) had no significant negative impact on the males flight propensity. No significant differences were observed between the control males (no irradiation and no exposure to the release process), irradiated males (no exposure to the release process) and irradiated males exposed to the release process with respect to mating competitiveness, premating period and mating duration. Only survival of irradiated males that were exposed to the release process was reduced ([~]2 folds), irrespective of whether the males were held with or without feeding.\n\nConclusionAlthough the release process had a negative effect on survival of the flies, the data of the experiments indicate that the BSI machine holds promise for use in tsetse SIT programmes. The results of this study will now need to be confirmed under operational field conditions in West Africa.",

    "abstract": "Pollination services and honeybee health in general are important in the African savannahs particularly to farmers who often rely on honeybee products as a supplementary source of income. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the floral cycle, abundance and spatial distribution of melliferous plants in the African savannah landscapes. Furthermore, placement of apiaries in the landscapes could benefit from information on spatiotemporal patterns of flowering plants, by optimising honeybees foraging behaviours, which could improve apiary productivity. This study sought to assess the suitability of simulated multispectral data for mapping melliferous (flowering) plants in the African savannahs. Bi-temporal AISA Eagle hyperspectral images, resampled to four sensors (i.e. WorldView-2, RapidEye, Spot-6 and Sentinel-2) spatial and spectral resolutions, and a 10-cm ultra-high spatial resolution aerial imagery coinciding with onset and peak flowering periods were used in this study. Ground reference data was collected at the time of imagery capture. The advanced machine learning random forest (RF) classifier was used to map the flowering plants at a landscape scale and a classification accuracy validated using 30% independent test samples. The results showed that 93.33%, 69.43%, 67.52% and 82.18% accuracies could be achieved using WorldView-2, RapidEye, Spot-6 and Sentinel-2 data sets respectively, at the peak flowering period. Our study provides a basis for the development of operational and cost-effective approaches for mapping flowering plants in an African semiarid agroecological landscape. Specifically, such mapping approaches are valuable in providing timely and reliable advisory tools for guiding the implementation of beekeeping systems at a landscape scale.",

    "abstract": "Poly-ubiquitin chains are flexible multidomain proteins, whose conformational dynamics enable their molecular recognition by a large number of partners in multiple biological pathways. By using alternative linkage, it is possible to obtain poly-ubiquitin molecules with different dynamical properties. This flexibility is further increased by the possibility to tune the length of poly-ubiquitin chains. Characterizing the dynamics of poly-ubiquitins as a function of their length is thus relevant to understand their biology. Structural characterization of poly-ubiquitin conformational dynamics is challenging both experimentally and computationally due to increasing system size and conformational variability. Here, by developing highly efficient and accurate small-angle X-ray scattering driven Martini coarse-grain simulations, we characterize the dynamics of linear M1-linked di-, tri- and tetra-ubiquitin chains. Our data show that the behavior of the di-ubiquitin subunits is independent of the presence of additional ubiquitin modules. We propose that the conformational space sampled by linear poly-ubiquitins, in general, may follow a simple self-avoiding polymer model. These results, combined with experimental data from small angle X-ray scattering, biophysical techniques and additional simulations show that binding of NEMO, a central regulator in the NF-{kappa}B pathway, to linear poly-ubiquitin obeys a 2:1 (NEMO:poly-ubiquitin) stoichiometry in solution, even in the context of four ubiquitin units. Eventually, we show how the conformational properties of long poly-ubiquitins may modulate the binding with their partners in a length-dependent manner.\n\nSignificanceProtein conformational dynamics plays an essential role in molecular recognition mechanisms. The characterization of conformational dynamics is hampered by the conformational averaging of observable in experimental structural biology techniques and by the limitations in the accuracy of computational methods. By developing an efficient and accurate approach to combine small-angle X-ray scattering solution experiments and coarse-grain Martini simulations, we show that the conformational dynamics of linear poly-ubiquitins can be efficiently determined and to rationalize the role of poly-ubiquitin dynamic in the molecular recognition of the UBAN domain upon binding to the signaling regulator NEMO. The analysis of the conformational ensembles allows us to propose a general model of the dynamics of linear poly-ubiquitin chains where they can be described as a self-avoiding polymer with a characteristic length associated with their specific linkage.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric histiocytic neoplasms are clonal hematopoietic disorders driven by mutations activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, such as BRAF-V600E. In non-BRAFV600E cases, we investigated alternative MAPK mutations and found two novel BRAF gene fusions. We investigated the distinct responsiveness of novel BRAF fusions to RAFi therapies and explored the mechanistic basis of such differential responses compared to other BRAF fusions. Two histiocytic patient tumors were analyzed using the CHOP Comprehensive Next-Gen Sequencing Solid Tumor Panel and a targeted RNA-seq panel for 106 fusion partner genes. In the two M- and L-type histiocytic neoplasms assessed, we found novel and rare BRAF gene fusions, MTAP-BRAF and MS4A6A-BRAF, respectively. Both BRAF fusions activated the MAPK/ PI3K pathways and showed homo- and hetero-dimerization with BRAF and the respective N-terminal fusion partner. In contrast to common BRAF fusions, MTAP-BRAF and MS4A6A-BRAF did not respond to PLX8394 due to a lack of disruption of active fusion homo- and hetero-dimers, which was in turn due to the untargeted, stable dimerization mediated by the N-terminal fusion partners. Conversely, we observed robust suppression with LY3009120 that bound fusion dimers and kept them in an inactivate confirmation. MEKi were found to successfully suppress fusion driven signaling and oncogenic phenotypes. Our finding that PLX8394 does not disrupt MTAP-BRAF or MS4A6A-BRAF dimerization due to contribution of N-terminal partners defines a novel paradigm for the distinct mechanisms sought by BRAF fusions in response to RAFi therapy. Overall, this study highlights the unique and differential biology hijacked by BRAF fusions in response to RAFi and further warrants detailed mechanistic classification of BRAF fusions based on their responsiveness to targeted agents.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, the African turquoise killifish, Nothobranchius furzeri, has emerged as an important model system for the study of vertebrate biology and ageing. However, rearing this fish in captivity can pose challenges, due to the short window of fertility, inbreeding problems, and the continuous maintenance of different strains and transgenic lines. To date, the main means of long term strain maintenance is to arrest embryos in diapause, a poorly understood and unreliable method. To solve these problems, we developed a robust protocol to cryopreserve sperm and to revive them for in vitro fertilization (IVF), as a better option for long term storage of N. furzeri lines. We tested a variety of extender and activator buffers for sperm in vitro fertilization, as well as cryoprotectants to achieve maximal long term storage and fertilization conditions tailored to this species. Our optimized protocol was able to preserve sperm in a cryogenic condition for months and to revive an average of 40% upon thawing. Thawed sperm were able to fertilize nearly the same number of eggs as natural fertilization, with an average of ~25% and peaks of ~55% fertilization. This technical advance will greatly facilitate the use of N. furzeri as a model organism.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCancer risk differs across ancestries and these differences may result from differing prevalence of inherited genetic predisposition. Yet, most germline genomic studies performed to date have focused on individuals of European ancestry. Ancestry-specific analyses of germline genomes are required to inform cancer genetic risk and prognosis for each ancestral group. Here, we investigate potentially germline pathogenic variants in cancer predisposition genes (CPG) and their somatic effects in patients across diverse ancestral backgrounds.\n\nMethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of germline genomic data of 9,899 patients from 33 cancer types generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project along with matching somatic genomic and transcriptomic data. By collapsing pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants to the gene level, we analyzed the association between variants in CPGs and cancer types within each ancestry. We also identified ancestry- specific predisposing variants and their associated somatic two-hit events and gene expression levels.\n\nResultsRecent genetic ancestry analysis classified the cohort of 9,899 cancer cases into individuals of primarily European, (N = 8,184, 82.7%), African (N = 966, 9.8%), East Asian (N = 649, 6.6%), South Asian (N=48, 0.5%), Native/Latin American (N=41, 0.4%), and admixed (N=11, 0.1%) ancestries. In the African ancestry, we discovered a potentially novel association of BRCA2 in lung squamous cell carcinoma (OR = 41.4 [95% CI, 6.1-275.6]; FDR = 0.002) along with the previously identified association of BRCA2 in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OR=8.5 [95% CI, 1.5-47.4]; FDR=0.045). Similarly, in the East Asian ancestry, we discovered one previously known association of BRIP1 in stomach adenocarcinoma (OR=12.8 [95% CI, 1.8-90.84]; FDR=0.038). Rare variant burden analysis further identified 7 suggestive associations for cancer-gene pairs in African ancestry individuals previously well described in European ancestry including SDHB in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, ATM in prostate adenocarcinoma, VHL in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, FH in kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, and PTEN in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. Loss of heterozygosity was identified for 7 out of the 15 African ancestry carriers of predisposing variants. Further, tumors from the SDHB or BRCA2 carriers showed simultaneous allelic specific expression and low gene expression of their respective affected genes; and FH splice-site variant carriers showed mis-splicing of FH.\n\nConclusionWhile several predisposing genes are shared across patients, many pathogenic variants are found to be ancestry-specific and trigger somatic effects. Analysis of larger diverse ancestries genomic cohorts are required to pinpoint ancestry- specific genetic predisposition to inform personalized diagnosis and screening strategies.",

Saliva-derived DNA samples were sequenced using the Riptide DNA library prep kit. After quality controls, 28 affected, 44 unaffected and 1,843,695 informative Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were included in the GWAS. Data were analyzed both at the single SNP and gene levels using the GEMMA and GATES methods, respectively. We detected significant signals at the gene level in both the CPSF7 and SDHAF2 genes (adjusted p = 0.016 and p = 0.025, respectively), two overlapping genes located on chromosome 18. The top SNP for both genes was rs22669389, however it did not reach genome-wide significance in the GWAS (adjusted p = 0.078). Our studies provide, for the first time, candidate loci for CIPF in the WHWT.

    "abstract": "Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has emerged as a potential and controversial antiviral candidate therapy for COVID-19. While many clinical trials are underway to test the efficacy of HCQ as a treatment for COVID-19, underlying mechanisms of HCQ in the setting of COVID-19 remain unclear. Hence, we examined differential gene expression signatures of HCQ exposure, in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection, and host signatures of COVID-19 in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, and postmortem lung to evaluate whether HCQ transcriptome signatures associate with restoration of SARS-CoV-2-related host transcriptional responses. Here, we show that 24 hours of in vitro treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) with HCQ significantly impacted transcription of 16 genes involved in immune regulation and lipid metabolism. Using transcriptome data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE and A549 cells and PBMC derived from confirmed COVID-19 infected patients, we determined that only 0.24% of the COVID-19 PBMC differentially expressed gene set and 0.39% of the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 cells differentially expressed gene set overlapped with HCQ-related differentially expressed genes. Moreover, we observed that HCQ treatment significantly impacted transcription of 159 genes in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages involved in cholesterol biosynthetic process and chemokine activity. Notably, when we compared the macrophage HCQ-related gene lists with genes transcriptionally altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in bronchoalveolar lavage of COVID-19+ patients, the CXCL6 gene was impacted in all three transcriptional signatures revealing evidence in favor of chemokine modulation. HCQ-related transcriptional changes minimally overlapped with host genes altered in postmortem lung biopsies from COVID-19 participants. These results may provide insight into the immunomodulation mechanisms of HCQ treatment in the setting of COVID-19 and suggest HCQ is not a panacea to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages (phages) evolve rapidly by acquiring genes from other phages leading to mosaic genomes. Here, we identify numerous genetic transfers between distantly related phages and aim at understanding their frequency, consequences and the conditions favoring them. Gene flow tends to occur between phages that are enriched for recombinases, transposases and non-homologous end joining, suggesting that both homologous and illegitimate recombination contribute to gene flow. Phage family and host phyla are strong barriers to gene exchange, but phage lifestyle is not. We observe more exchanges between temperate phages even if they tend to have smaller genomes. These acquisitions often include transcription regulators and lysins. Yet, there is also extensive gene flow between temperate and virulent phages, or between the latter. These predominantly involve virulent phages with large genomes previously classed as low gene flux, and lead to the preferential transfer of genes encoding functions involved in cell energetics, nucleotide metabolism, DNA packaging and injection, and virion assembly. Such exchanges may explain the acquisition of genes in virulent phages, which tend to have the largest genomes. We used genetic transfers, which occur upon co-infection of a host, to compare phage host range. We found that virulent phages have broader host ranges and mediate genetic exchanges between narrow host range temperate phages infecting distant bacterial hosts, thus contributing to gene flow between virulent phages, as well as between temperate phages. This gene flow drastically expands the gene repertoires available for phage and bacterial evolution, including the transfer of functional innovations across taxa.",

    "abstract": "Wild aquatic birds maintain a large genetically diverse pool of influenza A viruses (IAVs), which can be transmitted to lower mammals and ultimately humans. Through phenotypic analyses, only a small set of avian IAVs replicated well in the epithelial cells of swine upper respiratory tracts, and these viruses were shown to infect and cause virus shedding in pigs. Such a phenotypic trait appears to emerge randomly and are distributed among IAVs across multiple avian species, geographic and temporal orders, and is determined not by receptor binding preference but other markers across genomic segments, such as those in the ribonucleoprotein complex. This study demonstrates that phenotypic variants exist among avian IAVs, only a few of which may result in viral shedding in pigs upon infection, providing opportunities for these viruses to become pig adapted, thus posing a higher potential risk for creating novel variants or detrimental reassortants within pig populations.\n\nAuthor SummaryHaving both avian-like receptors and human-like 2,6-linked sialic acid receptors, swine serve as a \"mixing vessel\" for generating human influenza pandemic strains. All HA subtypes of IAVs can infect swine; however, only sporadic cases of avian IAVs are reported in domestic swine. The molecular mechanisms affecting avian IAVs ability to infect swine are still not fully understood. Through phenotypic analyses, this study suggested that tissue tropisms (i.e., in swine upper respiratory tracts) of avian IAVs affect their spillovers from wild birds to pigs, and this phenotype was determined not by receptor binding preference but by other markers across genomic segments, such as those in the ribonucleoprotein complex. In addition, our results showed that such a phenotypic trait was sporadically and randomly distributed among IAVs across multiple avian species, geographic and temporal orders. This study suggested an efficient way for risk assessment of avian IAVs, such as in evaluating their potentials to be transmitted from avian to pigs.",
