    "abstract": "Deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) or deep Boltzmann machines (DBM), can generate an arbitrary number of synthetic observations after being trained on an initial set of samples. This has mainly been investigated for imaging data but could also be useful for single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq). A small pilot study could be used for planning a full-scale study by investigating planned analysis strategies on synthetic data with different sample sizes. It is unclear whether synthetic observations generated based on a small scRNA-seq dataset reflect the properties relevant for subsequent data analysis steps.\n\nWe specifically investigated two deep generative modeling approaches, VAEs and DBMs. First, we considered single-cell variational inference (scVI) in two variants, generating samples from the posterior distribution, the standard approach, or the prior distribution. Second, we propose single-cell deep Boltzmann machines (scDBM). When considering the similarity of clustering results on synthetic data to ground-truth clustering, we find that the scVIposterior variant resulted in high variability, most likely due to amplifying artifacts of small data sets. All approaches showed mixed results for cell types with different abundance by overrepresenting highly abundant cell types and missing less abundant cell types. With increasing pilot dataset sizes, the proportions of the cells in each cluster became more similar to that of ground-truth data. We also showed that all approaches learn the univariate distribution of most genes, but problems occurred with bimodality. Overall, the results showed that generative deep learning approaches might be valuable for supporting the design of scRNA-seq experiments.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical anisotropy is an essential property for many biomolecules to assume their structures, functions and applications, however, the mechanisms for their direction-dependent mechanical responses remain elusive. Herein, by using single-molecule nanopore sensing technique, we explore the mechanisms of directional mechanical stability of the xrRNA1 RNA from ZIKA virus (ZIKV), which forms a complex ring-like architecture. We reveal extreme mechanical anisotropy in ZIKV xrRNA1 which highly depends on Mg2+ and the key tertiary interactions. The absence of Mg2+ and disruption of the key tertiary interactions strongly affect the structural integrity and attenuate mechanical anisotropy. The significance of ring structure in RNA mechanical anisotropy is further supported by steered molecular dynamics simulations on ZIKV xrRNA1 and another two RNAs with ring structures, the HCV IRES and THF riboswitch. We anticipate the ring structures can be used as key elements to build RNA-based nanostructures with controllable mechanical anisotropy for biomaterial and biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Aging is driven by subcellular processes that are relatively well-understood. However the qualitative mechanisms and quantitative dynamics of how these micro-level failures cascade to a macro-level catastrophe in a tissue or organs remain largely unexplored. Here we experimentally and theoretically study how cell failure propagates in a synthetic tissue in the presence of advective flow. We argue that cells secrete cooperative factors, thereby forming a network of interdependence governed by diffusion and flow, which fails with a propagating front parallel to advective circulation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEMortality rates typically increase for complex organisms as they age. This leads us to suggest that aging depends on interactions between cells. As cells become damaged, the effect propagates to other cells, eventually leading to a systemic catastrophe. Yet it is unclear how this failure dynamically propagates. Here we present experiments with synthetic tissues and analogous analytical models to investigate the dynamics of failure propagation. Our main contribution is a detailed investigation of failure propagation when interactions are mediated by advective flow. We find analytical expressions for when a pronounced propagation occurs, its velocity, and acceleration in terms of system parameters.",

    "abstract": "Laminin N-terminus 31 (LaNt 31) is an alternative splice isoform derived from the laminin 3 gene. The LaNt 31 protein is enriched around the terminal duct lobular units in normal breast tissue. In the skin and cornea the protein influences epithelial cell migration and tissue remodelling. However, LaNt 31 has never been investigated in a tumour environment. Here we analysed LaNt 31 in invasive ductal carcinoma and determined its contribution to breast carcinoma invasion. LaNt 31 expression and distribution were analysed by immunohistochemistry in human breast tissue biopsy sections and tissue microarrays covering 232 breast cancer samples. This analysis revealed LaNt 31 to be upregulated in 56 % of invasive ductal carcinoma specimens compared with matched normal tissue, and further increased in nodal metastasis compared with the tumour mass in 45 % of samples. 65.8 % of triple negative cases displayed medium to high LaNt 31 expression. To study LaNt 31 function, an adenoviral system was used to induce expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Metabolic activity, 2D cell migration, and invasion into collagen hydrogels were not significantly different between LaNt 31 overexpressing cells and control treated cells. However, LaNt 31 overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells displayed a striking change in their mode of invasion into laminin-containing Matrigel; changing from multicellular streaming to individual cellular-invasion. In agreement with these results, 66.7% of the tumours with the highest LaNt 31 expression were non-cohesive. Together these findings indicate that breast cancer-associated changes in LaNt 31 expression could directly contribute to tumour invasiveness, and that this little-studied protein may become a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "The site frequency spectrum in human populations is not accurately modeled by an infinite sites model, which assumes that all mutations are unique. Despite the pervasiveness of recurrent mutations, we lack computational methods to identify these events at specific sites in population sequencing data. Rare alleles that are identical-by-descent (IBD) are expected to segregate on a long, shared haplotype background that descends from a common ancestor. However, alleles introduced by recurrent mutation or by non-crossover gene conversions are identical-by-state and will have a shorter expected shared haplotype background. We hypothesized that the expected difference in shared haplotype background length can distinguish IBD and non-IBD variants in population sequencing data without pedigree information. We implemented a Bayesian hierarchical model and used Gibbs sampling to estimate the posterior probability of IBD state for rare variants, using simulations to demonstrate that our approach accurately distinguishes rare IBD and non-IBD variants. Applying our method to whole genome sequencing data from 3,621 individuals in the UK10K consortium, we found that non-IBD variants correlated with higher local mutation rates and genomic features like replication timing. Using a heuristic to categorize non-IBD variants as gene conversions or recurrent mutations, we found that potential gene conversions had expected properties such as enriched local GC content. By identifying recurrent mutations, we can better understand the spectrum of recent mutations in human populations, a source of genetic variation driving evolution and a key factor in understanding recent demographic history.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a common organism in periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Little is known about S. aureus genetic diversity in PJI as compared to nasal carriage. We hypothesized PJI S. aureus strains would be associated with increased virulence as compared to those from nasal carriage. Whole genome sequencing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed to genotype these two populations at high resolution. MLST revealed a variety of genotypes in both populations but many belonged to the most common clonal complexes. In nasal cultures, 69% of strains were of clonal complexes CC5, CC8, and CC30. In PJI cultures, only 51% could be classified in these common clonal complexes. Remaining strains were atypical, and these atypical strains in PJI were associated with poor host status and compromised immune conditions. Mutations in genes involved in fibronectin binding (ebh, fnbA, clfA, clfB) systematically distinguished later PJI isolates from the first PJI isolate from each patient. S. aureus isolated from nasal carriage and PJI specimens differ significantly, with the latter being more diverse. Strains associated with lower pathogenicity tended to be found in immunocompromised patients, suggesting the host immune system plays an important role in preventing PJI. Repeated mutations in S. aureus genes associated with extracellular matrix binding were identified suggesting an adaptive, parallel evolution in S. aureus during the development of PJI.",

The elevated pre-rRNA level of T cells is also observed in both mouse heart or skin transplantation models, and in kidney transplanted patients. Importantly, T cell activation can be significantly suppressed by inhibiting NF45/NF90-dependent rDNA transcription. Amazingly, CX5461, a rDNA transcription specific inhibitor, outperformed FK506, the most commonly used immunosuppressant, both in terms of potency and off-target activity (i.e. toxicity), as demonstrated by a series of skin and heart allograft models. Collectively, this reveals NF45/NF90-mediated rDNA transcription as a novel signaling pathway essential for T cell activation and as a new target for the development of safe and effective immunosuppressants.",

    "abstract": "The Cambrian Period (541-485 Mya) represents a major stage in the development of metazoan-dominated assemblages with complex community structure and species interactions. Exceptionally preserved fossil sites have allowed specimen-based identification of putative trophic interactions to which network analyses have been applied. However, network analyses of the fossil record suffer from incomplete and indirect data, time averaging that obscures species coexistence, and biases in preservation. Here, we present a novel high-resolution fossil dataset from the Raymond Quarry (RQ) member of the mid-Cambrian Burgess Shale (7549 specimens, 61 taxa, ~510 Mya) affording new perspectives on these challenging issues. Further, we formulate a new measure of  preservation bias that aids identification of those assemblage subsets to which network analyses can be reliably applied. For sections with sufficiently low bias, abundance correlation network analyses predicted longitudinally consistent trophic and competitive interactions. Our correlation network analyses predicted previously postulated trophic interactions with 83.5% accuracy and demonstrated a shift from specialist interaction-dominated assemblages to ones dominated by generalist and competitive interactions. This approach provides a robust, taphonomically corrected framework to explore and predict in detail the existence and ecological character of putative interactions in fossil datasets, offering new windows on ancient food-webs.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding interactions in paleo-ecosystems has been a difficult task due to biases in collection and preservation of taxa, as well as low time resolution of data. In this work, we use network science tools and a fine scale dataset from the Cambrian period to explore: (i) preservation bias due to ecological/physical characteristics of taxa; (ii) evidence that the magnitude and sign of pairwise abundance correlations between two fossil taxa yields information concerning the ecological character about the interaction. All results in our work derive from using complex system approaches to analyze abundance data, without assuming any prior knowledge about species interactions - thereby providing a novel general framework to assess and explore fossil datasets.",

The lack of a complete comprehension of their biological functionality, especially in a genome-wide scenario, has demanded new computational approaches to annotate their roles. It is widely known that secondary structure is determinant to know RNA function and machine learning based approaches have been successfully proven to predict RNA function from secondary structure information.\n\nHere we show that RNA function can be predicted with good accuracy from raw sequence information without the necessity of computing secondary structure features which is computationally expensive. This finding appears to go against the dogma of secondary structure being a key determinant of function in RNA. Compared to recent secondary structure based methods, the proposed solution is more robust to sequence boundary noise and reduces drastically the computational cost allowing for large data volume annotations.\n\nScripts and datasets to reproduce the results of experiments proposed in this study are available at: https://github.com/bioinformatics-sannio/ncrna-deep",

    "abstract": "We present a software-assisted workflow for the alignment and matching of filamentous structures across a 3D stack of serial images. This is achieved by combining automatic methods, visual validation, and interactive correction. After an initial alignment, the user can continuously improve the result by interactively correcting landmarks or matches of filaments. Supported by a visual quality assessment of regions that have been already inspected, this allows a trade-off between quality and manual labor. The software tool was developed to investigate cell division by quantitative 3D analysis of microtubules (MTs) in both mitotic and meiotic spindles. For this, each spindle is cut into a series of semi-thick physical sections, of which electron tomograms are acquired. The serial tomograms are then stitched and non-rigidly aligned to allow tracing and connecting of MTs across tomogram boundaries. In practice, automatic stitching alone provides only an incomplete solution, because large physical distortions and a low signal-to-noise ratio often cause experimental difficulties. To derive 3D models of spindles despite the problems related to sample preparation and subsequent data collection, semi-automatic validation and correction is required to remove stitching mistakes. However, due to the large number of MTs in spindles (up to 30k) and their resulting dense spatial arrangement, a naive inspection of each MT is too time consuming. Furthermore, an interactive visualization of the full image stack is hampered by the size of the data (up to 100 GB). Here, we present a specialized, interactive, semi-automatic solution that considers all requirements for large-scale stitching of filamentous structures in serial-section image stacks. The key to our solution is a careful design of the visualization and interaction tools for each processing step to guarantee real-time response, and an optimized workflow that efficiently guides the user through datasets.\n\nAuthor summaryElectron tomography of biological samples is used for a 3D reconstruction of filamentous structures, such as microtubules (MTs) in mitotic and meiotic spindles. Large-scale electron tomography can be applied to increase the reconstructed volume for the visualization of full spindles. For this, each spindle is cut into a series of semi-thick physical sections, of which electron tomograms are acquired. The serial tomograms are then stitched and non-rigidly aligned to allow tracing and connecting of MTs across tomogram boundaries. Previously, we presented fully automatic approaches for this 3D reconstruction pipeline. However, large volumes often suffer from imperfections (i.e. physical distortions) caused during sectioning and imaging, making it difficult to apply fully automatic approaches for matching and stitching of numerous tomograms. Therefore, we developed an interactive, semi-automatic solution that considers all requirements for large-scale stitching of microtubules in serial-section image stacks. We achieved this by combining automatic methods, visual validation and interactive error correction, thus allowing the user to continuously improve the result by interactively correcting landmarks or matches of filaments. We present large-scale reconstructions of spindles in which the automatic workflow failed and where different steps of manual corrections were needed. Our approach is also applicable to other biological samples showing 3D distributions of MTs in a number of different cellular contexts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSARS-CoV2 is a previously uncharacterized coronavirus and causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The host response to SARS-CoV2 has not yet been fully delineated, hampering a precise approach to therapy. To address this, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of gene expression data from the blood, lung, and airway of COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that COVID-19 pathogenesis is driven by populations of myeloid-lineage cells with highly inflammatory but distinct transcriptional signatures in each compartment. The relative absence of cytotoxic cells in the lung suggests a model in which delayed clearance of the virus may permit exaggerated myeloid cell activation that contributes to disease pathogenesis by the production of inflammatory mediators. The gene expression profiles also identify potential therapeutic targets that could be modified with available drugs. The data suggest that transcriptomic profiling can provide an understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in individual patients.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/121889v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7dccedorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1190e1forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ee2e67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@289f72_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Group B Coxsackieviruses belonging to the genus, Enterovirus, contain six serotypes that induce various diseases, whose occurrence may involve the mediation of more than one serotype. We recently identified immunogenic epitopes within CVB3 viral protein 1 that induce anti-viral T cell responses in mouse models of CVB infections. In our investigations to determine the protective responses of the viral epitopes, we unexpectedly noted that animals immunized with complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) alone and later challenged with CVB3 were completely protected against myocarditis. Similarly, the pancreatitis-inducing ability of CVB3 was remarkably reduced to only 10% in the CFA group as opposed to 73.3% in the control group that received no CFA. Additionally, no mortalities were noted in the CFA group, whereas 40% of control animals died during the course of 21 days post-infection with CVB3. Taken together, our data suggest that the adjuvant effects of CFA may be sufficient for protection against CVB infections. These observations may provide new insights into our understanding of the occurrence of viral infections. One example is Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) as individuals suffering from COVID-19 who have been vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin appear to have fewer morbidities and mortalities than unvaccinated individuals.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy enables spatial and temporal measurements of live cells and cellular communities. However, this potential has not yet been fully realized for investigations of individual cell behaviors and phenotypic changes in dense, three-dimensional (3D) bacterial biofilms. Accurate cell detection and cellular shape measurement in densely packed biofilms are challenging because of the limited resolution and low signal to background ratios (SBRs) in fluorescence microscopy images. In this work, we present Bacterial Cell Morphometry 3D (BCM3D), an image analysis workflow that combines deep learning with mathematical image analysis to accurately segment and classify single bacterial cells in 3D fluorescence images. In BCM3D, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained using simulated biofilm images with experimentally realistic SBRs, cell densities, labeling methods, and cell shapes. We systematically evaluate the segmentation accuracy of BCM3D using both simulated and experimental images. Compared to state-of-the-art bacterial cell segmentation approaches, BCM3D consistently achieves higher segmentation accuracy and further enables automated morphometric cell classifications in multi-population biofilms.",

    "abstract": "The bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis produces an arsenal of secondary metabolites that have diverse structures and roles in the ecology of this soil-dwelling bacterium. In liquid co-culture experiments, B. thailandensis secretes an antimicrobial that nearly eliminates another soil bacterium, Bacillus subtilis. To identify the antimicrobial, we used a transposon mutagenesis approach. This screen identified antimicrobial-defective mutants with insertions in the hmqA, hmqC and hmqF genes involved in biosynthesis of a family of 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones called 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-alkenylquinolines (HMAQs), which are closely related to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs). Insertions also occurred in the previously uncharacterized gene BTH_II1576. Results confirm that BTH_II1576 is involved in generating N-oxide derivatives of HMAQs (HMAQ-NO) in B. thailandensis and that HMAQ-NOs are sufficient to eliminate B. subtilis in co-cultures. Moreover, synthetic HMAQ-NO is [~]50-fold more active than HMAQ. Both the methyl group and the length of the carbon side chain account for high activity of HMAQ-NO against B. subtilis. The results provide new information on the biosynthesis and activities of HMAQs and reveal new insight into how these molecules might be important for the ecology of B. thailandensis.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe soil bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis produces 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones, mostly methylated 4-hydroxy-alkenylquinolines, a family of relatively unstudied metabolites similar to molecules also synthesized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Several of the methylated 4-hydroxy-alkenylquinolines have antimicrobial activity against other species. We show that N-oxidated methyl-alkenylquinolines are particularly antimicrobial and sufficient to kill Bacillus subtilis in co-cultures. We confirmed their biosynthesis requires the previously unstudied protein HmqL. These results provide new information about the biology of 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones, particularly the methylated 4-hydroxy-alkenylquinolines, which are unique to B. thailandensis. This study also has importance for understanding B. thailandensis secondary metabolites and has implications for potential therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents a challenge to laboratorians and healthcare workers around the world. Handling of biological samples from individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires strict biosafety and biosecurity measures. Within the laboratory, non-propagative work with samples containing the virus requires, at minimum, Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) techniques and facilities. Therefore, handling of SARS-CoV-2 samples remains a major concern in areas and conditions where biosafety and biosecurity for specimen handling is difficult to maintain, such as in rural laboratories or austere field testing sites. Inactivation through physical or chemical means can reduce the risk of handling live virus and increase testing ability worldwide. Herein we assess several chemical and physical inactivation techniques employed against SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Cambodian COVID-19 patients. This data demonstrates that all chemical (AVL, inactivating sample buffer and formaldehyde) and heat treatment (56{degrees}C and 98{degrees}C) methods tested completely inactivated viral loads of up to 5 log10.",
