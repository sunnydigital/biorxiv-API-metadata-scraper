    "abstract": "Phytoplankton populations are intrinsically large and genetically variable, and interactions between species in these populations shape their physiological and evolutionary responses. Yet, evolutionary responses of microbial organisms in novel environments are investigated almost exclusively through the lens of species colonising new environments on their own, and invasion studies are often of short duration. Although exceptions exist, neither type of study usually measures ecologically relevant traits beyond growth rates. Here, we experimentally evolved populations of fresh- and seawater phytoplankton as monocultures (the green algae Chlamydomonas moewusii and Ostreococcus tauri, each colonising a novel, unoccupied salinity) and co-cultures (invading a novel salinity occupied by a resident species) for 200 generations. Colonisers and invaders differed in extinction risks, phenotypes (e.g. size, primary production rates) and strength of local adaptation: invaders had systematically lower extinction rates and broader salinity and temperature preferences than colonisers - regardless of the environment that the invader originated from. We emphasise that the presence of a locally adapted species has the potential to alter the invading species eco-evolutionary trajectories in a replicable way across environments of differing quality, and that the evolution of small cell size and high ROS tolerance may explain high invader fitness. To predict phytoplankton responses in a changing world, such interspecific relationships need to be accounted for.",

    "abstract": "Model-based approaches that attempt to delimit species are hampered by computational limitations as well as the unfortunate tendency by users to disregard algorithmic assumptions. Alternatives are clearly needed, and machine-learning (M-L) is attractive in this regard as it functions without the need to explicitly define a species concept. Unfortunately, its performance will vary according to which (of several) bioinformatic parameters are invoked. Herein, we gauge the effectiveness of M-L-based species-delimitation algorithms by parsing 64 variably-filtered versions of a ddRAD-derived SNP dataset collected from North American box turtles (Terrapene spp.). Our filtering strategies included: (A) minor allele frequencies (MAF) of 5%, 3%, 1%, and 0% (=none), and (B) maximum missing data per-individual/per-population at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% (=no filtering). We found that species-delimitation via unsupervised M-L impacted the signal-to-noise ratio in our data, as well as the discordance among resolved clades. The latter may also reflect biogeographic history, gene flow, incomplete lineage sorting, or combinations thereof (as corroborated from previously observed patterns of differential introgression). Our results substantiate M-L as a viable species-delimitation method, but also demonstrate how commonly observed patterns of phylogenetic discordance can seriously impact M-L-classification.",

    "abstract": "Fluroquinolones are widely used as an empirical therapy for pseudomonal ocular infections. Based on increasing reports on acquired fluroquinolone resistance genes in clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we investigated 33 strains of P. aeruginosa isolated from the cornea of microbial keratitis patients in India and Australia between 1992 and 2018 to understand the prevalence of acquired fluroquinolone resistance genes in ocular isolates and to assess whether the possession of those genes was associated with fluoroquinolone susceptibility. We obtained the whole genome sequence of 33 isolates using Illumina MiSeq platform and investigated the prevalence of two fluoroquinolone resistance genes crpP and qnrVC1. To examine the associated mobile genetic elements of qnrVC1 positive strains, we obtained long read sequences using Oxford Nanopore MinION and performed hybrid assembly to combine long reads with Illumina short sequence reads. We further assessed mutations in QRDRs and antibiotic susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin to examine the association between resistance genes and phenotype. Twenty strains possessed crpP in genetic islands characterised by possession of integrative conjugative elements. The qnrVC1 gene was carried by four isolates on class I integrons and Tn3 transposons along with aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance genes. We did not observe any evidence of plasmids carrying fluroquinolone resistance genes. Resistance to fluroquinolones was observed in those strains which possessed crpP, qnrVC1 and that had QRDRs mutations. The presence of crpP was not a sole cause of fluroquinolone resistance.",

    "abstract": "Reality monitoring describes our ability to distinguish between internally and externally generated experiences. Individuals show significant variation in this ability and impaired reality monitoring has been linked to the experience of hallucinations. We undertook two studies to investigate the association between reality monitoring and morphology of the paracingulate region of medial prefrontal cortex. In Study 1 we compared reality monitoring accuracy and functional connectivity within paracingulate cortex in groups of healthy controls (N=20) and patients with schizophrenia and hallucinations (N=19). Controls showed greater reality monitoring accuracy that was associated with resting-state functional connectivity between paracingulate, precuneus and occipital cortices, while reality monitoring in patients was associated with more lateral functional connectivity. In Study 2 we used real-time fMRI neurofeedback to obtain causal evidence for the role of the paracingulate cortex in reality monitoring. Healthy individuals received Active feedback from paracingulate cortex (N=21) or Sham feedback based on randomised signal (N=18). Active-group participants showed a specific behavioural effect of improved reality monitoring for Imagined items, as well as increases in both activity within the paracingulate region, and its posterior functional connectivity with precuneus and lateral parietal cortices, and occipital cortex.\n\nOur findings suggest reality monitoring in healthy individuals is causally supported by a paracingulate mediated flexible network including the precuneus. Network connectivity can be enhanced using neurofeedback and tracks with improved reality monitoring ability. In contrast, patients with schizophrenia may utilise a distinct and more lateral network which may explain observed sub-optimal reality monitoring accuracy, contributing to the experience of hallucinations.\n\nSignificance StatementReality monitoring refers to our ability to distinguish imagination from our experiences in the outside world, and is linked both to hallucinations in schizophrenia as well as to the morphology of paracingulate cortex area of the brain. Here, we revealed less paracingulate involvement in the functional reality monitoring networks in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy individuals. Thereafter, we used real-time fMRI neurofeedback to show that healthy individuals can learn to upregulate brain activity within the paracingulate cortex, with this resulting in both improved reality monitoring ability and changes in paracingulate functional connectivity. This suggests that paracingulate cortex activity and connectivity play a causal role in reality monitoring, with implications for both the understanding and treatment of hallucinations.",

Our experiments characterize the circuits of the PFC regulating motivation, reinforcement and dopamine activity, revealing a novel cortico-thalamic loop. The stimulation of medial PFC (mPFC) neurons activated many downstream regions, as shown by functional MRI. Axonal terminal stimulation of mPFC neurons in downstream regions, including the anteromedial thalamic nucleus (AM), reinforced behavior and activated midbrain dopaminergic neurons. The stimulation of AM neurons projecting to the mPFC also reinforced behavior and activated dopamine neurons, and mPFC and AM showed a positive-feedback loop organization. Reciprocal excitatory functional connectivity, as well as co-activation of the two regions, was found in human participants who watched reinforcing videos.

    "abstract": "Functional amyloids are present in a wide variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. Experience-dependent aggregation of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding (CPEB) prion-like protein to a translationally active state has emerged as a plausible biochemical substrate of long-lasting memories. CPEB aggregation is driven by prion-like domains (PLD) that are highly divergent in sequence across species. Here, we describe the amyloid-like features of the neuronal Aplysia CPEB (ApCPEB) PLD in vitro using single-molecule and bulk biophysical methods and compare them with those previously reported for neuronal Drosophila CPEB, Orb2 PLD. The existence of transient oligomers and mature filaments suggests similarities in the late stages of the assembly pathway for both PLDs. However, while prior to aggregation the Orb2 PLD monomer remains as a random coil in solution, ApCPEB PLD adopts a diversity of conformations comprising -helical structures that evolve to coiled-coil species, suggesting structural differences at the beginning of their amyloid assembly pathways. Our results show how divergent PLDs of CPEB proteins from different species retain the ability to form a generic amyloid-like fold through different assembly mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Avian influenza outbreaks have been occurring on smallholder poultry farms in Asia for two decades. Farmer responses to these outbreaks can slow down or accelerate virus transmission. We used a longitudinal survey of 53 small-scale chicken farms in southern Vietnam to investigate the impact of outbreaks with disease-induced mortality on harvest rate, vaccination, and disinfection behaviors. We found that in small broiler flocks ([&le;]16 birds/flock) the estimated probability of harvest was 56% higher when an outbreak occurred, and 214% higher if an outbreak with sudden deaths occurred in the same month. Vaccination and disinfection were strongly positively correlated with flock size and farm size, respectively. Small-scale farmers - the overwhelming majority of poultry producers in low-income countries - tend to rely on rapid sale of birds to mitigate losses from diseases. As depopulated birds are sent to markets or trading networks, this reactive behavior has the potential to enhance onward transmission.\n\nOne sentence summaryA cohort study of fifty three small-scale poultry farms in southern Vietnam reveals that when outbreaks occur with symptoms similar to highly pathogenic avian influenza, farmers respond by sending their chickens to market early, potentially exacerbating the effects of the outbreak.",

    "abstract": "Subject Fibrotic diseases cover a spectrum of systemic and organ-specific maladies that affect a large portion of the population, currently without cure. The shared characteristic these diseases feature is their uncontrollable fibrogenesis deemed responsible for the accumulated damage in the susceptible tissues. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), an interstitial lung disease, is one of the most common and studied fibrotic diseases and still remains an active research target.Objective We highlight unique and common (i) genes, (ii) biological pathways and (iii) candidate repurposed drugs among nine fibrotic diseases. We bibliographically explore the resulting candidate substances for potential anti-fibrotic mode of action and focus on diseases that appear to be more similar to IPF so as to jointly examine potential treatments.Methodology We identify key genes for the 9 fibrotic diseases by analyzing transcriptomics datasets. We construct gene-to-gene networks for each disease and examine these networks to explore functional communities of biological pathways. We also use the most significant genes as input in Drug Repurposing (DR) tools and re-rank the resulting candidates according to their structural properties and functional relationship to each investigated disease.Results We identify 7 biological pathways involved in all 9 fibrotic diseases as well as pathways unique to some of these diseases. Based on our DR results, we suggest captopril and ibuprofen that both appear to slow the progression of fibrotic diseases according to existing bibliography. We also recommend nafcillin and memantine, which haven\u2019t been studied against fibrosis yet, for further wet-lab experimentation. We also observe a group of cardiomyopathy-related pathways that are exclusively highlighted for Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSF). We suggest digoxin to be tested against OSF, since we observe cardiomyopathy-related pathways implicated in OSF and there is bibliographic evidence that digoxin may potentially clear myocardial fibrosis. Finally, we establish that IPF shares several involved genes, biological pathways and candidate inhibiting-drugs with Dupuytren\u2019s Disease, IgG4-related Disease, SSc and Cystic Fibrosis. We propose that treatments for these fibrotic diseases should be jointly pursued.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

The annotated genes included 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA, two ribosomal genes, and a non-coding control region. Comparative mitogenome analyses showed both populations are genetically similar but significantly different from domestic buffalo. We also identified structural differences in seven tRNA secondary structures between both species. Both wild and domestic water buffalo formed sister clades which were paraphyletic to genus Bos.

Reducing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration mimics the effect of optogenetic depolarization. As the membrane potential sets the driving force for Ca2+ entry, hyperpolarization is an integral part of rapid stimulus-response coupling in microglia.

    "abstract": "Defective intracellular trafficking and export of miRNAs has been observed in senescent mammalian cells having impaired mitochondrial potential. Similar to what happens in senescent cells, Uncoupling Protein 2 mediated depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential results in progressive sequestration of miRNAs with polysomes and lowered release of miRNAs through extracellular vesicles. Supporting importance of mitochondrial membrane potential on miRNAs fate determination, impaired miRNA-trafficking process in growth retarded human cells has been found to be reversed in presence of Genipin an inhibitor of Uncoupling Protein 2. Mitochondrial detethering of endoplasmic reticulum in mitochondria depolarized cells, found to be responsible for defective compartmentalization of translation initiation factor eIF4E to ER attached polysomes. It causes retarded translation process of target mRNAs with rER attached polysomes to ensure reduced intracellular trafficking and extracellular export of miRNAs. We have identified a reduced activity of mTORC1 complex in mitochondria defective cells to cause reduced phosphorylation of eIF4E-BP1 to cause retarded eIF-4E targeting to ER attached polysome. Cumulatively, these data suggest intricate involvement of mitochondrial membrane potential and dynamics to determine stability of miRNAs in mammalian cells by affecting sub-cellular locations and export of miRNPs by affecting mTORC1 complex, the regulator of the protein translational machinery.\n\nSignificance statementHow the reduced mitochondrial activity in growth retarded cells causes defective miRNA export is an open question. Mitochondrial defects induces a retarded subcellular miRNP trafficking in human cells to cause an upregulation in cellular miRNA content by reducing extracellular vesicle-mediated export of miRNA. We have identified a defective compartmentalization of translation initiation factor eIF4E in mitochondria-ER detethered mammalian cells to cause the retarded intracellular miRNA movement and export Activity of mTORC1 complex, a key regulator of protein translation in mammalian cells, is found to be responsible for ER-compartmentalization of eIF4E. mTORC1 activity reduction in growth retarded and mitochondria detethered cells influences the cell fate by acting on miRNA-mRNA axis. This is a unique way how mitochondrial activity is linked with protein translation and gene repression control in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "Alteration of the lipid composition of biological membranes interferes with their function and can cause tissue damage by triggering apoptosis. Upon lipid bilayer stress, the endoplasmic reticulum mounts a stress response that is similar to the unfolded protein response. However, only a few genes are known to regulate lipid bilayer stress. Here, we performed a suppressor screen that combined the auxin-inducible degradation (AID) system with conventional RNAi in C. elegans to identify members of the lipid bilayer stress response. AID-mediated knockdown of the mediator MDT-15, a protein required for the upregulation of fatty acid desaturases, caused activation of a lipid bilayer stress sensitive reporters. We screened through almost all C. elegans kinases and transcription factors using RNAi by feeding. We report the identification of 8 genes that have not been implicated previously with lipid bilayer stress before in C. elegans. These suppressor genes include skn-1/NRF1,2,3 and let-607/CREB3. Our candidate suppressor genes suggest a network of transcription factors and the integration of multiple tissues for a centralized lipotoxicity response in the intestine. Additionally, we propose and demonstrate the proof-of-concept for combining AID and RNAi as a new screening strategy.",

    "abstract": "The size and shape of peptide ions in the gas phase are an under-explored dimension for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. To explore the nature and utility of the entire peptide collisional cross section (CCS) space, we measure more than a million data points from whole-proteome digests of five organisms with trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) and parallel accumulation - serial fragmentation (PASEF). The scale and precision (CV <1%) of our data is sufficient to train a deep recurrent neural network that accurately predicts CCS values solely based on the peptide sequence. Cross section predictions for the synthetic ProteomeTools library validate the model within a 1.3% median relative error (R > 0.99). Hydrophobicity, position of prolines and histidines are main determinants of the cross sections in addition to sequence-specific interactions.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMolecular multi-omics data provide an in-depth view on biological systems, and their integration is crucial to gain insights in complex regulatory processes. These data can be used to explain disease related genetic variants by linking them to intermediate molecular traits (quantitative trait loci, QTL). Molecular networks regulating cellular processes leave footprints in QTL results as so-called trans -QTL hotspots. Reconstructing these networks is a complex endeavor and use of biological prior information has been proposed to alleviate network inference. However, previous efforts were limited in the types of priors used or have only been applied to model systems. In this study, we reconstruct the regulatory networks underlying trans -QTL hotspots using human cohort data and data-driven prior information.\n\nResultsWe devised a strategy to integrate QTL with human population scale multi-omics data and comprehensively curated prior information from large-scale biological databases. State-of-the art network inference methods applied to these data and priors were used to recover the regulatory networks underlying trans -QTL hotspots. We benchmarked inference methods and showed, that Bayesian strategies using biologically-informed priors outperform methods without prior data in simulated data and show better replication across datasets. Application of our approach to human cohort data highlighted two novel regulatory networks related to schizophrenia and lean body mass for which we generated novel functional hypotheses.\n\nConclusionWe demonstrate, that existing biological knowledge can be leveraged for the integrative analysis of networks underlying trans associations to deduce novel hypotheses on cell regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Plastids and mitochondria have their own small genomes which do not undergo meiotic recombination and may have evolutionary fate different from each other and nuclear genome, thus highlighting interesting phenomena in plant evolution. We for the first time sequenced mitochondrial genomes of pea (Pisum L.), in 38 accessions mostly representing diverse wild germplasm from all over pea geographical range. Six structural types of pea mitochondrial genome were revealed. From the same accessions, plastid genomes were sequenced. Bayesian phylogenetic trees based on the plastid and mitochondrial genomes were compared. The topologies of these trees were highly discordant implying not less than six events of hybridisation of diverged wild peas in the past, with plastids and mitochondria differently inherited by the descendants. Such discordant inheritance of organelles is supposed to have been driven by plastid-nuclear incompatibility, known to be widespread in pea wide crosses and apparently shaping the organellar phylogenies. The topology of a phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequence of a nuclear gene His5 coding for a histone H1 subtype corresponds to the current taxonomy and resembles that based on the plastid genome. Wild peas (Pisum sativum subsp. elatius s.l.) inhabiting Southern Europe were shown to be of hybrid origin resulting from crosses of peas similar to those presently inhabiting south-east and north-east Mediterranean in broad sense.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed our ability to resolve cellular properties across systems. However, current scRNA-seq platforms are one-size-fits-all approaches that are tailored toward large cell inputs (> 1,000 cells), rendering them inefficient and costly when processing small, individual tissue samples. This important drawback tends to be resolved by loading bulk samples, but this yields confounded mosaic cell population read-outs. To overcome these technological limitations, we developed a deterministic, mRNA-capture bead and cell co-encapsulation dropleting system, DisCo. We demonstrate that DisCo enables precise particle and cell positioning and droplet sorting control through combined machine-vision and multilayer microfluidics. In comparison to other microfluidics systems, the active flow control driving DisCo, enables continuous operation and processing of low-input samples (< 100 cells) at high capture efficiency (> 70%). To underscore the unique capabilities of our approach, we analyzed intestinal organoid development by \"DisCo-ing\" 31 individual organoids at varying developmental stages. This revealed extensive organoid heterogeneity, identifying distinct subtypes including a regenerative fetal-like Ly6a+ stem cell population which persists as symmetrical cysts even under differentiation conditions. Furthermore, we uncovered a so far uncharacterized \"gobloid\" subtype consisting predominantly of precursor and mature (Muc2+) goblet cells. These findings demonstrate the unique power of DisCo in providing high-resolution snapshots of cellular heterogeneity among small, individual tissues.",

    "abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a relatively common developmental defect with considerable mortality and morbidity. Diaphragm formation is a complex process, involving several cell types, each with different developmental origins. Due to this complexity, the aetiology of CDH is not well understood. The pleuroperitoneal folds (PPFs) and the post hepatic mesenchymal plate (PHMP) are transient structures that are essential during diaphragm development. Using several mouse models including lineage tracing, we demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of the cells that make up the PPFs. The conditional deletion of Wt1 (Wilms Tumour gene) in the non-muscle mesenchyme of the PPFs results in CDH. We show that the fusion of the PPFs and the PHMP to form a continuous band of tissue involves migration of cells from both sources. The PPFs of mutant mice fail to fuse with the PHMP and exhibit increased RALDH2 expression. However, no changes in the expression of genes implicated in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are observed. Additionally, the mutant PPFs lack migrating myoblasts and muscle connective tissue fibroblasts (TCF4+/GATA4+), suggesting possible interactions between these cell types. Our study demonstrates the importance of the non-muscle mesenchyme in diaphragm development.\n\nAuthor SummaryCongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a frequent developmental defect and it remains one of the most difficult problems of perinatology. The defect can be repaired by surgery but it is often associated with complications and total mortalities are still high (50-60%). The causes of CDH are largely unknown. Body cavity formation is a carefully regulated process, and diaphragm formation defines the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Connective tissue and muscle fibres are the known major players involved in diaphragm formation. Our current study emphasises another player, the mesenchymal cells. We manipulate the expression of an important developmental regulator, Wt1 (Wilms tumour gene), in mesenchymal cells in a tissue specific manner using transgenic mouse models. We found that mutant mice can survive till birth, develop diaphragmatic hernia, and die shortly after birth. Ablating Wt1 in the mesenchymal cells leads to ceased movement, and the failure to form a continuous band of tissue. In our model, disruption of mesenchymal cell movement leads to the attenuation of migration of connective tissue fibroblasts and myoblasts, suggesting possible interactions between these cell types.",

    "abstract": "We present METATRYP version-2 software that identifies shared peptides across organisms within environmental metaproteomics studies to enable accurate taxonomic attribution of peptides during protein inference. Improvements include: ingestion of complex sequence assembly data categories (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assemblies, single cell amplified genomes, and metagenome assembled genomes), prediction of the Least Common Ancestor (LCA) for a peptide shared across multiple organisms, increased performance through updates to the backend architecture, and development of a web portal (https://metatryp.whoi.edu). Major expansion of the marine database confirms low occurrence of shared tryptic peptides among disparate marine microorganisms, implying tractability for targeted metaproteomics. METATRYP was designed for ocean metaproteomics and has been integrated into the Ocean Protein Portal (https://oceanproteinportal.org); however, it can be readily applied to other domains. We describe the rapid deployment of a coronavirus-specific web portal (https://metatryp-coronavirus.whoi.edu/) to aid in use of proteomics on coronavirus research during the ongoing pandemic. A Coronavirus-focused METATRYP database identified potential SARS-CoV-2 peptide biomarkers and indicated very few shared tryptic peptides between SARS-CoV-2 and other disparate taxa, sharing 0.1% peptides or less (1 peptide) with the Influenza A & B pan-proteomes, establishing that taxonomic specificity is achievable using tryptic peptide-based proteomic diagnostic approaches.\n\nStatement of significanceWhen assigning taxonomic attribution in bottom-up metaproteomics, the potential for shared tryptic peptides among organisms in mixed communities should be considered. The software program METATRYP v 2 and associated interactive web portals enables users to identify the frequency of shared tryptic peptides among taxonomic groups and evaluate the occurrence of specific tryptic peptides within complex communities. METATRYP facilitates phyloproteomic studies of taxonomic groups and supports the identification and evaluation of potential metaproteomic biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (S-AKI) is the most common complication in hospitalized and critically ill patients, highlighted by a rapid decline of kidney function occurring a few hours or days after sepsis onset. Systemic inflammation elicited by microbial infections is believed to lead to kidney damage under immunocompromised conditions. However, while AKI has been recognized as a disease with long-term sequelae, partly due to the associated higher risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), the understanding of kidney pathophysiology at the molecular level and the global view of dynamic regulations in situ after S-AKI, including transition to CKD, remains limited. Existing studies of S-AKI mainly focus on deriving sepsis biomarkers from body fluids. In the present study, we constructed a mid-severity septic murine model using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and examined the temporal changes to the kidney proteome and phosphoproteome at day 2 and day 7 after CLP surgery, corresponding to S-AKI and the transition to CKD, respectively by employing an ultrafast and economical filter-based sample processing method combined with the label-free quantitation approach. Collectively, we identified 2,119 proteins and 2,950 phosphosites through multi-proteomics analyses. Here we denote the pathways that are specifically responsive to S-AKI and its transition to CKD, which include regulation of cell metabolism regulation, oxidative stress, and energy consumption in the diseased kidneys.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which jumped into the human population in late 2019 from a currently uncharacterised animal reservoir. Due to this extremely recent association with humans, SARS-CoV-2 may not yet be fully adapted to its human host. This has led to speculations that some lineages of SARS-CoV-2 may be evolving towards higher transmissibility. The most plausible candidate mutations under putative natural selection are those which have emerged repeatedly and independently (homoplasies). Here, we formally test whether any of the recurrent mutations that have been observed in SARS-CoV-2 are significantly associated with increased viral transmission. To do so, we develop a phylogenetic index to quantify the relative number of descendants in sister clades with and without a specific allele. We apply this index to a carefully curated set of recurrent mutations identified within a dataset of 46,723 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients worldwide. We do not identify a single recurrent mutation in this set convincingly associated with increased viral transmission. Instead, recurrent SARS-CoV-2 mutations currently in circulation appear to be evolutionary neutral. Recurrent mutations also seem primarily induced by the human immune system via host RNA editing, rather than being signatures of adaptation to the novel human host. In conclusion, we find no evidence at this stage for the emergence of significantly more transmissible lineages of SARS-CoV-2 due to recurrent mutations.",

We are employing pneumatic artificial muscles, such as air cylinders, in the reverse mode of operation to achieve mechanical ventilation. The current design of the device can operate in two modes: controlled mode and assisted mode. Unlike most ICU ventilators, our device does not need a high-pressure air pipeline to operate. With the current design, mechanical ventilation for respiration rate ranging from 10 b/min to 30 b/min with a tidal volume range of 150 mL to 1000 mL and I:E ratio of 1:1 to 1:5 can be performed. We achieved a total cost of less $400 USD to make one device. We estimate the device to cost less than $250 USD when produced in larger volumes.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic provides an urgent example where a gap exists between availability of state-of-the-art diagnostics and current needs. As assay details and primer sequences become widely known, many laboratories could perform diagnostic tests using methods such as RT-PCR or isothermal RT-LAMP amplification. A key advantage of RT-LAMP based approaches compared to RT-PCR is that RT-LAMP is known to be robust in detecting targets from unprocessed samples. In addition, RT-LAMP assays are performed at a constant temperature enabling speed, simplicity, and point-of-use testing. Here, we provide the details of an RT-LAMP isothermal assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus with performance comparable to currently approved tests using RT-PCR. We characterize the assay by introducing swabs in virus spiked synthetic nasal fluids, moving the swab to viral transport medium (VTM), and using a volume of that VTM for performing the amplification without an RNA extraction kit. The assay has a Limit-of-Detection (LOD) of 50 RNA copies/L in the VTM solution within 20 minutes, and LOD of 5000 RNA copies/L in the nasal solution. Additionally, we show the utility of this assay for real-time point-of-use testing by demonstrating detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in less than 40 minutes using an additively manufactured cartridge and a smartphone-based reader. Finally, we explore the speed and cost advantages by comparing the required resources and workflows with RT-PCR. This work could accelerate the development and availability of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics by proving alternatives to conventional laboratory benchtop tests.\n\nSignificance StatementAn important limitation of the current assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 stem from their reliance on time- and labor-intensive and laboratory-based protocols for viral isolation, lysis, and removal of inhibiting materials. While RT-PCR remains the gold standard for performing clinical diagnostics to amplify the RNA sequences, there is an urgent need for alternative portable platforms that can provide rapid and accurate diagnosis, potentially at the point-of-use. Here, we present the details of an isothermal amplification-based detection of SARS-CoV-2, including the demonstration of a smartphone-based point-of-care device that can be used at the point of sample collection.",

    "abstract": "Recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Currently, there is no vaccine available for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Like closely related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 also uses its receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the spike (S) protein to engage the host receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), facilitating subsequent viral entry. Here we report the immunogenicity and vaccine potential of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (SARS2-RBD)-based recombinant proteins. Immunization with SARS2-RBD recombinant proteins potently induced a multi-functional antibody response in mice. The resulting antisera could efficiently block the interaction between SARS2-RBD and ACE2, inhibit S-mediated cell-cell fusion, and neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the anti-RBD sera also exhibited cross binding, ACE2-blockade, and neutralization effects towards SARS-CoV. More importantly, we found that the anti-RBD sera did not promote antibody-dependent enhancement of either SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry or authentic virus infection of Fc receptor-bearing cells. These findings provide a solid foundation for developing RBD-based subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV2.",

    "abstract": "A serious public health crisis is currently unfolding due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 viral entry depends on an interaction between the receptor binding domain of the trimeric viral Spike protein (Spike-RBD) and the dimeric human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. While it is clear that strategies to block the Spike/ACE2 interaction are promising as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, our current understanding is insufficient for the rational design of maximally effective therapeutic molecules. Here, we investigated the mechanism of Spike/ACE2 interaction by characterizing the binding affinity and kinetics of different multimeric forms of recombinant ACE2 and Spike-RBD domain. We also engineered ACE2 into a split Nanoluciferase-based reporter system to probe the conformational landscape of Spike-RBDs in the context of the Spike trimer. Interestingly, a dimeric form of ACE2, but not monomeric ACE2, binds with high affinity to Spike and blocks viral entry in pseudotyped virus and live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assays. We show that dimeric ACE2 interacts with an RBD on Spike with limited intra-Spike avidity, which nonetheless contributes to the affinity of this interaction. Additionally, we demonstrate that a proportion of Spike can simultaneously interact with multiple ACE2 dimers, indicating that more than one RBD domain in a Spike trimer can adopt an ACE2-accessible \"up\" conformation. Our findings have significant implications on the design strategies of therapeutic molecules that block the Spike/ACE2 interaction. The constructs we describe are freely available to the research community as molecular tools to further our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is known to bind to the receptor, ACE2, on the surface of target cells. The spike protein is processed by membrane proteases, including TMPRSS2, and either internalises or fuses directly with the cell, leading to infection. We have identified a human cell line that expresses both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the RT4 urinary bladder transitional carcinoma, and used it to develop a proxy assay for viral interactions with host cells. A tagged recombinant form of the spike protein, containing both the S1 and S2 domains, interacted strongly with RT4 cells as determined by flow cytometry, whereas the S1 domain and the receptor binding domain (RBD) interacted weakly. S1S2 interaction was temperature dependent and increased sharply at 37{degrees}C, suggesting that processing of the intact spike protein is likely to be important in the interaction. S1S2 protein could associate with cells with a low dependence on ACE2 expression, while RBD required the presence of ACE2 for interaction. As the spike protein has previously been shown to bind heparin, a soluble glycosaminoglycan, we used a flow cytometric assay to determine the effect of heparin on spike protein interaction with RT4 cells. Unfractionated heparin inhibited spike protein interaction with an IC50 value of <0.05U/ml whereas two low molecular weight heparins were much less effective. A mutant form of the spike protein, lacking the Arg-rich region proposed to be a furin cleavage site, interacted very weakly with cells and had a lower affinity for unfractionated and lower molecular weight heparin than the wild type spike protein. This indicates that the furin cleavage site might also be a heparin binding site and potentially important in interactions with host cells. Taken together, our data suggest that heparin, particularly unfractionated forms, could be considered to reduce clinical manifestations of COVID-19 by inhibiting continuing viral infection.\n\nAuthor SummarySince the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, the world has faced a vast public health crisis. SARS-CoV-2 associates with human cells through interaction of the viral spike protein with the host receptor, ACE2. In the absence of a vaccine, new treatments are required to reduce the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we use a novel technique to demonstrate spike protein interactions with human cells with low levels of ACE2 at the cell surface, suggesting a secondary receptor. We demonstrate the importance of a new heparin-binding site within the viral spike protein for these interactions. We also found that unfractionated heparin was able to bind to the viral spike protein and therefore, potently inhibit viral spike protein interactions with human cells. Our data demonstrate that ACE2 is not absolutely required for spike protein interactions with human cells and furthermore, that unfractionated heparin should be considered as a treatment to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) potently stimulates HIV-1 particle assembly in vitro and infectious particle production in vivo. However, knockout cells lacking the enzyme inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPPK-KO), which adds the final phosphate to inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5) to produce IP6, were still able to produce infectious HIV-1 particles at a greatly reduced rate. HIV-1 in vitro assembly can also be stimulated to a lesser extent with IP5, but it was not known if IP5 could also function in promoting assembly in vivo. IPPK-KO cells expressed no detectable IP6 but elevated IP5 levels and displayed a 20-100-fold reduction in infectious particle production, correlating with lost virus release. Transient transfection of an IPPK expression vector stimulated infectious particle production and release in IPPK-KOs but not in wildtype cells. Several attempts to make an IP6 and IP5 deficient stable cell line were not successful, but transient expression of multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase-1 (MINPP1) into IPPK-KOs resulted in the near ablation of IP6 and IP5. Under these conditions, HIV-1 infectious particle production and virus release were essentially abolished (1000-fold reduction). However, other retroviruses including a Gammaretrovirus, a Betaretrovirus, and two non-primate Lentiviruses displayed only a modest (3-fold) reduction in infectious particle production from IPPK-KOs and were not significantly altered by expression of IPPK or MINPP1. The only other retrovirus found that showed a clear IP6/IP5 dependence was the primate (macaque) Lentivirus Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV-mac), which displayed similar sensitivity to IP6/IP5 levels as HIV-1. Finally, we found that loss of IP6/IP5 in viral target cells had no effect on permissiveness to HIV-1 infection. However, because it was not possible to generate viral particles devoid of IP6 and IP5, we were not able to determine if IP6 or IP5 derived from the virus producer cells is required at additional steps beyond assembly.\n\nAuthor SummaryInositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) is a co-factor required for efficient production of infectious HIV-1 particles. The HIV-1 structural protein Gag forms a hexagonal lattice structure. The negatively charged IP6 sits in the middle of the hexamer and stabilizes a ring of positively charged lysines. Previously described results show that depletion of IP6 reduces, but does not eliminate, infectious virus production. This depletion was achieved through knock-out of inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPPK-KO), the enzyme responsible for adding the sixth and final phosphate to the molecule. Whether IP6 is required, another inositol phosphate can substitute, or IP6 is simply acting as an enhancer for virus production was unknown. Here, we show that loss of IP6 and inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5) abolishes infectious HIV-1 production from cells. We do this through a cell-based system using transiently expressed proteins to restore or deplete IP6 and IP5 in the IPPK-KO cell line. We further show that the IP6 and IP5 requirement is a feature of primate lentiviruses, but not all retroviruses, and that IP6 and IP5 is required in the producer but not the target cell for HIV-1 infection.",

This study pioneered the use of full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) for rapid and automated on-site pathological diagnosis of GCA. Sixteen TABs (12 negative and 4 positive for GCA) were selected according to major histopathological criteria of GCA following hematoxylin-eosin-saffron-staining for subsequent acquisition with FF-OCT to compare structural modifications of the artery cell wall and thickness of each tunica. Gabor filtering of FF-OCT images was then used to compute TAB orientation maps and validate a potential automated analysis of TAB sections. FF-OCT allowed both qualitative and quantitative visualization of the main structures of the temporal artery wall, from the internal elastic lamina to the vasa vasorum and red blood cells, unveiling a significant correlation with conventional histology. FF-OCT imaging of GCA TABs revealed destruction of the media with distinct remodeling of the whole arterial wall into a denser reticular fibrous neo-intima, which is distinctive of GCA pathogenesis and accessible through automated Gabor filtering. Rapid on-site FF-OCT TAB acquisition makes it possible to identify some characteristic pathological lesions of GCA within a few minutes, paving the way for potential machine intelligence-based or even non-invasive diagnosis of GCA.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Background: Recent reports on the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) alone, or combined with azithromycin (AZM) in the management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have raised cardiac safety concerns. Currently, there is limited mechanistic data evaluating cardiac safety with HCQ and AZM therapy. \nMethods: Using comprehensive In Vitro ProArrhythmia Assay (CiPA) Schema IC50 paradigms, we examined the cardiac electrophysiological effects of HCQ and HCQ/AZM. Molecular modelling explored HCQ and AZM binding properties to hERG. Langendorff-perfused guinea-pig hearts were electrically and optically mapped by multi-electrode array and voltage (RH237) and Ca2+ (Rhod-2 AM) dyes. Human action potential and ion current reconstructions were performed in silico.\nResults: HCQ blocked IKr and IK1 with IC50 concentrations (10+-0.6 and 34+-5.0 microM) within the therapeutic range observed clinically. HCQ also blocked INa and ICaL but at higher IC50, whilst Ito and IKs were unaffected. Contrastingly, AZM produced minor inhibition of INa, ICaL, IKs, and IKr,, with no effect on IK1 and Ito.  HCQ + AZM combined inhibited IKr and IK1 with IC50s of 7.7 +- 0.8 microM and 30.4 +- 3.0 microM, but spared INa, ICaL and Ito,.  Molecular modelling confirmed potential HCQ binding to hERG. Cardiac mapping and ECG studies in isolated hearts demonstrated that HCQ slowed heart rate and ventricular conduction with associated prolongation of PR, QRS and QT intervals. Optical mapping demonstrated, and prolonged, more heterogeneous, action potential durations and intracellular Ca2+ transients. These effects were accentuated with combined HCQ+AZM treatment, which elicited electrical alternans, re-entrant circuits and wave breaks. Reconstruction in a human in-silico model demonstrated that this is attributable to the integrated action of HCQ and AZM reducing IKr, IKs and IK1.\nConclusions: These data provide an electrophysiological basis for recent FDA guidelines cautioning against combined HCQ/AZM administration for the treatment of Covid-19 on the grounds of potential cardiac safety. We would strongly recommend monitoring of electrocardiographic QT interval with the use of this combination of medications.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",

Although LaNt 31 has been demonstrated to influence corneal and skin epithelial cell function, its expression has not been investigated beyond these tissues. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to characterise the distribution of this protein in a wide-array of human tissue sections in comparison to laminin 3. These data revealed widespread LaNt 31 expression. In epithelial tissue, LaNt 31 was present in the basal layer of the epidermis, throughout the epithelium of the digestive tract, and much of the epithelium of the reproductive system. LaNt 31 was also found throughout the vasculature of most tissues, with enrichment in reticular-like fibres in the extracellular matrix surrounding large vessels. A similar matrix pattern was observed around the terminal ducts in the breast and around the alveolar epithelium in the lung, where basement membrane staining was also evident. Specific enrichment of LaNt 31 was identified in sub-populations of cells of the kidney, liver, pancreas, and spleen, with variations in intensity between different cell types in the collecting ducts and glomeruli of the kidney being of particular note. Intriguingly, LaNt 31 immunoreactivity was also evident in neurons of the central nervous system, in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and spinal cord. Together these findings suggest that LaNt 31 may be functionally relevant in a wider range of tissue contexts than previously thought, and provides a valuable basis for investigation into this interesting protein.",

In a greenhouse trial, we studied how eight plant species responded to single and combined effects of three RDX soil concentrations and two levels of water-resourcing. In an outdoor trial, we studied the effects of high RDX soil concentration and two levels of water-resourcing in three plant species. Multiple endpoints related to RDX fate, plant health, and plant survival were evaluated in both trials. Starting RDX concentration was the most frequent factor influencing all endpoints. Water-resourcing also had significant impacts, but in fewer cases. For most endpoints, significant interaction effects between RDX concentration and water-resourcing were observed for some species and treatments. Main and interaction effects were typically variable (significant in one treatment, but not in another; associated with increasing endpoint values for one treatment and/or with decreasing endpoint values in another). This complexity has implications for understanding how RDX and water-availability combine to impact plants, as well as for applications like phytoremediation. Two plant species native to the southeastern United States, Ruellia caroliniensis and Salvia coccinea, exhibited treatment responses that suggest they may be useful for phytoremediation, even within complex and changing environments.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization has resulted in the origin and variation in extant species, and hybrids continue to arise despite pre- and post-zygotic barriers that limit their formation and evolutionary success. One important system that maintains species boundaries in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the mismatch repair pathway, which blocks recombination between divergent DNA sequences. Previous studies illuminated the role of the mismatch repair component Msh2 in blocking genetic recombination between divergent DNA during meiosis. Loss of Msh2 results in increased interspecific genetic recombination in bacterial and yeast models, and increased viability of progeny derived from yeast hybrid crosses. Hybrid isolates of two pathogenic fungal Cryptococcus species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus deneoformans, are isolated regularly from both clinical and environmental sources. In the present study, we sought to determine if loss of Msh2 would relax the species boundary between C. neoformans and C. deneoformans. We found that crosses between these two species in which both parents lack Msh2 produced hybrid progeny with increased viability and high levels of aneuploidy. Whole-genome sequencing revealed few instances of recombination among hybrid progeny and did not identify increased levels of recombination in progeny derived from parents lacking Msh2. Several hybrid progeny produced structures associated with sexual reproduction when incubated alone on nutrient-rich medium in light, a novel phenotype in Cryptococcus. These findings represent a unique, unexpected case where rendering the mismatch repair system defective did not result in increased meiotic recombination across a species boundary. This suggests that alternative pathways or other mismatch repair components limit meiotic recombination between homeologous DNA and enforce species boundaries in the basidiomycete Cryptococcus species.\n\nAuthor summarySeveral mechanisms enforce species boundaries by either preventing the formation of hybrids, known as pre-zygotic barriers, or preventing the viability and fecundity of hybrids, known as post-zygotic barriers. Despite these barriers, interspecific hybrids form at an appreciable frequency, such as hybrid isolates of the human fungal pathogenic species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus deneoformans, which are regularly isolated from both clinical and environmental sources. C. neoformans x C. deneoformans hybrids are typically highly aneuploid, sterile, and display phenotypes intermediate to those of either parent, although self-fertile isolates and transgressive phenotypes have been observed. One important mechanism known to enforce species boundaries or lead to incipient speciation is the DNA mismatch repair system, which blocks recombination between divergent DNA sequences during meiosis. The aim of this study was to determine if genetically deleting the DNA mismatch repair component Msh2 would relax the species boundary between C. neoformans and C. deneoformans. Progeny derived from C. neoformans x C. deneoformans crosses in which both parental strains lacked Msh2 had higher viability, and unlike previous studies in Saccharomyces, these Cryptococcus hybrid progeny had higher levels of aneuploidy and no observable increase in meiotic recombination at the whole-genome level.",

We noted a dot like contamination in our THP1 cell line, which does not make the culture medium turbid as fast as other common contaminants and remains in the culture for many days before it makes the culture unusable. The contaminant was identified as a member of the genus Brevibacterium and we could find that the antibiotic rifampicin effectively suppresses the growth of the bacterium.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas systems provide their prokaryotic hosts with acquired immunity against viruses and other foreign genetic elements, but how these systems are regulated to prevent auto-immunity is poorly understood. In type II CRISPR-Cas systems, a transactivating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) scaffold functions together with a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) guide to program Cas9 for the recognition and cleavage of foreign DNA targets. Here, we show that a long-form tracrRNA performs an unexpected second function by folding into a natural single guide that directs Cas9 to transcriptionally repress its own promoter. Further, we demonstrate that Pcas9 serves as a critical regulatory node; de-repression causes a dramatic induction of Cas genes, crRNAs and tracrRNAs resulting in a 3,000-fold increase in immunization rates against unrecognized viruses. Heightened immunity comes at the cost of increased auto-immune toxicity, demonstrating the critical importance of the controller. Using a bioinformatic analysis, we provide evidence that tracrRNA-mediated autoregulation is widespread in type II CRISPR-Cas systems. Collectively, we unveil a new paradigm for the intrinsic regulation of CRISPR-Cas systems by natural single guides, which may facilitate the frequent horizontal transfer of these systems into new hosts that have not yet evolved their own regulatory strategies.",

    "abstract": "Biochemistry and molecular biology have become increasingly reliant on experimental experience, because they are difficult subjects to understand from a theoretical approach. The Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program was established by the China Ministry of Education to foster the scientific interests and experiences of undergraduate students. Here, we reported on an innovative project-oriented learning (POL) system directed by Taishan Medical University (Named Shandong First Medical University &amp; Shandong Academy of Sciences since February 2019) China, which fused innovative project with biochemical course concepts. This study takes reverse genetics, which is considered to be difficult to understand through course-only learning, as an example. To help undergraduate students understand the principle of reverse genetics, the project involved producing hepatitis C virus in vitro. Furthermore, to give them a comprehensive scientific experience based on their knowledge from textbook, extensive mentorship was provided through the project, including theoretical guidance and technical support for experiments. Assessment showed a comprehensive improvement after participating in these programs. In conclusion, this POL system was a good model that enabled undergraduates to learn more during courses. It also provided a chance to experience hands-on sciences, which might motivate them to pursue a career in science.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Many cellular processes require cell polarization to be maintained as the cell changes shape, grows or moves. Without feedback mechanisms relaying information about cell shape to the polarity molecular machinery, the coordination between cell polarization and morphogenesis, movement or growth would not be possible. Here we theoretically and computationally study the role of a genetically-encoded mechanical feedback (in the Cell Wall Integrity Pathway) as a potential coordination mechanism between cell morphogenesis and polarity during budding yeast mating projection growth. We developed a coarse-grained continuum description of the coupled dynamics of cell polarization and morphogenesis as well as 3D stochastic simulations of the molecular polarization machinery in the evolving cell shape. Both theoretical approaches show that in the absence of mechanical feedback (or in the presence of weak feedback), cell polarity cannot be maintained at the projection tip during growth, with the polarization cap wandering off the projection tip, arresting morphogenesis. In contrast, for mechanical feedback strengths above a threshold, cells can robustly maintain cell polarization at the tip and simultaneously sustain mating projection growth. These results indicate that the mechanical feedback encoded in the Cell Wall Integrity pathway can provide important positional information to the molecular machinery in the cell, thereby enabling the coordination of cell polarization and morphogenesis.\n\nAuthor summaryCell migration, morphogenesis and secretion are among the vast number of cellular processes that require cells to define a preferred spatial direction to perform essential tasks. This is achieved by setting an intracellular molecular gradient that polarizes the cell. While the molecular players involved in cell polarization and some of the mechanisms that cells use to establish such molecular gradients are known, it remains unclear how cells maintain polarization as they dramatically change shape during morphogenesis, migration, etc. Here we identify a potential feedback control mechanism, encoded genetically in cells, that provides the molecular polarization machinery with the necessary information about cell geometry to maintain cell polarization during cell shape changes.",

    "abstract": "Dicer-Like (DCL), Argonaute (AGO), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) gene families are known as RNA silencing machinery genes or RNAi genes. They have important activities at post-transcriptional and chromatin modification levels. They regulate gene expression relating to different stresses, growth, and development in eukaryotes. A complete cycle of gene silencing is occurred by the collaboration of these three families. However, these gene families are not yet rigorously studied in the economically important wheat genome. Our bioinformatic analysis based genome-wide identification, characterization, diversification and regulatory components of these gene families identified 7 TaDCL, 39 TaAGO and 16 TaRDR genes from wheat genome against RNAi genes of Arabidopsis thaliana. Phylogenetic analysis of wheat genome with Arabidopsis and rice RNAi genes showed that TaDCL, TaAGO and TaRDR proteins are clustered into four, eight and four subgroups respectively. Domain, motif and exon-intron structure analyses showed that the TaDCL, TaAGO and TaRDR proteins conserve identical characteristics within groups while retain diverse differences between groups. GO annotations implied that a number of biological and molecular pathways are linked to RNAi mechanism in wheat. Gene networking between transcription factors and RNAi proteins indicates that ERF is the leading family linked to maximum RNAi genes followed by MIKC-MADS, C2H2, BBR-BPC, MYB, and Dof. Cis-regulatory elements associated to RNAi genes are predicted to act as regulatory components against various environmental conditions. Expressed sequence tag analysis showed that larger numbers of RNAi genes are expressed in different tissues and organs predicted to play roles for healthy plants and grains. Expression analysis of 7 TaDCL genes using qRT-PCR showed that only TaDCL3a and TaDCL3b had root specific significant expression (p-value<0.05) with no expression in leaf validated EST results. Besides, TaDCL3b and TaDCL4 significantly prompted in drought condition indicating their potential role in drought stress tolerance. Overall results would however help researchers for in-depth biological investigation of these RNAi genes in wheat crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly recognized condition in which children with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection present with a constellation of symptoms including hypotension, multiorgan involvement, and elevated inflammatory markers. These symptoms and the associated laboratory values strongly resemble toxic shock syndrome, an escalation of the cytotoxic adaptive immune response triggered upon the binding of pathogenic superantigens to MHCII molecules and T cell receptors (TCRs). Here, we used structure-based computational models to demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) exhibits a high-affinity motif for binding TCR, interacting closely with both the - and {beta}-chains variable domains complementarity-determining regions. The binding epitope on S harbors a sequence motif unique to SARS-CoV-2 (not present in any other SARS coronavirus), which is highly similar in both sequence and structure to bacterial superantigens. Further examination revealed that this interaction between the virus and human T cells is strengthened in the context of a recently reported rare mutation (D839Y/N/E) from a European strain of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the interfacial region includes selected residues from a motif shared between the SARS viruses from the 2003 and 2019 pandemics, which has intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-like character. These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 S may act as a superantigen to drive the development of MIS-C as well as cytokine storm in adult COVID-19 patients, with important implications for the development of therapeutic approaches.\n\nSignificanceAlthough children have been largely spared from severe COVID-19 disease, a rare hyperinflammatory syndrome has been described in Europe and the East Coast of the United States, termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MISC). The symptoms and diagnostic lab values of MIS-C resemble those of toxic shock, typically caused by pathogenic superantigens stimulating excessive activation of the adaptive immune system. We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike has a sequence and structure motif highly similar to those of bacterial superantigens, and may directly bind to the T cell receptors. This sequence motif, not present in other coronaviruses, may explain the unique potential for SARS-CoV-2 to cause both MIS-C and the cytokine storm observed in adult COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Ebola virus (EBOV) is the most virulent pathogens that cause hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in humans and nonhuman primates. The postexposure antibody therapies to prevent EBOV infection are considered efficient. However, due to the poor thermal stability of mammalian antibody, their application in the tropics has been limited. Here, we developed a thermostable therapeutic antibody against EBOV based on chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY). The IgY antibodies demonstrated excellent thermal stability, which retained their neutralizing activity at 25{degrees}C for one year, in contrast to conventional polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). We immunized laying hens with a variety of EBOV vaccine candidates and confirmed that VSV {Delta} G/EBOVGP encoding the EBOV glycoprotein could induce high titer neutralizing antibodies against EBOV. The therapeutic efficacy of immune IgY antibodies in vivo was evaluated in the newborn Balb/c mice model. Lethal dose of virus challenged mice were treated 2 or 24 h post-infection with different doses of anti-EBOV IgY. The group receiving a high dose of 106 NAU/kg (neutralizing antibody units/kilogram) achieved complete protection with no signs of disease, while the low-dose group was only partially protected. In contrast, all mice receiving naive IgY died within 10 days. In conclusion, the anti-EBOV IgY exhibits excellent thermostability and protective efficacy, and it is very promising to be developed as alternative therapeutic entities.\n\nAuthor SummaryAlthough several Ebola virus therapeutic antibodies have been reported in recent years, however, due to the poor thermal stability of mammalian antibody, their application in tropical endemic areas has been limited. We developed a highly thermostable therapeutic antibody against EBOV based on chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY). The IgY antibodies demonstrated excellent thermal stability, which retained their neutralizing activity at 25{degrees}C for one year. The newborn mice receiving passive transfer of IgY achieved complete protection against a lethal dose of virus challenge indicating that the anti-EBOV IgY provides a promising countermeasure to solve the current clinical application problems of Ebola antibody-based treatments in Africa.",

This strain was subjected to various stress conditions, including osmotic stress using different salts, physical stress by ultraviolet (UV) light, and light stress using different photoperiods. The optimal growth conditions for carotenoid production were determined to be 1 min of UV light, 0.5 mg/L of magnesium sulfate, and 18:6 h light/dark period, which resulted in a carotenoid yield of 118.3 g of carotenoid per gram of yeast.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite infecting up to one third of the human population. The central event in the pathogenesis of toxoplasmosis is the conversion of tachyzoites into encysted bradyzoites. A novel approach to analyze the structure of in vivo-derived tissue cysts may be the increasingly used computational image analysis. The objective of this study was to quantify the geometrical complexity of T. gondii cysts by morphological, particle, and fractal analysis, as well as to determine if and how it is impacted by parasite strain, cyst age, and host factors. Analyses were performed on 31 images of T. gondii brain cysts of four type-2 strains (the reference Me49 strain and three local isolates, named BGD1, BGD14, and BGD26) using ImageJ software package. The parameters of interest included diameter, circularity, relative particle count (RPC), fractal dimension (FD), lacunarity, and packing density (PD). Although cyst diameter varied widely, its negative correlation with RPC was observed. Circularity was remarkably close to 1, indicating that the shape of the brain cysts was a perfect circle. RPC, FD, and PD did not vary among cysts of different strains, age, and derived from mice of different genetic background. Conversely, lacunarity, which is a measure of heterogeneity, was significantly lower for BGD1 strain vs. all other strains, and higher for Me49 vs. BGD14 and BGD26, but did not differ among Me49 cysts of different age, and derived from genetically different mice. This study is the first application of fractal analysis in describing the structural complexity of T. gondii cysts. Despite all the differences among the analyzed cysts, most parameters remained conserved. Fractal analysis is a novel and widely accessible approach, which along with particle analysis may be applied to gain further insight into T. gondii cyst morphology.",

However, broader use of this gene editing toolbox is hampered by the great variability of efficiency among different target sites. Here we present TRAP-seq, a versatile and scalable approach in which the CRISPR gRNA expression cassette and the corresponding surrogate site are captured by Targeted Reporter Anchored Positional Sequencing in cells. TRAP-seq can faithfully recapitulate the CRISPR gene editing outcomes introduced to the corresponding endogenous genome site and most importantly enables massively parallel quantification of CRISPR gene editing in cells. We demonstrate the utility of this technology for high-throughput quantification of SpCas9 editing efficiency and indel outcomes for 12,000 gRNAs in human embryonic kidney cells. Using this approach, we also showed that TRAP-seq enables high throughput quantification of both ABE and CBE efficiency at 12,000 sites in cells. This rich amount of ABE/CBE outcome data enable us to reveal several novel nucleotide features (e.g. preference of flanking bases, nucleotide motifs, STOP recoding types) affecting base editing efficiency, as well as designing improved machine learning-based prediction tools for designing SpCas9, ABE and CBE gRNAs of high efficiency and accuracy (>70%). We have integrated all the 12,000 CRISPR gene editing outcomes for SpCas9, ABE and CBE into a CRISPR-centered portal: The Human CRISPR Atlas. This study extends our knowledge on CRISPR gene and base editing, and will facilitate the application and development of CRISPR in both research and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Local activation and long-range inhibition are mechanisms conserved in self-organizing systems leading to biological patterns. A number of them involve the production by the developing cell of an inhibitory morphogen, but how this cell gets immune to self-inhibition is rather unknown. Under combined nitrogen starvation, the multicellular cyanobacterium Nostoc PCC 7120 develops nitrogen-fixing heterocysts with a pattern of a heterocyst every 10-12 vegetative cells. Cell differentiation is regulated by HetR which activates the synthesis of its own inhibitory morphogen (PatS), which diffusion establishes the differentiation pattern. Here we show that HetR interacts with HetL at the same interface as PatS, and that this interaction is required to suppress inhibition and to differentiate heterocysts. hetL expression is induced under nitrogen-starvation and is activated by HetR, suggesting that HetL provides immunity to the heterocyst. This protective mechanism might be conserved in other differentiating cyanobacteria as HetL homologues are spread across the phylum.",

In an earlier study in this laboratory a KHV isolate GY1506 (KHV GY01 in GeneBank) was isolated from diseased common carp, replicated on CCB cells and identified by PCR targeted on and phylogenetic analysis of thymidine kinase (TK) gene. Electron microscopy examination of GY01 infected CCB cell line and whole genome analysis was studied for further characteristics and epidemiological features of this strain.\n\nResultsElectron microscopy examination of CCB infected with KHV GY01 strain revealed destruct of infected cells including incomplete nuclear membranes, deformed nucleus, marginalized nuclear chromosome, and the virus of different development stages and morphologies in the cytoplasm and nucleus, which resembles the herpesvirus. MEGA X and phyML were used for multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis of whole genomes of GY01 and other 21 KHV strains available in GeneBank. analysis showed that GY01 was more close to E and KHV-I and was predicted it originated from the same ancestor as the E and KHV-I. Pairwise alignment of strain GY01 and strain E by Geneious software and YASS online version revealed that two strains had high identity(99.1%) at the nucleotide sequence level although variations and disagreement existed. The number and structure arrangement of open reading frames (orfs) or protein-encoding genes of GY01 is very similar to KHV E, and also to KHV-U but different from KHV-I. The characteristics and function of each orf need further study in the future.\n\nConclusionsPathogenic changes of infected CCB cells and morphologies of KHV GY01 resembles the herpesvirus. Pairwise, multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis of whole genomes of GY01 and other 21 KHV strains available in GeneBank demonstrated that the GY01 is closely related to strain KHV E and KHV-I and suggested it originated from the same ancestor as the E and KHV-I.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 respiratory disease is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which uses the enzyme ACE2 to entry human cells. This disease is characterized by important damages at multi-organ level, partially due to the abundant expression of ACE2 in practically all human tissues. However, not every organ in which ACE2 is abundant is affected by SARS CoV-2, which suggests the existence of other multi-organ routes for transmitting the perturbations produced by the virus. We consider here diffusive processes through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 as such alternative route. We found a subdiffusive regime that allows the propagation of virus perturbations through the PPI network at a significant rate. By following the main subdiffusive routes across the PPI network we identify proteins mainly expressed in the heart, cerebral cortex, thymus, testis, lymph node, kidney, among others of the organs reported to be affected by COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has generated a global pandemic and no vaccine or antiviral drugs exist at the moment of writing. An attractive coronavirus drug target is the main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLpro) because of its vital role in the viral cycle. A significant body of work has been focused on finding inhibitors which bind and block the active site of the main protease, but little has been done to address potential non-competitive inhibition which targets regions beyond the active site, partly because the fundamental biophysics of such allosteric control is still poorly understood. In this work, we construct an Elastic Network Model (ENM) of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro homodimer protein and analyse the dynamics and thermodynamics of the main proteases ENM. We found a rich and heterogeneous dynamical structure in the correlated motions, including allosterically correlated motions between the homodimeric proteases active sites. Exhaustive 1-point and 2-point mutation scans of the ENM and their effect on fluctuation free energies confirm previously experimentally identified bioactive residues, but also suggest several new candidate regions that are distant from the active site for control of the protease function. Our results suggest new dynamically-driven control regions as possible candidates for non-competitive inhibiting binding sites in the protease, which may assist the development of current fragmentbased binding screens. The results also provide new insight into the protein physics of fluctuation allostery and its underpinning dynamical structure.",

    "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that the lower airway microbiota impacts lung health. However, the link between microbial community composition and lung homeostasis remains elusive. We combined amplicon sequencing and culturomics to characterize the viable bacterial community in 234 longitudinal bronchoalveolar lavage samples from 64 lung transplant recipients and established links to viral loads, host gene expression, lung function, and transplant health. We find that the lung microbiota post-transplant can be categorized into four distinct compositional states,  pneumotypes. The predominant  balanced pneumotype was characterized by a diverse bacterial community with moderate viral loads, and host gene expression profiles suggesting immune tolerance. The other three pneumotypes were characterized by being either microbiota-depleted, or dominated by potential pathogens, and were linked to increased immune activity, lower respiratory function, and increased risks of infection and rejection. Collectively, our findings establish a link between the lung microbial ecosytem, human lung function, and clinical stability post-transplant.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=191 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/106211v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (57K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1df2be3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ba839dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@116f657org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@86d8ac_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
