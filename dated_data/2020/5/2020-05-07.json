    "abstract": "SummaryHigh-throughput technologies produce complex high-dimensional datasets which are analyzed using a variety of ever-evolving bioinformatics tools. Well-designed web frameworks enable more intuitive and efficient analysis such that less time is spent on coding and more time is spent on interpretation of results and addressing insightful biological questions aided by interactive visualizations. Here, we present Omics BioAnalytics, a full-service Web framework that enables comprehensive, multi-level characterization, analysis, and integration of omics datasets. Blending web-based (R Shiny) and voice-based (Amazons Alexa) analytics, Omics BioAnalytics can be used both by expert computational biologists and non-coding biological domain experts, alike. Our web framework can be utilized to explore complex datasets and identify biosignatures and discriminative biomarkers of health and disease processes, and generate testable hypotheses relating to underlying molecular mechanisms.\n\nAvailabilityOmics BioAnalytics is freely available at https://github.com/singha53/omicsBioAnalytics and the web app is deployed at https://amritsingh.shinyapps.io/omicsBioAnalytics/.

    "abstract": "Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) bind microbe- and damage-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs/DAMPs, respectively) to enhance host immunity in animals and plants. Here, we report that PRRs also confer salt tolerance in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana following recognition of cognate ligands, such as bacterial flagellin and EF-Tu and the endogenous Pep peptides. Pattern-triggered salt tolerance (PTST) requires the PRR-associated kinases BAK1 and BIK1, and the NADPH oxidase RBOHD. Transcriptome profiling reveals an inventory of PTST target genes, which increase or acquire salt responsiveness following an exposure to immunogenic patterns. In their regulatory DNA sequences, specific binding sites for a subset of WRKY transcription factors are over-represented. Accordingly, PTST requires WRKY40 and WRKY18, which activate salt tolerance-related genes but attenuate pathogen defense-related genes, including the EDS1 immunity activator. PRR signaling leads to sustained WRKY40/WRKY18 accumulation under salt stress and utilizes both WRKYs for salt tolerance. The PRR-WRKY40/WRKY18 module also confers salt tolerance after challenge with non-pathogenic bacteria. Our findings give molecular insight into signaling plasticity underlying biotic-abiotic stress cross-tolerance in plants conferred by PRRs.",

    "abstract": "The vaginal microbiome has been connected to a wide range of health outcomes. This has led to a thriving research environment, but also to the use of conflicting methodologies to study its microbial composition. Here we systematically assess best practices for the sequencing-based characterization of the human vaginal microbiome. As far as 16S rRNA gene sequencing is concerned, the V1-V3 region has the best theoretical properties, but limitations of current sequencing technologies mean that the V3-V4 region performs equally well. Both of these approaches present very good agreement with qPCR quantification of key taxa, provided an appropriate bioinformatic pipeline is used. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing presents an interesting alternative to 16S amplification and sequencing, but it is not without its challenges. We have assessed different tools for the removal of host reads and the taxonomic annotation of metagenomic reads, including a new, easy-to-build and - use, reference database of vaginal taxa. This strategy performed as well as the best performing previously published strategies. Despite the many advantages of shotgun sequencing none of the shotgun approaches assessed here had as good agreement with the qPCR data as 16S rRNA gene sequencing.\n\nImportanceThe vaginal microbiome has been connected to a wide range of health outcomes, from susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections to gynecological cancers and pregnancy outcomes. This has led to a thriving research environment, but also to conflicting available methodologies, including many studies that do not report their molecular biological and bioinformatic methods in sufficient detail for them to be considered reproducible. This can lead to conflicting messages and delay progress from descriptive to intervention studies. By systematically assessing best practices for the characterization of the human vaginal microbiome, this study will enable past studies to be assessed more critically and assist future studies in the selection of appropriate methods for their specific research questions.",

Here, we developed four improvements of a data independent acquisition mass spectrometry proteogenomics workflow to reveal distinct molecular phenotypes related to breast cancer appearance. We confirm mutational processes detectable at the protein level and highlight quantitation and pathway complementarity between RNA and protein data. Our analyses also validated previously established enrichments of estrogen receptor-dependent molecular features relating to transcription factor expression, and provided evidence for molecular differences related to the presence of mammographic appearances in spiculated tumors. In addition, several transcript-protein pairs displayed radically different abundance correlations depending on the overall clinical and pathological properties of the tumor. These results demonstrate that there are differentially regulated protein networks in clinically relevant sample groups, and that these protein networks influence both cancer biology as well as the abundance of potential biomarkers and drug targets.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses are prone to emergence into new host species most recently evidenced by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Small animal models that recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 disease are desperately needed to rapidly evaluate medical countermeasures (MCMs). SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect wildtype laboratory mice due to inefficient interactions between the viral spike (S) protein and the murine ortholog of the human receptor, ACE2. We used reverse genetics to remodel the S and mACE2 binding interface resulting in a recombinant virus (SARS-CoV-2 MA) that could utilize mACE2 for entry. SARS-CoV-2 MA replicated in both the upper and lower airways of both young adult and aged BALB/c mice. Importantly, disease was more severe in aged mice, and showed more clinically relevant phenotypes than those seen in hACE2 transgenic mice. We then demonstrated the utility of this model through vaccine challenge studies in immune competent mice with native expression of mACE2. Lastly, we show that clinical candidate interferon (IFN) lambda-1a can potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human airway epithelial cells in vitro, and both prophylactic and therapeutic administration diminished replication in mice. Our mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 model demonstrates age-related disease pathogenesis and supports the clinical use of IFN lambda-1a treatment in human COVID-19 infections.",

    "abstract": "Viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus responsible of the Covid-19 pandemic, were sequenced in several Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces of China between 2017 and 20191-3. These viruses belong to two lineages: one from Guangdong (GD/P) and the other from Guangxi (GX/P). The GD/P viruses are particularly intriguing as the amino-acid sequence of the receptor binding domain of the spike protein is very similar to that of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (97.4%)2. This characteristic suggests that GD/P viruses are capable of binding human ACE2 receptor and may therefore be able to mediate infection of human cells. Whereas all six GX/P genomes were deposited as annotated sequences in GenBank, none of the two GD/P genomes assembled in previous studies2,3 are currently available. To overcome this absence, I assembled these genomes from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data available for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses detected in five captive pangolins from Guangdong. I found the genome assemblies of GD/P virus of poor quality, having high levels of missing data. Additionally, unexpected reads in the Illumina sequencing data were identified. The GD/P2S dataset2 contains reads that are identical to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting either the coexistence of two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the same pangolin or contamination by the human virus. In the four other GD/P datasets1 many mitochondrial reads from pangolin were identified, as well as from three other species, namely, human, mouse and tiger. Importantly, I only identified three polymorphic nucleotide sites between the five GD/P sequences. Such low levels of polymorphism may reasonably be accounted for by sequencing errors alone, thus raising the possibility that the five pangolins seized in Guangdong in March 2019 were infected by the same virus strain, most probably during their captivity.",

There are currently no specific registered antiviral drugs to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of [~]20 {micro}M, which is well below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2-3 logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3) were treated. Time of addition and plaque reduction assays showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle, possibly preventing entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin also inhibited the progression of infection. The results of our preclinical study warrant further investigation and suggest it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19 patients, which obviously requires well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 can lead to acute respiratory syndrome, which can be due to dysregulated immune signaling. We analyze the distribution of CpG dinucleotides, a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We find that the CpG content, which we characterize by a force parameter that accounts for statistical constraints acting on the genome at the nucleotidic and amino-acid levels, is, on average, low compared to other pathogenic betacoronaviruses. However, the CpG force widely fluctuates along the genome, with a particularly low value, comparable to the circulating seasonal HKU1, in the spike coding region and a greater value, comparable to SARS and MERS, in the highly expressed nucleocapside coding region (N ORF), whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3UTRs of all subgenomic RNA. This dual nature of CpG content could confer to SARS-CoV-2 the ability to avoid triggering pattern recognition receptors upon entry, while eliciting a stronger response during replication. We then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, finding a signature of CpG loss in regions with a greater CpG force. Sequence motifs preceding the CpG-loss-associated loci in the N ORF match recently identified binding patterns of the Zinc finger Anti-viral Protein. Using a model of the viral gene evolution under human host pressure, we find that synonymous mutations seem driven in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and particularly in the N ORF, by the viral codon bias, the transition-transversion bias and the pressure to lower CpG content.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with elevated levels of TNF- and proinflammatory CD11c monocytes /macrophages. TNF- mediated dysregulation in the plasticity of monocytes/macrophages is concomitant with pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, including metabolic syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Since neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2; product of the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 gene, SMPD3) is a key enzyme for ceramide production involved in inflammation, we investigated whether nSMase2 contributed to the inflammatory changes in the monocytes/macrophages induced by TNF-. In this study, we demonstrate that the disruption of nSMase activity in monocytes/macrophages either by chemical inhibitor GW4869 or small interfering RNA (siRNA) against SMPD3 results in defects in the TNF- mediated expression of CD11c. Furthermore, blockage of nSMase in monocytes/macrophages inhibited the secretion of inflammatory mediators IL-1b and MCP-1. In contrast, inhibition of acid SMase (aSMase) activity did not attenuate CD11c expression or secretion of IL-1b and MCP-1. TNF--induced phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and NF-{kappa}B was also attenuated by the inhibition of nSMase2. Moreover, NF-kB/AP-1 activity was blocked by the inhibition of nSMase2. SMPD3 was elevated in PBMCs from obese individuals and positively corelated with TNF- gene expression. These findings indicate that nSMase2 acts, at least in part, as a master switch in the TNF- mediated inflammatory responses in monocytes/macrophages.",

A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information.\n\nMethodsWe investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis of HCoV-host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.\n\nThe 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression, triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells.\n\nResultsAlthough the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines.\n\nConclusionsIn this paper, we developed a network-based model with the aim to define molecular aspects of pathogenic phenotypes in HCoV infections. The resulting pattern may facilitate the process of structure-guided pharmaceutical and diagnostic research with the prospect to identify potential new biological targets.",

We consider a population destined for extinction in the absence of mutants, which can only survive if mutants sufficiently adapted to the new environment arise and fix. We show that mutants that appear later during the environment deterioration have a higher probability to fix. The rescue probability of the population increases with a sigmoidal shape when the product of the carrying capacity and of the mutation probability increases. Furthermore, we find that rescue becomes more likely for smaller population sizes and/or mutation probabilities if the environment degradation is slower, which illustrates the key impact of the rapidity of environment degradation on the fate of a population. We also show that our main conclusions are robust across various types of adaptive mutants, including specialist and generalist ones, as well as mutants modeling antimicrobial resistance evolution. We further express the average time of appearance of the mutants that do rescue the population and the average extinction time of those that do not. Our methods can be applied to other situations with continuously variable fitnesses and population sizes, and our analytical predictions are valid in the weak-to-moderate mutation regime.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic 1,2. In order to understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and antigenic potential, and to develop diagnostic and therapeutic tools, it is essential to portray the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity map is currently based on computational predictions and relies on homology to other coronaviruses. Since coronaviruses differ in their protein array, especially in the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific collection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Utilizing a suite of ribosome profiling techniques 3-8, we present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 coding regions, allowing us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral open reading frames (ORF)s and to identify 23 novel unannotated viral translated ORFs. These ORFs include upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are likely playing a regulatory role, several in-frame internal ORFs lying within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. We further show that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; rather, virus translation dominates host translation due to high levels of viral transcripts. Overall, our work reveals the full coding capacity of SARS-CoV-2 genome, providing a rich resource, which will form the basis of future functional studies and diagnostic efforts.",

    "abstract": "The technique RT-qPCR for viral RNA detection is the current worldwide strategy used for early detection of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. RNA extraction is a key pre-analytical step in RT-qPCR, often achieved using commercial kits. However, the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic is causing disruptions to the global supply chains used by many diagnostic laboratories to procure the commercial kits required for RNA extraction. Shortage in these essential reagents is even more acute in developing countries with no means to produce kits locally. We sought to find an alternative procedure to replace commercial kits using common reagents found in molecular biology laboratories. Here we report a method for RNA extraction that takes about 40 min to complete ten samples, and is not more laborious than current commercial RNA extraction kits. We demonstrate that this method can be used to process nasopharyngeal swab samples and yields RT-qPCR results comparable to those obtained with commercial kits. Most importantly, this procedure can be easily implemented in any molecular diagnostic laboratory. Frequent testing is crucial for individual patient management as well as for public health decision making in this pandemic. Implementation of this method could maintain crucial testing going despite commercial kit shortages.",

To get a grip on this outbreak, specific preventive and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. It must be said that, until now, there are no existing vaccines for coronaviruses. To promptly and rapidly respond to pandemic events, the application of in silico trials can be used for designing and testing medicines against SARS-CoV-2 and speed-up the vaccine discovery pipeline, predicting any therapeutic failure and minimizing undesired effects. Here, we present an in silico platform that showed to be in very good agreement with the latest literature in predicting SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and related immune system host response. Moreover, it has been used to predict the outcome of one of the latest suggested approach to design an effective vaccine, based on monoclonal antibody. Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS) in silico platform is potentially ready to be used as an in silico trial platform to predict the outcome of vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV-2.",

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR is the simplest means to carry this out. However, technical challenges remain to improve efficiency and broaden applicability to any genetic background of Drosophila melanogaster as well as to other Drosophila species. To address these issues, we developed a two-stage marker-assisted strategy in which embryos are injected with RNPs and pre-screened using T7EI. Using sgRNA in complex with recombinant Cas9 protein, we assayed each sgRNA for genome-cutting efficiency. We then conducted HDR using sgRNAs that efficiently cut target genes and the application of a transformation marker that generates RNAi against eyes absent. This allows for screening based on eye morphology rather than color. These new tools can be used to make a single change or a series of allelic substitutions in a region of interest, or to create additional genetic tools such as balancer chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "By analyzing successive lifestyle stages of a model Rhizobium-legume symbiosis using mariner-based transposon insertion sequencing (INSeq), we have defined the genes required for rhizosphere growth, root colonization, bacterial infection, N2-fixing bacteroids and release from legume (pea) nodules. While only 27 genes are annotated as nif and fix in Rhizobium leguminosarum, we show 603 genetic regions (593 genes, 5 tRNAs and 5 RNA features) are required for the competitive ability to nodulate pea and fix N2. Of these, 146 are common to rhizosphere growth through to bacteroids. This large number of genes, defined as rhizosphere-progressive, highlights how critical successful competition in the rhizosphere is to subsequent infection and nodulation. As expected, there is also a large group (211) specific for nodule bacteria and bacteroid function. Nodule infection and bacteroid formation require genes for motility, cell envelope restructuring, nodulation signalling, N2 fixation, and metabolic adaptation. Metabolic adaptation includes urea, erythritol and aldehyde metabolism, glycogen synthesis, dicarboxylate metabolism and glutamine synthesis (GlnII). There are separate lifestyle adaptations specific to rhizosphere growth (17) and root colonization (23), distinct from infection and nodule formation. These results dramatically highlight the importance of competition at multiple stages of a Rhizobium-legume symbiosis.\n\nSignificanceRhizobia are soil-dwelling bacteria that form symbioses with legumes and provide biologically useable nitrogen as ammonium for the host plant. High-throughput DNA sequencing has led to a rapid expansion in publication of complete genomes for numerous rhizobia, but analysis of gene function increasingly lags gene discovery. Mariner-based transposon insertion sequencing (INSeq) has allowed us to characterize the fitness contribution of bacterial genes and determine those functionally important in a Rhizobium-legume symbiosis at multiple stages of development.",

    "abstract": "The haptophyte genus Pseudohaptolina (formerly Chrysochromulina clade B1-3) currently harbors two species: Pseudohaptolina arctica and Pseudohap-tolina sorokinii. In addition, Chrysochromulina birgeri is expected to belong to this genus due to its morphological similarity to P. sorokinii, but has not yet been genetically characterized. A strain belonging to Pseudohaptolina was brought into culture from Arctic waters, characterized by 18S and 28S rRNA gene sequencing as well as optical and transmission electron microscopy, and deposited in the Roscoff Culture Collection with the code RCC5270. Molecular and morphological data from RCC5270 were compared with those from previously described Pseudohaptolina and Pseudohaptolina-like species. Strain RCC5270 showed strong phylogenetic affinity to P. sorokinii, but TEM observations showed that RCC5270 possesses three types of organic body scale, rather than two as originally described in P. sorokinii. We found that the occurrence of three scale types is likely to have been overlooked in the original descriptions of both P. sorokinii and C. birgeri. We also found that environmental metabarcodes identical to the sequence of RCC5270 were abundant in the location from which C. birgeri was initially described (Gulf of Finland). We conclude that P. sorokinii and C. birgeri are conspecific and P. sorokinii is therefore synonymous with C. birgeri. Based on its phylogenetic placement and nomenclatural priority we propose the new combination Pseudohaptolina birgeri and emend the description of this species.",

    "abstract": "Although seagrasses are economically and ecologically critical species, little is known about their blade surface microbial communities and how these communities relate to the plant host. To determine microbial community composition and diversity on seagrass blade surfaces and in the surrounding seawater,16S rRNA gene sequencing (iTag) was used for samples collected at five sites along a gradient of freshwater input in the northern Gulf of Mexico on three separate sampling dates. Additionally, seagrass surveys were performed and environmental parameters were measured to characterize host characteristics and the abiotic conditions at each site. Results showed that Thalassia testudinum (turtle grass) blades hosted unique microbial communities that were distinct in composition and diversity from the water column. Additionally, results suggested that environmental conditions, including water depth, salinity, and temperature, were the major driver of community structure as blade surface microbial communities varied among sites and over sampling dates. Host condition may be a secondary driver of community structure as compositional changes were also correlated with host characteristics, including leaf growth rates and blade nutrient composition, Additionally, 21 microorganisms from five phyla (Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes) were present in all blade surface samples and may represent a core community for T. testudinum. Members of this core community may have ecological importance for determining community structure or in performing key community functions. This study provides new insights and understanding of the processes that influence the structure of marine phyllosphere communities, how these microbial communities relate to their host, and their role as a part of the seagrass holobiont, which is an important contribution given the current decline of seagrass coverage worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression requires specific structural alternations in the nucleoid structure to enable the access of the transcription machinery into the genomic DNA. In prokaryotes, DNA binding proteins, including nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) and transcription factors (TFs), drive the change in structure and gene expression. Currently, studies of global NAP and TF binding are often hindered by the lack of appropriate epigenomic tools. Here, we present POP-seq, a method that provides in vivo genome-wide openness profiles of the bacterial nucleoid. We demonstrate that POP-seq can be used to map the global in vivo protein-DNA binding events. Our results highlight a negative correlation between genome openness, compaction and transcription, suggesting that regions that are not accessible to Tn5 transposase are either too compacted or occupied by RNA polymerase. Importantly, we also show that the least open regions are enriched in housekeeping genes, while the most open regions are significantly enriched in genes important for fast adaptation to changing environment. Finally, we demonstrated that the genome openness profile is growth condition specific. Together, those results suggest a model where one can distinguish two types of epigenetic control: one stable, long-term silencing of highly compacted regions, and a second, highly responsive regulation through the dynamic competition between NAPs and RNA polymerase binding. Overall, POP-seq captures structural changes in the prokaryotic chromatin and provides condition-specific maps of global protein-DNA binding events, thus linking overall transcriptional and epigenetic regulation directly to phenotype.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has tragically burdened individuals and institutions around the world. There are currently no approved drugs or vaccines for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Enhanced understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To reveal insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host-viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2 we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air-liquid interface cultures over a time-course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as a major target of infection, which we confirmed by electron microscopy. Over the course of infection, cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell-intrinsic expression of type I and type III IFNs and IL6 but not IL1. This results in expression of interferon-stimulated genes in both infected and bystander cells. We observe similar gene expression changes from a COVID-19 patient ex vivo. In addition, we developed a new computational method termed CONditional DENSity Embedding (CONDENSE) to characterize and compare temporal gene dynamics in response to infection, which revealed genes relating to endothelin, angiogenesis, interferon, and inflammation-causing signaling pathways. In this study, we conducted an in-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HBECs and a COVID-19 patient and revealed genes, cell types, and cell state changes associated with infection.",

    "abstract": "Human fungal pathogens often encounter fungicidal stress conditions upon host invasion, but they can swiftly adapt by transcriptional reprogramming that enables pathogen survival. Fungal immune evasion is tightly connected to chromatin regulation. Hence, fungal chromatin modifiers pose alternative treatment options to combat fungal infections. Here, we present an ATAC-seq protocol adapted for the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans to gain further insight into the interplay of chromatin accessibility and gene expression mounted during fungal adaptation to oxidative stress. The ATAC-seq workflow facilitates the robust detection of genomic regions with accessible chromatin, but also allows for the precise modeling of nucleosome positions in C. albcians. Importantly, the data reveal genes with altered chromatin accessibility in upstream regulatory regions, which correlate with transcriptional regulation during the oxidative stress response. Interestingly, many genes show increased chromatin accessibility yet no change in gene expression upon stress exposure. Such chromatin signatures could predict yet unknown regulatory factors under highly dynamic transcriptional control. In addition, de novo motif analysis in genomic regions with increased chromatin accessibility upon hydrogen peroxide treatment shows significant enrichment for Cap1 binding sites, a major factor of oxidative stress responses in C. albicans. Taken together, the ATAC-seq workflow enables the identification of chromatin signatures and uncovers the dynamics of regulatory mechanisms mediating environmental adaptation of C. albicans to host immune surveillance.\n\nImportanceThe opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans colonizes and infects various tissues and organs of the human host. This is due to its rapid environmental adaptation facilitated by changes in gene expression coupled to chromatin alterations. Recent advances in chromatin profiling approaches, such as the development of ATAC-seq, shed light on the dynamic interplay of chromatin accessibility and transcriptional control. The here presented expansion of the ATAC-seq method to C. albicans demonstrates the robustness of ATAC-seq to detect dynamic modulations of chromatin accessibility in response to oxidative stress. This work serves as a basis to further exploit this application to characterize regulatory mechanisms that drive fungal environmental adaptation, such as during host invasion, and thus, will open novel antifungal treatment strategies targeting fungal chromatin regulation.",

    "abstract": "Over half of the worlds population lives in urban areas with, according to the United Nations (UN), nearly 70% expected to live in cities by 2050 (United Nations, 2019). Our cities are built by and for humans, but are also complex, adaptive biological systems involving a diversity of other living species. The majority of these species are invisible and constitute the citys microbiome. Our design decisions for the built environment shape these invisible populations, and we interact with them on a constant basis. A growing body of evidence shows us that our health and well-being are dependent on these interactions. Indeed, multicellular organisms owe meaningful aspects of their development and phenotype to interactions with the microorganisms--bacteria or fungi--with which they live in continual exchange and symbiosis. While the processing and sequencing of samples can be high-throughput, gathering samples is still very expensive, labor intensive, and can require mobilizing large numbers of volunteers to get a snapshot of the microbial landscape of a city, such as City Sampling Day (metasub.org). Here we postulate that honeybees may be effective collaborators in the sampling process, as they daily forage within a 2-mile radius of their hive. We describe the results of a pilot study conducted with 3 rooftop beehives in Brooklyn, NY, where we evaluated the potential of various hive materials (beeswax, honey, debris, pollen, propolis) to reveal information as to the surrounding metagenomic landscape, and where we conclude that the bee debris are the richest substrate. Based on these results, we profiled 4 additional cities in this manner: Sydney, Melbourne, Venice and Tokyo. While the molecular and computational methods used here were based on DNA analysis, it is possible they could be used to monitor RNA-based viruses such as Sars-Cov-2. Here we present the results of this study, and discuss them in terms of architectural implications, as well as the potential of this method for epidemic surveillance.",

    "abstract": "AbtractEukaryotic microorganisms transcribe monocistronic mRNAs to encode proteins. For synthetic biological approaches like metabolic engineering, precise co-expression of several proteins in space and time is advantageous. A straightforward approach is the application of viral 2A peptides to design synthetic polycistronic mRNAs in eukaryotes. Here, we establish such a system in the well-studied model microorganism Ustilago maydis. Using two fluorescence reporter proteins, we compared the activity of five viral 2A peptides. Their activity was evaluated in vivo using fluorescence microscopy and validated using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Activity ranged from 20 to 100% and the best performing 2A peptide was P2A from porcine teschovirus-1. As proof of principle, we followed regulated gene expression efficiently over time and synthesised a tri-cistronic mRNA encoding biosynthetic enzymes to produce mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs). In essence, we evaluated 2A peptides in vivo and demonstrated the applicability of 2A peptide technology for U. maydis in basic and applied science.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles in eukaryotic cells that fulfill various important metabolic functions. In this study, we investigated the role of Docking/Translocation Module (DTM) peroxins, mainly FvPex8, FvPex13, FvPex14, and FvPex33, in Fusarium verticillioides virulence and fumonisin B1 (FB1) biosynthesis. Protein interaction experiments suggested that FvPex13 serves as the core subunit of F. verticillioides DTM. When we generated gene deletion mutants ({Delta}Fvpex8, {Delta}Fvpex13, {Delta}Fvpex14, {Delta}Fvpex33, {Delta}Fvpex33/14) and examined whether the expression of other peroxin genes were affected in the DTM mutants, {Delta}Fvpex8 strain showed most drastic changes to PEX gene expression profiles. Deletion mutants exhibited disparity in carbon source utilization and defect in cell wall integrity when stress agents were applied. Under nutrient starvation, mutants also showed higher levels of lipid droplet accumulation. Notably, {Delta}Fvpex8 mutant showed significant FB1 reduction and altered expression of FUM1 and FUM19 genes. However, FvPex13 was primarily responsible for virulence, while {Delta}Fvpex33/14 double mutant also showed virulence defect. In summary, our study suggests that FvPex13 is the core component of DTM, regulating peroxisome membrane biogenesis as well as PTS1- and PTS2-mediated transmembrane cargo transportation. Importantly, we predict FvPex8 as a key component in DTM that affects peroxisome function in FB1 biosynthesis in F. verticillioides.",

    "abstract": "How genes with novel cellular functions evolve is a central biological question. Exon shuffling is one mechanism to assemble new protein architectures. Here we show that DNA transposons, which are mobile and pervasive in genomes, have provided a recurrent supply of exons and splice sites to assemble protein-coding genes in vertebrates via exon-shuffling. We find that transposase domains have been captured, primarily via alternative splicing, to form new fusion proteins at least 94 times independently over [~]350 million years of tetrapod evolution. Evolution favors fusion of transposase DNA-binding domains to host regulatory domains, especially the Kruppel-associated Box (KRAB), suggesting transposase capture frequently yields new transcriptional repressors. We show that four independently evolved KRAB-transposase fusion proteins repress gene expression in a sequence-specific fashion. Genetic knockout and rescue of the bat-specific KRABINER fusion gene in cells demonstrates that it binds its cognate transposons genome-wide and controls a vast network of genes and cis-regulatory elements. These results illustrate a powerful mechanism by which a transcription factor and its dispersed binding sites emerge at once from a transposon family.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryHost-transposase fusion generates novel cellular genes, including deeply conserved and lineage specific transcription factors.",

    "abstract": "Phages are the main source of within-species bacterial diversity and drivers of horizontal gene transfer, but we know little about the mechanisms that drive genetic diversity of these mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Recently, we showed that a sporulation selection regime promotes evolutionary changes within SP{beta} prophage of Bacillus subtilis, leading to direct antagonistic interactions within the population. Herein, we reveal that under a sporulation selection regime, SP{beta} recombines with low copy number phi3Ts phage DNA present within the B. subtilis population. Recombination results in a new prophage occupying a different integration site, as well as the spontaneous release of virulent phage hybrids. Analysis of Bacillus sp. strains suggests that SP{beta} and phi3T belong to a distinct cluster of unusually large phages inserted into sporulation-related genes that are equipped with a spore-related genetic arsenal. Comparison of Bacillus sp. genomes indicates that similar diversification of SP{beta}-like phages takes place in nature. Our work is a stepping stone toward empirical studies on phage evolution, and understanding the eco-evolutionary relationships between bacteria and their phages. By capturing the first steps of new phage evolution, we reveal striking relationship between survival strategy of bacteria and evolution of their phages.",

    "abstract": "Dissimilatory nitrate/nitrite reduction to ammonium (DNRA) has recently gained attention as a nitrogen retention pathway that may potentially be harnessed to alleviate nitrogen loss resulting from denitrification. Until recently, ecophysiology of DNRA bacteria inhabiting agricultural soils has remained largely unexplored, due to the difficulty in targeted enrichment and isolation of DNRA microorganisms. In this study, >100 microbial isolates capable of DNRA have been isolated from rice paddy soil with apparent dominance of denitrification using a novel high-throughput screening method. Six of these isolates, each assigned to a disparate genus, was examined to improve understanding of DNRA physiology. All isolates carried nrfA and/or nirB, and an isolate affiliated to Bacillus possessed a clade II nosZ gene and was capable of N2O reduction. A common prominent physiological feature observed in all DNRA isolates was NO2- accumulation observed before NH4+ production, which was further examined with Citrobacter sp. DNRA3 (possessing nrfA and nirB) and Enterobacter sp. DNRA5 (possessing only nirB). In both organisms, NO2--to-NH4+ reduction was inhibited by submillimolar NO3-, and nrfA or nirB transcription was down-regulated when NO3- was being reduced to NO2-. Both batch and chemostat incubations of these isolates with excess organic electron donors produced NH4+ from reduction of NO3-; however, incubation with excess NO3- resulted in NO2- buildup but no substantial NH4+ production, presumably due to NO3- presence. This previously overlooked link between NO3- repression of NO2--to-NH4+ reduction and the C-to-N ratio regulation of DNRA activity may be a key mechanism underpinning denitrification-vs-DNRA competition in soil.\n\nIMPORTANCEDissimilatory nitrate/nitrite reduction to ammonium (DNRA) is an anaerobic microbial pathway that competes with denitrification for common substrates NO3- and NO2-. Unlike denitrification leading to nitrogen loss and N2O emission, DNRA reduces NO3- and NO2- to NH4+, a reactive nitrogen with higher tendency to be retained in soil matrix. Therefore, stimulation of DNRA has often been proposed as a strategy to improve fertilizer efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Such attempts have been hampered by lack of insights into soil DNRA ecophysiology. Here, we have developed a novel high-throughput screening method for isolating DNRA-catalyzing organisms from agricultural soils without apparent DNRA activity. Physiological characteristics of six DNRA isolates were closely examined, disclosing a previously overlooked link between NO3- repression of NO2--to-NH4+ reduction and the C-to-N ratio regulation of DNRA activity, which may be key to understanding why significant DNRA activity is rarely observed in nitrogen-rich agricultural soils.",
