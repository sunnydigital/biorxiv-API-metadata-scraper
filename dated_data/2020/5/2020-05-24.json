    "abstract": "The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\n\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\n\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts contain photosynthetic protein complexes that convert light energy into chemical energy. Photosynthetic protein complexes are considered to undergo structural reorganization to maintain the efficiency of photochemical reactions. A detailed description of the mobility of photosynthetic complexes in real-time is necessary to understand how macromolecular organization of the membrane is altered by environmental fluctuations. Here, we used high-speed atomic force microscopy to visualize and characterize the in situ mobility of individual protein complexes in grana thylakoid membranes isolated from Spinacia oleracea. Our observations reveal that these membranes can harbor complexes with at least two distinctive classes of mobility. A large fraction of grana membranes contained proteins with quasi-static mobility, exhibiting molecular displacements smaller than 10 nm2. In the remaining fraction, the protein mobility is variable with molecular displacements of up to 100 nm2. This visualization at high-spatiotemporal resolution enabled us to estimate an average diffusion coefficient of [~]1 nm2 s-1. Interestingly, both confined and Brownian diffusion models could describe the protein mobility of the second group of membranes. We also provide the first direct evidence of rotational diffusion of photosynthetic complexes. The rotational diffusion of photosynthetic complexes could be an adaptive response to the high protein density in the membrane to guarantee the efficiency of electron transfer reactions. This characterization of the mobility of individual photosynthetic complexes in grana membranes establishes a foundation that could be adapted to study the dynamics of the complexes inside the intact and photosynthetically functional thylakoid membranes to be able to understand its structural responses to diverse environmental fluctuations.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe characterized the dynamics of individual photosynthetic protein complexes in grana thylakoid membranes from Spinacia oleracea by high-speed atomic microscopy (HS-AFM). Direct visualization at high spatiotemporal resolution unveils that the mobility of photosynthetic proteins is heterogeneous but governed by the confinement effect imposed by the high protein density in the thylakoid membrane. The photosynthetic complexes display rotational diffusion, which might be a consequence of the crowded environment in the membrane and a mechanism to sustain an efficient electron transfer chain.",

    "abstract": "We propose an extended Gaussian mixture model for the distribution of causal effects of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for human complex phenotypes that depends on linkage disequilibrium (LD) and heterozygosity (H), while also allowing for independent components for small and large effects. Using a precise methodology showing how genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics (z-scores) arise through LD with underlying causal SNPs, we applied the model to GWAS of multiple human phenotypes. Our findings indicated that causal effects are distributed with dependence on total LD and H, whereby SNPs with lower total LD and H are more likely to be causal with larger effects; this dependence is consistent with models of the influence of negative pressure from natural selection. Compared with the basic Gaussian mixture model it is built on, the extended model - primarily through quantification of selection pressure - reproduces with greater accuracy the empirical distributions of z-scores, thus providing better estimates of genetic quantities, such as polygenicity and heritability, that arise from the distribution of causal effects.",

    "abstract": "High-frequency stimulation induced long-term potentiation (LTP), or low frequency stimulation induced LTD are considered as cellular models of memory formation. Interestingly, spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can induce equally robust timing-dependent LTP (t-LTP) and t-LTD in response to low frequency repeats of coincident action potential (AP) firing in presynaptic and postsynaptic cells. Commonly, STDP paradigms relying on 25-100 repeats of coincident AP firing are used to elicit t-LTP or t-LTD, but the minimum number of repeats required for successful STDP is barely explored. However, systematic investigation of physiologically relevant low repeat STDP paradigms is of utmost importance to explain learning mechanisms in vivo. Here, we examined low repeat STDP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses by pairing one presynaptic AP with either one postsynaptic AP (1:1 t-LTP), or a burst of 4 APs (1:4 t-LTP) and found 3-6 repeats to be sufficient to elicit t-LTP. 6x 1:1 t-LTP required postsynaptic Ca2+ influx via NMDARs and L-type VGCCs and was mediated by increased presynaptic glutamate release. In contrast, 1:4 t-LTP depended on postsynaptic metabotropic GluRs and ryanodine receptor signaling, and was mediated by postsynaptic insertion of AMPA receptors. Unexpectedly, both 6x t-LTP variants were strictly dependent on activation of postsynaptic Ca2+-permeable AMPARs but were differentially regulated by dopamine receptor signaling. Our data show that synaptic changes induced by only 3-6 repeats of mild STDP stimulation occurring in [&le;] 10 s can take place on time scales observed also during single trial learning.",

    "abstract": "Semantic reversal anomalies (SRAs) - sentences where an implausibility is created by reversing participant roles - have attracted much attention in the literature on the electrophysiology of language. In spite of being syntactically well-formed but semantically implausible, these sentences unexpectedly elicited a monophasic P600 effect in English and Dutch rather than an N400 effect. Subsequent research revealed variability in the presence/absence of an N400 effect to SRAs depending on the language examined and the choice of verb type in English. However, most previous studies employed the same presentation modality (visual) and task (acceptability judgement). Here, we conducted two experiments and three statistical analyses to investigate the influence of stimulus modality, task demand, and statistical choices on event-related potential (ERP) response patterns to SRAs in English. We reproduced a previous studys procedure and analysis (Bourguignon et al., 2012), and further introduced between-subjects factors of task type and modality, using mixed effects modelling to analyse the data. We observed an N400 effect to typical English SRAs (agent subject verbs, e.g. the fries will eat the boys), which contrasts existing literature and was not predicted by existing theories that account for SRA processing. Task demand modulated the ERPs elicited by SRAs, while auditory presentation led to increased comprehension accuracy and a more broadly distributed ERP. Finally, the statistical methods used influenced the presence/absence of ERP effects. Our results suggest a sensitivity of language-related ERP patterns to methodological parameters and we conclude that future experiments should take this into careful consideration.",

    "abstract": "Plexins receive guidance cues from semaphorin ligands and transmit their signal through the plasma membrane. This family of proteins is unique amongst single-pass transmembrane receptors as their intracellular regions interact directly with several small GTPases, which regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion. Here, we characterize the GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) function of Plexin-B1 and find that a cooperative GAP activity towards the substrate GTPase, Rap1b, is associated with the N-terminal Juxtamembrane region of Plexin-B1. Importantly, we unveil an activation mechanism of Plexin-B1 by identifying a novel functional loop which partially blocks Rap1b entry to the plexin GAP domain. Consistent with the concept of allokairy developed for other systems, Plexin-B activity is increased by an apparent substrate mediated cooperative effect. Simulations and mutagenesis suggest the repositioned JM conformation is stabilized by the new activation switch loop when the active site is occupied, giving rise to faster enzymatic turnover and cooperative behavior. The biological implications, essentially of a threshold behavior for cell migration are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The influence of non-visual information on visual awareness judgments has recently gained substantial interest. Using single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), we investigate the potential contribution of evidence from the motor system to judgment of visual awareness. We hypothesized that TMS-induced activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) would increase reported visual awareness as compared to the control condition. Additionally, we investigated whether TMS-induced motor-evoked potential could measure accumulated evidence for stimulus perception. Following stimulus presentation and TMS, participants first rated their visual awareness verbally using the Perceptual Awareness Scale, after which they responded manually to a Gabor orientation identification task. Delivering TMS to M1 resulted in higher average awareness ratings as compared to the control condition, in both correct and incorrect identification task response trials, when the hand with which participants responded was contralateral to the stimulated hemisphere (TMS-response-congruent trials). This effect was accompanied by longer Perceptual Awareness Scale response times, irrespective of the congruence between TMS and identification response. Moreover, longer identification response times were observed in TMS-response-congruent trials in the M1 condition as compared to the control condition. Additionally, the amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials were related to the awareness ratings when response congruence was taken into account. We argue that motor-evoked potential can serve as an indirect measure of evidence accumulated for stimulus perception and that longer Perceptual Awareness Scale response times and higher amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials in the M1 condition reflect integration of additional evidence with visual awareness judgment. In conclusion, we advocate that motor activity influences perceptual awareness judgments.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical cell competition is important during tissue development, cancer invasion, and tissue ageing. Heterogeneity plays a key role in practical applications since cancer cells can have different cell stiffness and different proliferation rates than normal cells. To study this phenomenon, we propose a one-dimensional mechanical model of heterogeneous epithelial tissue dynamics that includes cell-length-dependent proliferation and death mechanisms. Proliferation and death are incorporated into the discrete model stochastically and arise as source/sink terms in the corresponding continuum model that we derive. Using the new discrete model and continuum description, we explore several applications including the evolution of homogeneous tissues experiencing proliferation and death, and competition in a heterogeneous setting with a cancerous tissue competing for space with an adjacent normal tissue. This framework allows us to postulate new mechanisms that explain the ability of cancer cells to outcompete healthy cells through mechanical differences rather than by having some intrinsic proliferative advantage. We advise when the continuum model is beneficial and demonstrate why naively adding source/sink terms to a continuum model without considering the underlying discrete model may lead to incorrect results.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement, the increase of assortative mating driven by selection against unfit hybrids, is conditional on pre-existing divergence. Yet, for ecological divergence to precede the evolution of assortment, strict symmetries between fitnesses in niches must hold, and/or there must be low gene flow between the nascent species. It has thus been argued that conditions favouring sympatric speciation are rarely met in nature. Indeed, we show that under disruptive selection, violating symmetries in niche sizes and increasing strength of the trade-off in selection between the niches quickly leads to loss of genetic variation, instead of evolution of specialists. The region of the parameter space where polymorphism is maintained further narrows with increasing number of loci encoding the diverging trait and the rate of recombination between them. Yet, evolvable assortment and pre-existing assortment both substantially broaden the parameter space within which polymorphism is maintained. Notably, pre-existing niche preference speeds up further increase of assortment, thus facilitating reinforcement in the later phases of speciation. We conclude that in order for sympatric ecological divergence to occur, niche preference must co-evolve throughout the divergence process. Even if populations come into secondary contact, having diverged in isolation, niche preference substantially broadens the conditions for coexistence in sympatry and completion of the speciation process.",

    "abstract": "Tigecycline and colistin are few of last-resort defenses used in anti-infection therapies against carbapenem-resistant bacterial pathogens. The successive emergence of plasmid-borne tet(X) tigecycline resistance mechanism and mobile colistin resistance (mcr) determinant, renders them clinically ineffective, posing a risky challenge to global public health. Here, we report that co-carriage of tet(X6) and mcr-1 gives co-resistance to both classes of antibiotics by a single plasmid in E. coli. Genomic analysis suggested that transposal transfer of mcr-1 proceeds into the plasmid pMS8345A, in which a new variant tet(X6) is neighbored with Class I integron. The structure-guided mutagenesis finely revealed the genetic determinants of Tet(X6) in the context of phenotypic tigecycline resistance. The combined evidence in vitro and in vivo demonstrated its enzymatic action of Tet(X6) in the destruction of tigecycline. The presence of Tet(X6) (and/or MCR-1) robustly prevents the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by tigecycline (and/or colistin). Unlike that mcr-1 exerts fitness cost in E. coli, tet(X6) does not. In the tet(X6)-positive strain that co-harbors mcr-1, tigecycline resistance is independently of colistin resistance caused by MCR-1-mediated lipid A remodeling, and vice versa. Co-production of Tet(X6) and MCR-1 gives no synergistic delayed growth of the recipient E. coli. Similar to that MCR-1 behaves in the infection model of G. mellonella, Tet(X6) renders the treatment of tigecycline ineffective. Therefore, co-transfer of such two AMR genes is of great concern in the context of \"one health\" comprising environmental/animal/human sectors, and heightened efforts are required to monitor its dissemination.\n\nAuthor summaryWe report that tet(X6), a new tigecycline resistance gene, is co-carried with the other resistance gene mcr-1 by a single plasmid. Not only have we finely mapped genetic determinants of tet(X6), but also revealed its biochemical action of tigecycline destruction. Crosstalk of Tet(X6) with MCR-1 is addressed. Tet(X6) tigecycline resistance is independently of MCR-1 colistin resistance, and vice versa. Similar to MCR-1 that renders colistin clinically ineffective, Tet(X6) leads to the failure of tigecycline treatment in the infection model of G. mellonella. This study extends mechanistic understanding mechanism and interplay of Tet(X6) and MCR-1, coproduced by a single plasmid. It also heightens the need to prevent rapid and large-scaled spread of AMR.",

    "abstract": "Microglia are heterogeneous and ubiquitous CNS-resident macrophages that maintain homeostasis of neural tissues and protect them from pathogen attacks. Yet, their differentiation in different compartments remains elusive. We performed single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis to compare the transcriptomes of microglia in adult mouse (C57/Bl) brains and spinal cords to identify microglial subtypes in these CNS compartments. Cortical microglia from 2-month mice consisted of a predominant population of the homeostatic subtype (HOM-M) and a small population (4%) of the inflammatory subtype (IFLAM-M), while spinal microglia consisted of 55% HOM-M and 45% IFLAM-M subtype. Comparison of cortical and spinal microglia at 2, 4 and 8 months revealed consistently a higher composition of the IFLAM-M subtype in the spinal cord. At 8-month, cortical microglia differentiated a small new subtype with interferon response phenotypes (INF-M), while spinal microglia polarized toward a proinflammatory phenotype, as indicated by the increase of microglia expressing IL-1{beta}. To further characterize the differential plasticity of cortical and spinal microglial heterogeneity, we determined the microglial transcriptomes from HIV-1 gp 120 transgenic (Tg) mice, a model of HIV-associated neurological disorders. Compared with wild-type (Wt) cortical microglia, the gp120Tg cortical microglia had three new subtypes, with signatures of interferon I response (INF-M), cell proliferation (PLF-M), and myelination or demyelination (MYE-M) respectively; while INF-M and PLF-M subtypes presented at all ages, the MYE-M only at 4-month. In contrast, only the INF-M subtype was observed in the spinal microglia from 2- and 4-month gp120tg mice. Bioinformatic analysis of regulated molecular pathways of individual microglial subtypes indicated that gp120 more severely impaired the biological function of microglia in cortices than in the spinal cord. The results collectively reveal differential heterogeneity and plasticity of cortical and spinal microglia, and suggest functional differentiation of microglia in different CNS compartments.",

    "abstract": "Escaping aversive stimuli is essential for complex organisms, but prolonged exposure to stress leads to maladaptive learning. Stress alters plasticity, neuromodulatory signaling, and neuronal activity in distributed networks, yet the field lacks a unifying framework for its varied consequences. Here we describe neuromodulatory and plasticity changes following aversive learning by using a learned helplessness paradigm, where ketamine restores escape behavior. Dopaminergic neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area systematically varies across learning, correlating with future sensitivity to ketamine treatment. Ketamines effects are blocked by chemogenetic inhibition of dopamine signaling and mimicked by optogenetic activation. We use 2-photon glutamate uncaging/imaging to interrogate structural plasticity in medial prefrontal cortex, revealing that dendritic spinogenesis on pyramidal neurons is both regulated by aversive experience and recovered by ketamine in a dopamine-dependent manner. Together, these data describe recurrent circuits that causally link neuromodulatory dynamics, aversive learning, and plasticity enhancements driven by a therapeutically promising antidepressant.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To develop a digital algorithm and validate a semi-quantitative scoring method for surface methylene blue (MB) staining in whole lymph nodes (LN).Methods Lymph nodes from canine models undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping were prospectively assessed ex vivo and photographed. Two blinded observers evaluated all images and assigned a semi-quantitative score based on surface staining (0 \u2013 no blue stain, 1 \u2013 1-50% stained, 2 \u2013 51-100% stained). A standard reference for degree of blue staining was based on signal-to-background ratios using computer-based imaging software with an output measurement of percentage of staining of the LN. Agreement between observers was assessed using the Kappa coefficient.Results 124 lymph nodes were included and demonstrated strong agreement (K = 0.8007, p &lt; 0.0001) between results of semi-quantitative scoring and image analysis. Also, strong interobserver and intraobserver agreement was observed for the scoring system (K = 0.8051, p &lt; 0.0001 and K = 0.9493, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively).Discussion Agreement between the observer-based scoring system and imaging software illustrates a validated method in assessing MB staining, without the need for analysis software. The use of a semi-quantitative scoring system shows promise for a simple, objective assessment of MB staining in surgery and for future study. Lymph nodes can have variable surface colour, which can make assessment of blue staining challenging for novice observers in certain cases. This study describes a digital algorithm for quantitative analysis of blue staining in LN thereby providing a novel and objective reporting mechanism in scientific research involving SLN mapping.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells display massive dysregulation of key regulatory pathways due to now well-catalogued mutations and other DNA-related aberrations. Moreover, enormous heterogeneity has been commonly observed in the identity, frequency and location of these aberrations across individuals with the same cancer type or subtype, and this variation naturally propagates to the transcriptome, resulting in myriad types of dysregulated gene expression programs. Many have argued that a more integrative and quantitative analysis of heterogeneity of DNA and RNA molecular profiles may be necessary for designing more systematic explorations of alternative therapies and improving predictive accuracy.\n\nWe introduce a representation of multi-omics profiles which is sufficiently rich to account for observed heterogeneity and support the construction of quantitative, integrated, metrics of variation. Starting from the network of interactions existing in Reactome, we build a library of \"paired DNA-RNA aberrations\" that represent prototypical and recurrent patterns of dysregulation in cancer; each two-gene \"Source-Target Pair\" (STP) consists of a \"source\" regulatory gene and a \"target\" gene whose expression is plausibly \"controlled\" by the source gene. The STP is then \"aberrant\" in a joint DNA-RNA profile if the source gene is DNA-aberrant (e.g., mutated, deleted, or duplicated), and the downstream target gene is \"RNA-aberrant\", meaning its expression level is outside the normal, baseline range. With M STPs, each sample profile has exactly one of the 2M possible configurations.\n\nWe concentrate on subsets of STPs, and the corresponding reduced configurations, by selecting tissue-dependent minimal coverings, defined as the smallest family of STPs with the property that every sample in the considered population displays at least one aberrant STP within that family. These minimal coverings can be computed with integer programming. Given such a covering, a natural measure of cross-sample diversity is the extent to which the particular aberrant STPs composing a covering vary from sample to sample; this variability is captured by the entropy of the distribution over configurations.\n\nWe apply this program to data from TCGA for six distinct tumor types (breast, prostate, lung, colon, liver, and kidney cancer). This enables an efficient simplification of the complex landscape observed in cancer populations, resulting in the identification of novel signatures of molecular alterations which are not detected with frequency-based criteria. Estimates of cancer heterogeneity across tumor phenotypes reveals a stable pattern: entropy increases with disease severity. This framework is then well-suited to accommodate the expanding complexity of cancer genomes and epigenomes emerging from large consortia projects.\n\nAuthor SummaryA large variety of genomic and transcriptomic aberrations are observed in cancer cells, and their identity, location, and frequency can be highly indicative of the particular subtype or molecular phenotype, and thereby inform treatment options. However, elucidating this association between sets of aberrations and subtypes of cancer is severely impeded by considerable diversity in the set of aberrations across samples from the same population. Most attempts at analyzing tumor heterogeneity have dealt with either the genome or transcriptome in isolation. Here we present a novel, multi-omics approach for quantifying heterogeneity by determining a small set of paired DNA-RNA aberrations that incorporates potential downstream effects on gene expression. We apply integer programming to identify a small set of paired aberrations such that at least one among them is present in every sample of a given cancer population. The resulting \"coverings\" are analyzed for six cancer cohorts from the Cancer Genome Atlas, and facilitate introducing an information-theoretic measure of heterogeneity. Our results identify many known facets of tumorigenesis as well as suggest potential novel genes and interactions of interest.\n\nData Availability StatementRNA-Seq data, somatic mutation data and copy number data for The Cancer Genome Atlas were obtained through the Xena Cancer Genome Browser database (https://xenabrowser.net) from individual cancer type cohorts.

    "abstract": "Intestinal digesta is commonly used for studying responses of microbiota to dietary shifts, yet evidence is accumulating that it represents an incomplete view of the intestinal microbiota. In a 16-week seawater feeding trial, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were fed either a commercially-relevant reference diet or an insect meal diet containing 15% black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae meal. The digesta- and mucosa-associated distal intestinal microbiota were profiled by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Regardless of diet, we observed substantial differences between digesta- and mucosa-associated intestinal microbiota. Microbial richness and diversity were much higher in the digesta than the mucosa. The insect meal diet altered the distal intestinal microbiota resulting in higher microbial richness and diversity. The diet effect, however, depended on the sample origin. Digesta-associated intestinal microbiota showed more pronounced changes than the mucosa-associated microbiota. Lastly, multivariate association analyses identified two mucosa-enriched taxa, Brevinema andersonii and unclassified Spirochaetaceae, associated with the expression of genes related to immune responses and barrier function in the distal intestine, respectively. Overall, our data clearly indicate that responses in digesta- and mucosa-associated microbiota to dietary inclusion of insect meal differ, with the latter being more resilient to dietary changes.",

    "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) is a potential therapeutic target for the inflammatory respiratory diseases such as congestive obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. The sequence identity of [~]88% with its isoform PDE4D is the key barrier in developing selective PDE4B inhibitors which may help to overcome associated side effects. Despite high sequence identity, both isoforms differ in few residues present in N-terminal (UCR2) and C-terminal (CR3) involved in catalytic site formation. Previously, we designed and tested specific PDE4B inhibitors considering N-terminal residues as a part of the catalytic cavity. In continuation, current work thoroughly presents an MD simulation-based analysis of N-terminal residues and their role in ligand binding. The various parameters viz. root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), principal component analysis (PCA), dynamical cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) analysis, secondary structure analysis, and residue interaction mapping were investigated to establish rational. Results showed that UCR2 reduced RMSF values for the metal binding pocket (31.5{+/-}11 to 13.12{+/-}6 [A]2) and the substrate-binding pocket (38.8{+/-}32 to 17.3{+/-}11 [A]2). UCR2 enhanced anti-correlated motion at the active site region that led to the improved ligand-binding affinity of PDE4B from -24.57{+/-}3 to -35.54{+/-}2 kcal/mol. Further, the atomic-level analysis indicated that T-pi and {pi}-{pi} interactions between inhibitors and residues are vital forces that regulate inhibitor association to PDE4B with high affinity. In conclusion, UCR2, the N-terminal domain, embraces the dynamics of PDE4B active site and stabilizes PDE4B inhibitor interactions. Therefore the N-terminal domain needs to be included by designing next-generation, selective PDE4B-inhibitors as potential anti-inflammatory drugs.",

    "abstract": "ARHGAP36 is a Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family member that contributes to spinal cord development and tumorigenesis. This multidomain protein is composed of splicing-dependent N-terminal sequences, the GAP-like region, and a unique C-terminal domain, and an N-terminal arginine-rich region has been shown to suppress protein kinase A (PKA) and activate Gli transcription factors. To understand how these structural elements act in concert, we have mapped the ARHGAP36 structure-activity landscape with domain- and amino-acid-level resolution. ARHGAP36-mediated Gli activation can be repressed by N-terminal sequences that regulate subcellular ARHGAP36 localization and PKA targeting. The GAP-like and C-terminal domains counteract this autoinhibitory mechanism and promote ARHGAP36 trafficking to the plasma membrane and primary cilium, respectively. The GAP-like domain may also conditionally suppress the arginine-rich region, and it modulates ARHGAP36 binding to the prolyl oligopeptidase-like protein PREPL and the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRAJA2. These domain-dependent activities provide a potential means for tissue-specific ARHGAP36 functions.",

    "abstract": "To adapt in an ever-changing environment, cells must integrate physical and chemical signals and translate them into biological meaningful information through complex signaling pathways. By combining lipidomic and proteomic approaches with functional analysis, we have shown that UBTD1 (Ubiquitin domain-containing protein 1) plays a crucial role in both the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) self-phosphorylation and its lysosomal degradation. On the one hand, by modulating the cellular level of ceramides through ASAH1 (N-Acylsphingosine Amidohydrolase 1) ubiquitination, UBTD1 controls the ligand-independent phosphorylation of EGFR. On the other hand, UBTD1, via the ubiquitination of SQSTM1/p62 (Sequestosome 1) and endolysosome positioning, participates in the lysosomal degradation of EGFR. The coordination of these two ubiquitin-dependent processes contributes to the control of the duration of the EGFR signal. Moreover, we showed that UBTD1 depletion exacerbates EGFR signaling and induces cell proliferation emphasizing a hitherto unknown function of UBTD1 in EGF-driven cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Plant cell walls are complex structures subject to dynamic remodeling in response to developmental and environmental cues, and play essential functions in disease resistance responses. We tested the specific contribution of plant cell walls to immunity by determining the susceptibility of a set of Arabidopsis cell wall mutants (cwm) to pathogens with different parasitic styles: a vascular bacterium, a necrotrophic fungus and a biotrophic oomycete. Remarkably, most cwm mutants tested (31/38; 81.6%) showed alterations in their resistance responses to at least one of these pathogens, in comparison to wild-type plants, illustrating the relevance of wall composition in determining disease resistance phenotypes. We found that the enhanced resistance of cwm plants to the necrotrophic and vascular pathogens negatively impacted on cwm fitness traits, like biomass and seed yield. Enhanced resistance of cwm plants is not only mediated by canonical immune pathways, like those modulated by phytohormones or Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns, which are not de-regulated in all cwm tested. Pectin-enriched wall fractions isolated from cwm plants triggered immune responses in other plants, suggesting that wall-mediated defensive pathways might contribute to cwm resistance. Cell walls of cwm plants show a high diversity of composition alterations as revealed by glycome profiling that detect specific wall carbohydrate moieties. Mathematical analysis of glycome profiling data identified correlations between the amounts of specific wall carbohydrate moieties and disease resistance phenotypes of cwm plants. These data support the relevant and specific function of plant wall composition in plant immune response modulation and in balancing disease resistance/development trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "The genomic sequences of crops continue to be produced at a frenetic pace. However, it remains challenging to develop complete annotations of functional genes and regulatory elements in these genomes. Here, we explore the potential to use DNA methylation profiles to develop more complete annotations. Using leaf tissue in maize, we define [~]100,000 unmethylated regions (UMRs) that account for 5.8% of the genome; 33,375 UMRs are found greater than 2 kilobase pairs from genes. UMRs are highly stable in multiple vegetative tissues and they capture the vast majority of accessible chromatin regions from leaf tissue. However, many UMRs are not accessible in leaf (leaf-iUMRs) and these represent a set of genomic regions with potential to become accessible in specific cell types or developmental stages. Leaf-iUMRs often occur near genes that are expressed in other tissues and are enriched for transcription factor (TF) binding sites of TFs that are also not expressed in leaf tissue. The leaf-iUMRs exhibit unique chromatin modification patterns and are enriched for chromatin interactions with nearby genes. The total UMRs space in four additional monocots ranges from 80-120 megabases, which is remarkably similar considering the range in genome size of 271 megabases to 4.8 gigabases. In summary, based on the profile from a single tissue, DNA methylation signatures pinpoint both accessible regions and regions poised to become accessible or expressed in other tissues. UMRs provide powerful filters to distill large genomes down to the small fraction of putative functional genes and regulatory elements.\n\nSignificance StatementCrop genomes can be very large with many repetitive elements and pseudogenes. Distilling a genome down to the relatively small fraction of regions that are functionally valuable for trait variation can be like looking for needles in a haystack. The unmethylated regions in a genome are highly stable during vegetative development and can reveal the locations of potentially expressed genes or cis-regulatory elements. This approach provides a framework towards complete annotation of genes and discovery of cis-regulatory elements using methylation profiles from only a single tissue.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in ANO5 (TMEM16E) cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R12 (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L). Recent evidence implicates defective plasma membrane repair as a likely mechanism for the disorder. Here, we probe the ANO5-dependency of the membrane repair pathway using a laser wounding assay in Ano5 knockout mouse muscle fibers. Wounded myofibers from Ano5 knockout mice exhibit delayed membrane resealing relative to wild type fibers as revealed by an increased uptake of the membrane-impermeant FM1-43 dye and a prolonged elevation of intracellular Ca2+. The trafficking of several annexin proteins, which together form a cap at the site of injury, is altered in Ano5 knockout fibers. Annexin A2 accumulates at the wound to nearly twice the level observed in WT fibers, while annexin A6 accumulation is substantially inhibited in the absence of ANO5. Furthermore, trafficking of annexins A1 and A5 to the cap is decreased in the Ano5 knockout. These changes are correlated with an alteration in the fine structure of the annexin repair cap and the shedding of annexin-positive extracellular vesicles. Our results suggest that the meticulous coordination of the annexin repair machinery required to effectively reseal wounded sarcolemma is disrupted in Ano5 knockout mice. ANO5 is a putative phospholipid scramblase, responsible for exposure of intracellular phospholipids to the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane. However, because the membrane repair defect is rescued by overexpression of wild type ANO5 or a scramblase-defective mutant, we suggest that ANO5-mediated phospholipid scrambling is not essential for membrane repair.\n\nSignificance StatementMutations in ANO5/TMEM16E cause myopathies of variable severity, with some patients losing ambulation entirely. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the function of ANO5 at the protein level, but it has been suggested that ANO5 plays a role in the repair of injured muscle plasma membranes. Here, we investigate the mechanism of ANO5-mediated repair and find that annexin proteins, which in normal muscle form a cap to seal wounds, traffic abnormally to the cap when ANO5 is not expressed. Muscle fibers lacking ANO5 reseal more slowly and thus are exposed to prolonged intracellular calcium elevation that can damage the fibers. Our findings contribute to the growing literature implicating failed repair as a probable pathogenic mechanism in patients with ANO5 mutations.",

We hypothesised that sustained delivery of LTB4 would be a therapeutic strategy to prevent osteoclast cell differentiation in bone resorption in inflammatory diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of LTB4 in differentiation of monocytic lineage cells into osteoclasts after stimulation with LTB4 loaded in microspheres (MS).\n\nDesignLTB4-MS were prepared using an oil-in-water emulsion solvent extraction-evaporation process. Sterility, LPS contamination, characterization and efficiency of LTB4 encapsulation were investigated. J774A.1 cells were cultured in the presence of monocyte colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and ligand for receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANKL) and then stimulated with LTB4-MS. Cytotoxicity was determined by lactate dehydrogenase assay, osteoclast formation by means of the activity of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase enzyme and gene expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to investigate regulation of Alox5, Alox5ap, Acp5, Mmp9, Calcr and Ctsk.\n\nResultsWe found that 5-lipoxygenase pathway is involved in the osteoclastic differentiation hematopoietic lineage cells and that exogenous addition of LTB4-MS inhibited osteoclastogenesis induced by M-CSF and RANKL. The mechanism of LTB4-MS involved induction of Mmp9 gene expression and inhibition of Calcr and Ctsk, without changing Acp5.\n\nConclusionLTB4-MS inhibited differentiation of macrophages into an osteoclastic phenotype and cell activation under M-CSF and RANKL stimulus shedding light on a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent osteoclast differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes that generate new myelin sheaths around demyelinated axons in the regenerative process of remyelination are generally derived from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). During this process, OPCs become activated, populate the area of myelin loss, and finally differentiate. Although much is known about the individual stages of remyelination, the exact sequence of events and whether a dependency of each individual stage on each other exists is unknown. Understanding the biology behind these questions is important for the development of remyelination therapies to overcome the age-related decline in remyelination efficiency observed in the chronic phase of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we show that, following toxin-induced demyelination, all re-populating OPCs first migrate into the site of damage, undergo relatively few rounds of division and eventually differentiate. We further show that OPC proliferation is a requirement for differentiation. Together, our results reveal an unexpected link between OPC proliferation and differentiation, and opens up the possibility of novel regenerative strategies in MS focussing on stimulating OPC proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is the master regulator of centriole duplication in metazoan organisms. Catalytic activity and protein turnover of PLK4 are tightly coupled in human cells, since changes in PLK4 concentration and catalysis have profound effects on centriole duplication and supernumerary centrosomes, which are associated with aneuploidy and cancer. Recently, PLK4 has been targeted with a variety of small molecule kinase inhibitors exemplified by centrinone, which rapidly induces inhibitory effects on PLK4 and leads to on-target centrosome depletion. Despite this, relatively few PLK4 substrates have been identified unequivocally in human cells, and PLK4 signaling outside centriolar networks remains poorly characterised. We report an unbiased mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative analysis of cellular protein phosphorylation in stable PLK4-expressing U2OS human cells exposed to centrinone. PLK4 phosphorylation was itself sensitive to brief exposure to the compound, resulting in PLK4 stabilization. Analysing asynchronous cell populations, we report hundreds of centrinone-regulated cellular phosphoproteins, including centrosomal and cell cycle proteins and a variety of likely  non-canonical substrates. Surprisingly, sequence interrogation of ~300 significantly down-regulated phosphoproteins reveals an extensive network of centrinone-sensitive [Ser/Thr]Pro phosphorylation sequence motifs, which based on our analysis might be either direct or indirect targets of PLK4. In addition, we confirm that NMYC and PTPN12 are PLK4 substrates, both in vitro and in human cells. Our findings suggest that PLK4 catalytic output directly controls the phosphorylation of a diverse set of cellular proteins, including Pro-directed targets that are likely to be important in PLK4-mediated cell signaling.",

    "abstract": "Key enzymatic processes in biology use the nonequilibrium error correction mechanism called kinetic proofreading to enhance their specificity. Kinetic proofreading typically requires several dedicated structural features in the enzyme, such as a nucleotide hydrolysis site and multiple enzyme-substrate conformations that delay product formation. Such requirements limit the applicability and the adaptability of traditional proofreading schemes. Here, we explore an alternative conceptual mechanism of error correction that achieves delays between substrate binding and subsequent product formation by having these events occur at distinct physical locations. The time taken by the enzyme-substrate complex to diffuse from one location to another is leveraged to discard wrong substrates. This mechanism does not require dedicated structural elements on the enzyme, making it easier to overlook in experiments but also making proofreading tunable on the fly. We discuss how tuning the length scales of enzyme or substrate concentration gradients changes the fidelity, speed and energy dissipation, and quantify the performance limitations imposed by realistic diffusion and reaction rates in the cell. Our work broadens the applicability of kinetic proofreading and sets the stage for the study of spatial gradients as a possible route to specificity.",

    "abstract": "During muscle regeneration, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) promotes both proliferation and migration. However, the relationship between proliferation and migration is poorly understood in this context. To elucidate this complex relationship on a physiological level, we established an intravital imaging system for measuring ERK activity, migration speed, and cell-cycle phases in mouse muscle satellite cells. We found that in vivo, ERK was maximally activated in satellite cells two days after injury, and this is then followed by increases in cell number and motility. With limited effects of immediate ERK activity on migration, we hypothesized that ERK increases migration speed in the later phase by promoting cell-cycle progression. Our cell-cycle analysis further revealed that in satellite cells, ERK activity is critical for the G1/S transition, and cells migrate more rapidly in the S/G2 phase three days after injury. Finally, migration speed of satellite cells was suppressed after CDK1/2, but not CDK1, inhibitor treatment, demonstrating a critical role of CDK2 in satellite cell migration. Overall, our study demonstrates that in satellite cells, the ERK-CDK2 axis not only promotes the G1/S transition, but also migration speed, which may provide a novel mechanism for efficient muscle regeneration.",

Taf4 inactivation rapidly diminishes expression of critical genes involved in BC function leading to increased glycaemia, lowered plasma insulin levels, defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and in the longer term reduced BC mass through apoptosis of a subpopulation of BCs. Nevertheless, glycaemia and blood insulin levels are stabilised after 11 weeks with mutant animals showing long term survival. Bulk RNA-seq and ATAC-seq together with single cell RNA-seq on isolated Langerhans islets show that Taf4 loss leads to a remodelling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression not only in targeted BCs, but also alpha and delta cells. One week after Taf4-loss, cells with mixed BC, alpha and/or delta cell identities were observed as well as a BC population trans-differentiating into alpha-like cells. Computational analysis defines how known critical BC and alpha cell determinants may act in combination with additional transcription factors and the NuRF chromatin remodelling complex to promote BC trans-differentiation.",

Toxicity tests in zebrafish showed no deleterious effects of prolonged MTZ treatments of [&le;]1 mM. NTR 2.0 therefore enables sustained cell loss paradigms and ablation of previously resistant cell types.

    "abstract": "Shaping the animal body plan is a complex process that involves the spatial organization and patterning of the different germ layers. Recent advances in live imaging have started to unravel the cellular choreography underlying this process in mammals, however, the sequence of events transforming an unpatterned cell ensemble into structured territories is largely unknown. Here, using gastruloids -3D aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells-we study the formation of one of the three germ layers, the endoderm. We show that the endoderm is generated from an epiblast-like homogeneous state by a three-step mechanism: (i) a loss of E-cadherin mediated contacts in parts of the aggregate leading to the appearance of islands of E-cadherin expressing cells surrounded by cells devoid of E-cadherin, (ii) a separation of these two populations with islands of E-cadherin expressing cells flowing toward the aggregate tip, and (iii) their differentiation into an endoderm population. During the flow, the islands of E-cadherin expressing cells are surrounded by cells expressing T-Brachyury, reminiscent of the process occurring at the primitive streak. Consistent with recent in vivo observations, the endoderm formation in the gastruloids does not require an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, but rather a maintenance of an epithelial state for a subset of cells coupled with fragmentation of E-cadherin contacts in the vicinity, and a sorting process. Our data emphasize the role of signaling and tissue flows in the establishment of the body plan.",

    "abstract": "Dominantly inherited, missense mutations in the widely expressed housekeeping gene, GARS1, cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2D (CMT2D), a peripheral neuropathy characterised by muscle weakness and wasting in limb extremities. Mice modelling CMT2D display early and selective neuromuscular junction (NMJ) pathology, epitomised by disturbed maturation and neurotransmission, leading to denervation. Indeed, the NMJ disruption has been reported in several different muscles; however, a systematic comparison of neuromuscular synapses from distinct body locations has yet to be performed. We therefore analysed NMJ development and degeneration across five different wholemount muscles to identify key synaptic features contributing to the distinct pattern of neurodegeneration in CMT2D mice. Denervation was found to occur along a distal-to-proximal gradient, providing a cellular explanation for the greater weakness observed in mutant Gars hindlimbs compared to forelimbs. Nonetheless, muscles from similar locations and innervated by axons of equivalent length showed significant differences in neuropathology, suggestive of additional factors impacting on site-specific neuromuscular degeneration. Defective NMJ development preceded and associated with degeneration, but was not linked to a delay of wild-type NMJ maturation processes. Correlation analyses indicate that muscle fibre type nor synaptic architecture explain the differential denervation of CMT2D NMJs, rather it is the extent of post-natal synaptic growth that predisposes to neurodegeneration. Together, this work improves our understanding of the mechanisms driving synaptic vulnerability in CMT2D and hints at pertinent pathogenic pathways.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic fluctuations at the transcriptional level contribute to isogenic cell-to-cell heterogeneity in mammalian cell populations. However, we still have no clear understanding of the repercussions of this heterogeneity, given the lack of tools to independently control mean expression and variability of a gene. Here, we engineered a synthetic circuit to independently modulate mean expression and heterogeneity of transgenes and endogenous human genes. The circuit, a Tunable Noise Rheostat (TuNR), consists of a transcriptional cascade of two inducible transcriptional activators, where the output mean and variance can be modulated by two orthogonal small molecule inputs. In this fashion, different combinations of the inputs can achieve the same mean but with different population variability. With TuNR, we achieve low basal expression, over 1000-fold expression of a transgene product, and up to 7-fold induction of the endogenous gene NGFR. Importantly, for the same mean expression level, we are able to establish varying degrees of heterogeneity in expression within an isogenic population, thereby decoupling gene expression noise from its mean. TuNR is therefore a modular tool that can be used in mammalian cells to enable direct interrogation of the implications of cell-to-cell variability.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Failure of modularity remains a significant challenge for synthetic gene circuits assembled with tested modules as they often do not function as expected. Competition over shared limited gene expression resources is a crucial underlying reason. Here, we first built a synthetic cascading bistable switches (Syn-CBS) circuit in a single strain with two coupled self-activation modules to achieve two successive cell fate transitions. Interestingly, we found that the in vivo transition path was redirected as the activation of one switch always prevailed against the other instead of the theoretically expected coactivation. This qualitatively different type of resource competition between the two modules follows a \u2018winner-takes-all\u2019 rule, where the winner is determined by the relative connection strength between the modules. To decouple the resource competition, we constructed a two-strain circuit, which achieved successive activation and stable coactivation of the two switches. We unveiled a nonlinear resource competition within synthetic gene circuits and provided a division of labor strategy to minimize unfavorable effects.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Cell division requires dramatic reorganization of the cell cortex that is primarily driven by the actomyosin network. We previously reported that Protocadherin 7 (PCDH7) enriches at the cell surface during mitosis which is required for building up the full mitotic rounding pressure. Here we showed that PCDH7 gets palmitoylated and interacts with the palmitoyltransferase, ZDHHC5. Both PCDH7 and ZDHHC5 co-localize at the mitotic cell surface, and they translocate to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. PCDH7s localization depends on palmitoylation activity of ZDHHC5. Loss of expression of PCDH7 impairs active RhoA and phospho-myosin levels at the cleavage furrow and increases the rate of multinucleated cells. This work uncovers a palmitoylation-dependent translocation mechanism for PCDH7 and attributes a regulatory role to contributing actomyosin activity during cytokinesis.",

    "abstract": "Planar cell polarity (PCP) organizes the orientation of cellular protrusions and migratory activity within the tissue plane. PCP establishment involves the subcellular polarization of core PCP components. It has been suggested Wnt gradients could provide a global cue that coordinates local PCP with tissue axes. Here we dissect the role of Wnt ligands in the orientation of hairs of Drosophila wings, an established system for study of PCP. We found that PCP was normal in quintuple mutant wings that rely solely on membrane-tethered Wingless for Wnt signaling, suggesting that a Wnt gradient is not required. We then used a nanobody-based approach to trap Wntless in the endoplasmic reticulum, and hence prevent all Wnt secretion, specifically during the period of PCP establishment. PCP was still established. We conclude that, even though Wnt ligands could contribute to PCP, they are not essential, and another global cue must exist for tissue-wide polarization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHeat stress and fescue toxicosis caused by ingesting tall fescue infected with the endophytic fungus Epichloe coenophiala represent two of the most prevalent stressors to beef cattle in the United States, costing the beef industry millions of dollars each year. The rate at which a beef cow sheds her winter coat early in the summer is an indicator of adaptation to heat and an economically relevant trait in many parts of the U.S. Further, research suggests that early-summer hair shedding may be reflective of tolerance to fescue toxicosis, as vasoconstriction induced by fescue toxicosis limits the ability of an animal to shed its winter coat. Here, we developed parameters for routine genetic evaluation of hair shedding score in American Angus cattle and identified genomic loci associated with variation in hair shedding score via genome-wide association analysis (GWAA).\n\nResultsHair shedding score was found to be moderately heritable (h2 = 0.34 to 0.40), with differing repeatability estimates between cattle grazing versus not grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue. Our results suggest modestly negative genetic and phenotypic correlations between a dams hair shedding score (lower score is earlier shedding) and the weaning weight of her calf, one metric of performance. Together, these results indicate that economic gains can be made via the use of hair shedding score breeding values to select for heat tolerant cattle. GWAA identified 176 variants significant at FDR < 0.05. Functional enrichment analyses using genes within 50 Kb of these variants identified pathways involved in keratin formation, prolactin signaling, host-virus interaction, and other biological processes.\n\nConclusionsThis work contributes to a continuing trend in the development of genetic evaluations for environmental adaptation. The results of this work will aid beef cattle producers in selecting more sustainable and climate-adapted cattle, as well as enable the development of similar routine genetic evaluations in other breeds.",

    "abstract": "Different conditions have been devised to isolate MEK/ERK signalling independent human naive pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) that are distinct from conventional primed PSCs and better correspond to pre-implantation developmental stages. While the naive conditions described thus far endow human PSCs with different extents of naivety features, isolating human pluripotent cells that retain characteristics of ground state pluripotency while maintaining differentiation potential and genetic integrity, remains a major challenge. Here we engineer reporter systems that allow functional screening for conditions that can endow both the molecular and functional features expected from human naive pluripotency. We establish that simultaneous inhibition of SRC-NF{kappa}B, WNT/{beta}CATENIN and PKC signalling pathways is essential for enabling expansion of teratoma competent fully naive human PSCs in defined or xeno-free conditions. Divergent signalling and transcriptional requirements for maintaining naive pluripotency were found between mouse and human. Finally, we establish alternative naive conditions in which MEK/ERK inhibition is substituted with inhibition for NOTCH/RBPj signalling, which allow obtaining alternative human naive PSCs with diminished risk for loss of imprinting and deleterious global DNA hypomethylation. Our findings set a framework for the signalling foundations of human naive pluripotency and may advance its utilization in future translational applications.\n\nHighlights of key findingsO_LICombined inhibition of SRC, WNT and PKC signaling consolidates human naive pluripotency\nC_LIO_LIStable expansion of DNA/RNA methylation-independent and TGF/ACTIVIN-independent human naive PSCs\nC_LIO_LIOpposing roles for ACTIVIN and WNT/{beta}CATENIN signaling on mouse vs. human naive pluripotency\nC_LIO_LI2i and MEK/ERKi independent alternative human naive PSC conditions via inhibiting NOTCH/RBPj signaling\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The spatial distribution of cells within a tissue underlies organ function. However, these spatial distributions are often difficult to identify, making it challenging to evaluate how cells establish these patterns during development or how diseases may disrupt these patterns and impair function. To address this, we developed an image analysis tool based on a novel algorithm that identifies spatial patterns within tissues. This analytical tool was used to study the bone marrow, a specialized microenvironment in which spatial patterning of regulatory cells may influence the differentiation and survival of hematopoietic stem cells. Using this algorithm, we discovered clusters of regulatory cells within the bone marrow that suggest an organization of micro-niches, which may form the basis of the hematopoietic stem cell microenvironment. This work provides a new tool for the detection and analysis of tissue morphology that enables identification of spatial patterns within tissues that can lead to a deeper understanding of tissue function, provide clues for early onset of disease, and be used as a tool for studying the impact of pharmaceutics on tissue development and regeneration.\n\nIn BriefThis work introduces a new statistic to analyze the patterning of cells and physiological features in histological images.

The unique advantage of the program lies in databases created based on genus-specific sequence properties derived from protein secondary structure, namely amino acid usages, codon usages, and codon contexts of three codon DNA 9-mers. SeSaMe PS Function searches a query sequence against reference sequence database, identifies three codon DNA 9-mers with structural roles, and dynamically creates the comparative dataset of 54 microbial genera based on their codon usage biases. The program applies correlation Principal Component Analysis in conjunction with K-means clustering method to the comparative dataset. Three codon DNA 9-mers clustered as sole member or with only a few members are often structurally and functionally distinctive sites that provide useful insights into important molecular interactions. The program provides a versatile means for studying functions of short sequences from metagenome sequencing and has a wide spectrum of applications.",

Although the genetic sequences of their etiologic viruses are of high homology, the clinical and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 significantly differ from SARS5,6. Especially, it seems that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes vast replication in vivo without being effectively monitored by anti-viral immunity7. Here, we show that the viral protein encoded from open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2, which shares the least homology with SARS-CoV among all the viral proteins, can directly interact with MHC-I molecules and significantly down-regulates their surface expression on various cell types. In contrast, ORF8a and ORF8b of SARS-CoV do not exert this function. In the ORF8-expressing cells, MHC-I molecules are selectively target for lysosomal degradation by an autophagy-dependent mechanism. As a result, CTLs inefficiently eliminate the ORF8-expressing cells. Our results demonstrate that ORF8 protein disrupts antigen presentation and reduces the recognition and the elimination of virus-infected cells by CTLs8. Therefore, we suggest that the inhibition of ORF8 function could be a strategy to improve the special immune surveillance and accelerate the eradication of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe recent emergence of the novel SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its international spread pose a global health emergency. The viral spike (S) glycoprotein binds the receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) ACE2 and promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. The trimeric S protein binds the receptor using the distal receptor-binding domain (RBD) causing conformational changes in S protein that allow priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling the dynamic structural features used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal novel therapeutic targets. Using structures determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, we performed structural analysis and atomic comparisons of the different conformational states adopted by the SARS-CoV-2-RBD.\n\nResultsHere, we determined the key structural components induced by the receptor and characterized their intramolecular interactions. We show that {kappa}-helix (also known as polyproline II) is a predominant structure in the binding interface and in facilitating the conversion to the active form of the S protein. We demonstrate a series of conversions between switch-like {kappa}-helix and {beta}-strand, and conformational variations in a set of short -helices which affect the proximal hinge region. This conformational changes lead to an alternating pattern in conserved disulfide bond configurations positioned at the hinge, indicating a possible disulfide exchange, an important allosteric switch implicated in viral entry of various viruses, including HIV and murine coronavirus. The structural information presented herein enables us to inspect and understand the important dynamic features of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and propose a novel potential therapeutic strategy to block viral entry. Overall, this study provides guidance for the design and optimization of structure-based intervention strategies that target SARS-CoV-2.",

The present study reports sequence analysis, complete coordinate tertiary structure prediction and in silico sequence-based and structure-based functional characterization of full SARS-CoV-2 proteome based on the NCBI reference sequence NC_045512 (29903 bp ss-RNA) which is identical to GenBank entry MN908947 and MT415321.

Each protein of orf1ab polyprotein group has been studied separately. A total of 25 polypeptides have been analyzed out of which 15 proteins are not yet having experimental structures and only 10 are having experimental structures with known PDB IDs. Out of 15 newly predicted structures six (6) were predicted using comparative modeling and nine (09) proteins having no significant similarity with so far available PDB structures were modeled using ab-initio modeling.

The study has identified nine major targets (spike protein, envelop protein, membrane protein, nucleocapsid protein, 2-O-ribose methyltransferase, endoRNAse, 3-to-5 exonuclease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase) for which drug design targets could be considered. There are other 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs), which may also be percieved from the drug design angle. The protein structures have been deposited to ModelArchive.

    "abstract": "The soricid water shrew, Chimarrogale platycephalus, is a mammal species endemic to the Japanese Islands. They inhabit the islands of Honshu and Kyushu, and are considered to be extinct in Shikoku. Information on this water shrew from Honshu and Kyushu is also scarce, and C. platycephalus is registered on the Japanese Governments red list as an endangered species. Almost all study areas such as regarding their ethology, ecology, also their phylogenetics are lacking. The delay in these foundational studies is due to difficulties related to them being both nocturnal and aquatic. In order to study of C. platycephalus, it is essential to conduct field research in mountain streams at night under such circumstances. In response to such difficult circumstances, we established a genetic analysis method using the feces of C. platycephalus, and as a result the accumulation of data on their phylogenetic evolution and phylogeography has increased which has improved our understanding of this species. Furthermore in this study, development of microsatellite markers was carried out, and a total of 21 loci marker analyses were performed. In addition, in order to confirm the credibility of these 21 microsatellite markers, as being able to validly differentiate individuals, all markers were examined using the fecal and tissues specimens from verified separately reared individuals (12 individuals) with the known history of having been reared in an aquarium. As a result, it was revealed that if analyses of the 12 loci were possible, individual differentiation with 100% accuracy was possible. The development of microsatellite markers in this study, and the establishment of individual identification methods by means of this will be expected to greatly contribute to future ecological and ethological research, population genetics and biogeographical research of the water shrew, C. platycephalus.",

To improve the sensitivity of detection, data-independent acquisition (DIA) based proteomics was found to outperform data-dependent acquisition (DDA) workflows in identifying and quantifying low abundant proteins. Here, by making use of representative bacterial pathogen/host proteome samples, we report an optimized hybrid library generation workflow for data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry relying on the use of data-dependent and in silico predicted spectral libraries. When compared to searching DDA experiment-specific libraries only, the use of hybrid libraries significantly improved peptide detection to an extent suggesting that infection relevant host-pathogen conditions could be profiled in sufficient depth without the need of a priori bacterial pathogen enrichment when studying the bacterial proteome.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=101 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/113340v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bbc20aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c0455eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a2873org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e5b0b6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold enormous potential for the development of cell-based therapies for many currently incurable diseases. However, the safety and efficacy of potential iPSC-based treatments need to be verified in relevant animal disease models before their application in the clinic. Moreover, in order to reduce possible risks for the patients, it is necessary to use reprogramming approaches that ensure to the greatest extent possible the genomic integrity of the cells. Here, we report the derivation of iPSCs from common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) using self-replicating mRNA vectors based on the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE-mRNAs). By transfection of marmoset fetal fibroblasts with Tomato-modified VEE-mRNAs carrying the human OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and c-MYC (VEE-OKS-iM-iTomato) and culture in medium supplemented with two small molecule inhibitors, we first established intermediate primary colonies with neural progenitor-like properties. In the second reprogramming step, we converted these colonies into transgene-free pluripotent stem cells by further culturing them with customized marmoset iPSC medium in feeder-free conditions. The resulting cell lines possess pluripotency characteristics, such as expression of various pluripotency markers, long-term self-renewal, stable karyotype, and ability to differentiate into derivatives of the three primary germ layers in vitro and in vivo. Our experiments reveal a novel paradigm for flexible reprogramming of somatic cells, where primary colonies obtained by a single VEE-mRNA transfection can be directed either towards the neural lineage or further reprogrammed to pluripotency. These results (i) will further enhance the role of the common marmoset as animal disease model for preclinical testing of iPSC-based therapies and (ii) establish an in vitro system to experimentally address developmental signal transduction pathways in primates.",

    "abstract": "Benign melanocytic nevi frequently emerge when an acquired BRAFV600E mutation triggers unchecked proliferation and subsequent arrest in melanocytes. Recent observations have challenged the role of oncogene-induced senescence in melanocytic nevus formation, necessitating investigations into alternative mechanisms for the establishment and maintenance of proliferation arrest in nevi. We compared the transcriptomes of melanocytes from healthy human skin, nevi, and melanomas arisen from nevi and identified a set of microRNAs as highly expressed nevus-enriched transcripts. Two of these microRNAs - MIR211-5p and MIR328-3p - induced mitotic failure, genome duplication and proliferation arrest in human melanocytes through convergent targeting of AURKB. We demonstrate that BRAFV600E induces a similar proliferation arrest in primary human melanocytes that is both reversible and conditional. Specifically, BRAFV600E expression stimulates either arrest or proliferation depending on the differentiation state of the melanocyte. We report genome duplication in human melanocytic nevi, reciprocal expression of AURKB and microRNAs in nevi and melanomas, and rescue of arrested human nevus cells with AURKB expression. Together, our data describe an alternative molecular mechanism for melanocytic nevus formation that is congruent with both experimental and clinical observations.",

    "abstract": "We generated induced excitatory sensory neurons (iNeurons, iNs) from chimpanzee, bonobo and human stem cells by expressing the transcription factor neurogenin-2 (NGN2). Single cell-RNA sequencing showed that genes involved in dendrite and synapse development are expressed earlier during iNs maturation in the chimpanzee than the human cells. In accordance, during the first two weeks of differentiation, chimpanzee and bonobo iNs showed repetitive action potentials and more spontaneous excitatory activity than human iNs, and extended neurites of higher total length. However, the axons of human iNs were slightly longer at 5 weeks of differentiation. The timing of the establishment of neuronal polarity did not differ between the species. Chimpanzee, bonobo and human neurites eventually reached the same level of structural complexity. Thus, human iNs develop slower than chimpanzee and bonobo iNs and this difference in timing likely depends on functions downstream of NGN2.",

    "abstract": "The majority of polygenic risk scores (PRS) have been developed and optimized in individuals of European ancestry and may have limited generalizability across other ancestral populations. Understanding aspects of PRS that contribute to this issue and determining solutions is complicated by disease-specific genetic architecture and limited knowledge of sharing of causal variants and effect sizes across populations. Motivated by these challenges, we undertook a simulation study to assess the relationship between ancestry and the potential bias in PRS developed in European ancestry populations. Our simulations show that the magnitude of this bias increases with increasing divergence from European ancestry, and this is attributed to population differences in linkage disequilibrium and allele frequencies of European discovered variants, likely as a result of genetic drift. Importantly, we find that including into the PRS variants discovered in African ancestry individuals has the potential to achieve unbiased estimates of genetic risk across global populations and admixed individuals. We confirm our simulation findings in an analysis of HbA1c, asthma, and prostate cancer in the UK Biobank. Given the demonstrated improvement in PRS prediction accuracy, recruiting larger diverse cohorts will be crucial--and potentially even necessary--for enabling accurate and equitable genetic risk prediction across populations.",

    "abstract": "From 2010 to 2015, 73 common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) housed at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (WNPRC) were diagnosed postmortem with lymphocytic enterocolitis. We used unbiased deep-sequencing to screen the blood of deceased enterocolitis-positive marmosets for the presence of RNA viruses. In five out of eight marmosets with lymphocytic enterocolitis, we discovered a novel pegivirus that was not present in ten subsequently deep-sequenced matched, clinically-normal common marmosets with no evidence of lymphocytic enterocolitis. The novel virus, which we have named Southwest bike trail virus (SOBV), is most closely related (68% nucleotide identity) to a strain of simian pegivirus A that was previously isolated from a three-striped night monkey (Aotus trivirgatus). To determine the prevalence of this novel virus within the WNPRC marmoset colony, we screened 146 living animals and found an overall prevalence of 34% (50/146). Over the next four years, 85 of the 146 screened marmosets died or were euthanized and were examined histologically for lymphocytic enterocolitis. Out of these 85 animals, 27 SOBV-positive common marmosets had developed lymphocytic enterocolitis, compared to 42 SOBV-negative common marmosets, indicating no evidence of an association between this virus and development of enterocolitis in this cohort (p=0.0798). The novel pegivirus was also found in two of 32 (6%) clinically-normal common marmosets screened while in quarantine during the transfer from the New England Primate Research Center to the WNPRC, suggesting SOBV has different prevalence at different centers and could exert confounding influences on the comparison of marmoset studies from multiple centers.\n\nImportanceCommon marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are a valuable model species. We discovered two variants of a novel simian pegivirus, which we named the Southwest bike trail virus (SOBV), in common marmosets which had postmortem histologic diagnosis of lymphocytic enterocolitis. The virus was not present in ten matched, clinically-normal controls. We screened 146 live healthy common marmosets in the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center colony and found 34% (50/146) of the animals were SOBV-positive. SOBV was also present in two of 32 (6%) clinically-normal common marmosets from the New England Primate Research Center. These findings could have confounding effects in animal studies, especially those in which infection-free animals are desired, and they demonstrate the need for further investigations into SOBV transmission, the length of time of SOBV persistence, and SOBV prevalence at other primate centers, in order to increase understanding of the effects of SOBV and of this viral genus.",

    "abstract": "The interactions among humans, their environment, and the trillions of microbes residing within the human intestinal tract form a tripartite relationship that is fundamental to the overall health of the host. Disruptions in the delicate balance between the intestinal microbiota and their host immunity are implicated in various chronic diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is no known cure for IBD, therefore, novel therapeutics targeting prevention and symptoms management are of great interest. Recently, physical activity in healthy mice was shown to be protective against chemically-induced colitis, however the benefits of physical activity during or following disease onset is not known. In this study, we examine whether voluntary wheel running is protective against primary disease symptoms in a mucin 2 deficient (Muc2-/-) life-long model of murine colitis. We show that 6 weeks of wheel running in healthy C57BL/6 mice leads to distinct changes in fecal bacteriome, increased butyrate production, and modulation in colonic gene expression of various cytokines, suggesting an overall primed anti-inflammatory state. However, these physical activity-derived benefits are not present in Muc2-/- mice harboring a dysfunctional mucosal layer from birth, ultimately showing no improvements in clinical signs. We extrapolate from our findings that while physical activity in healthy individuals may be an important preventative measure against IBD, for those with a compromised intestinal mucosa, a commonality in IBD patients, these benefits are lost.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, has led to a resurgence in the use of colistin as a last-resort drug. Colistin is a cationic lipopeptide antibiotic that selectively acts on Gram-negative bacteria through electrostatic interactions with anionic phosphate groups of the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Colistin resistance in K. pneumoniae is mediated through loss of these phosphate groups, or modification with cationic groups (e.g. 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N), or phosphoethanolamine), but also hydroxylation of acyl-groups of lipid A. Here, we study the in vitro evolutionary trajectories towards colistin resistance in clinical K. pneumoniae complex strains (three K. pneumoniae sensu stricto strains and one K. variicola subsp. variicola strain) and their impact on fitness and virulence characteristics.\n\nThrough population sequencing during the in vitro evolution experiment, we found that resistance develops through a combination of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertion and deletions (indels), and the integration of insertion sequence (IS) elements, affecting genes associated with LPS biosynthesis and modification, and capsule structures. The development of colistin resistance decreased the maximum growth rate of one K. pneumoniae sensu stricto strain, but not in the other three K. pneumoniae sensu lato strains. Colistin-resistant strains had lipid A modified through hydroxylation, palmitoylation, and L-Ara4N addition. Colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae sensu stricto strains exhibited cross-resistance to LL-37, in contrast to the K. variicola subsp. variicola strain that did not change in susceptibility to LL-37. Virulence, as determined in a Caenorhabditis elegans survival assay, was higher in two colistin-resistant strains.\n\nOur study suggests that nosocomial K. pneumoniae complex strains can rapidly develop colistin resistance de novo through diverse evolutionary trajectories upon exposure to colistin. This effectively shortens the lifespan of this last-resort antibiotic for the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant Klebsiella.\n\nAuthor summaryBacteria that frequently cause infections in hospitalised patients are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. Colistin is a positively charged antibiotic that is used for the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Colistin acts by specifically interacting with the negatively charged LPS molecule in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Colistin resistance is mostly mediated through modification of LPS to reduce its negative charge. Here, we use a laboratory evolution experiment to show that strains belonging to the Klebsiella pneumoniae complex, a common cause of multidrug-resistant hospital-acquired infections, can rapidly accumulate mutations that reduce the negative charge of LPS without an appreciable loss of fitness. Colistin resistance can lead to cross-resistance to an antimicrobial peptide of the human innate immune system, but can increase susceptibility to serum, and virulence in a nematode model. These findings show that extensively resistant K. pneumoniae complex strains may rapidly develop resistance to the last-resort antibiotic colistin via different evolutionary trajectories, while retaining their ability to cause infections.",

However, neither the underlying mechanisms by which [Ca2+]i is regulated by SPE nor the physiological and pathological significance of the SPE-evoked calcium signal are fully understood. Here, we successfully isolated and characterized SPE by several methods, including transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking and nanoflow cytometry analysis. Application of SPE dose-dependently increased human sperm [Ca2+]i via extracellular Ca2+ influx. The Ca2+ influx was mediated by the sperm-specific CatSper channel, because the SPE-elevated [Ca2+]i was suppressed by a CatSper inhibitor, and SPE potentiated the CatSper current in human sperm. The role of CatSper in the SPE-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i was further confirmed by the absence of the SPE-induced [Ca2+]i increase and CatSper current in a CatSper-deficient sample. Furthermore, both protein and no-protein components in SPE were shown to contribute to the elevated [Ca2+]i, as well as the hyperactivated motility of human sperm. Interestingly, when sperm were stimulated with exosomes derived from asthenozoospermic semen, the elevation of [Ca2+]i was significantly lower than that by exosomes isolated from normal seminal plasma. The SPE from normal seminal plasma improved the motility of sperm from asthenozoospermic samples. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that SPE modulates Ca2+ signaling and human sperm function by activating a CatSper channel. The application of SPE to enhance sperm motility may provide a new clinical avenue for asthenozoospermic men.",

Earlier studies highlighted the implication of Kctd13 genetic imbalance in the 16p11.2 deletion through the regulation of the RHOA pathway. Here, we target the pathway and rescue the cognitive phenotypes of the 16p11.2 deletion mouse models. We used a chronic administration of fasudil (HA1077), an inhibitor of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), in mouse models carrying a heterozygous inactivation of Kctd13, or the deletion of the entire 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 region. We focused our attention on the most robust cognitive phenotypes seen in the 16p11.2 models and we showed that a chronic fasudil treatment can restore object recognition memory in both mouse models but does not change other behavioural traits. These findings confirm KCTD13 as one target gene causing cognitive deficits in 16p11.2 deletion patients, and the pertinence of the RHOA pathway as a therapeutic path and reinforce the contribution of other gene(s) involved in cognitive defects found in the 16p11.2 CNV models.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS- Kctd13 haploinsufficiency recapitulates most of the behaviour phenotypes found in the 16p11.2 Del/+ models\n- Fasudil treatment restores Kctd13 and 16p11.2 Del/+ mutant phenotypes in novel location and novel object recognition memory tests\n- Fasudil treatment restores the RhoA pathway in Kctd13+/- and 16p11.2 Del/+ models",

    "abstract": "Multiparental populations (MPPs) are experimental populations in which the genome of every individual is a mosaic of known founder haplotypes. These populations are useful for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) because tests of association can leverage inferred founder haplotype descent. It is difficult, however, to determine how haplotypes at a locus group into distinct functional alleles, termed the allelic series. The allelic series is important because it provides information about the number of causal variants at a QTL and their combined effects. In this study, we introduce a fully-Bayesian model selection framework for inferring the allelic series. This framework accounts for sources of uncertainty found in typical MPPs, including the number and composition of functional alleles. Our prior distribution for the allelic series is based on the Chinese restaurant process, a relative of the Dirichlet process, and we leverage its connection to the coalescent to introduce additional prior information about haplotype relatedness via a phylogenetic tree. We evaluate our approach via simulation and apply it to QTL from two MPPs: the Collaborative Cross (CC) and the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR). We find that, although posterior inference of the exact allelic series is often uncertain, we are able to distinguish biallelic QTL from more complex multiallelic cases. Additionally, our allele-based approach improves haplotype effect estimation when the true number of functional alleles is small. Our method, Tree-Based Inference of Multiallelism via Bayesian Regression (TIMBR), provides new insight into the genetic architecture of QTL in MPPs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe mosquito Anopheles stephensi is a vector of urban malaria in Asia that recently invaded Africa. Studying the genetic basis of vectorial capacity and engineering genetic interventions are both impeded by limitations of a vectors genome assembly. The existing assemblies of An. stephensi are draft-quality and contain thousands of sequence gaps, potentially missing genetic elements important for its biology and evolution.\n\nResultsTo access previously intractable genomic regions, we generated a reference-grade genome assembly and full transcript annotations that achieve a new standard for reference genomes of disease vectors. Here, we report novel species-specific transposable element families and insertions in functional genetic elements, demonstrating the widespread role of TEs in genome evolution and phenotypic variation. We discovered 29 previously hidden members of insecticide resistance genes, uncovering new candidate genetic elements for the widespread insecticide resistance observed in An. stephensi. We identified 2.4 Mb of the Y-chromosome and seven new male-linked gene candidates, representing the most extensive coverage of the Y-chromosome in any mosquito. By tracking full length mRNA for >15 days following blood feeding, we discover distinct roles of previously uncharacterized genes in blood metabolism and female reproduction. The Y-linked heterochromatin landscape reveals extensive accumulation of long-terminal repeat retrotransposons throughout the evolution and degeneration of this chromosome. Finally, we identify a novel Y-linked putative transcription factor that is expressed constitutively through male development and adulthood, suggesting an important role throughout male development.\n\nConclusionCollectively, these results and resources underscore the significance of previously hidden genomic elements in the biology of malaria mosquitoes and will accelerate development of genetic control strategies of malaria transmission.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite improvements in antiretroviral therapy, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain prevalent in subjects undergoing therapy. HAND significantly affects individuals quality of life, as well as adherence to therapy, and, despite the increasing understanding of neuropathogenesis, no definitive diagnostic or prognostic marker has been identified.\n\nResultsWe investigated transcriptomic profiles in frontal cortex tissues of Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected Rhesus macaques sacrificed at different stages of infection. Gene expression was compared among SIV-infected animals (n=11), with or without CD8+ lymphocyte depletion, based on detectable (n=6) or non-detectable (n=5) presence of the virus in frontal cortex tissues. Significant enrichment in activation of monocyte and macrophage cellular pathways was found in animals with detectable brain infection, independently from CD8+ lymphocyte depletion. In addition, transcripts of four poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) were up-regulated in the frontal cortex, which was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.\n\nConclusionsOur results shed light on involvement of PARPs in SIV infection of the brain and their role in SIV-associated neurodegenerative processes. Inhibition of PARPs may provide an effective novel therapeutic target for HIV-related neuropathology.",

    "abstract": "Bictegravir (BIC), an integrase inhibitor, and doravirine (DOR), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, were recently approved by the US FDA for HIV treatment and are recommended first line treatment options. Because certain clinical scenarios warrant using them in combination, we developed a fully validated LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous measurement of BIC and DOR, along with a legacy integrase inhibitor, raltegravir (RAL), in human plasma over a clinically relevant 1000-fold range for each analyte. These analytes were extracted from the plasma by protein precipitation with their stable, isotopically labeled internal standards (BIC-d5, 13C6-DOR, and RAL-d6). Following extraction, samples were analyzed by reverse phase chromatography on a Waters Atlantis T3 C18 (50\u00d72.1mm, 3um particle size) column with subsequent detection by electrospray ionization in positive ion mode on an AB Sciex API-5000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The assay was linear (R2&gt;0.994) over the selected calibration ranges (20.0-20,000ng/mL (BIC), 3.00-3,000ng/mL (DOR), and 10.0-10,000 (RAL)). The assay was accurate (inter-assay %Bias \u2264\u00b18.5) and precise (inter-assay %CV \u226411.4). This method was validated according to FDA guidance for industry and can be used to assess the pharmacokinetics of two newly approved antiretrovirals, or to support therapeutic drug monitoring for modern antiretroviral therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Cell division of Staphylococcus adopts a \"popping\" mechanism that mediates extremely rapid separation of the septum. Elucidating the structure of the septum is crucial for understanding this exceptional bacterial cell division mechanism. Here, the septum structure of Staphylococcus warneri is extensively characterized using high-speed time-lapse confocal microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electron microscopy. The cells of S. warneri divide in a fast \"popping\" manner on a millisecond timescale. Our results show that the septum is composed of two separable layers, providing a structural basis for the ultrafast daughter cell separation. The septum is formed progressively toward the center with non-uniform thickness of the septal disk in radial directions. The peptidoglycan on the inner surface of double-layered septa is organized into concentric rings, which are generated along with septum formation. Moreover, this study signifies the importance of new septum formation in initiating new cell cycles. This work unravels the structural basis underlying the \"popping\" mechanism that drives Staphylococcus cell division and reveals a generic structure of the bacterial cell.\n\nIMPORTRANCEThis work shows that the septum of Staphylococcus warneri is composed of two layers and the peptidoglycan on the inner surface of the double-layered septum is organized into concentric rings. Moreover, new cell cycles of Staphylococcus could be initiated before the previous cell cycle is complete. This work advances our knowledge about a basic structure of bacterial cell and provides the double layered structural information of septum for the bacterium that divide with the \"popping\" mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia is an important environmental cue in heart development. Despite of extensive characterization of gain and loss of function models, there is disagreement about the impact of HIF1 elimination in cardiac tissue. Here, we used a new conditional knock out of Hif1a in NKX2.5 cardiac progenitors to assess the morphological and functional consequences of HIF1 loss in the developing heart. By combining histology, electron microscopy and high-throughout genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, we found that deletion of Hif1a leads to impaired embryonic glycolysis without influencing cardiomyocyte proliferation and results in an increased mitochondrial number, activation of a transient amino acid response and upregulation of HIF2 and ATF4 by E12.5. Hif1a mutants display normal fatty acid oxidation metabolic profile and do not show any sign of cardiac dysfunction in the adulthood. Our results demonstrate that HIF1 signaling is dispensable for heart development and reveal the metabolic flexibility of the embryonic myocardium, opening the potential application of alternative energy sources as therapeutic interventions during ischemic events.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of imprinted gene loci also referred to as loss of imprinting (LOI) can result in severe developmental defects and other diseases, but the molecular mechanisms that ensure imprint stability remain incompletely understood. Here, we dissect the functional components of the imprinting control region of the essential Dlk1-Dio3 locus (called IG-DMR) and the mechanism by which they ensure imprinting maintenance. Using pluripotent stem cells carrying an allele-specific reporter system, we demonstrate that the IG-DMR consists of two antagonistic regulatory elements: a paternally methylated CpG-island that prevents the activity of Tet dioxygenases and a maternally unmethylated regulatory element, which serves as a non-canonical enhancer and maintains expression of the maternal Gtl2 lncRNA by precluding de novo DNA methyltransferase function. Targeted genetic or epigenetic editing of these elements leads to LOI with either bi-paternal or bi-maternal expression patterns and respective allelic changes in DNA methylation and 3D chromatin topology of the entire Dlk1-Dio3 locus. Although the targeted repression of either IG-DMR or Gtl2 promoter is sufficient to cause LOI, the stability of LOI phenotype depends on the IG-DMR status, suggesting a functional hierarchy. These findings establish the IG-DMR as a novel type of bipartite control element and provide mechanistic insights into the control of Dlk1-Dio3 imprinting by allele-specific restriction of the DNA (de)methylation machinery.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe IG-DMR is a bipartite element with distinct allele-specific functions\nC_LIO_LIA non-canonical enhancer within the IG-DMR prevents DNA methyltransferase activity\nC_LIO_LITargeted epigenome editing allows induction of specific imprinting phenotypes\nC_LIO_LICRISPRi reveals a functional hierarchy between DMRs that dictates imprint stability\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Psittaciformes (parrots, cockatoos and lorikeets) comprise one of the most colourful clades of birds. Their unique pigments and cavity nesting habits are two potential explanations for their colourful character. However, plumage colour varies substantially between parrot species and sometimes also between males and females of the same species. Here, we use comparative analyses to evaluate what factors correlate with colour elaboration, colour diversity and sexual dichromatism. Specifically, we test the association between different aspects of parrot colouration and (1) the intensity of sexual selection and social interactions, (2) variation along the slow-fast life-history continuum and (3) climatic variation. We show that larger species and species that live in warm environments display more elaborated colours, yet smaller species have higher levels of sexual dichromatism. Larger parrots tend to have darker and more blue and red colours. Parrots that live in humid environments are darker and redder, whilst species inhabiting warm regions have more blue plumage colours. In general, the variables we considered explain small to moderate amounts of variation in parrot colouration (up to 20%). Our data suggest that sexual selection may be acting more strongly on males in small, short-lived parrots leading to sexual dichromatism. More elaborate colouration in both males and females of the larger, long-lived species with slow tropical life-histories suggests that mutual mate choice and reduced selection for crypsis may be important in these species, as has been shown for passerines.",

    "abstract": "In teleost fishes there are three immunoglobulin isotypes named immunoglobulin M (IgM), D (IgD) and T (IgT). IgT has been the last to be described and is considered a teleosts-fish specific isotype. From the recent availability of genome sequences of fishes, an in-depth analysis of Actinopterygii immunoglobulin heavy chain genes was undertaken. With the aid of a bioinformatics pipeline, a machine learning software, CHfinder, was developed that identifies the coding exons of the CH domains of fish immunoglobulins. Using this pipeline, a high number of such sequences were obtained from teleosts and holostean fishes. IgT was found in teleost and holostean fishes that had not been previously described. A phylogenetic analysis reveals that IgT CH1 exons are similar to the IgM CH1. This analysis also demonstrates that the other three domains (CH2, CH3 and CH4) were not generated by recent duplication processes of IgM in Actinopterygii, indicating it is an immunoglobulin with an earlier origin.",
