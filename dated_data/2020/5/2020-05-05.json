    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a progressive disease, which is primarily characterized by a decline in {beta}-cell function and worsening of insulin resistance. Unfortunately, most interventions (lifestyle, diet, and therapeutic agents) for T2DM only provide a transient restoration of {beta}-cell function and the progression is inevitable once it starts. To understand the natural progression of T2DM, a mechanistic model was developed to quantitatively characterize the dynamic interactions among {beta}-cell function, plasma fasting glucose (PFG), fasting insulin (FI), and the degree of insulin resistance, starting from an early stage of T2DM over up to 8 years. The model was validated using clinical data to optimize the disease parameters. The restoration and deterioration rates of {beta}-cell function were both predicted as 84.5 %/year and 1.10 /year for early stages of T2DM. The model predicted a positive correlation between the initial level of {beta}-cell function at diagnosis and its maximum restoration potential, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis and intervention. After the treatment, {beta}-cell function could be temporarily restored within several months, which has a long-term benefit in glycemic control. The maximal tolerated PFG level that permits {beta}-cell function restoration was predicted to be around 8.33 nM; and the temporal restoration of {beta}-cell function would be unlikely at a PFG level above this threshold. The intrinsic deterioration rates of {beta}-cell function and insulin resistance were both critical factors for long-term glycemic control. In conclusion, our model provides a quantitative analysis of the natural disease progression in T2DM and yields insights into factors that are critical for long-term glycemic control.",

    "abstract": "The illegal practice of cyanide fishing continues to damage coral reef ecosystems throughout the Indo-Pacific. To combat this destructive fishing method, a simple, reliable test to detect whether or not a fish has been captured using cyanide (CN) is needed. This study analyzed the toxicokinetics of acute, pulsed CN exposure as well as chronic exposure to thiocyanate (SCN), the major metabolite of CN, in the clownfish species, Amphiprion clarkii. Fish were pulse exposed to 50 ppm CN for 20 or 45 seconds or chronically exposed to 100 ppm SCN for 12 days. Blood plasma levels of SCN were measured following derivatization to SCN-bimane using an Acquity UPLC I-Class and Q-Exactive hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap HRAM mass spectrometer or directly by HPLC-UV. After exposure to CN, depending on the duration of exposure, SCN plasma levels reached a maximum concentration (300-470 ppb) 0.13-0.17 days after exposure, had a 0.1 to 1.2 day half-life, and often did not return to baseline levels. The half-life of plasma SCN after direct exposure to SCN was found to be 0.13 days, similar to the CN exposure, and that SCN in the holding water would often drop below detection. Finally, we observed that when a fish, never exposed to SCN, was placed in aquarium water spiked with SCN, there was a steady decrease in aqueous SCN concentration over 24 hours until it could no longer be detected. This pattern was repeated with a second sequential dose. These results demonstrate that A. clarkii do not excrete SCN after CN exposure, but in fact can absorb low concentrations of SCN from water, refuting several publications. It appears that A. clarkii exhibit a classic two compartment model where SCN is rapidly eliminated from the blood plasma and is distributed throughout the tissue but not excreted in their urine. This study demonstrates that SCN may be used as a marker of CN exposure only if fish are tested shortly after exposure. There is species specific variability in response to CN, and studies of other taxa need to be performed before this test can be deployed in the field.",

    "abstract": "The \"browning\" of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) through increased abundance of thermogenic beige/brite adipocytes is induced by cold exposure and many other perturbations in association with beneficial systemic metabolic effects. Adipose browning is reported to require activation of sympathetic nerve fibers (SNF), aided by alternately activated macrophages within iWAT. Here we demonstrate the first example of a non-cell autonomous pathway for iWAT browning that is fully independent of SNF activity. Thus, the strong induction of thermogenic adipocytes prompted by deletion of adipocyte fatty acid synthase (iAdFASNKO mice) was unaffected by denervation or the deletion of SNF modulator Neuregulin-4. However, browning of iWAT in iAdFASNKO mice does require adipocyte cAMP/protein kinase A signaling, as it was blocked in adipocyte- selective Fasn/Gs double KO mice. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of iAdFASNKO mouse adipose stromal cells revealed increased macrophages displaying gene expression signatures of the alternately activated type. Mechanistically, depletion of such phagocytic immune cells in iAdFASNKO mice fully abrogated appearance of thermogenic adipocytes in iWAT. Altogether, these findings reveal an unexpected pathway of cAMP/PKA-dependent iWAT browning that is initiated by adipocyte signals and caused by macrophage-like cells independent of sympathetic neuron involvement.",

    "abstract": "Salicylic acid (SA) homeostasis determines also developmental senescence and is spatiotemporally controlled by various mechanisms, including biosynthesis, transport and conjugate formation. The alteration of WHIRLY1 (WHY1), a repressor of leaf natural senescence, with respect to allocation in the nucleus or chloroplast causes a perturbation in SA homeostasis, resulting in adverse plant senescence phenotypes. Loss of WHY1 resulted in a 5 days earlier SA peak compared to wild type plants which accumulated SA at 42 days after germination. SA accumulation coincided with an early leaf senescence phenotype, which could be prevented by ectopic expression of the nuclear WHY1 isoform (nWHY1). However, expressing the plastid WHY1 isoform (pWHY1) greatly enhanced cellular SA levels. A global transcriptional analysis in WHY1 loss-of-function background by expressing either pWHY1 or nWHY1 indicated that hormone metabolism related genes were most significantly altered. The pWHY1 isoform predominantly affected stress related gene expression, while the nWHY1 controlled rather developmental gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) assays indicated that nWHY1 directly binds to the promoter region of isochorismate synthase (ICS1) to activate its expression at later stage, but indirectly activated S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase (BSMT1) gene expression via ethylene response factor 109 (ERF109), while repressing phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL1) expression via R2R3-MYB member 15 (MYB15) at the early stage of development. Interestingly, rising SA levels exerted a feedback effect by inducing nWHY1 modification and pWHY1 accumulation. Thus, the alteration of WHY1 organelle isoforms and the feedback of SA intervened in a circularly integrated regulatory network during developmental or stress-induced senescence in Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "Certain fungal endophytes are known to improve plant resistance to biotic stresses in forest trees. In this study, three stem fungal endophytes belonging to classes Cystobasidiomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Dothideomycetes were selected from 210 isolates for their potential as enhancers of Ulmus minor resistance to Ophiostoma novo-ulmi. We evaluated phenotypic traits of these endophytes that could be beneficial for inhibiting O. novo-ulmi in the host plant. Under in vitro conditions, the Dothideomycetous isolate YCB36 strongly inhibited O. novo-ulmi growth, released antipathogenic VOCs, chitinases and siderophores, and overlapped with the pathogen in nutrient utilization patterns. These functional traits could explain the 40% reduction in leaf wilting due to O. novo-ulmi in elm trees pre-inoculated with this endophyte. Ulmus minor trees inoculated with this endophyte showed increased leaf stomatal conductance and higher concentrations of flavonoids and total phenolic compounds in xylem tissues, suggesting induction of defence metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Necrosis- and ethylene-inducing-like proteins (NLPs) are secreted by fungi, oomycetes and bacteria. Conserved nlp peptides derived from NLPs are recognized as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), leading to PAMP-triggered immune responses. RLP23 is the receptor of the nlp peptides in Arabidopsis thaliana; however, its actual contribution to plant immunity is unclear. Here, we report that RLP23 is required for Arabidopsis immunity against the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Arabidopsis rlp23 mutants exhibited enhanced susceptibility to B. cinerea compared with the wild-type plants. Notably, microscopic observation of the B. cinerea infection behaviour indicated the involvement of RLP23 in pre-invasive resistance to the pathogen. B. cinerea carried two NLP genes, BcNEP1 and BcNEP2; BcNEP1 was expressed preferentially before/during invasion into Arabidopsis, whereas BcNEP2 was expressed at the late phase of infection. Importantly, the nlp peptides derived from both BcNEP1 and BcNEP2 induced the production of reactive oxygen species in an RLP23-dependent manner. In contrast, other necrotrophic fungus Alternaria brassicicola did not express the NLP gene in the early infection phase and exhibited no enhanced virulence in the rlp23 mutants. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that RLP23 contributes to Arabidopsis pre-invasive resistance to B. cinerea via NLP recognition at the early infection phase.",

    "abstract": "The yft1 tomato mutant has a yellow-fruited phenotype controlled by a recessive gene (YFT1), which has been shown by map-based cloning to be a homolog of ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 (EIN2). The genetic lesion of the YFT1 allele of yft1 is attributed to a 573 bp DNA fragment (IF573) insertion at 1,200 bp downstream of the transcription start site (TSS). Transcriptome analysis revealed that the mutation resulted in 5,053 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the fruit pericarp compared with the M82 wild type cultivar. These were annotated as being involved in ethylene synthesis, chromoplast development, and carotenoid synthesis. Genetic lesion in YFT1 caused a reduction in its own transcript levels in yft1 and impaired ethylene emission and signal transduction, delayed chromoplast development and decreased carotenoid accumulation. The molecular mechanism underlying the reduced expression of YFT1 in yft1 was examined at both the RNA and DNA levels. The IF573 event was shown to introduce two negative regulatory sequences located at -272 to -173 bp and -172 to -73 bp in the YFT1 allele promoter, causing alterative splicing due to aberrant splicing sites, and also altering the structure of the open reading frame in the 5-UTR. This study contributes to the understanding of color formation in tomato fruit.\n\nOne-sentence summaryLesion happened in regulatory region impairs expression of a key gene of ethylene signal pathway, and alters fruit color in tomato due to effect of carotenoids accumulation and ethylene synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Hyperactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway motivates the clinical use of MAPK inhibitors for BRAF-mutant melanomas. Heterogeneity in differentiation state due to epigenetic plasticity, however, results in cell-to-cell variability in the state of MAPK dependency, diminishing the efficacy of MAPK inhibitors. To identify key regulators of such variability, we screened 276 epigenetic-modifying compounds, individually or combined with MAPK inhibitors, across genetically diverse and isogenic populations of melanoma cells. Following single-cell analysis and multivariate modeling, we identified three classes of epigenetic inhibitors that target distinct epigenetic states associated with either one of the lysine-specific histone demethylases KDM1A or KDM4B, or BET bromodomain proteins. While melanocytes remained insensitive, the anti-tumor efficacy of each inhibitor was predicted based on melanoma cells differentiation state and MAPK activity. Our systems pharmacology approach highlights a path toward identifying actionable epigenetic factors that extend the BRAF oncogene addiction paradigm on the basis of tumor cell differentiation state.",

    "abstract": "Some organism-specific databases about regulation in bacteria have become larger, accelerated by high-throughput methodologies, while others are no longer updated or accessible. Each database homogenize its datasets, giving rise to heterogeneity across databases. Such heterogeneity mainly encompasses different names for a gene and different network representations, generating duplicated interactions that could bias network analyses. Abasy (Across-bacteria systems) Atlas consolidates information from different sources into meta-curated regulatory networks in bacteria. The high-quality networks in Abasy Atlas enable cross-organisms analyses, such as benchmarking studies where gold standards are required. Nevertheless, network incompleteness still casts doubts on the conclusions of network analyses, and available sampling methods cannot reflect the curation process. To tackle this problem, the updated version of Abasy Atlas presented in this work provides historical snapshots of regulatory networks. Thus, network analyses can be performed at different completeness levels, making possible to identify potential bias and to predict future results. We leverage the recently found constraint in the complexity of regulatory networks to develop a novel model to quantify the total number of regulatory interactions as a function of the genome size. This completeness estimation is a valuable insight that may aid in the daunting task of network curation, prediction, and validation. The new version of Abasy Atlas provides 76 networks (204,282 regulatory interactions) covering 42 bacteria (64% Gram-positive and 36% Gram-negative) distributed in 9 species (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptomyces coelicolor), containing 8,459 regulons and 4,335 modules.\n\nDatabase URLhttps://abasy.ccg.unam.mx/",

    "abstract": "Discovering and developing pharmaceutical drugs increasingly relies on mechanistic mathematical modeling and simulation. In immuno-oncology, models that capture causal relations among genetic drivers of oncogenesis, functional plasticity, and host immunity provide an important complement to wet experiments, given the cellular complexity and dynamics within tumors. Unfortunately, formulating such mechanistic cell-level models currently relies on hand curation by experts, which can bias how data is interpreted or the priority of drug targets. In modeling molecular-level networks, rules and algorithms have been developed to limit a priori biases in formulating mechanistic models. To realize an equivalent approach for cell-level networks, we combined digital cytometry with Bayesian network inference to generate causal models that link an increase in gene expression associated with onco-genesis with alterations in stromal and immune cell subsets directly from bulk transcriptomic datasets. To illustrate, we predicted how an increase in expression of Cell Communication Network factor 4 (CCN4/WISP1) altered the tumor microenvironment using data from patients diagnosed with breast cancer and melanoma. Digital cytometry and network inference predictions were then tested using two immunocompetent mouse models for melanoma, which provided consistent experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Societies rely on individual contributions to sustain public goods that benefit the entire community. Several mechanisms, that specify how individuals change their decisions based on past experiences, have been proposed to explain how altruists are not outcompeted by selfish counterparts. A key aspect of such strategy updates involves a comparison of an individuals latest payoff with that of a random neighbour. In reality, both the economic and social milieu often shapes cooperative behaviour. We propose a new decision heuristic, where the propensity of an individual to cooperate depends on the local strategy environment in which she is embedded as well as her wealth relative to that of her neighbours. Our decision-making model allows cooperation to be sustained and also explains the results of recent experiments on social dilemmas in dynamic networks. Final cooperation levels depend only on the extent to which the strategy environment influences altruistic behaviour but are largely unaffected by network restructuring. However, the extent of wealth inequality in the community is affected by a subtle interplay between the environmental influence on a persons decision to contribute and the likelihood of reshaping social ties, with wealth-inequality levels rising with increasing likelihood of network restructuring in some situations.",

Some researchers pointed out that sexually monomorphic ornaments could also be evolved by mate choice by both sexes or either sex. Many species of fruit fly have sexually monomorphic wing pigmentation. However, involvement of their sexually monomorphic ornaments in mate choice has not been tested. We aimed to examine whether the sexually monomorphic polka-dotted pattern on wings of Drosophila guttifera contributes to mate choice. Because D. guttifera does not mate in the dark condition at all and courtship sound was not observed, some visual information is likely to be used in mating behaviour. We compared the number of mates between individuals with and without wings, and found that presence of wings influenced mate choice in both sexes. We then compared the number of mates between individuals bearing replaced wings, one group for conspecific D. guttifera wings and another group for heterospecific D. melanogaster wings with no pigmentation pattern. The effect of conspecific/heterospecific wings was only detected in mate choice by females. By comparison between wild-type and black-painted wings, we found no evidence of contribution of wing pigmentation pattern to mate choice in either sex.",

Therefore, the availability of large single donor depots of primary MSC would greatly benefit the cell therapy market by reducing costs associated with manufacturing.\n\nWe have discovered that an abundant population of cells possessing all the hallmarks of MSC is tightly associated with the vertebral body (VB) bone matrix and are only liberated by proteolytic digestion. Here we demonstrate that these vertebral bone-adherent (vBA) MSC possess all the International Society of Cell and Gene Therapy (ISCT)-defined characteristics (e.g., plastic adherence, surface marker expression, and trilineage differentiation) of MSC and, therefore, have termed them vBA-MSC, to distinguish this population from loosely associated MSC recovered through aspiration or rinsing of the bone marrow (BM) compartment.\n\nPilot banking and expansion was performed with vBA-MSC obtained from 3 deceased donors and it was demonstrated that bank sizes averaging 2.9x108 {+/-} 1.35x108 vBA-MSC at passage one were obtainable from only 5 g of digested VB bone fragments. Each bank of cells demonstrated robust proliferation through a total of 9 passages without significant reduction in population doubling times. The theoretical total cell yield from the entire amount of bone fragments (approximately 300g) from each donor with limited expansion through 4 passages is 100 trillion (1x1014) vBA-MSC, equating to over 105 doses at 10x106 cells/kg for an average 70 kg recipient. Thus, we have established a novel and plentiful source of MSC which will benefit the cell therapy market by overcoming manufacturing and regulatory inefficiencies due to donor-to-donor variability.",

    "abstract": "Investigations of the human neuromuscular junction (NMJ) have predominately utilised experimental animals and model organisms. Consequently, there remains a paucity of data regarding the development of the human NMJ and a lack of systems that enable temporal investigation of the motor unit. This work addresses this need, providing the methodologies to bioengineer 3D models of the human motor unit. Separate maturation of primary human skeletal muscle and iPSC derived motor neurons seeks to accurately represent neuromuscular development via controlled addition of motor axons following primary myogenesis. Spheroid cultures of motor neuron progenitors augmented the transcription of OLIG2, ISLET1 and SMI32 motor neuron mRNAs [~]400, [~]150 and [~]200-fold respectively. Axon projections of adhered motor neuron spheroids exceeded 1000m in monolayer, with transcription of SMI32 and VACHT mRNAs further enhanced in a concentration dependent manner within optimised 3D type I collagen extracellular matrices. Bioengineered skeletal muscles produce functional forces, demonstrate increased acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering, and transcription of MUSK and LRP4 mRNAs indicating enhanced organisation of the post-synaptic membrane. Dosed integration of motor neuron spheroids outlined the motor pool required to functionally innervate muscle tissues in 3D, generating physiologically functional human NMJs that evidence pre- and post-synaptic membrane and motor nerve terminal co-localisation. Spontaneous firing was significantly elevated in 3D motor units, confirmed to be driven by the motor nerve via antagonistic inhibition of the AChR. Finally, functional analyses outlined decreased time to peak twitch and half relaxation times, indicating enhanced physiology of excitation contraction coupling of NMJs within innervated motor units.",

Recently, deep learning techniques have been witnessed with revival in a variety of areas such as image processing and genomic data analysis, and they will be useful for the coming age of big data analysis in pharmaceutical research and chemogenomic applications. This provides us an impetus to develop a novel deep learning platform to accurately and reliably predict the response of cancer to different drug treatments.\n\nResultsIn this study, we describe a Java-based implementation of deep neural network (DNN) method, termed JavaDL, to predict cancer responses to drugs solely based on their chemical features. To this end, we devised a novel cost function by adding a regularization term which suppresses overfitting. We also adopted an \"early stopping\" strategy to further reduce overfit and improve the accuracy and robustness of our models. Currently the software has been integrated with a genetic algorithm-based variable selection approach and implemented as part of our JavaDL package. To evaluate our program, we compared it with several machine learning programs including SVM and kNN. We observed that JavaDL either significantly outperforms other methods in model building and prediction or obtains better results in handling big data analysis. Finally, JavaDL was employed to predict drug responses of several highly aggressive triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, and the results showed robust and accurate predictions with r2 as high as 0.80.\n\nAvailabilityThe program is freely available at https://imdlab.mdanderson.org/JavaDL/JavaDL.php.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionFinding orthologs remains an important bottleneck in comparative genomics analyses. While the authors of software for the quick comparison of protein sequences evaluate the speed of their software and compare their results against the most usual software for the task, it is not common for them to evaluate their software for more particular uses, such as finding orthologs as reciprocal best hits (RBH). Here we compared RBH results, between prokaryotic genomes, obtained using software that runs faster than blastp. Namely, lastal, diamond, and MMseqs2.\n\nResultsWe found that lastal required the least time to produce results. However, it yielded fewer results than any other program when comparing evolutionarily distant genomes. The program producing the most similar number of RBH as blastp was MMseqs2. This program also resulted in the lowest error estimates among the programs tested. The results with diamond were very close to those obtained with MMseqs2, with diamond running faster. Our results suggest that the best of the programs tested was diamond, ran with the \"sensitive\" option, which took 7% of the time as blastp to run, and produced results with lower error rates than blastp.\n\nAvailabilityA program to obtain reciprocal best hits using the software we tested is maintained at https://github.com/Computational-conSequences/SequenceTools",

To identify potential interactions between SMARCB1 loss and the process of neural development, we introduced an inducible SMARCB1 loss of function system into human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) which were subjected to either directed neuronal differentiation or differentiation into cerebral organoids. Using this system, we have identified substantial differences in the downstream effects of SMARCB1 loss depending on differentiation state and identified an interaction between SMARCB1 loss and neural differentiation pressure which causes a resistance to terminal differentiation and a defect in maintenance of a normal cell state. Our results provide insight into how SMARCB1 loss might interact with neural development in the process of ATRT tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Comparisons of vertebrate brain structure suggest a conserved pattern of scaling between components, but also many examples of lineages diverging dramatically from these general trends. Two competing hypotheses of brain evolution seek to explain these patterns of variation by invoking either \u2018external\u2019 processes, such as selection driving phenotypic change, or \u2018internal\u2019 processes, like developmental coupling among brain regions. Efforts to reconcile these views remain deadlocked, in part due to empirical under-determination and the limitations of \u2018relative significance\u2019 debates. We introduce an agent-based model that allows us to simulate brain evolution in a \u2018bare-bones\u2019 system and examine the dependencies between variables that may shape brain evolution. Our simulations formalise verbal arguments and interpretations concerning the evolution of brain structure. We illustrate that \u2018concerted\u2019 patterns of brain evolution cannot alone be taken as evidence for developmental coupling, or constraint, despite these terms often being treated as synonymous in the literature. Both developmentally coupled and uncoupled brain architectures can represent adaptive mechanisms, depending on the distribution of selection across the brain, life history, and the relative costs of neural tissue. Our model also illustrates how the prevalence of mosaic and concerted patterns of evolution may fluctuate through time in a variable environment, which we argue implies that developmental coupling is unlikely to be a significant evolutionary constraint.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The effects of partner choice have been documented in a large number of biological systems such as sexual markets, interspecific mutualisms, or human cooperation. There are, however, a number of situations in which one would expect this mechanism to play a role, but where no such effect has ever been demonstrated. This is the case in particular in many intraspecific interactions, such as collective hunts, in non-human animals. Here we use individual-based simulations to solve this apparent paradox. We show that the conditions for partner choice to operate are in fact restrictive. They entail that individuals can compare social opportunities and choose the best. The challenge is that social opportunities are often rare because they necessitate the co-occurrence of (i) at least one available partner, and (ii) a resource to exploit together with this partner. This has three consequences. First, partner choice cannot lead to the evolution of cooperation when resources are scarce, which explains that this mechanism could never be observed in many cases of intraspecific cooperation in animals. Second, partner choice can operate when partners constitute in themselves a resource, which is the case in sexual interactions and interspecific mutualisms. Third, partner choice can lead to the evolution of cooperation when individuals live in a rich environment, and/or when they are highly efficient at extracting resources from their environment.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic lethal interactions are of paramount importance both in biology and in medicine, and hence increasing efforts have been devoted to their systematic identification. Our previous computational analysis revealed that in prokaryotic species, synthetic lethal genes tend to be further away in chromosomes than random (i.e. repulsion), which was shown to provide bacterial genomes with greater robustness to large-scale DNA deletions. To test the generalizability of this observation in eukaryotic genomes, we leveraged the wealth of experimentally determined synthetic lethal genetic interactions of yeast that are curated in the BioGRID (Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets) database. We observed an opposite trend that is the genomic proximity of synthetic lethal gene pairs both on the 2D and 3D chromosomal space of the yeast genome (i.e. 2D and 3D attraction). To gain mechanistic insights into the origin of the attraction of synthetic lethal gene pairs in S. cerevisiae, we characterized four classes of genes, in which synthetic lethal interactions are enriched and partly explain the observed patterns of genomic attraction: i) gene pairs operating on the same pathways, 2) co-expressed genes, 3) gene pairs whose protein products physically interact and 4) the paralogs. However, our analysis revealed that the contribution of these four types of genes is not sufficient to fully explain the observed 2D and 3D attraction of synthetic lethal gene pairs and hence its evolutionary origin still remains as an open question.\n\nSignificance statementUnravelling the organizing principles underlying gene arrangements is one of the fundamental questions of research in evolutionary biology. One understudied aspect of this organization is the relative chromosomal arrangement of synthetic lethal gene pairs. In this study, by analyzing a wealth of synthetic lethality data in yeast, we provide evidence that synthetic lethal gene pairs tend to be attracted to each other both on 2D and 3D chromosomal space of the yeast genome. This observation is in sharp contrast with the repulsion of synthetic lethal (metabolic) gene pairs that we observed previously in bacterial genomes. Characterizing the evolutionary forces underlying this genomic pattern in yeast can open the door towards an evolutionary theory of genome organization in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of mortality driven by infectious agents. RNA viruses such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and the new pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can be highly pathogenic. Clinical and experimental evidence indicate that most severe and lethal cases do not depend on the viral burden and are, instead, characterized by an aberrant immune response. In this work we assessed how the innate immune response contributes to the pathogenesis of RNA virus infections. We demonstrate that type III interferons produced by dendritic cells in the lung in response to viral recognition cause barrier damage and compromise the host tissue tolerance. In particular, type III interferons inhibit tissue repair and lung epithelial cell proliferation, causing susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections. Overall, our data give a strong mandate to rethink the pathophysiological roles of this group of interferons and their possible use in the clinical practice against endemic as well as emerging viral infections.",

    "abstract": "Signaling via pre-TCR is essential for initial T cell differentiation. How the signal is triggered and whether its alteration impacts on lymphocyte repertoires is nevertheless debated. We show that a mutation in the transmembrane domain of the CD3{zeta} chain impairs murine thymocyte development at the double negative (DN) stage coinciding with reduced levels of steady-state pre-TCR signaling. Single particle tracking and TIRF microscopy on mouse primary DN3/DN4 thymocytes shows that wild-type pre-TCR form particles with a broad range of fluorescent intensities whereas mutant complexes are less intensely labeled and move faster, suggesting reduced pre-TCR nanoclustering. Notably, the mutant early-pre-TCR-selected-DP population shows less TCR{beta} repertoire diversity. We thus propose that the pre-TCR forms stable nanoclusters, the size of which determines signaling efficacy. This signaling does not merely promote maturation of any thymocyte expressing a rearranged TCR{beta} chain, but shapes the repertoire of DP thymocytes that can audition for positive and negative selection.",

There are contradictory reports regarding response of circulating monocytes to pro-inflammatory or non-inflammatory stimuli in vitro. Here we aimed to analyze the phenotypic changes in circulating monocytes when stimulated with pro and non-inflammatory stimuli.\n\nMETHODSWhole blood from 9 healthy donors was extracted and studied. Monocyte subpopulations were directly measured using flow cytometry with PBMC Ficoll extraction method. Pro-inflammatory interleukin IL-1{beta} was measured by intracellular cytometry. Whole blood-extracted monocytes were stimulated using LPS and IL-4 as previously described. Changes against non-stimulated (N-S) populations were statistically analyzed.\n\nRESULTSCompared to N-S, LPS-stimulated monocytes display a singular milieu of markers, with higher levels of intracellular IL-1{beta} in parallel raise of CD14+CD163-/CD14+CD163+ ratio. CD163 shows positive correlation with levels of IL-1{beta}. In t-SNE (T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) analysis, after LPS stimulation, subpopulation CD14+CD16-CD163-, containing mainly classical monocytes, show a higher number of IL-1{beta}+ cells.\n\nCONCLUSIONClassical monocytes, the non-inflammatory subset, show higher levels of IL-1{beta} in response to LPS narrowing down to a new subpopulation of monocytes CD14+CD16-CD163-, which correlates better with this interleukin response than widely used monocytes classification. Using CD163 in addition to CD16, we were able to show that classical monocytes display the most intense response to LPS. Additionally, CD163 appears to be a suitable addition to CD14-CD16 classification to improve its performance.",

    "abstract": "Colistin resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae is predominantly caused by mutations that increase expression of the arn (also known as pbg or pmrF) operon. Expression is activated by the PhoPQ and PmrAB two-component systems. Constitutive PhoPQ activation occurs directly by mutation or following loss of MgrB. PhoPQ may also cross-activate PmrAB via the linker protein PmrD. Using proteomics, we show that MgrB loss causes a wider proteomic effect than direct PhoPQ activation, suggesting additional targets for MgrB. Different mgrB mutations cause different amounts of Arn protein production, which correlated with colistin MIC. Disruption of phoP in an mgrB mutant had a reciprocal effect to direct activation of PhoQ in a wild-type background, but the regulated proteins showed almost total overlap. Disruption of pmrD or pmrA slightly reduced Arn protein production in an mgrB mutant, but production was still high enough to confer colistin resistance; disruption of phoP conferred wild-type Arn production and colistin MIC. Activation of PhoPQ directly, or through mgrB mutation did not significantly activate PmrAB or PmrC production but direct activation of PmrAB by mutation did, and also activated Arn production and conferred colistin resistance. There was little overlap between the PmrAB and PhoPQ regulons. We conclude that under the conditions used for colistin susceptibility testing, PhoPQ-PmrD-PmrAB cross-regulation is not significant and that independent activation of PhoPQ or PmrAB is the main reason that Arn protein production increases above the threshold required for colistin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Some microbes display pleomorphism, showing variable cell shapes in a single culture, whereas others differentiate to adapt to changed environmental conditions. The pleomorphic archaeon Haloferax volcanii commonly forms discoid-shaped ( plate) cells in culture, but may also be present as rods, and can develop into motile rods in soft agar, or longer filaments in certain biofilms. Here we report improvement of H. volcanii growth in both semi-defined and complex media by supplementing with eight trace-element micronutrients. With these supplemented media, transient development of plate cells into uniformly-shaped rods was clearly observed during the early log phase of growth; cells then reverted to plates for the late log and stationary phases. In media prepared with high-purity water and reagents, without supplemental trace elements, rods and other complex elongated morphologies ( pleomorphic rods) were observed at all growth stages of the culture; the highly-elongated cells sometimes displayed a substantial tubule at one or less frequently both poles, as well as unusual tapered and highly-curved forms. Polar tubules were observed forming by initial mid-cell narrowing or tubulation, causing a dumbbell-like shape, followed by cell division towards one end. Formation of the uniform early-log rods, as well as the pleomorphic rods and tubules were dependent on the function of the tubulin-like cytoskeletal protein, CetZ1. Our results have revealed the remarkable morphological plasticity of H. volcanii cells in response to multiple culture conditions, and should facilitate the use of this species in further studies of archaeal biology.",

    "abstract": "Coordination of multiple activities of complex enzymes is critical for life, including transcribing, replicating, and repairing DNA. Bacterial RecBCD helicase-nuclease must coordinate DNA unwinding and cutting to repair broken DNA. Starting at a DNA end, RecBCD unwinds DNA with its fast RecD helicase on the 5-ended strand and its slower RecB helicase on the 3-ended strand. At Chi hotspots (5GCTGGTGG3), RecBs nuclease cuts the 3-ended strand and loads RecA strand-exchange protein onto it. We report here that a small molecule NSAC1003, a sulfanyltriazolobenzimidazole, mimics Chi sites by sensitizing RecBCD to cut DNA at a Chi-independent position a certain percent of the DNA substrates length. This percent decreases with increasing NSAC1003 concentration. Our data indicate that NSAC1003 slows RecB and sensitizes it to cut DNA when the leading helicase RecD stops at the DNA distal end. Two previously described RecBCD mutants altered in the RecB ATP-binding site also have this property, but uninhibited wild-type RecBCD lacks it. Computation docks NSAC1003 into the ATP-binding site, suggesting that NSAC1003 acts directly on RecB. NSAC1003 will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of RecBCD-Chi regulation and DNA repair. Similar studies could help elucidate other DNA enzymes whose activities are coordinated at chromosomal sites.",

    "abstract": "Protamines are the safeguards of the paternal sperm genome. They replace most of the histones during spermiogenesis, resulting in DNA hypercondensation, thereby protecting its genome from environmental noxa. Impaired protamination has been linked to male infertility in mice and humans in many studies. Apart from impaired DNA integrity, protamine-deficient human and murine sperm show multiple secondary effects, including decreased motility and aberrant head morphology. In this study, we use a Prm2-deficient mouse model in combination with label-free quantitative proteomics to decipher the underlying molecular processes of these effects. We show that loss of the sperms antioxidant capacity, indicated by downregulation of key proteins like SOD1 and PRDX5, ultimately initiates an oxidative stress-mediated destruction cascade during epididymal sperm maturation. This is confirmed by an increased level of 8-OHdG in epididymal sperm, a biomarker for oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage. Prm2-deficient testicular sperm are not affected and initiate the proper development of blastocyst stage preimplantation embryos in vitro upon intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) into oocytes. Our results provide new insight into the role of Prm2 and its downstream molecular effects on sperm function and present an important contribution to the investigation of new treatment regimens for infertile men with impaired protamination.\n\nSignificance statementSexual reproduction requires the successful fertilization of female eggs by male sperm. The generation of functional sperm is a complex, multi-step differentiation process known as spermatogenesis that takes places in the male testis. One important step for physiological sperm function is the incorporation of small proteins, known as protamines into the DNA. Defects within this process are common causes of male infertility. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain largely unknown, thus preventing targeted therapies. Here, we identify the molecular cascade being initiated in protamine-deficient murine sperm that ultimately impedes fertilization. Our findings have broad implications for the development of new treatment options for infertile men with faulty protamination that seek medical advice.",

Individual dendritic branches are thought to constitute a signal processing unit, yet how neighbouring synapses shape the boundaries of functional dendritic units are not well understood. Here we addressed the cellular basis underlying the organization of the strengths of neighbouring Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses by optical quantal analysis and spine size measurements. Inducing potentiation at clusters of spines produced NMDA receptor-dependent heterosynaptic plasticity. The direction of postsynaptic strength change showed distance-dependency to the stimulated synapses where proximal synapses predominantly depressed whereas distal synapses potentiated; potentiation and depression were regulated by CaMKII and calcineurin, respectively. By contrast, heterosynaptic presynaptic plasticity was confined to weakening of presynaptic strength of nearby synapses, which required CaMKII and the retrograde messenger nitric oxide. Our findings highlight the parallel engagement of multiple signalling pathways, each with characteristic spatial dynamics in shaping the local pattern of synaptic strengths.",

The link between LRRK2 and -synuclein aggregation in PD remains enigmatic. Numerous reports suggest critical LRRK2 functions in microglial responses. Herein, we find that LRRK2-positive immune cells in the brain represent CD68-positive pro-inflammatory, monocyte-derived macrophages, distinct from microglia. Rod -synuclein fibrils stimulate LRRK2 kinase activity in monocyte-derived macrophages, and LRRK2 mutations lead to enhanced recruitment of classical monocytes into the midbrain in response to -synuclein. LRRK2 kinase inhibition blocks -synuclein fibril induction of LRRK2 protein in both human and murine macrophages, with human cells demonstrating much higher LRRK2 levels and kinase activity than equivalent murine cells. Further, interferon-{gamma} strongly induces LRRK2 kinase activity in primary human macrophages in comparison to weak effects observed in murine cells. These results highlight peripheral immune responses in LRRK2-linked paradigms that further connect two central proteins in PD.",

Using laminar current-source density (CSD) analysis, we found layer-specific changes of the spatiotemporal synaptic activity patterns. Applying multitaper spectral analysis and time-domain conditional Granger causality (GC) measures, we found increased stimulus-evoked oscillatory power in the beta band (25-36 Hz) selectively within infragranular layers Vb and enhanced supragranular synaptic activity.

    "abstract": "The brains ability to encode temporal patterns and predict upcoming events is critical for speech perception and other aspects of social communication. Deficits in predictive coding may contribute to difficulties with social communication and overreliance on repetitive predictable environments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using a mismatch negativity (MMN) task involving rhythmic tone sequences of varying complexity, we tested the hypotheses that 1) individuals with ASD have reduced MMN response to auditory stimuli that deviate in presentation timing from expected patterns, particularly as pattern complexity increases and 2) amplitude of MMN signal is inversely correlated with level of impairment in social communication and repetitive behaviors. Electroencephalography was acquired as individuals (age 6-21years) listened to repeated five-rhythm tones that varied in the Shannon entropy of the rhythm across three conditions (zero, medium-1 bit) and high-2 bit entropy). The majority of the tones conformed to the established rhythm (standard tones); occasionally the 4th tone was temporally shifted relative to its expected time of occurrence (deviant tones). Social communication and repetitive behaviors were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised. Both neurotypical controls (n=19) and individuals with ASD (n=21) show stepwise decreases in MMN as a function of increasing entropy. Contrary to the result forecasted by a predictive coding hypothesis, individuals with ASD do not differ from controls in these neural mechanisms of prediction error to auditory rhythms of varied temporal complexity, and there is no relationship between these signals and social communication or repetitive behavior measures.\n\nLay SummaryWe tested the idea that the brains ability to use previous experience to influence processing of sounds is weaker in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than in neurotypical individuals. We found no difference between individuals with ASD and neurotypical controls in brain wave responses to sounds that occurred earlier than expected in either simple or complex rhythms. There was also no relationship between these brain waves and social communication or repetitive behavior scores.",

Here we tested the heritability of retinotopic maps in human visual cortex using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We demonstrate that retinotopic organization shows a closer correspondence in monozygotic (MZ) compared to dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, suggesting a partial genetic determination. Using population receptive field (pRF) analysis to examine the preferred spatial location and selectivity of these neuronal populations, we estimate a heritability around 30% for polar angle preferences and spatial selectivity, as quantified by pRF size, in extrastriate areas V2 and V3. Our findings are consistent with heritability in both the macroscopic arrangement of visual regions and stimulus tuning properties of visual cortex.

This flexibility switch represents a novel motor-like activity, allowing EEA1 to generate a force that moves vesicles closer to the membrane they will fuse with. To elucidate how binding of a single signaling protein can globally change the stiffness of a 200 nm long chain, we propose a simplified description of the coiled-coil as a one-dimensional Frenkel-Kontorova chain.

It is in these cristae membranes that the OXPHOS complexes have been shown to reside in various species. The majority of the OXPHOS subunits are nuclear-encoded and must therefore be imported from the cytosol through the outer membrane at contact sites with the inner boundary membrane. As the mitochondrially-encoded components are also integral members of these complexes, where does nascent protein synthesis occur? Transcription, mRNA processing, maturation and at least part of the mitoribosome assembly process occur at the nucleoid and the spatially juxtaposed mitochondrial RNA granules, is protein synthesis also performed at the RNA granules close to these entities, or does it occur distal to these sites ? We have adapted a click chemistry based method, coupled with STED nanoscopy to address these questions. We report that in human cells in culture, within the limits of our methodology, the majority of mitochondrial protein synthesis occurs at the cristae membranes and is spatially separated from the sites of RNA processing and maturation.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a common genetic disorder with lung and liver involvement. Most patients carry the Z allele in SERPINA1 that encodes a mutant AAT (ATZ) forming hepatotoxic polymers. We found CHOP upregulation and activation in both mouse (PiZ) and human livers expressing ATZ. Compared to controls, juvenile PiZ/Chop-/- mice showed reduction in hepatic ATZ and transcriptional response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, as consequence of CHOP-mediated increase of SERPINA1 transcription. CHOP was found to upregulate SERPINA1 though binding with c-JUN on SERPINA1 regulatory elements, thus aggravating hepatic accumulation of ATZ. Increased CHOP levels were detected in diseased livers of children homozygous for the Z allele.\n\nCompared to adults, AAT deficiency in infants has different severity and prognosis. Based on our findings, CHOP-c-JUN complex upregulates SERPINA1 transcription and play an important role in the hepatic disease pathogenesis by increasing the burden of proteotoxic ATZ, particularly in the pediatric population.",

    "abstract": "Combining genetic and cell-type-specific proteomic datasets can lead to new biological insights and therapeutic hypotheses, but a technical and statistical framework for such analyses is lacking. Here, we present an open-source computational tool called Genoppi that enables robust, standardized, and intuitive integration of quantitative proteomic results with genetic data. We used Genoppi to analyze sixteen cell-type-specific protein interaction datasets of four proteins (TDP-43, MDM2, PTEN, and BCL2) involved in cancer and neurological disease. Through systematic quality control of the data and integration with published protein interactions, we show a general pattern of both cell-type-independent and cell-type-specific interactions across three cancer and one human iPSC-derived neuronal type. Furthermore, through the integration of proteomic and genetic datasets in Genoppi, our results suggest that the neuron-specific interactions of these proteins are mediating their genetic involvement in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, our analyses indicate that human iPSC-derived neurons are a relevant model system for studying the involvement of TDP-43 and BCL2 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

A common form of the loss function in machine learning for survival data is also mainly based on Cox partial likelihood function, due to its simplicity. However, the optimization problem becomes intractable when more complicated regularization is employed with the Cox loss function. In this paper, we show that a convex conjugate function of Cox loss function based on Fenchel Duality exists, and this provides an alternative framework to optimization based on the primal form. Furthermore, the dual form suggests an efficient algorithm for solving the kernel learning problem with censored survival outcomes.

Intestinal macrophages are vital in the process of resolution of inflammation but the mechanisms underlying their mucosal healing capacity remains elusive. Here, we describe a subset of E prostanoid receptor 4 (EP4) expressing intestinal macrophages with mucosal healing properties both in human and mice. Notably, Csf1r-iCre EP4-fl/fl mice showed defective mucosal healing and intestinal epithelial barrier regeneration in a dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis model. Mechanistically, an increased mucosal level of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) triggers the secretion of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) in monocyte-derived EP4+ macrophages via MAPKs. Subsequently, CXCL1 drives epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation from regenerating crypts during the resolution phase of colitis. Thus, EP4+ intestinal macrophages are essential for the support of the intestinal stem cell niche and for the regeneration of the injured epithelium.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryProstaglandin E2 licenses E-type prostanoid receptor 4 intestinal macrophage regenerative capacity promoting mucosal healing via the secretion of CXCL1",

With the recent development of direct acting antivirals (DAA), treatment of chronically infected patients has become highly effective although a subset of patients do not respond to therapy. Sofosbuvir is a common component of current de novo or salvage combination therapies. We used pre-treatment whole genome sequencing of HCV from 507 patients infected with HCV subtype 3a and treated with sofosbuvir containing regimens to detect viral polymorphisms associated with response to treatment. We found that three common polymorphisms present in HCV NS2 and NS3 proteins (not direct targets of sofosbuvir) were associated with reduced treatment response. These polymorphisms were enriched in post-treatment HCV sequences of patients unresponsive to treatment; they were also associated with lower reductions in viral load in the first week of therapy. The finding of polymorphisms in NS2 and NS3 proteins associated with poor treatment outcomes emphasises the value of more systematic genome-wide analyses of HCV in uncovering indirect but clinically relevant mechanisms of antiviral resistance.",

Since gut microbiome alterations can reflect and/or contribute to impending host health changes, we examined whether gut microbiota metagenomic profiles would provide more robust measures for predicting disease outcomes in colitis-prone hosts.\n\nMethodsUsing the IL-10 gene-deficient (IL-10 KO) murine model where early life dysbiosis from antibiotic (cefoperozone, CPZ) treated dams vertically-transferred to pups increases risk for colitis later in life, we investigated temporal metagenomic profiles in the gut microbiota of post-weaning offspring and determined their relationship to eventual clinical outcomes.\n\nResultsCompared to controls, offspring acquiring maternal CPZ-induced dysbiosis exhibited a restructuring of intestinal microbial membership both in bacteriome and mycobiome that were associated with alterations in specific functional subsystems. Furthermore, among IL-10 KO offspring from CPZ-treated dams, several functional subsystems, particularly nitrogen metabolism, diverged between mice that developed spontaneous colitis (CPZ-colitis) versus those that did not (CPZ-no-colitis) at a time point prior to eventual clinical outcome.\n\nConclusionsOur findings provide support that functional metagenomic profiling of gut microbes has potential and promise meriting further study for development of tools to assess risk and manage human IBD.\n\nSynopsisCurrently, predictive markers for the development and course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are not available. This study supports the notion that gut microbiome metagenomic profiles could be developed into a useful tool to assess risk and manage human IBD.",

The identification of evenly expressed reference genes is necessary for accurate quantitative gene expression analysis, whether by traditional RT-PCR (reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) or by qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time PCR; qPCR). In the Stramenopiles (the major line of eukaryotes that includes brown algae) there is a noted lack of known reference genes for such studies, largely due to the absence of available molecular tools. Here we present a set of nine reference genes (Elongation Factor 1 alpha (EF1A), Elongation Factor 2 alpha (EF2A), Elongation Factor 1 beta (EF1B), 14-3-3 Protein, Ubiquitin Conjugating Enzyme (UBCE2), Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Actin Related Protein Complex (ARP2/3), Ribosomal Protein (40s; S23), and Actin) for the brown alga Fucus distichus. These reference genes were tested on adult sporophytes across six abiotic stress conditions (desiccation, light and temperature modification, hormone addition, pollutant exposure, nutrient addition, and wounding). Suitability of these genes as reference genes was quantitatively evaluated across conditions using standard methods and the majority of the tested genes were evaluated favorably. However, we show that normalization genes should be chosen on a condition-by-condition basis. We provide a recommendation that at least two reference genes be used per experiment, a list of recommended pairs for the conditions tested here, and a procedure for identifying a suitable set for an experimenters unique design. With the recent expansion of interest in brown algal biology and accompanied molecular tools development, the variety of experimental conditions tested here makes this study a valuable resource for future work in basic biology and understanding stress responses in the brown algal lineage.",

    "abstract": "The cortex plays an important role in regulating motivation and cognition, and does so by regulating multiple subcortical brain circuits. Glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are topographically organized in different subregions such as the prelimbic, infralimbic and orbitofrontal, and project to topographically-organized subcortical target regions. Dopamine D1 and D2 receptors are expressed on glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the PFC. However, it is unclear whether D1 and D2 receptor-expressing pyramidal neurons in the PFC are also topographically organized. We used a retrograde adeno-associated virus (AAVRG)-based approach to illuminate the topographical organization of D1 and D2 receptor-expressing neurons, projecting to distinct striatal and midbrain subregions. Our experiments reveal that AAVRG injection in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) or dorsal striatum (dSTR) of D1Cre mice labeled distinct neuronal subpopulations in medial orbitofrontal or prelimbic PFC, respectively. However, AAVRG injection in NAcc or dSTR of D2Cre mice labeled medial orbitofrontal, but not medial prelimbic PFC, respectively. Additionally, D2R+ but not D1R+ PFC neurons were labeled upon injection of AAVRG in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Thus, our data are the first to highlight a unique dopamine receptor-specific topographical pattern in the PFC, which could have profound implications for corticostriatal signaling in the basal ganglia.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCorticostriatal connections play an important role in regulating goal-directed and habitual behavior, and neuromodulators such as cortical dopamine play an important role in behavioral flexibility. Dopamine receptor expressing D1R+ and D2R+ projection neurons in the cortex mediate the effects of cortical dopamine, but whether these neurons are anatomically organized in a manner that would explain how these neurons mediate these complex effects, is not clear. Our results show a distinct topographical organization of D1R+ and D2R+ PFC pyramidal neurons that project to distinct striatal and midbrain subregions. These results suggest that effects of cortical dopamine are mediated by anatomically localized distinct receptor- and target-defined subcircuits.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric and neurological disorders are afflictions of the brain that can affect individuals throughout their lifespan. Many brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have been conducted; however, imaging-based biomarkers are not yet well established for diagnostic and therapeutic use. This article describes an outline of the planned study, the Brain/MINDS Beyond human brain MRI project (FY2018 [~] FY2023), which aims to establish clinically-relevant imaging biomarkers with multi-site harmonization by collecting data from healthy traveling subjects (TS) at 13 research sites. Collection of data in psychiatric and neurological disorders across the lifespan is also scheduled at 13 sites, whereas designing measurement procedures, developing and analyzing neuroimaging protocols, and databasing are done at three research sites. The Harmonization protocol (HARP) was established for five high-quality 3T scanners to obtain multimodal brain images including T1 and T2-weighted, resting state and task functional and diffusion-weighted MRI. Data are preprocessed and analyzed using approaches developed by the Human Connectome Project. Preliminary results in 30 TS demonstrated cortical thickness, myelin, functional connectivity measures are comparable across 5 scanners, providing high reproducibility and sensitivity to subject-specific connectome. A total of 75 TS, as well as patients with various psychiatric and neurological disorders, are scheduled to participate in the project, allowing a mixed model statistical harmonization. The HARP protocols are publicly available online, and all the imaging, demographic and clinical information, harmonizing database will also be made available by 2024. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first project to implement a rigorous, prospective harmonization protocol with multi-site TS data. It explores intractable brain disorders across the lifespan and may help to identify the disease-specific pathophysiology and imaging biomarkers for clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new method for decoding neural data from fMRI. It is based on two assumptions, first that neural representation is distributed over networks of neurons embeded in voxel noise and second that the stimuli can be decoded as learned relations from sets of categorical stimuli. We illustrate these principles with two types of stimuli, color (wavelength) and letters (visual shape), both of which have early visual system response, but at the same time must be learned within a given function or category (color contrast, alphabet). Key to the decoding method is reducing the stimulus cross-correlation by a matched noise voxel sample by normalizing the stimulus voxel matrix thus unmasking a highly discriminative neural profile per stimulus. Projection of this new voxel space (ROI) to a smaller set of dimensions (with e.g., non-metric Multidimensional scaling), the relational information takes a unique geometric form revealing functional relationships between sets of stimuli, defined by R. Shepard, as second-order isomorphisms (SOI). In the case of colors the SOI appears as a nearly equally spaced set of wavelengths arranged in a color wheel, with a gap between the \"purples\" and \"reds\" (consistent with the gap in the original Ekmans color set). In the case of letters, a cluster space resulted from the decorrelated voxel neural profiles, which matched the phrase structure of the mnemonic used for more than 100 years to teach children the alphabet (across multiple languages), The Alphabet Song.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in the disruption of supraspinal control of spinal networks and an increase in the relative influence of afferent feedback to sublesional neural networks, both of which contribute to enhancing spinal reflex excitability. Hyperreflexia occurs in ~75% of individuals with chronic SCI and critically hinders functional recovery and quality of life. It is suggested to result from an increase in motoneuronal excitability and a decrease in presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibitory mechanisms. In contrast, locomotor training decreases hyperreflexia by restoring presynaptic inhibition.\n\nPrimary afferent depolarization (PAD) is a powerful presynaptic inhibitory mechanism that selectively gates primary afferent transmission to spinal neurons to adjust reflex excitability and ensure smooth movement. However, the effect of chronic SCI and step-training on the reorganization of presynaptic inhibition evoked by hindlimb afferents, and the contribution of PAD has never been demonstrated. The objective of this study is to directly measure changes in presynaptic inhibition through dorsal root potentials (DRPs) and its association to plantar H-reflex inhibition. We provide direct evidence that H-reflex hyperexcitability is associated with a decrease in transmission of PAD pathways activated by PBSt afferents after chronic SCI. More precisely, we illustrate that PBSt group I muscle afferents evoke a similar pattern of inhibition onto both L4-DRPs and plantar H-reflexes evoked by the tibial nerve in Control and step-trained animals, but not in chronic SCI rats. These changes are not observed after step-training, suggesting a role for activity-dependent plasticity to regulate PAD pathways activated by flexor muscle group I afferents.\n\nKey point summaryO_LIPresynaptic inhibition is modulated by supraspinal centers and primary afferents in order to filter sensory information, adjust spinal reflex excitability, and ensure smooth movements.\nC_LIO_LIAfter SCI, the supraspinal control of primary afferent depolarization (PAD) interneurons is disengaged, suggesting an increased role for sensory afferents. While increased H-reflex excitability in spastic individuals indicates a possible decrease in presynaptic inhibition, it remains unclear whether a decrease in sensory-evoked PAD contributes to this effect.\nC_LIO_LIWe investigated whether the PAD evoked by hindlimb afferents contributes to the change in presynaptic inhibition of the H-reflex in a decerebrated rat preparation. We found that chronic SCI decreases presynaptic inhibition of the plantar H-reflex through a reduction in PAD evoked by PBSt muscle group I afferents.\nC_LIO_LIWe further found that step-training restored presynaptic inhibition of the plantar H-reflex evoked by PBSt, suggesting the presence of activity-dependent plasticity of PAD pathways activated by flexor muscle group I afferents.\nC_LI",

Alongside the inherent variability embedded within these metrics, added complications include the influence of ambiguous or prolonged noxious inputs, or in situations when communication may be compromised. As such, there is continued interest in the development of brain biomarkers of pain, such as in the form of neural  signatures of brain activity. However, issues pertaining to pain-related specificity remain, and by understanding the current limits of these signatures we can both progress their development and investigate the potentially generalizable properties of pain to other salient and/or somatomotor tasks. Here, we utilized two independent datasets to test one of the established Neural Pain Signatures (the NPS (Wager et al. 2013)). In Study 1, brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 40 healthy subjects during experimentally induced breathlessness, conditioned anticipation of breathlessness and a simple finger opposition task. In Study 2, brain activity was again measured during anticipation and breathlessness in 19 healthy subjects, as well as a modulation with the opioid remifentanil. We were able to identify significant NPS-related brain activity during anticipation and perception of breathlessness, as well as during finger opposition using the global NPS. Furthermore, localised NPS responses were found in early somatomotor regions, bilateral insula and dorsal anterior cingulate for breathlessness and finger opposition. In contrast, no conditions were able to activate the local signature in the dorsal posterior insula - thought to be critical for pain perception. These results provide properties of the present boundaries of the NPS, and offer insight into the overlap between breathlessness and somatomotor conditions with pain.",

    "abstract": "Tau protein in vitro can undergo liquid liquid phase separation (LLPS); however, observations of this phase transition in living cells are limited. To investigate protein state transitions in living cells we found that Cry2 can optogentically increase the association of full lengh tau with microtubules. To probe this mechanism, we identified tau domains that drive tau clustering on microtubules in living cells. The polyproline rich domain (PRD) drives LLPS and does so under the control of phosphorylation. These readily observable cytoplasmic condensates underwent fusion and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching consistent with the ability of the PRD to undergo LLPS in vitro. In absence of the MTBD, the tau PRD co-condensed with EB1, a regulator of plus-end microtubule dynamic instability. The specific domain properties of the MTBD and PRD serve distinct but mutually complementary roles that utilize LLPS in a cellular context to implement emergent functionalities that scale their relationship from binding alpha-beta tubulin heterodimers to the larger proportions of microtubules.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) participates in synaptic vesicle trafficking and synaptic transmission, but its misfolding is also strongly implicated in Parkinsons disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders known as synucleinopathies where misfolded aSyn accumulates in different regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although increased aSyn expression levels or altered aggregation propensities likely underlie familial PD with SNCA amplification or mutations, the majority of synucleinopathies arise sporadically, indicating that disease can develop under normal levels of wildtype aSyn. We report here the development and characterization of a mouse line expressing an aSyn-GFP fusion protein under the control of native Snca regulatory elements. Regional and subcellular localization of the aSyn-GFP fusion protein in brains and peripheral tissues of knock-in (KI) mice are indistinguishable from that of wildtype littermates. Importantly, similar to wildtype aSyn, aSyn-GFP disperses from synaptic vesicles upon membrane depolarization, indicating that the tag does not alter normal aSyn dynamics at synapses. In addition, intracerebral injection of aSyn pre-formed fibrils into KI mice induced the formation of aSyn-GFP inclusions with a distribution pattern similar to that observed in wildtype mice, albeit with attenuated kinetics due to the GFP tag. We anticipate that this new mouse model will facilitate in vitro and in vivo studies requiring in situ detection of endogenous aSyn, therefore providing new insights into aSyn function in health and disease.\n\nSignificance StatementAlpha-synuclein (aSyn) participates in synaptic vesicle function and represents a major component of the Lewy pathology found in Parkinsons and related neurodegenerative diseases. The function of aSyn and the sequence of events leading to its aggregation and neurotoxicity are not fully understood. Here we present a new mouse model in which Enhanced Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) has been knocked-in at the C-terminal of the Snca gene. The resulting fusion protein shows identical expression and localization to that of wildtype animals, is functional, and is incorporated into pathological aggregates in vitro and in vivo. This new tool allows for monitoring aSyn under a variety of physiological and pathological conditions, and may uncover additional insights into its function and dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The visual message conveyed by a retinal ganglion cell (RGC) is often summarized by its spatial receptive field, but in principle also depends on the responses of other RGCs and natural image statistics. This possibility was explored by linear reconstruction of natural images from responses of the four numerically-dominant macaque RGC types. Reconstructions were highly consistent across retinas. The optimal reconstruction filter for each RGC - its visual message - reflected natural image statistics, and resembled the receptive field only when nearby, same-type cells were included. ON and OFF cells conveyed largely independent, complementary representations, and parasol and midget cells conveyed distinct and expected features. Correlated activity and nonlinearities had statistically significant but minor effects on reconstruction. Simulated reconstructions, using linear-nonlinear cascade models of RGC light responses that incorporated measured spatial properties and nonlinearities, produced similar results. Spatiotemporal reconstructions exhibited similar spatial properties, suggesting that the results are relevant for natural vision.",

Here, we show that female C57BL/6J mice binge drink more than males and have greater basal BNSTCRF neuron excitability and synaptic excitation. We identified a dense VGLUT2+ glutamatergic synaptic input from the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) that is anatomically similar in males and females. These PVTBNST neurons release glutamate directly onto BNSTCRF neurons but also engage a large BNST interneuron population to ultimately provide a net inhibition of BNSTCRF neurons, and both components of this polysynaptic PVTVGLUT2-BNSTCRF circuit are more robust in females than males. Chemogenetic inhibition of the PVTBNST projection promoted binge alcohol drinking in females without affecting males, and chemogenetic activation of the pathway was sufficient to reduce avoidance behavior in both sexes in anxiogenic contexts. Lastly, we show that withdrawal from repeated binge drinking produces a female-like phenotype in the male PVT-BNSTCRF excitatory synapse without altering the function of PVTBNST neurons per se. Our data describe a complex feedforward inhibitory PVTVGLUT2-BNSTCRF glutamatergic circuit that is more robust in females, plays sex-dependent roles in alcohol drinking and avoidance behavior, and undergoes sex-dependent alcohol-induced plasticity.",

Available methods are expensive, laborious and often limited by either the analysis of short CpG stretches or low assay sensitivity. Here, we present a cost-efficient next generation sequencing-based strategy for the simultaneous investigation of multiple candidate genes in large cohorts. To illustrate the method, we present analysis of four candidate genes commonly assessed in psychoneuroendocrine research: Glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), Serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), FKBP Prolyl isomerase 5 (FKBP5), and the Oxytocin receptor (OXTR).\n\nDNA methylation standards and DNA of a female and male donor were bisulfite treated in three independent trials and were used to generate sequencing libraries for 42 CpGs from the NR3C1 1F promoter region, 83 CpGs of the SLC6A4 5 regulatory region, 5 CpGs located in FKBP5 intron 7, and additional 12 CpGs located in a potential enhancer element in intron 3 of the OXTR. In addition, DNA of 45 patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and 45 healthy controls was assayed. Multiplex libraries of all samples were sequenced on a MiSeq system and analyzed for mean methylation values of all CpG sites using amplikyzer2 software.\n\nResults indicated excellent accuracy of the assays when investigating replicates generated from the same bisulfite converted DNA, and very high linearity (R2> 0.9) of the assays shown by the analysis of differentially methylated DNA standards. Comparing DNA methylation between BPD and healthy controls revealed no biologically relevant differences.\n\nThe technical approach as described here facilitates targeted DNA methylation analysis and represents a highly sensitive, cost-efficient and high throughput tool to close the gap between coverage and precision in epigenetic research of stress-associated phenotypes.",

Osteoblasts isolated from Phospho1-/- mice were enriched for genes associated with energy metabolism and diabetes; Phospho1 both directly and indirectly interacted with genes associated with glucose transport and insulin receptor signalling. Canonical thermogenesis via brown adipose tissue did not underlie the metabolic protection observed in adult Phospho1-/- mice.

We identified PSII-LHCII supercomplexes in their monomeric and multimeric forms in the low-light acclimated spinach leaves and prepared them using sucrose density gradient-ultracentrifugation in the presence of amphipol A8-35. When the leaves were acclimated to high-light, however, only monomeric forms were present. Single particle electron microscopy identified that the multimeric PSII-LHCII supercomplexes were composed of two ( megacomplex) or three ( arraycomplex) units of PSII-LHCII supercomplexes, which aligned like a fraction of the semi-crystalline array. Further characterization using fluorescence analysis revealed that multimeric forms have a higher light-harvesting capability, but a lower thermal dissipation capability than the monomeric form, suggesting such a configurational conversion of PSII-LHCII supercomplexes possibly serves as a structural basis for the plants acclimation to environmental light.",

Here we report a multiscale investigation of the regulation and function of this phenomenon. We identify key cell signaling events comprising interaction of the ethylene, cytokinin, and auxin hormone signaling pathways. We identify the gene Oryza sativa Histidine Kinase-1/OsHK1, as well as the auxin influx carrier gene OsAUX1, as essential regulators of this process in rice. Robophysical modelling demonstrated the benefits of tip movement for navigating past obstacles, prompting us to challenge mutant and wild-type plants with different substrates. Consistent with model behavior, root circumnutation facilitated exploration of a solid surface and promoted seedling establishment in rocky soil. Thus, the integration of robotics, physics and biology elucidated the functional importance of root circumnutation and uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying its regulation.\n\nOne sentence summaryCircumnutation facilitates root exploration.",

    "abstract": "Catharanthus roseus produces a diverse range of specialized metabolites of the monoterpenoid indole alkaloid (MIA) class in a heavily branched pathway. Recent great progress in identification of MIA biosynthesis genes revealed that the different pathway branch genes are expressed in a highly cell type- and organ-specific and stress-dependent manner. This implies a complex control by specific transcription factors (TFs), only partly revealed today. We generated and mined a comprehensive compendium of publicly available C. roseus transcriptome data for MIA pathway branch-specific TFs. Functional analysis was performed through extensive comparative gene expression analysis and profiling of over 40 MIA metabolites in the C. roseus flower petal expression system. We identified additional members of the known BIS and ORCA regulators. Further detailed study of the ORCA TFs suggests subfunctionalization of ORCA paralogs in terms of target gene-specific regulation and synergistic activity with the central jasmonate response regulator MYC2. Moreover, we identified specific amino acid residues within the ORCA DNA-binding domains that contribute to the differential regulation of some MIA pathway branches. Our results advance our understanding of TF paralog specificity for which, despite the common occurrence of closely related paralogs in many species, comparative studies are scarce.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTA gene discovery program for regulators of monoterpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis in Catharanthus roseus advances our understanding of paralog specificity and subfunctionalization of the renowned class of ORCA transcription factors, particularly in terms of target gene-specificity and synergistic activity with other jasmonate-responsive transcription factors.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of single cell sequencing technologies, finding cell communities with high accuracy has become crucial for large scale projects. Employing the current commonly used dimensionality reduction techniques such as tSNE and UMAP, it is often difficult to clearly distinguish cell communities in high dimensional space. Usually cell communities with similar origin and trajectories cluster so closely to each that their subtle but important differences do not become readily apparent. This creates a problem for clustering, as clustering is also performed on dimensionality reduction results. In order to identify such communities, scientists either perform broad clustering and then extract each cluster and perform re-clustering to identify sub-populations or they over-cluster the data and then merging the clusters with similar gene expressions. This is an incredibly cumbersome and time-consuming process. To solve this problem, we propose K-nearest-neighbor-based Network graph drawing Layout (KNetL, pronounced like  nettle) for dimensionality reduction. In our method, we use force-directed graph drawing, whereby the attractive force (analogous to a spring force) and the repulsive force (analogous to an electrical force in atomic particles) between the cells are evaluated, and the cell communities are organized in a structural visualization. The coordinates of the force-compacted nodes are then extracted, and we employ dimensionality reduction methods, such as tSNE and UMAP to unpack the nodes. The final plot, a KNetL map, shows a visually-appealing and distinctive separation between cell communities. Our results show that KNetL maps bring significant resolution to visualizing and identifying otherwise hidden cell communities. All the algorithms are implemented in the iCellR package and available through the CRAN repository. Single (i) Cell R package (iCellR) provides great flexibility at every step of the analysis pipeline, including normalization, clustering, dimensionality reduction, interactive 2D and 3D visualizations, batch alignment or data integration, imputation, and interactive cell gating tools, which allow users to manually gate around the cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscriptomic signatures are useful in defining the molecular phenotypes of cells, tissues, and patient samples. Their most successful and widespread clinical application is the stratification of breast cancer patients into molecular (PAM50) subtypes. In most cases, gene expression signatures are developed using transcriptome-wide measurements, thus methods that match signatures to samples typically require a similar degree of measurements. The cost and relatively large amounts of fresh starting material required for whole-transcriptome sequencing has limited clinical applications, and accordingly thousands of existing gene signatures are unexplored in a clinical context.\n\nResultsGenes in a molecular signature can provide information about molecular phenotypes and their underlying transcriptional programs from tissue samples, however determining the transcriptional state of these genes typically requires the measurement of all genes across multiple samples to allow for comparison. An efficient assay and scoring method should quantify the relative abundance of signature genes with a minimal number of additional measurements. We identified genes with stable expression across a range of abundances, and with a preserved relative ordering across large numbers (thousands) of samples, allowing signature scoring, and supporting general data normalisation for transcriptomic data. Based on singscore, we have developed a new method, stingscore, which quantifies and summarises relative expression levels of signature genes from individual samples through the inclusion of these \"stably-expressed genes\".\n\nConclusionWe show that our proposed list of stable genes has better stability across cancer and normal tissue data than previously proposed stable or housekeeping genes. Additionally, we show that signature scores computed from whole-transcriptome data are comparable to those calculated using only values for signature genes and our panel of stable genes. This new approach to gene expression signature analysis may facilitate the development of panel-type tests for gene expression signatures, thus supporting clinical translation of the powerful insights gained from cancer transcriptomic studies.",

Nonetheless, the significance of the currently available open-pore conformations is debated due to their diversity in the pore geometry. Here, we discuss the physiological significance of existing models of the GlyR active state based on conductance and selectivity measurements by computational electrophysiology. The results support the conclusion that the original cryo-EM reconstruction of the active state obtained in detergents as well as its subsequent refinement by Molecular Dynamics simulations are likely to be non-physiological as they feature artificially dilated ion pores. In addition, the calculations indicate that a physiologically relevant open pore configuration should be constricted within a radius of 2.5 and 2.8[A], which is consistent with previous modeling, electrophysiology measurements, and the most recent cryo-EM structures obtained in a native lipid-membrane environment.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a heterogeneous embryonal malignancy and the most deadly tumor of childhood, although a minor subset may show spontaneous differentiation. It arises from the multipotent neural crest lineage during development. Some of this multipotency is retained in neuroblastoma, which can give rise to both adrenergic and mesenchymal tumor cells. The mechanisms enabling such dual fates are unknown, but likely help neuroblastoma to evade existing therapies. To understand neuroblastoma plasticity, we analyzed patient tumors using single-cell transcriptomics. In addition to the heterogeneous adrenergic and mesenchymal populations, we identify a subpopulation of malignant cells resembling Schwann cell precursors (SCPs). This SCP-like population connects the adrenergic and mesenchymal compartments through transitions structurally reminiscent of the SCP cell-fate decision fork that occurs during normal development. While the directionality of such transitions in neuroblastoma remains to be established, this finding expands the potential reservoirs of malignant cells, and suggests intratumoral plasticity mechanisms relevant for therapeutic resistance and relapse.",

    "abstract": "An explosion of recent findings firmly demonstrated that brain activity and cognitive function in rodents and humans are modulated synchronously with nasal respiration. Rhythmic respiratory (RR) coupling of wide-spread forebrain activity was confirmed using advanced techniques, including current source density analysis, single unit firing, and phase modulation of local gamma activity, creating solid premise for investigating how higher networks use this mechanism in their communication. Here we show essential differences in the way prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC) process the RR signal from the olfactory bulb (OB) allowing dynamic PFC-HC coupling utilizing this input. We used inter-regional coherences and their correlations in rats, breathing at low rate ([~]2 Hz) at rest, outside of the short sniffing bouts. We found strong and stable OB-PFC coherence, contrasting OB-HC coherence which was low but highly variable. PFC-HC coupling, however, primarily correlated with the latter, indicating that HC access to the PFC output is dynamically regulated by the responsiveness of HC to the common rhythmic drive. This pattern was present in both theta and non-theta states of waking, whereas PFC-HC communication appeared protected from RR synchronization in sleep states. The findings help to understand the mechanism of rhythmic modulation of non-olfactory cognitive processes by the on-going regular respiration, reported in rodents as well as humans. These mechanisms may be impaired when nasal breathing is limited or in OB-pathology, including malfunctions of the OB epithelium due to infections, such as in COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "A pervasive issue in stable isotope tracing and metabolic flux analysis is the presence of naturally occurring isotopes such as 13C. For mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) measured by mass spectrometry, it is common practice to correct for natural isotopes within metabolites of interest using a particular linear transform based on binomial distributions. However, the origin and mathematical derivation of this transform is rather obscure, and it may be difficult for nonexperts to understand precisely how to interpret the resulting corrected MIDs. Moreover, corrected MIDs are often used to fit metabolic network models and infer metabolic fluxes, which implicitly assumes that corrected MIDs will yield the same flux solution as the actual observed MIDs. Yet, there seems to be no published proof of this important property. Here, we provide a detailed derivation of the MID-correcting linear transform, reflecting its historical development, and describe some interesting properties. We also provide a proof that for metabolic flux analysis on noise-free MID data at steady state, observed and corrected MIDs indeed yield the same flux solution. On the other hand, for noisy MID data, the flux solution will generally differ between the two representations.",

    "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a complex disease caused by different species of genus Leishmania, which affects millions of people spanning over 88 countries causing extensive mortality and morbidity. Leishmaniasis exists in three clinical forms; cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral. Anti-leishmanial therapy is one of the challenging fields due to the presence of wide range of Leishmania species and host response against the pathogenic infection. Clinical survey reveals toxicity of drugs and trial compounds causing death among patients and predominant resistance to different class of antimonials among the leishmaniasis patient. Identification of appropriate target protein is a primary and important phase of drug development and Leishmania is a suitable system for targeted drug development as it branched out quite early from the higher eukaryotes like human. With the advancement of genomic era and availability of whole genome sequences of Leishmania species, relevant information on their respective genes and proteins are now easily extracted. Hence, in the current study, to aid the targeted drug therapy, an exhaustive whole genome scale comparative sequence analysis was performed to identify genes/proteins exclusive to Leishmania. Subsequently, further filtration was employed to identify the individual Leishmania species specific gene/proteins. Among such proteins, a considerable number was found to have no recognizable structure and functions. Hence, efforts were taken to characterize these Leishmania exclusive gene/proteins via providing additional sequence, structure, localization and functional information. All the information about each of these Leishmania exclusive gene/proteins from five different Leishmania species has been systemically categorized and represented in the form a user-friendly database called Leish-ExP, which is freely available at http://www.hpppi.iicb.res.in/Leish-ex.",

    "abstract": "The global breeding population of Eleonoras falcon is distributed from the Canary Islands in the west, across the Mediterranean Sea, to Cyprus in the east. The remoteness of nesting colonies, which are predominantly located on sea cliffs and islets, renders breeding success estimation a challenging task, requiring a composite approach to assess each of the breeding stages. Early estimates of the breeding success of Eleonoras falcon suggested that Akrotiri colony in Cyprus had the lowest breeding success among all the colonies throughout the species breeding range, at a level seemingly unsustainable, suggesting the colony might have been in danger of gradual extinction. Here we use a diversity of survey methods using boat, ground and aerial surveys, with the incorporation of photography and photogrammetry, to reassess the breeding success and the effect of nest characteristics on the Eleonoras falcon breeding population in Cyprus. During a six-year study, we found that Cyprus hosts ~138 {+/-} 8 breeding pairs and that breeding success equals 1.54 {+/-} 0.85 fledglings per breeding pair, thus considerably higher than previous estimates. In addition, by analyzing temporal variation in breeding and nest characteristics, we found that early breeding and reuse of nests positively influence breeding success, but physical nest characteristics have a limited effect on colony productivity. The range of survey methods employed, as well as the array of photography techniques utilized, highly enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of this study, allowing us to overcome the challenge of inaccessibility of nesting cliffs.",

In vitro TM cells and ex vivo perfused eyes were subjected to pigment dispersion followed by K-115 treatment (PK115). PK115 was compared to sham-treated controls (C) and pigment (P). Cytoskeletal alterations were assessed by F-actin labeling. TM cell phagocytosis of fluorescent targets was evaluated by flow cytometry. Cell migration was studied with a wound-healing assay. Intraocular pressure was continuously monitored and compared to after the establishment of the pigmentary glaucoma model and after treatment with K-115.\n\nResultsIn vitro, the percentage of cells with stress fibers increased in response to pigment but declined sharply after treatment with K-115 (P: 32.8 +/- 2.9%; PK115: 11.6 +/- 3.3%, P < 0.001). Phagocytosis first declined but recovered after K-115 (P: 25.7+/-2.1%, PK115: 33.4+/-0.8%, P <0.01).

    "abstract": "Population admixture is an important subject in population genetics. Inferring population demographic history with admixture under the so-called admixture network model from population genetic data is an established problem in genetics. Existing admixture network inference approaches work with single genetic variation sites. While these methods are usually very fast, they dont fully utilize the information (e.g., linkage disequilibrium or LD) contained in population genetic data. In this paper, we develop a new admixture network inference method called GTmix. Different from existing methods, GTmix works with local gene genealogies that can be inferred from population haplotypes. Local gene genealogies represent the evolutionary history of sampled alleles and contain the LD information. GTmix performs coalescent-based maximum likelihood inference of admixture networks with the inferred genealogies based on the well-known multispecies coalescent (MSC) model. GTmix utilizes various techniques to speed up likelihood computation on the MSC model and optimal network search. Our simulations show that GTmix can infer more accurate admixture networks with much smaller data than existing methods, even when these existing methods are run with much larger data. GTmix is reasonably efficient and can analyze genetic datasets of current interests.",

    "abstract": "One of the most recognisable icon of the Namib Desert is the endemic gymnosperm Welwitschia mirabilis. Recent studies indicated that climate change may seriously affect populations in the northern Namibia subrange (Kunene region) but their extinction risk has not yet been assessed. In this study, we apply IUCN criteria to define the extinction risk of welwitschia populations in northern Namibia and assign them to a red list category. We collected field data in the field to estimate relevant parameters for this assessment. We observed 1330 plants clustered in 12 small and isolated stands. The extent of occurrence has a surface of 214.2 km2 (i.e. < 5000 km2) and the area of occupancy a surface of 56.0 km2 (i.e. < 500 km2). The quality of habitat is expected to face a reduction of 69.47 % (i.e. > 50 %) as a consequence of climate change predicted in the area. These data indicate a very high extinction risk for welwitschia in northern Kunene and classify these populations as endangered (EN) according to IUCN criteria. Similar assessments for other subranges are prevented by the lack of relevant data, an issue that deserves further research attention. Our results advocate the necessity of a management plan for the species, including measures for mitigating the impact of climate change on isolated populations across its fragmented range.",

    "abstract": "Plant protection products, including insecticides, are important for global food production. Historically, research of the adverse effects of insecticides on bees has focused on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), while non-Apis bee species remained understudied. Consequently, sensitivity assessment of insecticides for the majority of bees is lacking, which in turn hinders accurate risk characterization and consequently bee protection. Interspecies sensitivity extrapolation based on body weight offers a potential solution to this problem, but in the past such approaches have often ignored the phylogenetic background and consequently non independence of species used in such models. Using published data on the sensitivity of different bee species to commonly used insecticides, their body weight and phylogenetic background I build interspecies scaling models (ISMs) applying a phylogenetically informed framework. In addition, I compared, the relative sensitivity of the standard test species Apis mellifera to other bee species to evaluate their protectiveness when used as standards screening bee species in the risk assessment process. I found that overall 1) body weight is a predictor of bee sensitivity to insecticides for a range of insecticide classes and 2) A. mellifera is the most sensitive standard test species currently available and consequently a suitable surrogate species for ecotoxicological risk assessment.",

Notably, LmCen-/- is the first genetically engineered gene deleted Leishmania strain that is antibiotic resistant marker free and does not have any off-target mutations. Mice immunized with LmCen-/- had virtually no visible lesions following challenge with L. major-infected sand flies while non-immunized animals developed large and progressive lesions with a 2-log fold higher parasite burden. LmCen-/- immunization showed protection and an immune response comparable to leishmanization. LmCen-/- is safe since it was unable to cause disease even in immunocompromised mice, induces robust host protection against vector sand fly challenge and because it is marker free, can be advanced to human vaccine trials.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated gene expression contributes to most prevalent features in human cancers. Here, we show that most subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) depend on the aberrant assembly of MYB transcriptional co-activator complex. By rapid and selective peptidomimetic interference with the binding of CBP/P300 to MYB, but not CREB or MLL1, we find that the leukemic functions of MYB are mediated by CBP/P300 co-activation of a distinct set of transcription factor complexes. These MYB complexes assemble aberrantly with LYL1, E2A, C/EBP family members, LMO2 and SATB1. They are organized convergently in genetically diverse subtypes of AML, and are at least in part associated with inappropriate transcription factor co-expression. Peptidomimetic remodeling of oncogenic MYB complexes is accompanied by specific proteolysis and dynamic redistribution of CBP/P300 with alternative transcription factors such as RUNX1 to induce myeloid differentiation and apoptosis. Thus, aberrant assembly and sequestration of MYB:CBP/P300 complexes provide a unifying mechanism of oncogenic gene expression in AML. This work establishes a compelling strategy for their pharmacologic reprogramming and therapeutic targeting for diverse leukemias and possibly other human cancers caused by dysregulated gene control.",

    "abstract": "Summary ParagraphThe SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused already over 3.5 million COVID-19 cases and 250,000 deaths globally. There is an urgent need to create novel models to study SARS-CoV-2 using human disease-relevant cells to understand key features of virus biology and facilitate drug screening. As primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory-based, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that could be adapted for drug screens. The lung organoids, particularly aveolar type II cells, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis following SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed a robust induction of chemokines and cytokines with little type I/III interferon signaling, similar to that observed amongst human COVID-19 pulmonary infections. We performed a high throughput screen using hPSC-derived lung organoids and identified FDA-approved drug candidates, including imatinib and mycophenolic acid, as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry. Pre- or post-treatment with these drugs at physiologically relevant levels decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection of hPSC-derived lung organoids. Together, these data demonstrate that hPSC-derived lung cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 can model human COVID-19 disease and provide a valuable resource to screen for FDA-approved drugs that might be repurposed and should be considered for COVID-19 clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases due to coronavirus (CoV) infections have received significant global attention in the past decade and have been linked to bats as the original source. The diversity, distribution, and host associations of bat CoVs were investigated to assess their potential for zoonotic transmission. Phylogenetic, network, and principal coordinate analysis confirmed the classification of betacoronaviruses (BetaCoVs) into five groups (2A to 2E) and a potentially novel group, with further division of 2D into five subgroups. The genetic co-clustering of BetaCoVs among closely related bats reflects host taxon-specificity with each bat family as the host for a specific BetaCoV group, potentially a natural barrier against random transmission. The divergent pathway of BetaCoV and host evolution suggests that the viruses were introduced just prior to bat dispersal and speciation. As such, deviant patterns were observed such as for 2D-IV, wherein cross-taxon transmission due to overlap in bat habitats and geographic range among genetically divergent African bat hosts could have played a strong role on their shared CoV lineages. In fact, a few bat taxa especially the subfamily Pteropodinae were shown to host diverse groups of BetaCoVs. Therefore, ecological imbalances that disturb bat distribution may lead to loss of host specificity through cross-taxon transmission and multi-CoV infection. Hence, initiatives that minimize the destruction of wildlife habitats and limit wildlife-livestock-human interfaces are encouraged to help maintain the natural state of bat BetaCoVs in the wild.\n\nImportanceBat Betacoronaviruses (BetaCoVs) pose a significant threat to global public health and have been implicated in several epidemics such as the recent pandemic by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Here, we show that bat BetaCoVs are predominantly host-specific, which could be a natural barrier against infection of other host types. However, a strong overlap in bat habitat and geographic range may facilitate viral transmission to unrelated hosts, and a few bat families have already been shown to host multi-CoV variants. We predict that continued disturbances on the ecological balance may eventually lead to loss of host specificity. When combined with enhanced wildlife-livestock-human interfaces, spillover to humans may be further facilitated. We should therefore start to define the ecological mechanisms surrounding zoonotic events. Global surveillance should be expanded and strengthened to assess the complete picture of bat coronavirus diversity and distribution and their potential to cause spillover infections.",

    "abstract": "Host proteases have been suggested to be crucial for dissemination of MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, but the relative contribution of membrane versus intracellular proteases remains controversial. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is regarded as one of the main proteases implicated in the coronavirus S protein priming, an important step for binding of the S protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor before cell entry. The main cellular location where the SARS-CoV-2 S protein priming occurs remains debatable, therefore hampering the development of targeted treatments. Herein, we identified the human extracellular serine protease inhibitor (serpin) alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT) as a novel TMPRSS2 inhibitor. Structural modeling revealed that A1AT docked to an extracellular domain of TMPRSS2 in a conformation that is suitable for catalysis, resembling similar serine protease-inhibitor complexes. Inhibitory activity of A1AT was established in a SARS-CoV-2 viral load system. Notably, plasma A1AT levels were associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Our data support the key role of extracellular serine proteases in SARS-CoV-2 infections and indicate that treatment with serpins, particularly the FDA-approved drug A1AT, may be effective in limiting SARS-CoV-2 dissemination by affecting the surface of the host cells.\n\nSummaryDelivery of extracellular serine protease inhibitors (serpins) such as A1AT has the capacity to reduce SARS-CoV-2 dissemination by binding and inhibiting extracellular proteases on the host cells, thus, inhibiting the first step in SARS-CoV-2 cell cycle (i.e. cell entry).",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing global health threat with more than two million infected people since its emergence in late 2019. Detailed knowledge of the molecular biology of the infection is indispensable for understanding of the viral replication, host responses, and disease progression. We provide gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in three human cell lines (H1299, Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells), using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. Small RNA profiling showed strong expression of the immunity and inflammation-associated microRNA miRNA-155 upon infection with both viruses. SARS-CoV-2 elicited approximately two-fold higher stimulation of the interferon response compared to SARS-CoV in the permissive human epithelial cell line Calu-3, and induction of cytokines such as CXCL10 or IL6. Single cell RNA sequencing data showed that canonical interferon stimulated genes such as IFIT2 or OAS2 were broadly induced, whereas interferon beta (IFNB1) and lambda (IFNL1-4) were expressed only in a subset of infected cells. In addition, temporal resolution of transcriptional responses suggested interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) activities precede that of nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B). Lastly, we identified heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) as a protein relevant for the infection. Inhibition of the HSP90 charperone activity by Tanespimycin/17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) resulted in a reduction of viral replication, and of TNF and IL1B mRNA levels. In summary, our study established in vitro cell culture models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and identified HSP90 protein as potential drug target for therapeutic intervention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and currently has detrimental human health, community and economic impacts around the world. It is unclear why some SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals remain asymptomatic, while others develop severe symptoms. Baseline pulmonary levels of anti-viral leukocytes, already residing in the lung prior to infection, may orchestrate an effective early immune response and prevent severe symptoms. Using \"in silico flow cytometry\", we deconvoluted the levels of all seven types of anti-viral leukocytes in 1,927 human lung tissues. Baseline levels of CD8+ T cells, resting NK cells and activated NK cells, as well as cytokines that recruit these, are significantly lower in lung tissues with high expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2. We observe this in univariate analyses, in multivariate analyses, and in two independent datasets. Relevantly, ACE2 mRNA and protein levels very strongly correlate in human cells and tissues. Above findings also largely apply to the SARS-CoV-2 entry protease TMPRSS2. Both SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells and COVID-19 lung tissues show upregulation of CD8+ T cell- and NK cell-recruiting cytokines. Moreover, tissue-resident CD8+ T cells and inflammatory NK cells are significantly more abundant in bronchoalveolar lavages from mildly affected COVID-19 patients, compared to severe cases. This suggests that these lymphocytes are important for preventing severe symptoms. Elevated ACE2 expression increases sensitivity to coronavirus infection. Thus, our results suggest that some individuals may be exceedingly susceptible to develop severe COVID-19 due to concomitant high pre-existing ACE2 and TMPRSS expression and low baseline cytotoxic lymphocyte levels in the lung.",

Some studies have described common modulation and shared genes during stress response to different types of disturbances (termed as perturbome), leading to the idea of central control at the molecular level. We implemented a robust machine learning approach to identify and describe genes associated with multiple perturbations or perturbome in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 model.\n\nUsing microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), we evaluated six approaches to rank and select genes: using two methodologies, data single partition (SP method) or multiple partitions (MP method) for training and testing datasets, we evaluated three classification algorithms (SVM Support Vector Machine, KNN K-Nearest neighbor and RF Random Forest). Gene expression patterns and topological features at the systems level were included to describe the perturbome elements.\n\nWe were able to select and describe 46 core response genes associated with multiple perturbations in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and it can be considered a first report of the P. aeruginosa perturbome. Molecular annotations, patterns in expression levels, and topological features in molecular networks revealed biological functions of biosynthesis, binding, and metabolism, many of them related to DNA damage repair and aerobic respiration in the context of tolerance to stress. We also discuss different issues related to implemented and assessed algorithms, including data partitioning, classification approaches, and metrics. Altogether, this work offers a different and robust framework to select genes using a machine learning approach.",

    "abstract": "Within four months of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, more than 250 nucleotide mutations have been detected in the ORF1 of the virus isolated from different parts of the globe. These observations open up an obvious question about the rate and direction of mutational pressure for further vaccine and therapeutics designing. In this study, we did a comparative analysis of ORF1a and ORF1b by using the first isolate (Wuhan strain) as the parent sequence. We observed that most of the nucleotide mutations are C to U transitions. The rate of synonymous C to U transitions is significantly higher than the rate of nonsynonymous ones, indicating negative selection on amino acid substitutions. Further, trends in nucleotide usage bias have been investigated in 49 coronaviruses species. A strong bias in nucleotide usage in fourfold degenerated sites towards uracil residues is seen in ORF1 of all the studied coronaviruses. A more substantial mutational U pressure is observed in ORF1a than in ORF1b owing to the translation of ORF1ab via programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Unlike other nucleotide mutations, mutational U pressure caused by cytosine deamination, mostly occurring in the RNA-plus strand, cannot be corrected by the proof-reading machinery of coronaviruses. The knowledge generated on the direction of mutational pressure during translation of viral RNA-plus strands has implications for vaccine and nucleoside analogue development for treating covid-19 and other coronavirus infections.",

We determined the SARS-CoV-2 selectome by calculating rates of pervasive and episodic diversifying selection for every amino acid coding position in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. To provide context for evolutionary dynamics of a highly pathogenic betacoronavirus following a zoonotic spillover into human hosts, we also determined the selectomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and performed evolvability calculations for SARS-CoV-2 based on SARS-CoV. These analyses identify the amino acid sites within each coding sequence that have been subjected to pervasive diversifying selection or episodic diversifying selection, and report significantly evolvable sites in the ORF1a polyprotein, the spike protein, and the membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2.

Gel based proteomics approach followed by in gel trypsin digestion and peptide identification by mass spectrometry was used for signature protein identification.\n\nResultsTotal of 18 protein spots with differential expression in TBDM patients in comparison to other groups were identified. These include Vimentin, tubulin beta chain protein, superoxide dismutase, Actin related protein 2/3 complex subunit 2, PDZ LIM domain protein, Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor, Ras related protein Rab, dCTPpyrophosphatase 1, Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 12, coffilin 1, three isoforms of Peptidylprolylcis-trans isomerase A, three isoforms of Protein S100A9, Protein S100A8 and SH3 domain containing protein. These proteins belonged to four functional categories i.e. structural, cell cycle/growth regulation, signaling and intermediary metabolism.\n\nConclusionProteins identified to be differentially expressed in TBDM patient can act as potent biomarkers and as predictors for copathogenesis of tuberculosis and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic is a major human tragedy. Worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 has already infected over 3 million and has killed about 230,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 originated in China and, within three months, has evolved to an additional 10 subtypes. One particular subtype with a non-silent (Aspartate to Glycine) mutation at 614th position of the Spike protein (D614G) rapidly outcompeted other pre-existing subtypes, including the ancestral. We assessed that D614G mutation generates an additional serine protease (Elastase) cleavage site near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We also identified that a single nucleotide deletion (delC) at a known variant site (rs35074065) in a cis-eQTL of TMPRSS2, is extremely rare in East Asians but is common in Europeans and North Americans. The delC allele facilitates entry of the 614G subtype into host cells, thus accelerating the spread of 614G subtype in Europe and North America where the delC allele is common. The delC allele at the cis-eQTL locus rs35074065 of TMPRSS2 leads to overexpression of both TMPRSS2 and a nearby gene MX1. The cis-eQTL site, rs35074065 overlaps with a transcription factor binding site of an activator (IRF1) and a repressor (IRF2). IRF1 activator can bind to variant delC allele, but IRF2 repressor fails to bind. Thus, in an individual carrying the delC allele, there is only activation, but no repression. On viral entry, IRF1 mediated upregulation of MX1 leads to neutrophil infiltration and processing of 614G mutated Spike protein by neutrophil Elastase. The simultaneous processing of 614G spike protein by TMPRSS2 and Elastase serine proteases facilitates the entry of the 614G subtype into host cells. Thus, SARS-CoV-2, particularly the 614G subtype, has spread more easily and with higher frequency to Europe and North America where the delC allele regulating expression of TMPRSS2 and MX1 host proteins is common, but not to East Asia where this allele is rare.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics discovery was a significant breakthrough in the field of therapeutic medicines, but the over (mis)use of such antibiotics (n parallel) caused the increasing number of resistant bacterial species at an ever-higher rate. This study was thus devised to assess the multi-drug resistant bacteria present in sanitation-related facilities in human workplaces. In this regard, samples were collected from different gender, location, and source-based facilities, and subsequent antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed on isolated bacterial strains. Four classes of the most commonly used antibiotics i.e., {beta}-lactam, Aminoglycosides, Macrolides, and Sulphonamides, were evaluated against the isolated bacteria.\n\nThe antibiotic resistance profile of different (70) bacterial strains showed that the antibiotic resistance-based clusters also followed the grouping based on their isolation sources, mainly the gender. Twenty-three bacterial strains were further selected for their 16s rRNA gene based molecular identification and for phylogenetic analysis to evaluate the taxonomic evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Moreover, the bacterial resistance to Sulphonamides and beta lactam was observed to be the most and to Aminoglycosides and macrolides as the least. Plasmid curing was also performed for MDR bacterial strains, which significantly abolished the resistance potential of bacterial strains for different antibiotics. These curing results suggested that the antibiotic resistance determinants in these purified bacterial strains are present on respective plasmids. Altogether, the data suggested that the human workplaces are the hotspot for the prevalence of MDR bacteria and thus may serve the source of horizontal gene transfer and further transmission to other environments.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in CHCHD10, coding for a mitochondrial intermembrane space protein, are a rare cause of autosomal dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutation-specific toxic gain of function or haploinsuffuciency models have been proposed to explain pathogenicity. To decipher the metabolic dysfunction associated with the haploinsufficient p.R15L variant we integrated transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteomic data sets in patient cells subjected to nutrient stress. Patient cells had a complex I deficiency resulting in an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio, downregulation of the TCA cycle, and a reorganization of one carbon metabolism. This led to phosphorylation of AMPK, activation of an endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR), and the production of GDF15 and FGF21, which are markers of mitochondrial disease. The endoplasmic reticulum UPR was mediated through the IRE1/XBP1 pathway, and was accompanied by reduced eIF2alpha phosphorylation, dephosphorylation of both JNK isoforms, and up regulation of several dual specific phosphatases. This study demonstrates that loss of CHCHD10 function elicits a striking energy deficit that activates cellular stress pathways, which may underlie the selective vulnerability of motor neurons.",

    "abstract": "Small proteins shorter than 50 amino acids have been long overlooked. A number of small proteins have been identified in several model bacteria using experimental approaches and assigned important functions in diverse cellular processes. The recent development of ribosome profiling technologies has allowed a genome-wide identification of small proteins and small ORFs (smORFs), but our incomplete understanding of small proteins hinders de novo computational prediction of smORFs in non-model bacterial species. Here, we have identified several sequence features for smORFs by a systematic analysis of all the known small proteins in E. coli, among which the translation initiation rate is the strongest determinant. By integrating these features into a support vector machine learning model, we have developed a novel sPepFinder algorithm that can predict conserved smORFs in bacterial genomes with a high accuracy of 92.8%. De novo prediction in E. coli has revealed several novel smORFs with evidence of translation supported by ribosome profiling. Further application of sPepFinder in 549 bacterial species has led to the identification of > 100,000 novel smORFs, many of which are conserved at the amino acid and nucleotide levels under purifying selection. Overall, we have established sPepFinder as a valuable tool to identify novel smORFs in both model and non-model bacterial organisms, and provided a large resource of small proteins for functional characterizations.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the host cell surface receptor ACE2 is responsible for mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection. By analyzing the spike-hACE2 interacting surface, we predicted many hot spot residues that make major contributions to the binding affinity. Mutations on most of these residues are likely to be deleterious, leading to less infectious virus strains that may suffer from negative selection. Meanwhile, several residues with mostly advantageous mutations have been predicted. It is more probable that mutations on these residues increase the transmission ability of the virus by enhancing spike-hACE2 interaction. So far, only a limited number of mutations has been reported in this region. However, the list of hot spot residues with predicted downstream effects from this study can still serve as a tracking list for SARS-CoV-2 evolution studies. Coincidentally, one advantageous mutation, p.476G>S, started to surge in the last couple of weeks based on the data submitted to the public domain, indicating that virus strains with increased transmission ability may have already spread.",

While cellular studies indicate heme is required for the REV-ERBs to bind the corepressor NCoR and repress transcription, fluorescence-based biochemical assays and crystal structures suggest that heme displaces NCoR. Here, we show that heme artifactually influences detection of NCoR interaction in fluorescence-based assays. However, using fluorescence-independent methods, isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that heme directly increases REV-ERB{beta} ligand-binding domain (LBD) binding affinity for NCoR. We further report two crystal structures of REV-ERB{beta} LBD cobound to heme and NCoR peptides, which reveal the structural basis for heme-dependent NCoR binding to REV-ERB{beta}. By resolving previous contradictory biochemical, structural, and cellular studies, our findings should facilitate renewed progress toward understanding heme-dependent REV-ERB activity.",

We have launched the Provir/Latitude 45 study to identify conserved CTL epitopes in archived HIV-1 DNA according to the HLA class I alleles in aviremic patients under antiretroviral therapy (ART). A HIV-1 polypeptidic therapeutic vaccine based on viral sequence data obtained from circulating blood was proposed; here, our aim was to compare the proviral DNA in blood and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) at two different levels : nucleotide sequences and potential CTL epitopes. The reverse transcriptase was sequenced in both compartments using next generation sequencing (NGS) in samples from nine individuals, two of which had also single genome sequencing (SGS) performed; phylogenetic trees were established and compared; CTL epitopes were also identified according to their potential affinity for the HLA alleles. The proviral sequences of both compartments intra-patient exhibited a very low genetic divergence while it was possible to differentiate the sequences inter-patients; SGS analysis of two couples of samples confirmed that there was not a compartmentalization of the sequences intra-patient.When we simulated the CTL epitopes which can be presented by the corresponding HLA alleles in both compartments, no significant difference was observed. We conclude that the proviral DNA sequences in blood and GALT are similar and that the epitope analysis in blood can be considered as relevant to that observed in the GALT, a hard-to-reach major compartment, and can therefore be used for therapeutic vaccine approaches.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is mediated by multiple pathways, including classical non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ) and several homology-driven repair pathways. This is particularly important for Cas9-mediated genome editing, where the outcome critically depends on the pathway that repairs the break. It is thought that the local chromatin context affects the pathway choice, but the underlying principles are poorly understood. Using a newly developed multiplexed reporter assay in combination with Cas9 cutting, we systematically measured the relative activities of three DSB repair pathways as function of chromatin context in >1,000 genomic locations. This revealed that NHEJ is broadly biased towards euchromatin, while microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) is more efficient in specific heterochromatin contexts. In H3K27me3-marked heterochromatin, inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 shifts the balance towards NHEJ. Single-strand templated repair (SSTR), often used for precise CRISPR editing, competes with MMEJ, and this competition is weakly associated with chromatin context. These results provide insight into the impact of chromatin on DSB repair pathway balance, and guidance for the design of Cas9-mediated genome editing experiments.",

Host defense against IA relies on lung-infiltrating neutrophils and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). Here, we demonstrate that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are prototypically anti-viral cells, participate in innate immune crosstalk underlying mucosal antifungal immunity. Aspergillus-infected murine Mo-DCs and neutrophils recruited pDCs to the lung by releasing the CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL10, in a Dectin-1/Card9- and type I and III interferon-signaling dependent manner, respectively. During aspergillosis, circulating pDCs entered the lung in response to CXCR3-dependent signals. Via targeted pDC ablation, we found that pDCs were essential for host defense in the presence of normal neutrophil and Mo-DC numbers. Although interactions between pDC and fungal cells were not detected, pDCs regulated neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity and conidial killing. Thus, pDCs act as positive feedback amplifiers of neutrophil effector activity against inhaled mold conidia.",

    "abstract": "Yeast genomes can be assembled from sequencing data, but genome integrations and episomal plasmids often fail to be resolved with accuracy, completeness, and contiguity. Resolution of these features is critical for many synthetic biology applications, including strain quality control and identifying engineering in unknown samples. Here, we report an integrated workflow, named Prymetime, that uses sequencing reads from inexpensive NGS platforms, assembly and error correction software, and a list of synthetic biology parts to achieve accurate whole genome sequences of yeasts with engineering annotated. To build the workflow, we first determined which sequencing methods and software packages returned an accurate, complete, and contiguous genome of an engineered S. cerevisiae strain with two similar plasmids and an integrated pathway. We then developed a sequence feature annotation step that labels synthetic biology parts from a standard list of yeast engineering sequences or from a custom sequence list. We validated the workflow by sequencing a collection of 15 engineered yeasts built from different parent S. cerevisiae and nonconventional yeast strains. We show that each integrated pathway and episomal plasmid can be correctly assembled and annotated, even in strains that have part repeats and multiple similar plasmids. Interestingly, Prymetime was able to identify deletions and unintended integrations that were subsequently confirmed by other methods. Furthermore, the whole genomes are accurate, complete, and contiguous. To illustrate this clearly, we used a publicly available S. cerevisiae CEN.PK113 reference genome and the accompanying reads to show that a Prymetime genome assembly is equivalent to the reference using several standard metrics. Finally, we used Prymetime to resequence the nonconventional yeasts Y. lipolytica Po1f and K. phaffii CBS 7435, producing an improved genome assembly for each strain. Thus, our workflow can achieve accurate, complete, and contiguous whole genome sequences of yeast strains before and after engineering. Therefore, Prymetime enables NGS-based strain quality control through assembly and identification of engineering features.",
