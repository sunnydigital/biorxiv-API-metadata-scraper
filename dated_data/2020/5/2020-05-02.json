    "abstract": "Oncogenes or chemotherapy treatments trigger the induction of suppressive pathways such as apoptosis or senescence. Senescence was initially defined as a definitive arrest of cell proliferation but recent results have shown that this mechanism is also associated with cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance. Senescence is therefore much more heterogeneous than initially thought. How this response varies is not really understood, it has been proposed that its outcome relies on the secretome of senescent cells and on the maintenance of their epigenetic marks.\n\nUsing experimental models of senescence escape, we now described that the stability of this suppression relies on specific tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Following chemotherapy treatment, the DNA binding of the type III RNA polymerase was reduced to prevent tRNA transcription and induce a complete cell cycle arrest. By contrast, during senescence escape, specific tRNAs such as tRNA-Leu-CAA and tRNA-Tyr-GTA were up-regulated. Reducing tRNA transcription appears necessary to control the strength of senescence since RNA pol III inhibition through BRF1 depletion maintained senescence and blocked cell persistence. mTOR inhibition also prevented CIS escape in association with a reduction of tRNA-Leu-CAA and tRNA-Tyr-GTA expression. Further confirming the role of the tRNA-Leu-CAA and tRNA-Tyr-GTA, their corresponding tRNA ligases, YARS and LARS, were necessary for senescence escape. This effect was specific since the CARS ligase had no effect on persistence. YARS and LARS inactivation reduced cell emergence and proteomic analysis indicated that this effect was associated with the down-regulation of E2F1 target genes.\n\nOverall, these findings highlight a new regulation of tRNA biology during senescence and suggest that specific tRNAs and ligases contribute to the strength and heterogeneity of this suppression.",

    "abstract": "Platinum resistance is a common occurrence in high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and a major cause of OC deaths. Platinum agents form DNA crosslinks, which activate nucleotide excision repair (NER), fanconi anemia (FA) and homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathways. Chromatin modifications occur in the vicinity of DNA damage and play an integral role in the DNA damage response (DDR). Chromatin modifiers, including polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) members, and chromatin structure are frequently dysregulated in OC and can potentially contribute to platinum resistance. However, the role of chromatin modifiers in the repair of platinum DNA damage in OC is not well understood. We demonstrate that the PRC1 complex member RING1A mediates monoubiquitination of lysine 119 of phosphorylated H2AX ({gamma}H2AXub1) at sites of platinum DNA damage in OC cells. After platinum treatment, our results reveal that NER and HRR both contribute to RING1A localization and {gamma}H2AX monoubiquitination. Importantly, replication protein A (RPA), involved in both NER and HRR, mediates RING1A localization to sites of damage. Furthermore, RING1A deficiency impaired the activation of the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint and reduced the ability of OC cells to repair platinum DNA damage. Elucidating the role of RING1A in the DDR to platinum agents will allow for the identification of therapeutic targets to improve the response of OC to standard chemotherapy regimens.",

    "abstract": "An effective stockpiling method for egg masses of the invasive brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys [St[a]l]; Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) would be useful for rearing and field studies of its egg parasitoid Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae). The current method of stockpiling H. halys egg masses at sub-zero temperatures has lethal and sublethal fitness consequences for T. japonicus. We show that parasitoid emergence from egg masses refrigerated at 8{degrees}C for up to two months before parasitism is higher than from frozen egg masses and usually has minimal or no sublethal fitness effects (sex ratio, development time, activity, fecundity, longevity, and weight) on emerging T. japonicus. Only after two months of host egg refrigeration did the emergence of T. japonicus begin to decrease significantly (by 9.6% relative to untreated viable egg masses), whereas egg masses previously frozen at -80{degrees}C had a 58.8% reduction in parasitoid emergence after 14 days of storage. Refrigerated egg masses that were subsequently exposed to average field temperatures (warm: 22.9{degrees}C; cool: 13.2{degrees}C) were still suitable for T. japonicus parasitism after 7 days, while viable egg masses exposed to warm temperatures for 7 days before parasitism had 24.1% lower parasitoid emergence. Our results demonstrate that refrigeration at 8{degrees}C, while resulting in complete mortality of H. halys embryos after 10 days, are more suitable for T. japonicus parasitism than those stored at sub-zero temperatures. The quantity and quality of H. halys eggs that can be stockpiled with this method could facilitate T. japonicus laboratory colony maintenance, field monitoring, and releases.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization and introgression are common processes among numerous plant species that present both challenges and opportunities for studies of species delimitation, phylogenetics, taxonomy, and adaptation. Rhus integrifolia and R. ovata are two ecologically important shrubs native to the southwestern USA and Mexico, and are known to hybridize frequently, but the morphological, genetic, and ecological implications of hybridization in these species are poorly studied on a broad geographic scale. Analyses were conducted using leaf morphology, genetic variation of plastid and nuclear loci, and species distribution models for both species and their putative hybrid introgressants across 19 localities in California and Arizona, USA. These analyses revealed evidence for morphological and genetic distinction among localities comprising putative parental species, but a high degree of morpho-genetic intermediacy among localities with putative hybrids. Comparison of morphological and genetic population structure among localities revealed evidence for putative local adaptation or widespread phenotypic plasticity. Multiple regression models identified a weak but statistically significant negative association between leaf area and precipitation. Finally, species distribution modeling inferred northward range shifts over time, with both species predicted to occupy more coastal regions in the future, possibly increasing the frequency of hybridization among them. These findings underscore the importance of integrative assessment of multiple data sources in the study of hybridizing species and highlight the Rhus integrifolia-ovata complex as a powerful model for investigating the adaptive implications of hybridization.",

    "abstract": "COCH is the most abundantly expressed gene in the cochlea. Unsurprisingly, mutations in COCH underly deafness in mice and humans. Two forms of deafness are linked to mutations in COCH, the well-established autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, with or without vestibular dysfunction (DFNA9) via a gain-of-function/dominant-negative mechanism, and more recently autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB110) via nonsense variants. Using a combination of targeted gene panels, exome sequencing and functional studies, we identified four novel pathogenic variants (two nonsense variants, one missense and one inframe deletion) in COCH as the cause of autosomal recessive hearing loss in a multi-ethnic cohort. To investigate whether the non-truncating variants exert their effect via a loss-of-function mechanism, we used mini-gene splicing assays. Our data showed both the missense and inframe deletion variants altered RNA-splicing by creating an exon splicing silencer and abolishing an exon splicing enhancer, respectively. Both variants create frameshifts and are predicted to result in a null allele. This study confirms the involvement of loss-of-function mutations in COCH in autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, expands the mutational landscape of DFNB110 to include coding variants that alter RNA-splicing, and highlights the need to investigate the effect of coding variants on RNA-splicing.",

Recently, we found certain grey-value conditions where a weak, illusory motion occurs in the opposite direction. Of the four models for explaining the illusion, one (Backus and Oruc, 2005) also explains the unexpected perceived opposite direction. We here present a simple new model, without free parameters, based on an array of standard correlation-type motion detectors with a subsequent non-linearity (e.g., saturation) before summing the detector outputs. The model predicts (1) the pattern-appearance motion illusion for steady fixation, (2) an illusion under the real-world situation of saccades across or near the pattern (pattern shift), (3) a relative maximum of illusory motion for the same grey values where it is found psychophysically, and (4) the inverse illusion for certain luminance values.

Presently, the scope of the problem is unknown, as these youth may not be reliable reporters on fitness. This issue is compounded by the fact that there have been no investigations that utilized a formal fitness assessment in this critical population. The present study aims to determine the level of fitness in CHR youth with lab-based measures, test how effectively self-report measures characterize objective fitness indices, and explore clinical factors that may be interrupting reliable self-report-an important tool if these interventions are to be taken to scale.\n\nMethodsForty CHR individuals completed an exercise survey and lab-based indices of fitness (i.e., VO2max and BMI). Forty healthy volunteers completed lab indices of fitness and a structured clinical interview ruling out the presence of psychiatric illness.\n\nResultsCHR youth showed greater BMI and lower VO2max compared to healthy volunteers. In the CHR group, abstract self-report items (perceived fitness) did not reflect lab indices of fitness, whereas specific exercise behaviors (intensity of exercise) showed stronger correlations with laboratory-based fitness measurements. Exploratory analyses suggested that positive symptoms involving grandiosity, and negative symptoms such as avolition, correlated with discrepancy between self-perception and laboratory findings of fitness.\n\nDiscussionResults suggest that CHR individuals are less objectively fit than matched controls, and that it will be important to consider unique population characteristics when weighing self-report data.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary liver tumor developing in the wake of chronic liver disease. Chronic liver disease and inflammation leads to a fibrotic environment actively supporting and driving hepatocarcinogenesis. Insight into hepatocarcinogenesis in terms of the interplay between the tumor stroma micro-environment and tumor cells is thus of considerable importance. Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models are proposed as the missing link between current in vitro 2D cell culture models and in vivo animal models. Our aim was to design a novel 3D biomimetic HCC model with accompanying fibrotic stromal compartment and vasculature. Physiologically relevant hydrogels such as collagen and fibrinogen were incorporated to mimicking the bio-physical properties of the tumor ECM. In our model LX2 and HepG2 cells embedded in a hydrogel matrix were seeded onto the inverted insert membrane of a Transwell system. HUVEC cells were then seeded onto the opposite side of the membrane. Three formulations consisting of ECM-hydrogels embedded with cells were prepared and the bio-physical properties determined by rheology. Cell viability was determined by the AlamarBlue(R) assay over 21-days. The effect of the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin was evaluated in both a 2D co-culture and our 3D model for a period of 72h. We show that this model is viable for 25-days and gives rise to metastatic tumor nodules after 17 days in culture. Rheology results show that bio-physical properties of a fibrotic, cirrhotic and HCC liver can be successfully mimicked. Overall, results indicate that this 3D model is more representative of the in vivo situation compared to traditional 2D cultures. Our 3D tumor model showed a decreased response to chemotherapeutics, mimicking drug resistance typically seen in HCC patients. This model could in future provide a valuable new platform to study multifocal HCC or to identify mechanisms that contribute to early stages of metastasis.\n\nSUMMARYA protocol for a novel 3D biomimetic HCC model with accompanying fibrotic stromal compartment and vasculature, to study endocrine and paracrine signaling in liver cancer. The model uses physiological relevant hydrogels in ratios mimicking the bio-physical properties of the stromal extracellular matrix, which is an active mediator of cellular interactions, tumor growth and metastasis.",

We systematically compare the FRR with the DTW in three aspects: 1) basic framework, 2) mathematical properties, and 3) computational efficiency. We show that the FRR has superior performance in all these aspects and the advantages are well illustrated with simulation examples. We then apply the FRR method to two real experimental recordings - one fMRI and one EEG data set. It is found the FRR method properly removes the phase variability in each set.

    "abstract": "T cell entry into inflamed tissue requires firm adhesion, cell spreading, and migration along and through the endothelial wall. These events require the T cell integrins LFA-1 and VLA-4 and their endothelial ligands ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, respectively. T cells migrate against the direction of shear flow on ICAM-1 and with the direction of shear flow on VCAM-1, suggesting that these two ligands trigger distinct cellular responses. However, the contribution of specific signaling events downstream of LFA-1 and VLA-4 has not been explored. Using primary mouse T cells, we found that engagement of LFA-1, but not VLA-4, induces cell shape changes associated with rapid 2D migration. Moreover, LFA-1 ligation results in activation of the PI3K and ERK pathways, and phosphorylation of multiple kinases and adaptor proteins, while VLA-4 ligation triggers only a subset of these signaling events. Importantly, T cells lacking Crk adaptor proteins, key LFA-1 signaling intermediates, or the ubiquitin ligase cCbl, failed to migrate against the direction of shear flow on ICAM-1. These studies identify novel signaling differences downstream of LFA-1 and VLA-4 that drive T cell migratory behavior.\n\nSummary StatementInflammatory responses require leukocyte migration along the vascular wall.

In bone regeneration, crosstalk between macrophages and hMSCs is critical with macrophages playing a key role in the recruitment and differentiation of hMSCs. However, engineered biomaterials able to both direct hMSC fate and modulate macrophage phenotype have not yet been identified. A novel combinatorial chemistry-microtopography screening platform, the ChemoTopoChip, is used to identify materials suitable for bone regeneration by screening with human immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (hiMSCs) and human macrophages. The osteoinduction achieved in hiMSCs cultured on the \"hit\" materials in basal media is comparable to that seen when cells are cultured in osteogenic media, illustrating that these materials offer a materials-induced alternative in bone-regenerative applications. These also exhibit immunomodulatory effects, concurrently polarizing macrophages towards a pro-healing phenotype. Control of cell response is achieved when both chemistry and topography are recruited to instruct the required cell phenotype, combining synergistically. The large library of materials reveals that the relative roles of microtopography and material chemistry are similar, and machine learning identifies key material and topographical features for cell-instruction.",

Because perivascular sensory nerves and their transmitters calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) are important mediators of both vasodilation and inflammatory responses, our objective was to identify IBD-related deficits in perivascular sensory nerve function and vascular neurotransmitter signaling.\n\nApproach and ResultsIn MAs from an IL-10-/- mouse model, we found that IBD significantly impairs EFS-mediated sensory vasodilation and sensory inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstriction, despite decreased sympathetic nerve density and vasoconstriction. The MA content and EFS-mediated release of both CGRP and SP are slightly decreased with IBD, but IBD has different effects on each transmitter. CGRP nerve density, receptor expression, hyperpolarization and vasodilation are preserved with IBD. In contrast, SP nerve density and receptor expression are increased, and SP hyperpolarization and vasodilation are impaired with IBD. A critical finding is that blocking neurokinin 1 (SP) receptors restored EFS-mediated sensory vasodilation and enhanced CGRP-mediated vasodilation in MAs from IBD but not Control mice.\n\nConclusionsAn aberrant role for the perivascular sensory neurotransmitter SP and its downstream signaling in MAs underlies vascular dysfunction with IBD. With IBD, SP signaling impedes CGRP-mediated sensory vasodilation, contributing to impaired blood flow. Substance P and NK1 receptors may represent an important target for treating vascular dysfunction in IBD.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii represents nowadays an important nosocomial pathogen of poorly defined reservoirs outside the clinical setting. Here we conducted whole-genome sequencing analysis of the Acinetobacter sp. NCIMB8209 collection strain, isolated in 1943 from the aerobic degradation (retting) of desert guayule shrubs. NCIMB8209 contained a 3.75 Mb chromosome and a plasmid of 134 kb. Phylogenetic analysis based on core genes indicated NCIMB8209 affiliation to A. baumannii, a result supported by the identification of a chromosomal blaOXA-51-like gene. Seven genomic islands lacking antimicrobial resistance determinants, 5 regions encompassing phage-related genes and, notably, 93 insertion sequences (IS) were found in this genome. NCIMB8209 harbors most genes linked to persistence and virulence described in contemporary A. baumannii clinical strains, but many of them encoding components of surface structures are interrupted by IS. Moreover, defense genetic islands against biological aggressors such as type 6 secretion systems or crispr/cas are absent from this genome. These findings correlate with a low capacity of NCIMB8209 to form biofilm and pellicle, low motility on semisolid medium, and low virulence towards Galleria mellonella and Caenorhabitis elegans. Searching for catabolic genes and concomitant metabolic assays revealed the ability of NCIMB8209 to grow on a wide range of substances produced by plants including aromatic acids and defense compounds against external aggressors. All the above features strongly suggest that NCIMB8209 has evolved specific adaptive features to a particular environmental niche. Moreover, they also revealed that the remarkable genetic plasticity identified in contemporary A. baumannii clinical strains represents an intrinsic characteristic of the species.\n\nIMPORTANCEAcinetobacter baumannii (Ab) is an ESKAPE opportunistic pathogen, with poorly defined natural habitats/reservoirs outside the clinical setting. Ab arose from the Acb complex as the result of a population bottleneck, followed by a recent population expansion from a few clinically-relevant clones endowed with an arsenal of resistance and virulence genes. Still, the identification of virulence traits and the evolutionary paths leading to a pathogenic lifestyle has remained elusive, and thus the study of non-clinical (\"environmental\") Ab isolates is necessary. We conducted here comparative genomic and virulence studies on Ab NCMBI8209 isolated in 1943 from the microbiota responsible of the decomposition of guayule, and therefore well differentiated both temporally and epidemiologically from the nowadays predominant multidrug-resistant strains. Our work provides insights on the adaptive strategies used by Ab to escape from host defenses, and may help the adoption of measures aimed to limit its further dissemination.",

    "abstract": "In the model organism Caulobacter crescentus, a network of two-component systems involving the response regulators CtrA, DivK and PleD coordinate cell cycle progression with differentiation. Active phosphorylated CtrA prevents chromosome replication in G1 cells while simultaneously regulating expression of genes required for morphogenesis and development. At the G1-S transition, phosphorylated DivK (DivK~P) and PleD (PleD~P) accumulate to indirectly inactivate CtrA, which triggers DNA replication initiation and concomitant cellular differentiation. The phosphatase PleC plays a pivotal role in this developmental program by keeping DivK and PleD phosphorylation levels low during G1, thereby preventing premature CtrA inactivation. Here, we describe CckN as a second phosphatase akin to PleC that dephosphorylates DivK~P and PleD~P in G1 cells. However, in contrast to PleC, we do not detect kinase activity with CckN. The effects of CckN inactivation are largely masked when PleC is present, but become evident when PleC and DivJ, the major kinase for DivK and PleD, are absent. Accordingly, mild overexpression of cckN restores most phenotypic defects of a pleC null mutant. We also show that CckN and PleC are proteolytically degraded in a ClpXP-dependent way well before the onset of the S phase. Surprisingly, known ClpX adaptors are dispensable for PleC and CckN proteolysis, suggesting the existence of adaptors specifically involved in proteolytic removal of cell cycle regulators. Since cckN expression is induced in stationary phase, depending on the stress alarmone (p)ppGpp, we propose that CckN acts as an auxiliary factor responding to environmental stimuli to modulate CtrA activity under suboptimal conditions.\n\nImportanceTwo-component signal transduction systems are widely used by bacteria to sense environmental signals and respond accordingly by modulating various cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression. In Caulobacter crescentus, PleC acts as a phosphatase that indirectly protects the response regulator CtrA from premature inactivation during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Here, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that PleC is seconded by another phosphatase, CckN. The activity of PleC and CckN phosphatases is restricted to G1 phase since both proteins are timely degraded by proteolysis just before the G1-S transition. This degradation requires new proteolytic adaptors as well as an unsuspected N-terminal motif for CckN. Our work illustrates a typical example of redundant functions between two-component proteins.",

Among Bt bioinsecticides, those based on the strain Bt var. kurstaki (Btk) are widely used in farming to specifically control pest lepidopteran larvae. Although there is much evidence of the lack of acute lethality of Btk products for non-target animals, only scarce data are available on their potential non-lethal developmental adverse effects. Using doses that could be reached in the field upon sprayings, we have shown that Btk products impair growth and developmental time of the non-target dipteran Drosophila melanogaster. These effects are mediated by the synergy between Btk bacteria and Btk insecticidal toxins, which induces a significant apoptosis of larval enterocytes, resulting in a decreased intestinal capacity to digest proteins. The harmful effects can be mitigated by a protein-rich diet or by adding the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum into the food. Finally, we showed that the larval midgut maintain its integrity upon Btk aggression thanks to both the flattening of surviving enterocytes and the generation of new immature cells arising from the adult midgut precursor cells.",

    "abstract": "The Zika virus (ZIKV) was responsible for a recent debilitating epidemic that till date has no cure. A potential way to reduce ZIKV virulence is to limit the action of the non-structural proteins involved in its viral replication. One such protein, NS1, encoded as a monomer by the viral genome, plays a major role via symmetric oligomerization. We examine the homodimeric structure of the dominant {beta}-ladder segment of NS1 with extensive all atom molecular dynamics. We find it stably bounded by two spatially separated interaction clusters (C1 and C2) with significant differences in the nature of their interactions. Four pairs of distal, intra-monomeric disulfide bonds are found to be coupled to the stability, local structure, and wettability of the interfacial region. Symmetric reduction of the intra-monomeric disulfides triggers marked dynamical heterogeneity, interfacial wettability and asymmetric salt bridging propensity. Harnessing the model-free Lipari-Szabo based formalism for estimation of conformational entropy (Sconf), we find clear signatures of heterogeneity in the monomeric conformational entropies. The observed asymmetry, very small in the unperturbed state, expands significantly in the reduced states. This allosteric effect is most noticeable in the electrostatically bound C2 cluster that underlies the greatest stability in the unperturbed state. Allosteric induction of conformational and thermodynamic asymmetry is expected to affect the pathways leading to symmetric higher ordered oligomerization, and thereby affect crucial replication pathways.\n\nStatement of significanceControlling viral pathogenesis remains a challenge in the face of modern-day epidemics. Though cumbersome and fraught with misleads, most therapeutic endeavors lean towards the design of drug molecules targeting specific proteins involved in viral pathogenesis. This work demonstrates an alternative approach, namely the usage of allosteric intervention to disrupt the binding integrity of the primary domain of the non-structural NS1 protein dimer crucially important in ZIKV virulence. The intervention, triggered by symmetric reduction of the internal monomeric disulfide bonds, results in weakening and distortion of the distal binding interfaces. It further introduces marked structural and entropic asymmetry within the homooligomeric unit, precluding the formation of higher ordered oligomers of high symmetry. The results have important ramifications for consolidated efforts at limiting ZIKV virulence.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe increasing availability of microbial genomes and environmental shotgun metagenomes provides unprecedented access to the genomic differences within related bacteria. The human oral microbiome with its diverse habitats and abundant, relatively well-characterized microbial inhabitants presents an opportunity to investigate bacterial population structures at an ecosystem scale.\n\nResultsHere, we employ a metapangenomic approach that combines public genomes with Human Microbiome Project (HMP) metagenomes to study the diversity of microbial residents of three oral habitats: tongue dorsum, buccal mucosa, and supragingival plaque. For two exemplar taxa, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and the genus Rothia, metapangenomes revealed distinct genomic groups based on shared genome content. H. parainfluenzae genomes separated into three distinct subgroups with differential abundance between oral habitats. Functional enrichment analyses identified an operon encoding oxaloacetate decarboxylase as diagnostic for the tongue-abundant subgroup. For the genus Rothia, grouping by shared genome content recapitulated species-level taxonomy and habitat preferences. However, while most R. mucilaginosa were restricted to the tongue as expected, two genomes represented a cryptic population of R. mucilaginosa in many buccal mucosa samples. For both H. parainfluenzae and the genus Rothia, we identified not only limitations in the ability of cultivated organisms to represent populations in their native environment, but also specifically which cultivar gene sequences were absent or ubiquitous.\n\nConclusionsOur findings provide insights into population structure and biogeography in the mouth and form specific hypotheses about habitat adaptation. These results illustrate the power of combining metagenomes and pangenomes to investigate the ecology and evolution of bacteria across analytical scales.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has created the need for development of new therapeutic strategies. Understanding the mode of viral attachment, entry and replication has become a key aspect of such interventions. The coronavirus surface features a trimeric spike (S) protein that is essential for viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for entry. Herein, we describe glycomic and glycoproteomic analysis of hACE2 expressed in HEK293 human cells. We observed high glycan occupancy (73.2 to 100%) at all seven possible N-glycosylation sites and surprisingly detected one novel O-glycosylation site. To deduce the detailed structure of glycan epitopes on hACE2 that may be involved in viral binding, we have characterized the terminal sialic acid linkages, the presence of bisecting GlcNAc, and the pattern of N-glycan fucosylation. We have conducted extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide and glycan spectrum, in addition to using bioinformatics tools to validate the hACE2 glycosylation. Our elucidation of the site-specific glycosylation and its terminal orientations on the hACE2 receptor, along with the modeling of hACE2 glycosylation sites can aid in understanding the intriguing virus-receptor interactions and assist in the development of novel therapeutics to prevent viral entry. The relevance of studying the role of ACE2 is further increased due to some recent reports about the varying ACE2 dependent complications with regard to age, sex, race, and pre-existing conditions of COVID-19 patients.",

Nonetheless, little effort has been dedicated to investigating the functional relevance of particular splicing events, even those in the key developmental and hormonal regulators. Here we reveal, in the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana, that the PIN7 gene, which encodes a polarly localized transporter for the phytohormone auxin, produces two evolutionary-conserved transcripts. These isoforms PIN7a and PIN7b, differing in a 4 amino acid motif, are present at nearly equal levels in most cells. Although both variants do not differ in the subcellular localization and transport auxin with similar capacity, they closely associate and mutually influence their stability within the plasma membrane. Phenotypic complementation tests reveal that the functional contribution of PIN7b per se is minor but it markedly attenuates the prominent PIN7a activity, which is required for correct seedling apical hook formation and auxin-mediated tropic responses. These results establish alternative splicing of the PIN family as a conserved, functionally-relevant mechanism, unveiling an additional regulatory level of auxin-mediated plant development.",

    "abstract": "Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) was introduced a decade ago as a method to monitor alpha-synuclein (-syn) oligomerization in intact cells. Since then, several -syn BiFC cellular assays and animal models have been developed based on the assumption that an increase in the fluorescent signal correlates with increased -syn oligomerization or aggregation. Despite the increasing use of these assays and models in mechanistic studies, target validation and drug screening, there have been no reports that 1) validate the extent to which the BiFC fluorescent signal correlates with -syn oligomerization at the biochemical level; 2) provide a structural characterization of the oligomers and aggregates formed by the BiFC fragments; or 3) investigate the extent to which the oligomers of the fluorescent complex resemble oligomers formed on the pathway to -syn fibrillization. To address this knowledge gap, we first analysed the expression level and oligomerization properties of the individual constituents of -syn-Venus, one of the most commonly used BiFC systems, in HEK-293 & SH-SY5Y cells from three different laboratories using multiple approaches, including size exclusion chromatography, semiquantitative Western blot analysis, in-cell crosslinking, immunocytochemistry and sedimentation assays. Next, we investigated the biochemical and aggregation properties of -syn upon co-expression of both BiFC fragments. Our results show that 1) the C-terminal-Venus fused to -syn (-syn-Vc) is present in much lower abundance than its counterpart with N-terminal-Venus fused to -syn (Vn--syn) ; 2) Vn--syn exhibits a high propensity to form oligomers and higher-order aggregates; and 3) the expression of either or both fragments does not result in the formation of -syn fibrils or cellular inclusions. Furthermore, our results suggest that only a small fraction of Vn--syn is involved in the formation of the fluorescent BiFC complex and that some of the fluorescent signal may arise from the association or entrapment of -syn-Vc in Vn--syn aggregates. The fact that the N-terminal fragment exists predominantly in an aggregated state also indicates that one must exercise caution when using this system to investigate -syn oligomerization in cells or in vivo. Altogether, our results suggest that cellular and animal models of oligomerization, aggregation and cell-to-cell transmission that are based on the -syn BiFC systems should be thoroughly characterized at the biochemical level to ensure that they reproduce the process of interest and measure what they are intended to measure.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/074161v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fe4896org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4f912forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c4e157org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a648e6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) was introduced a decade ago to monitor alpha-synuclein oligomerization in intact cells, based on the assumption that an increase in the fluorescent signal correlates with -synuclein oligomerization and aggregation. Herein, we used several biochemical and cellular assays to characterize commonly used -synuclein Venus BiFC assays. Our results show that one of the BiFC fragments (Vn--synuclein) exhibits higher expression levels and aggregation propensity than its counterpart (-synuclein-Vc), thus complicating the interpretation of the molecular interactions that give rise to the fluorescence signal and raise concerns about their application to investigate -syn oligomerization in cells or in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Summary ParagraphThe current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There are currently no therapeutic options for mitigating this disease due to lack of a vaccine and limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 biology. As a result, there is an urgent need to create new disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 biology and to screen for therapeutics using human disease-relevant tissues. COVID-19 patients typically present with respiratory symptoms including cough, dyspnea, and respiratory distress, but nearly 25% of patients have gastrointestinal indications including anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Moreover, these symptoms are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes1. Here, we report using human pluripotent stem cell-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the permissiveness of colonic cell types to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single cell RNA-seq and immunostaining showed that the putative viral entry receptor ACE2 is expressed in multiple hESC-derived colonic cell types, but highly enriched in enterocytes. Multiple cell types in the COs can be infected by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus, which was further validated in vivo using a humanized mouse model. We used hPSC-derived COs in a high throughput platform to screen 1280 FDA-approved drugs against viral infection. Mycophenolic acid and quinacrine dihydrochloride were found to block the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus in COs both in vitro and in vivo, and confirmed to block infection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study established both in vitro and in vivo organoid models to investigate infection of SARS-CoV-2 disease-relevant human colonic cell types and identified drugs that blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection, suitable for rapid clinical testing.",

Here we report the rapid adaption of SARS-CoV-2 in BALB/c mice, based on which a convenient, economical and effective animal model was developed. Specifically, we found that mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 at passage 6 (MACSp6) efficiently infected both aged and young wild-type BALB/c mice, resulting in moderate pneumonia as well as inflammatory responses. The elevated infectivity of MACSp6 in mice could be attributed to the substitution of a key residue (N501Y) in the receptorbinding domain (RBD). Using this novel animal model, we further evaluated the in vivo protective efficacy of an RBD-based SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine, which elicited highly potent neutralizing antibodies and conferred full protection against SARS-CoV-2 MACSp6 challenge. This novel mouse model is convenient and effective in evaluating the in vivo protective efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\nSummaryThis study describes a unique mouse model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and confirms protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 RBD subunit vaccine.",

    "abstract": "In response to the ongoing global pandemic, progress has been made in understanding the molecular-level host interactions of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19. However, when the virus enters the body it interacts not only with the host but also with the micro-organisms already inhabiting the host. Understanding the virus-host-microbiome interactions can yield additional insights into the biological processes perturbed by viral invasion. With this aim we carry out a functional analysis of previously published RNA sequencing data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from eight COVID-19 patients, twenty-five community-acquired pneumonia patients, and twenty healthy controls. The resulting microbiome functional profiles and their top differentiating features clearly separate the cohorts. By examining the functional features in connection with their associated metabolic pathways, differentially abundant pathways are indicated, compared to both the community-acquired pneumonia and healthy cohorts. From this analysis, distinguishing signatures in COVID-19 respiratory tract microbiomes are identified, including decreased lipid and glycan metabolism pathways, and increased carbohydrate metabolism pathways. Here we present a framework for comparative functional analysis of microbiomes, the results from which can lead to new hypotheses on the host-microbiome interactions in healthy versus afflicted cohorts. The findings from this analysis call for further research on microbial functions and host-microbiome interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Neutrophil activation seems to be crucial in the initiation and perpetuation of this exacerbated lung inflammation. However, the precise mechanisms by which this activation occurs remain yet elusive. To this end, this in silico study tried to identify potential proinflammatory inducing peptides (PIPs) produced by the action of the elastase released in neutrophil-extracellular traps over SARS-CoV-2 particles. We found nine potential PIPs exclusive from the SARS-CoV-2, showing homology against T cell recognition epitopes. Moreover, 78 percent of these exclusive PIPs were found produced by the enzymatic cleavage on the spike glycoproteins, suggesting that high PIP concentrations might be released following SARS-CoV-2 huge replication rate.

As no effective antiviral treatment is currently available, new drugs are urgently needed. We employed transcriptional analysis to uncover potential antiviral drugs from natural products or FDA approved drugs. We found liquiritin significantly inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells with EC50 = 2.39 M. Mechanistically, we found liquiritin exerts anti-viral function by mimicking type I interferon. Upregulated genes induced by liquiritin are enriched in GO categories including type I interferon signaling pathway, negative regulation of viral genome replication and etc. In toxicity experiment, no death was observed when treated at dose of 300 mg/kg for a week in ICR mice. All the organ indexes but liver and serum biochemical indexes were normal after treatment. Liquiritin is abundant in licorice tablet (~0.2% by mass), a traditional Chinese medicine. Together, we recommend liquiritin as a competitive candidate for treating COVID-19.

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions between virus and host are crucial for infection. SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic is an RNA virus prone to mutations. Formation of a stable binding interface between the Spike (S) protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) of host actuates viral entry. Yet, how this binding interface evolves as virus acquires mutations during pandemic remains elusive. Here, using a high fidelity bioinformatics pipeline, we analysed 31,403 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the globe, and identified 444 non-synonymous mutations that cause 49 distinct amino acid substitutions in the RBD. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested independent emergence of these RBD mutants during pandemic. In silico structure modelling of interfaces induced by mutations on residues which directly engage ACE2 or lie in the near vicinity revealed molecular rearrangements and binding energies unique to each RBD mutant. Comparative structure analysis using binding interface from mouse that prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry uncovered minimal molecular determinants in RBD necessary for the formation of stable interface. We identified that interfacial interaction involving amino acid residues N487 and G496 on either ends of the binding scaffold are indispensable to anchor RBD and are well conserved in all SARS-like corona viruses. All other interactions appear to be required to locally remodel binding interface with varying affinities and thus may decide extent of viral transmission and disease outcome. Together, our findings propose the modalities and variations in RBD-ACE2 interface formation exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for endurance.\n\nImportanceCOVID-19, so far the worst hit pandemic to mankind, started in January 2020 and is still prevailing globally. Our study identified key molecular arrangements in RBD-ACE2 interface that help virus to tolerate mutations and prevail. In addition, RBD mutations identified in this study can serve as a molecular directory for experimental biologists to perform functional validation experiments. The minimal molecular requirements for the formation of RBD-ACE2 interface predicted using in silico structure models may help precisely design neutralizing antibodies, vaccines and therapeutics. Our study also proposes the significance of understanding evolution of protein interfaces during pandemic.",

Such spatial organization may be achieved via reaction-diffusion or directional cargo transport, as prominently executed by motor proteins. In contrast to these processes that rely on specific protein interactions, active transport based on a non-specific, purely physical mechanism remains poorly explored. Here, by a joint experimental and theoretical approach, we describe a hidden function of the MinDE protein system from E. coli: Besides forming dynamic patterns, this system accomplishes the active transport of large, functionally unrelated cargo on membranes in vitro. Remarkably, this mechanism allows to sort diffusive objects according to their effective size, as evidenced using modular DNA origami-streptavidin nanostructures. We show that the diffusive fluxes of MinDE and cargo couple via density-dependent friction. This non-specific process constitutes a Maxwell-Stefan diffusiophoresis, so far undescribed in a biologically relevant setting.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a numerical model to investigate the deformation of biological cells by applying external electric fields operating at or near cell resonant frequencies. Cells are represented as pseudo solids with high viscosity suspended in liquid media. The electric field source is an atmospheric plasma jet developed inhouse, for which the emitted energy distribution has been measured.\n\nViscoelastic response is resolved in the entire cell structure by solving a deformation matrix assuming an isotropic material with a prescribed modulus of elasticity. To investigate cell deformation at resonant frequencies, one mode of natural cell oscillation is considered in which the cell membrane is made to radially move about its eigenfrequency. An electromagnetic wave source interacts with the cell and induces oscillation and viscoelastic response. The source carries energy in the form of a distribution function which couples a range of oscillating frequencies with electric field amplitude.\n\nResults show that cell response may be increased by the external electric field operating at or near resonance. In the elastic regime, response increases until a steady threshold value, and the structure moves as a damped oscillator. Generally, this response is a function of both frequency and magnitude of the source, with a maximum effect found at resonance. To understand the full effect of the source energy spectrum, the system is solved by considering five frequency-amplitude couplings. Results show that the total solution is a nonlinear combination of the individual solutions. Additionally, sources with different signal phases are simulated to determine the effect of initial conditions on the evolution of the system, and the result suggests that there may be multiple solutions within the same order of magnitude for elastic response and velocity. Cell rupture from electric stress may occur during application given a high energy source.\n\nSignificanceCold atmospheric plasma jets (CAPJs) have been widely researched for their potential applications in cancer therapy. Existing research has focused mainly on the ability of CAPJs to deliver a mixture of reactive species which can be absorbed by cancer cells and induce cell death. The objective of our study is to investigate the mechanical effect of CAPJ electromagnetic (EM) waves on interacting cells. By coupling the EM waves associated with plasma frequency and cell viscoelastic response, we have developed a numerical tool to investigate cell damage either by mechanical or thermal loads. This work is motivated by the promise of EM waves to function as a sensitizing agent for cancer cells in preparation for chemotherapy.",

It was optimized for low production cost, simplicity, low power consumption, design flexibility, consistent, and controllable growth light intensity.\n\nThe illuminated orbital shaker is especially well suited for low-resource research laboratories and education. It is an alternative to commercial instruments for microalgae cultivation. It improves on typical do-it-yourself microalgae growth systems by offering consistent and well characterized illumination light intensity. The illuminated growth area is 20 cm x 15 cm, which is suitable for three T75 tissue culture flasks or six 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The photosynthetic photon flux density, is variable in eight steps (26 - 800 mol {middle dot} m-2 {middle dot} s-1) and programmable in a 24-hour light/dark cycle. The agitation speed is variable (0 - 210 RPM). The overall material cost is around {pound}300, including an entry-level orbital shaker. The build takes two days, requiring electronics and mechanical assembly capabilities. The instrument build is documented in a set of open-source protocols, design files, and source code. The design can be readily modified, scaled, and adapted for other orbital shakers and specific experimental requirements.\n\nThe instrument function was validated by growing fresh-water microalgae Desmodesmus quadricauda and Chlorella vulgaris. The cultivation protocols, microalgae growth curves, and doubling times are included in this report.\n\nSpecifications table\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@23c347org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e96f84org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@985cb5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ee9a76org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dee9ab_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL",

    "abstract": "Human cerebellar development occurs late in gestation and is hindered by preterm birth. The fetal development of Purkinje cells, the primary output cells of the cerebellar cortex, is crucial for the structure and function of the cerebellum. However, morphological and electrophysiological features in Purkinje cells at different gestational ages, and the effects of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) experience on cerebellar development are unexplored. Utilizing non-human primate baboon cerebellum, we investigated Purkinje cell development during the last trimester of pregnancy and the effect of NICU experience following premature birth on developmental features of Purkinje cells. Immunostaining and whole-cell patch clamp recordings of Purkinje cells in the baboon cerebellum at different gestational ages revealed that molecular layer width, driven by Purkinje dendrite extension, drastically increased and refinement of action potential waveform properties occurred throughout the last trimester of pregnancy. Preterm birth followed by NICU experience for 2 weeks impeded development of Purkinje cells, including action potential waveform properties, synaptic input, and dendrite extension compared with age-matched controls. In addition, these alterations impact Purkinje cell output, reducing the spontaneous firing frequency in deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) neurons. Taken together, primate cerebellum undergoes developmental refinements during late gestation, and NICU experience following preterm birth alters morphological and physiological features in the cerebellum that can lead to functional deficits.\n\nSummary StatementBaboon cerebellum undergoes developmental refinements during late gestation, and NICU experience following preterm birth impacts cellular development in the cerebellum that can lead to functional deficits.",

    "abstract": "Next Generation Sequencing has been applied in many areas of biology, including quantification of gene expression, Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), gene finding, Motif discovery and much more. Due to the vast area of application and importance in key findings in the field, massive genomic data is being generated using high throughput sequencing. Therefore, sequencing quality also needs to be evaluated in light of different applications. In order to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, we need to accurately characterize and identify sequencing errors and distinguish these errors from their true genetic variant in sequencing, i.e. misreads follow a binomial distribution and it further can be approximated to the Poisson process for longer sequences. However, the insertion and deletion rates are 1000 times lower than substitution error rates and, therefore, less significant. The model assumes that error arrival at a position is not dependent on an error at other positions. Furthermore, errors in sequences can cause an error in studies based on multiple sequences and they also follow Binomial - Poisson Distribution (for example - Alignment is a merging of two Binomial processes for short sequences and it further can be approximated to Poisson for long sequences (for example - genomic sequence). It provides a systematic way to evaluate the accuracy in sequencing-based applications. Many error suppressing algorithms or techniques are there, and our Binomial Poisson model can provide a further systematic understanding of error behavior in short sequences so that more techniques for error removal can be developed with much efficient suppression rates.",

    "abstract": "T-cell receptor stimulation induces the convergence of multivesicular bodies towards the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and the polarization of the MTOC to the immune synapse (IS). These events lead to exosome secretion at the IS. We describe here that upon IS formation centrosomal area F-actin decreased concomitantly with MTOC polarization to the IS. PKC{delta}-interfered T cell clones showed a sustained level of centrosomal area F-actin associated with defective MTOC polarization. We analysed the contribution of two actin cytoskeleton-regulatory proteins, FMNL1 and paxillin, to the regulation of cortical and centrosomal F-actin networks. FMNL1{beta} phosphorylation and F-actin reorganization at the IS were inhibited in PKC{delta}-interfered clones. F-actin depletion at the central region of the IS, a requirement for MTOC polarization, was associated with FMNL1{beta} phosphorylation at its C-terminal, autoregulatory region. Interfering all FMNL1 isoforms prevented MTOC polarization; nonetheless, FMNL1{beta} re-expression restored MTOC polarization in a centrosomal area F-actin reorganization-independent manner. Moreover, PKC{delta}-interfered clones exhibited decreased paxillin phosphorylation at the MTOC, which suggests an alternative actin cytoskeleton regulatory pathway. Our results infer that PKC{delta} regulates MTOC polarization and secretory traffic leading to exosome secretion in a coordinated manner by means of two distinct pathways, one involving FMNL1{beta} regulation and controlling F-actin reorganization at the IS, and the other, comprising paxillin phosphorylation potentially controlling centrosomal area F-actin reorganization.",

The SCV was auxotrophic for hemin and had impaired biofilm formation compared to the ancestral isolates. A single novel nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in hemA, which encodes a glutamyl-tRNA reductase responsible for the initial step of porphyrin biosynthesis leading to the production of haem, was responsible for the SCV phenotype. We showed this phenotype was stable over multiple generations and the SNP in hemA resulted in a significant fitness cost to the isolate which persisted even in the presence of hemin. As hemA is not found in mammalian cells, and disruption of the gene results in impaired biofilm formation and a significant fitness cost, it represents a potential target for novel drug development specifically for the treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infections caused by biofilm-producing E. coli.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOsteoarthritis remains one of the greatest causes of morbidity and mortality in the equine population. The inability to detect pre-clinical changes in osteoarthritis has been a significant impediment to the development of effective therapies against this disease. Synovial fluid represents a potential source of disease-specific small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) that could aid in the understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. We hypothesised that early stages of osteoarthritis would alter the expression of sncRNAs, facilitating the understanding of the underlying pathogenesis and potentially provide early biomarkers.\n\nMethodsSmall RNA sequencing was performed using synovial fluid from the metacarpophalangeal joints of both control and early osteoarthritic non-Thoroughbred horses. A group of differentially expressed sncRNAs was selected for further validation through qRT-PCR using an independent cohort of synovial fluid samples from control and early osteoarthritic horses. Bioinformatic analysis was performed in order to identify putative targets of the differentially expressed microRNAs and to explore potential associations with specific biological processes.\n\nResultsResults revealed 22 differentially expressed sncRNAs including 13 microRNAs; miR-10a, miR-223, let7a, miR-99a, miR-23b, miR-378, miR-143 (and six novel microRNAs), four small nuclear RNAs; U2, U5, U11, U12, three small nucleolar RNAs; U13, snoR38, snord96, and one small cajal body-specific RNA; scarna3. Five sncRNAs were validated; miR-223 was significantly reduced in early OA and miR-23b, let-7a-2, snord96A and snord13 were significantly upregulated. Significant cellular functions deduced by the differentially expressed microRNAs included apoptosis (P < 0.0003), necrosis (P < 0.0009), autophagy (P < 0.0007) and inflammation (P < 0.00001). A conservatively filtered list of 57 messenger RNA targets was obtained; the top biological processes associated were regulation of cell population proliferation (P < 0.000001), cellular response to chemical stimulus (P < 0.000001) and cell surface receptor signalling pathway (P < 0.000001).\n\nConclusionsSynovial fluid sncRNAs can be used as molecular biomarkers for early disease in equine osteoarthritic joints. The biological processes they regulate may play an important role in understanding early osteoarthritis pathogenesis. Characterising these dynamic molecular changes could provide novel insights on the process and mechanism of early osteoarthritis development and is critical for the development of new therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Phytophthora melonis is the causal agent of damping-off or crown rot, one of the most destructive cucumber diseases that causes severe economic losses in Iran and some other parts of the world. Despite intense research efforts made in the past years, no permanent cure currently exists for this disease. With the aim to understand the molecular mechanisms of defense against P. melonis, root collars and leaves of four cucumber genotypes consisting of resistant Ramezz; moderately resistant Baby and very susceptible Mini 6-23 and Extrem, were monitored for quantitative gene expression analysis of five antifungal and/or anti-oomycete genes (CsWRKY20, CsLecRK6.1, PR3, PR1-1a and LOX1) at three points after inoculation with P. melonis. The gene expression analysis indicated that P. melonis strongly enhanced the expression of these genes after inoculation in both leaves and root collars. Further, not only the transcript levels of these genes were significantly higher in the resistant and moderately resistance genotypes, but also the time point of the highest relative expression ratio for the five genes was different in the four cucumber genotypes. CsWRKY20 and PR3 showed the maximum expression in Ramezz at 48 hours post inoculation (hpi) while CsLecRK6.1, and LOX1 showed the highest expression at 72 hpi. In addition, PR1-1a showed the maximum expression in the Baby at 72 hpi. Root collars responded faster than leaves and some responses were more strongly up-regulated in root collars than in leaves. The genes found to be involved in disease resistance in two different organs of cucumber after pathogen infection. The results suggest that increased expression of these genes led to activation of defense pathways and could be responsible for a reduced P. melonis colonization capacity in Ramezz and Baby. Overall, this work represents a valuable resource for future functional genomics studies to unravel the molecular mechanisms of C. sativus- P. melonis interaction.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) can be found in the free-floating extracellular DNA (eDNA) fraction of microbial systems. These xenogenic components can generate bacterial cells resistant to one or more antibiotics by natural transformation. Because of low concentration in wastewater, the obtaining of a high quality and a high yield of eDNA extract is challenging. We developed a method using chromatography to isolate eDNA without causing cell lysis (often unchecked) from complex wastewater matrices. The chromatographic step involved a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose-monolithic column to capture the eDNA found in cell-free filtered wastewater samples (e.g. influent wastewater, activated sludge and treated effluent wastewaster). Free-floating eDNA yields from 1 L of influent, activated sludge and treated effluent water reached 12.5 {+/-} 1.9 g, 12.3 {+/-} 1 g and 5.6 {+/-} 2.9 g of raw eDNA and 9.0 {+/-} 0.7 g, 5.6 {+/-} 0.46 g and 2.6 {+/-} 1.3 g of purified eDNA, respectively. In order to check the suitability of free-floating eDNA extracts for molecular analysis, qPCR and metagenomics were performed. eDNA extracts from treated effluent water were analyzed by qPCR to quantify a selected panel of ARGs and MGEs. Microbiome, resistome, and mobilome profiles from activated sludge free-floating eDNA were measured by metagenomic sequencing. Between iDNA and eDNA fractions, qPCR showed differences of 0.94, 1.11, 1.92 and 1.32 log10 gene copies mL-1 for sulfonamides resistant genes (sul1 and sul2), {beta}-lactamase resistance gene blaCTXM, and the class 1 integron-integrase (intI1) MGE, respectively. These differences highlighted the crucial need for an isolation method to discern both iDNA and eDNA to understand ARGs persistence and quantity in complex cultures. The eDNA yields obtained from 1 L of activated sludge (3.6 g of total suspended solids L-1) samples were substantially higher than the amount of DNA template needed for high-throughput sequencing (>1 g) in service facilities. Subsystems classification showed that the eDNA metagenome was mainly composed by MGEs (65.1%). The 35.9% rest related to traditional functional genetic signatures. It was the first time the resistome from the eDNA fraction was analyzed showing lower number of primary aligned reads when compared to the iDNA and a predominance of aminoglycosides and {beta}-lactamams. Metagenome results showed that eDNA can not be discarded as a pool of ARGs and MGEs for horizontal gene transfer. This novel isolation method was powerful to elucidate the molecular compositions of free-floating eDNA fractions in complex environmental samples such as wastewater environments at different microbial densities. Data obtained using this extraction method will foster xenogenic and microbial risk assessments across urban and natural water systems. This will support water authorities in the delineation of measures to adopt at wastewater treatment plants to remove them and safeguard environmental and public health.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/072397v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1905305org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3a774borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6e1262org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@790c42_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Picture created with BioRender\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the LRRK2 gene have been widely linked to Parkinsons disease. The G2019S variant has been shown to contribute uniquely to both familial and sporadic forms of the disease. LRRK2-related mutations have been extensively studied, yet the wide variety of cellular and network events directly or indirectly related to these mutations remain poorly understood. In this study, we structured multi-nodal human neural networks carrying the G2019S mutation using custom-designed microfluidic chips coupled to microelectrode-arrays. By applying live imaging approaches, immunocytochemistry and computational modelling, we have revealed alterations in both the structure and function of the resulting neural networks when compared to controls. We provide first evidence of increased neuritic density associated with the G2019S LRRK2 mutation, while previous studies have found either a strong decrease, or no change, compared to controls. Additionally, we corroborate previous findings regarding increased baseline network activity compared to control neural networks. Furthermore, we can reveal additional network alterations attributable to the specific mutation by selectively inducing transient overexcitation to confined parts of the structured multi-nodal networks. These alterations, which we were able to capture both at the micro- and mesoscale manifested as differences in relative network activity and correlation, as well as in mitochondria activation, neuritic remodelling, and synaptic alterations. Our study thus provides important new insights into early signs of neural network pathology significantly expanding upon the current knowledge relating to the G2019S Parkinsons disease mutation.",

    "abstract": "Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by focal atrophy of the gray matter (GM), especially in the frontal and temporal regions. Recent studies suggest a framework where white matter (WM) atrophy plays an important role in FTD pathophysiology. However, these studies often overlook the fact that WM tracts bridging different brain regions may have different vulnerabilities to the disease and the relative contribution of GM atrophy to this WM model, resulting in a less comprehensive understanding of the relationship between clinical symptoms and pathology. Here, by leveraging the sensitivity of advanced diffusion MRI modelling and metrics to precise white matter microstructural properties, we aim to clarify the relative contributions of WM fibers and GM atrophy to the cognitive symptoms typically found in FTD. A total of 155 participant from the Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Neuroimaging Initiative (FTLDNI) were analysed, including 68 normal elderly controls (CN), 28 behavioral variants (BV), 26 sematic variants (SV) and 30 progressive non fluent aphasia variants (PNFA) of FTD. Diffusion MRI analysis was performed using two complementary techniques: whole brain fixel-based analysis (FBA) and structural connectivity based on probabilistic tractography. Whole brain GM atrophy was assessed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Using a common factor analysis to extract a semantic and an executive factor, we aim to test the relative contribution of WM and GM of specific tracts in predicting cognition. We found that semantic symptoms were mainly dependent on short-range WM fiber disruption, while damage to long-range WM fibers was preferentially associated to executive dysfunction with the GM contribution to cognition being predominant for local processing. Our results support the importance of the disruption of specific WM tracts to the core cognitive symptoms associated with FTD. As large-scale WM tracts, which are particularly vulnerable to vascular disease, were highly associated with executive dysfunction, our findings highlight the importance of controlling for risk factors associated with deep white matter disease, such as vascular risk factors, in patients with FTD in order not to potentiate underlying executive dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The frontal cortex-basal ganglia network plays a pivotal role in adaptive goal-directed behaviors. Medial frontal cortex (MFC) encodes information about choices and outcomes into sequential activation of neural population, or neural trajectory. While MFC projects to the dorsal striatum (DS), whether DS also displays temporally coordinated activity remains unknown. We studied this question by simultaneously recording neural ensembles in the MFC and DS of rodents performing an outcome-based alternative choice task. We found that the two regions exhibited highly parallel evolution of neural trajectories, transforming choice information into outcome-related information. When the two trajectories were highly correlated, spike synchrony was task-dependently modulated in some MFC-DS neuron pairs. Our results suggest that neural trajectories concomitantly process decision-relevant information in MFC and DS with increased spike synchrony between these regions.",

    "abstract": "Recently redox-regulation of tip growth has been extensively studied, but differential sensitivity of growing cells to particular ROS and their subcellular localization is still unclear. Here we used specific dyes to provide mapping of H2O2 and O*2- in short and long pollen tubes. We found apical accumulation of H2O2 and H2O2-producing organelles in the shank that were not colocalized with O*2--producing mitochondria. Differential modulation of ROS content of the germination medium affected both growth speed and pollen tube morphology. Oxygen radicals affected ionic zoning: membrane potential and pH gradients. OH* caused depolarization all along the tube while O*2- provoked hyperpolarization and cytoplasm alkalinization. O*2- accelerated growth and reduced tube diameter, indicating that this ROS can be considered as pollen tube growth stimulator along with H2O2. Serious structural disturbances were observed upon exposure to OH* and H2O2 and O*2- quencher MnTMPP: pollen tube growth slowed down and ballooned tips formed in both cases, but in the presence of OH* membrane transport and organelle distribution was affected as well. OH*, thus, can be considered as a negative influence on pollen tubes which, presumably, have mechanisms for leveling it. The assumption was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy: pollen tubes actively reduce OH* content in the incubation medium.",

    "abstract": "Wood is a remarkable material. It is responsible for the sequestration of significant anthropogenic CO21, aids understanding of past climates2, has unique acoustic, thermal, and strength properties, and is an endlessly renewable source of energy3. However, we lack a general integrated understanding of how its structure is created. A theoretical framework of wood formation is presented here that explains a diverse range of poorly understood observations, including: (i) the anatomy of growth rings, with a transition from low-density earlywood to high-density latewood; (ii) the high sensitivity of latewood density to temperature; (iii) cell-size regulation; and (iv) relationships between growth and temperature. These features arise from interactions in time and space between the production of cells, the dynamics of developmental zones, and the supply of carbohydrates. Carbohydrate distribution is critical for the final density profile, challenging current theory which emphasises compensation between the rates and durations of cell enlargement and wall thickening. These findings have implications for our understanding of how growth responds to environmental variability and the interpretation of tree rings as proxies of past climates. In addition, they provide a framework for the incorporation of explicit growth processes into models, such as those used to predict the role of vegetation in the future global carbon cycle. Finally, divergent responses in volume and mass with increasing temperature suggest caution in interpreting observations based on volume alone.",

    "abstract": "Iron (Fe) toxicity is a major challenge for plant cultivation in acidic water-logged soil environments, where lowland rice is a major staple food crop. Only few studies addressed the molecular characterization of excess Fe tolerance in rice, and these highlight different mechanisms for Fe tolerance in the studied varieties.\n\nHere, we screened 16 lowland rice varieties for excess Fe stress growth responses to identify contrasting lines, Fe-tolerant Lachit and -susceptible Hacha. Hacha and Lachit differed in their physiological and morphological responses to excess Fe, including leaf growth, leaf rolling, reactive oxygen species generation, Fe and metal contents. These responses were mirrored by differential gene expression patterns, obtained through RNA-sequencing, and corresponding GO term enrichment in tolerant versus susceptible lines. From the comparative transcriptomic profiles between Lachit and Hacha in response to excess Fe stress, individual genes of the category metal homeostasis, mainly root-expressed, may contribute to the tolerance of Lachit. 22 out of these 35 metal homeostasis genes are present in selection sweep genomic regions, in breeding signatures and/or differentiated during rice domestication. These findings will serve to design targeted Fe tolerance breeding of rice crops.\n\nSummary statementLowland rice varieties Hacha and Lachit were selected for contrasting abilities to cope with iron excess stress. Morphological and physiological phenotypes were mirrored by molecular transcriptome changes, indicating altered metal homeostasis in the root as an adaptive tolerance mechanism in Lachit.",

    "abstract": "Plant phenotyping using machine learning and computer vision approaches is a challenging task. Deep learning-based systems for plant phenotyping is more efficient for measuring different plant traits for diverse genetic discoveries compared to the traditional image-based phenotyping approaches. Plant biologists have recently demanded more reliable and accurate image-based phenotyping systems for assessing various features of plants and crops. The core of these image-based phenotyping systems is structural classification and features segmentation. Deep learning-based systems, however, have shown outstanding results in extracting very complicated features and structures of above-ground plants. Nevertheless, the below-ground part of the plant is usually more complicated to analyze due to its complex arrangement and distorted appearance. We proposed a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) model named \"RootNet\" that detects and pixel-wise segments plant roots features. The feature of the proposed method is detection and segmentation of very thin (1-3 pixels wide roots). The proposed approach segment high definition images without significantly sacrificing pixel density, it leads to more accurate root type detection and segmentation results. It is hard to train CNNs with high definition images due to GPU memory limitations. The proposed patch-based CNN training setup makes use of the entire image (with maximum pixel desisity) to recognize and segment give root system efficiently. We have used wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings dataset, which consists of wheat roots grown in visible pouches. The proposed system segments are given root systems and save it to the Root System Markup Language (RSML) for future analysis. RootNet trained on the dataset mentioned above along with popular semantic segmentation architectures, and it achieved a benchmark accuracy.",

As a novel strategy for bacterial compartmentalization, protein supercharging and complex coacervation were employed to engineer liquid-like condensates in E. coli. A simple model for the phase separation of supercharged proteins was developed and used to predict intracellular condensate formation. Herein, we demonstrate that GFP-dense condensates formed by expressing GFP variants of sufficient charge in cells are dynamic and enrich specific nucleic acid and protein components. This study provides a fundamental characterization of intracellular phase separation in E. coli driven by protein supercharging and highlights future utility in designing functional synthetic membraneless organelles.",

Using 30 years of data from multiple groups of wild spotted hyenas, we address three critical aims for understanding infanticide in any species: (1) quantify the contribution of infanticide to overall mortality (2) describe the circumstances under which infanticide occurs and (3) evaluate hypotheses about the evolution of infanticide. We find that, although observed only rarely, infanticide is in fact a leading source of juvenile mortality. Infanticide accounted for 24% of juvenile mortality, and 1 in 10 hyenas born in our population perished due to infanticide. In all observed cases of infanticide, killers were adult females, but victims could be of both sexes. Of four hypotheses regarding the evolution of infanticide, we found the most support for the hypothesis that infanticide in spotted hyenas reflects competition over social status among matrilines.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that a subset of aged rats with normal spatial learning performance show head scanning rates during a novel, local-global cue-mismatch manipulation that are similar to those of young rats. However, these aged rats demonstrated different patterns of expression of neural activity markers in brain regions associated with spatial learning, perhaps suggesting neural mechanisms that compensate for age-related brain changes. These prior studies did not investigate the head scanning properties of aged rats that had spatial learning impairments. The present study analyzed head scanning behavior in young, aged-unimpaired, and aged-impaired Long Evans rats. Aged-impaired rats performed the head scan behavior at a lower rate than the young rats. These results suggest that decreased attention to spatial landmarks may be a contributing factor to the spatial learning deficits shown by the aged-impaired rats.",

The mitochondrial protonmotive force (PMF) is an electrochemical gradient that powers ATP synthesis and adjusts metabolism to energetic demands via cellular signaling. It is unknown how or where transient PMF changes are sensed and signaled due to lack of precise spatiotemporal control in vivo. We addressed this by expressing a light-activated proton pump in mitochondria to spatiotemporally \"turn off\" mitochondrial function through PMF dissipation in tissues with light. We applied our construct - mitochondria-OFF (mtOFF) - to understand how metabolic status impacts hypoxia resistance, a response that relies on mitochondrial function. mtOFF activation induced starvation-like behavior mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We found prophylactic mtOFF activation increased survival following hypoxia, and that protection relied on neuronal AMPK. Our study links spatiotemporal control of mitochondrial PMF to cellular metabolic changes that mediate behavior and stress resistance.",

Complex N-glycans have a core of three mannose sugars, with distal repeats of N-acetylglucosamine and galactose sugars terminating with sialic acid (SA). Long-range slime-like and short-range Velcro-like self-adhesions were observed between SA and mannose residues, respectively, in ill-defined monolayers. We investigated if and how these adhesions translate when SA and mannose residues are presented in complex N-glycan shields on two pseudo-typed viruses brought together in force spectroscopy (FS). Slime-like adhesions were observed between the shields at higher ramp rates, whereas Velcro-like adhesions were observed at lower rates. The complex glycan shield appears penetrable at the lower ramp rates allowing the adhesion from the mannose core to be accessed; whereas the whole virus appears compressed at higher rates permitting only surface SA adhesions to be sampled. The slime-like and velcro-like adhesions were lost when SA and mannose, respectively, were cleaved with glycosidases. While virus self-adhesion in FS was modulated by glycan penetrability, virus self-aggregation in solution was only determined by the surface sugar. Mannose-terminal viruses self-aggregated in solution, while SA-terminal ones required Ca2+ ions to self-aggregate. Viruses with galactose or N-acetylglucosamine surfaces did not self-aggregate, irrespective of whether or not a mannose core was present below the N-acetylglucosamine surface. Well-defined rules appear to govern the self-adhesion and -aggregation of N-glycosylated surfaces, regardless of whether the sugars are presented in ill-defined monolayer, or N-glycan, or even polymer architecture.",

One remarkable event occurs during development is the cochlear lengthening that starts with cochlear outgrowth around E11 and continues throughout development. Different mechanisms contribute to this process including cochlear progenitor proliferation and convergent extension. We previously identified that FGF9 and FGF20 promote cochlear lengthening by regulating auditory sensory epithelial proliferation through FGFR1 and FGFR2 in the periotic mesenchyme. Here, we provide evidence that ETS-domain transcription factors ETV4 and ETV5 are downstream of mesenchymal FGF signaling to control cochlear lengthening. Next generation RNA sequencing identified that Etv1, Etv4 and Etv5 mRNAs are decreased in the Fgf9 and Fgf20 double mutant periotic mesenchyme. Deleting both Etv4 and Etv5 in periotic mesenchyme resulted in shortening of cochlear length but maintaining normal patterning of organ of Corti and density of hair cells and supporting cells. This recapitulates phenotype of mesenchymal-specific Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 deleted inner ear. Furthermore, analysis of Etv1/4/5 triple conditional mutants revealed that ETV1 does not contribute in this process. Our study reveals that ETV4 and ETV5 function downstream of mesenchymal FGF signaling to promote cochlear lengthening.",

Our observations suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV. However, no precursors or branches of evolution stemming from a less human-adapted SARS-CoV-2-like virus have been detected. The sudden appearance of a highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 presents a major cause for concern that should motivate stronger international efforts to identify the source and prevent near future re-emergence. Any existing pools of SARS-CoV-2 progenitors would be particularly dangerous if similarly well adapted for human transmission. To look for clues regarding intermediate hosts, we analyze recent key findings relating to how SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved and adapted for human transmission, and examine the environmental samples from the Wuhan Huanan seafood market. Importantly, the market samples are genetically identical to human SARS-CoV-2 isolates and were therefore most likely from human sources. We conclude by describing and advocating for measured and effective approaches implemented in the 2002-2004 SARS outbreaks to identify lingering population(s) of progenitor virus.",

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that immune-inducible genes had become constitutively upregulated. This was the result of resistant larvae differentiating precursors of specialized immune cells called lamellocytes that were previously only produced after infection. Therefore, populations evolved resistance by genetically hard-wiring an induced immune response to become constitutive.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEpidemiological studies suggest that paternal obesity may increase the risk of fathering small for gestational age offspring. Studies in non-human mammals suggest that such associations could be mediated by DNA methylation changes in spermatozoa that influence offspring development in utero. Human obesity is associated with differential DNA methylation in peripheral blood. It is unclear, however, whether this differential DNA methylation is reflected in spermatozoa. We profiled genome-wide DNA methylation using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array in matched human blood and sperm from lean (discovery n=47; replication n=21) and obese (n=22) males to analyse tissue covariation of DNA methylation, and identify whether this covariation is influenced by obesity.\n\nResultsDNA methylation signatures of human blood and spermatozoa are highly discordant, and methylation levels are correlated at only a minority of CpG sites ([~]1%). While at the majority of these sites, DNA methylation appears to be influenced by genetic variation, obesity-associated DNA methylation in blood was not generally reflected in spermatozoa, and obesity did not influence covariation patterns. However, one cross-tissue obesity-specific hypermethylated site (cg19357369; chr4:2429884; P=8.95 x 10-8; beta=0.02) was identified, warranting replication and further investigation. When compared to a wide range of human somatic tissue samples (n=5,917), spermatozoa displayed differential DNA methylation in pathways enriched in transcriptional regulation.\n\nConclusionsHuman sperm displays a unique DNA methylation profile that is highly discordant to, and practically uncorrelated with, that of matched peripheral blood. Obesity only nominally influences sperm DNA methylation, making it an unlikely mediator of intergenerational effects of metabolic traits.",

    "abstract": "The steady state expression of each gene is the result of a dynamic transcription and degradation of that gene. While regular RNA-seq methods only measure steady state expression levels, RNA-seq of metabolically labeled RNA identifies transcripts that were transcribed during the window of metabolic labeling. Whereas short-read RNA sequencing can identify metabolically labeled RNA at the gene level, long-read sequencing provides much better resolution of isoform-level transcription. Here we combine thiouridine-to-cytosine conversion (TUC) with PacBio long-read sequencing to study the dynamics of mRNA transcription in the GM12878 cell line. We show that using long-TUC-seq, we can detect metabolically labeled mRNA of distinct isoforms more reliably than using short reads. Long-TUC-seq holds the promise of capturing isoform dynamics robustly and without the need for enrichment.",

    "abstract": "A large body of work has revealed fundamental principles of HIV-1 integration into the human genome. However, the effect of the integration site to proviral transcription activity has so far remained elusive. Here we combine open-source, large-scale datasets including epigenetics, transcriptome, and 3D genome architecture to interrogate the chromatin states, transcription activity landscape, and nuclear sub-compartments around HIV-1 integration sites in CD4+ T cells to decipher human genome codes shaping the transcription of proviral classes defined based on their position and orientation in the genome. Using a Hidden Markov Model, we describe the importance of specific chromatin states and genome architecture in the control of HIV-1 transcription activity. Additionally, implementation of a machine-learning logistic regression model reveals upstream chromatin accessibility, transcription activity, and categorical nuclear sub-compartments as optimal features predicting HIV-1 transcriptional outcomes. We finally demonstrate clinical relevance by interrogating the positions of intact proviruses persisting in patients under suppressive therapy and provide a compass compatible with clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "The recovery and cultivation of diverse field-related microorganisms from the terrestrial subsurface environment remains a challenge despite recent advances in modern molecular technology. Here we applied natural organic carbon (C), i.e., sediment-derived natural organic matter (NOM) and bacterial cell lysate, to groundwater microbial communities for a 30-day enrichment incubation, followed by conventional direct-plating for isolation. The groundwater was collected from a background well at the Oak Ridge Reservation Field Research Center, Tennessee. As a comparison, we also included enrichments amended with simple organic C sources, including glucose, acetate, benzoate, oleic acid, cellulose, and mixed vitamins. Our results demonstrate that complex natural organic C sources are more effective in enriching diverse bacterial species from groundwater than simple organic C sources. Microcosms amended with simple organic C (glucose, acetate, benzoate, or oleic acid) show significantly lower biodiversity than unamended control and are dominated by only few phyla such as Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. In contrast, microcosms amended with complex natural organic C (sediment NOM or bacterial cell lysate) display significantly higher biodiversity, and enrich distinct species from the phyla that are poorly represented in published culture collections (e.g., Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes, and Armatimonadetes). Our subsequent isolation efforts from natural organic C-amended enrichments led to 222 purified bacterial isolates representing 5 phyla, 16 orders, and 54 distinct species including candidate novel, rarely cultivated, and undescribed organisms.\n\nImportanceInnovative strategies for recovering bacterial strains representing the true diversity of microbial communities in the terrestrial subsurface would significantly advance the understanding of ecologically critical taxa residing in these ecosystems. In this study, we demonstrate that complex natural organic C that mimic the naturally available resources for microbes encourages the growth of diverse bacteria much more robustly than traditional simplistic organic C sources. Results from this study will substantially advance and improve the design of strategies to effectively cultivate and isolate diverse and novel subsurface microorganisms in the laboratory. Obtaining axenic cultures of the  once-unculturable microorganisms will greatly enhance our understanding of microbial physiology, function, and roles in different biogeochemical niches in terrestrial subsurface ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Early-life maternal care received has a profound effect on later-life behaviour in adult offspring and previous studies have suggested epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) are involved. Changes in thyroid hormone receptor signaling might be related to differences in maternal care received and DNA methylation modifications. We investigated the effects of two factors in the maternal environment, temperature exposure (a proxy of maternal contact) and licking-like tactile stimulation, on these processes in week-old female rat pups. We assessed thyroid hormone receptor signaling by measuring circulating triiodothyronine and transcript abundance of thyroid hormone receptors and the thyroid hormone-responsive genes DNA methyltransferase 3a and oxytocin in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. DNA methylation of the oxytocin promoter was assessed in relation to changes in thyroid hormone receptor binding. Repeated room temperature exposure was associated with a decrease in thyroid hormone receptor signaling measures relative to nest temperature exposure, while acute room temperature exposure was associated with an increase. Repeated room temperature exposure also increased thyroid hormone receptor binding and DNA methylation at the oxytocin promoter. These findings suggest that repeated room temperature exposure may affect DNA methylation levels as a consequence of alterations in thyroid hormone receptor signaling.",

    "abstract": "The ability to characterize heterogeneous and anisotropic water diffusion processes within macro-scopic MRI voxels non-invasively and in vivo is a desideratum in biology, neuroscience, and medicine. While an MRI voxel may contain approximately a microliter of tissue, our goal is to examine intravoxel diffusion processes on the order of picoliters. Here we propose a new theoretical framework and experimental design to describe and measure such intravoxel structural heterogeneity and anisotropy. We assume that a constrained normal tensor-variate distribution (CNTVD) describes the variability of positive definite diffusion tensors within a voxel which extends its applicability to a wide range of b-values unlike existing models. We use a Monte Carlo scheme to synthesize realistic numerical diffusion tensor distribution (DTD) phantoms and invert the MR signal. We show that the signal inversion is well-posed and estimate the CNTVD parameters parsimoniously by exploiting the different symmetries of the mean and covariance tensors of CNTVD. The robustness of the estimation pipeline is assessed by adding noise to calculated MR signals and compared with the ground truth. A family of invariant parameters which characterize microscopic shape, size and orientation heterogeneity within a voxel are also presented.",
