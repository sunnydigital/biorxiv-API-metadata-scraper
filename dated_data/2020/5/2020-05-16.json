    "abstract": "Algal lipids are important fuel storage molecules in algae and a currency for energy transfer in the marine food chain as well as materials for biofuel production, but their production and regulation are not well understood in many species including the common coastal phytoplankton Eutreptiella spp. Here, using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS), we discovered 24 types of fatty acids (FAs) in Eutreptiella sp. with a relatively high proportion of long chain unsaturated FAs. The abundances of C16, C18 and saturated FAs decreased when phosphate in the culture medium was depleted. Among the 24 FAs, docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5) were the most abundant, suggesting that Eutreptiella sp. preferentially invests in the synthesis of very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPFA). Further transcriptomic analysis revealed that Eutreptiella sp. likely synthesizes VLCPFA via {Delta}8 pathway and uses type I and II fatty acid synthases. Using RT-qPCR, we found that some of the lipid production genes, such as {beta}-ketoacyl-ACP reductase, fatty acid desaturase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acyl carrier protein, {Delta}8 desaturase, and Acyl-ACP thioesterase, were more actively expressed during light period. Besides, two carbon-fixation genes were more highly expressed in the high lipid illuminated cultures, suggesting a linkage between photosynthesis and lipid production.",

    "abstract": "Outer radial glial (oRG) cells are a population of neural stem cells prevalent in the developing human cortex that contribute to its cellular diversity and evolutionary expansion. The mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is active in human oRG cells. Mutations in mTOR pathway genes are linked to a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders and malformations of cortical development. We find that dysregulation of mTOR signaling specifically affects oRG cells, but not other progenitor types, by changing the actin cytoskeleton through the activity of the GTPase, CDC42. These effects change oRG cellular morphology, migration, and mitotic behavior. Thus, mTOR signaling can regulate the architecture of the developing human cortex by maintaining the cytoskeletal organization of oRG cells and the radial glia scaffold. Our study provides insight into how mTOR dysregulation may contribute to neurodevelopmental disease.",

    "abstract": "The anatomical reorganization required for optimal C4 photosynthesis should also impact plant hydraulics. Most C4 plants possess large bundle-sheath cells and high vein density, which should also lead to higher leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) and capacitance. Paradoxically, the C4 pathway reduces water demand and increases water-use-efficiency, creating a potential mis-match between supply capacity and demand in C4 plant water relations. We use phylogenetic analyses, physiological measurements, and models to examine the reorganization of hydraulics in closely-related C4 and C3 grasses. Evolutionarily young C4 lineages have higher Kleaf, capacitance, turgor-loss-point, and lower stomatal conductance than their C3 relatives. In contrast, species from older C4 lineages show decreased Kleaf and capacitance, indicating that over time, C4 plants have evolved to optimize hydraulic investments while maintaining C4 anatomical requirements. The initial \"over-plumbing\" of C4 plants disrupts the positive correlation between maximal assimilation rate and Kleaf, decoupling a key relationship between hydraulics and photosynthesis generally observed in vascular plants.",

In CSF cells, 133/133 and 115/117 differentially expressed sncRNAs are increased in RRMS relapse compared to remission and RRMS compared to NINDC, respectively. In contrast, 65/67 differentially expressed PBMC sncRNAs are decreased in RRMS compared to NINDC.

    "abstract": "High-quality genome assembly has wide applications in genetics and medical studies. However, it is still very challenging to achieve gap-free chromosome-scale assemblies using current workflows for long-read platforms. Here we propose GALA (Gap-free long-read assembler), a chromosome-by-chromosome assembly method implemented through a multi-layer computer graph that identifies mis-assemblies within preliminary assemblies or chimeric raw reads and partitions the data into chromosome-scale linkage groups. The subsequent independent assembly of each linkage group generates a gap-free assembly free from the mis-assembly errors which usually hamper existing workflows. This flexible framework also allows us to integrate data from various technologies, such as Hi-C, genetic maps, a reference genome and even motif analyses, to generate gap-free chromosome-scale assemblies. We de novo assembled the C. elegans and A. thaliana genomes using combined Pacbio and Nanopore sequencing data from publicly available datasets. We also demonstrated the new methods applicability with a gap-free assembly of a human genome with the help a reference genome. In addition, GALA showed promising performance for Pacbio high-fidelity long reads. Thus, our method enables straightforward assembly of genomes with multiple data sources and overcomes barriers that at present restrict the application of de novo genome assembly technology.",

    "abstract": "The sensing and generation of cellular forces are essential aspects of life. Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) has emerged as a standard broadly applicable methodology to measure cell contractility and its role in cell behavior. While TFM platforms have enabled diverse discoveries, their implementation remains limited in part due to various constraints, such as time-consuming substrate fabrication techniques, the need to detach cells to measure null force images, followed by complex imaging and analysis, and the unavailability of cells for post-processing. Here we introduce a reference-free technique to measure cell contractile work in real-time, with basic substrate fabrication methodologies, simple imaging, and analysis with the availability of the cells for post-processing. In this technique, we confine the cells on fluorescent adhesive protein micropatterns of a known area on compliant silicone substrates and use the cell deformed pattern area to calculate cell contractile work. We validated this approach by comparing this Pattern-based Contractility Screening (PaCS) to conventional bead-displacement TFM and show quantitative agreement between the methodologies. Using this platform, we measure the contractile work of highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells is significantly higher than non-invasive MCF-7 cells. PaCS enables the broader implementation of contractile work measurements in diverse quantitative biology and biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Transients in ecology are extremely important since they determine how equilibria are approached. The debate on the dynamic stability of ecosystems has been largely focused on equilibrium states. However, since ecosystems are constantly changing due to climate conditions or to perturbations such as the climate crisis or anthropogenic actions (habitat destruction, deforestation, or defaunation), it is important to study how dynamics can proceed till equilibria. In this contribution we investigate dynamics and transient phenomena in small food chains using mathematical models. We are interested in the impact of habitat loss in ecosystems with vegetation undergoing facilitation. We provide a thorough dynamical study of a small food chain system given by three trophic levels: vegetation, herbivores, and predators. The dynamics of the vegetation alone suffers a saddle-node bifurcation, causing extremely long transients. The addition of a herbivore introduces a remarkable number of new phenomena. Specifically, we show that, apart from the saddle node involving the extinction of the full system, a transcritical and a supercritical Hopf-Andronov bifurcation allow for the coexistence of vegetation and herbivores via non-oscillatory and oscillatory dynamics, respectively. Furthermore, a global transition given by a heteroclinic bifurcation is also shown to cause a full extinction. The addition of a predator species to the previous systems introduces further complexity and dynamics, also allowing for the coupling of different transient phenomena such as ghost transients and transient oscillations after the heteroclinic bifurcation. Our study shows how the increase of ecological complexity via addition of new trophic levels and their associated nonlinear interactions may modify dynamics, bifurcations, and transient phenomena.",

    "abstract": "C3 and C4 are major functional types in terrestrial biosphere models, with photosynthesis traits as important input parameters. The evolution of C4 required reorganizations of Calvin-Benson-cycle and coordination of C4-cycle enzymes, resulting in divergences of physiological traits between C3 and C4. In addition, photosynthesis further optimized after the evolution of C4 causing diversification within C4 lineages due to different evolutionary histories. We combined optimality modeling, physiological measurements and phylogenetic analysis to examine how various aspects of C4 photosynthetic machinery were reorganized and coordinated within C4 lineages and as compared to closely-related C3 in grasses. Optimality models and measurements indicated a higher maximal electron transport to maximal Rubisco carboxylation ratio (Jmax/Vcmax) in C4 than C3, consistent with the optimal prediction to maximize photosynthesis. The coordination between Calvin-Benson and C4 cycles (Vpmax/Vcmax), however, is in line with the optimal modeling results under 200 ppm, as opposed to current CO2. Such inconsistencies can be explained by a slowly declining assimilation rate beyond optimal Vpmax/Vcmax. Although rapid coordination occurred early in C4 evolution, C4 is still under optimizing processes and photosynthetic measures have continued to increase across time. Lastly, better understandings of Jmax/Vcmax, Vpmax/Vcmax and fluorescence-based-electron-transport proffer enhanced approaches to parameterize terrestrial biosphere models.",

    "abstract": "The brain is a complex system exhibiting ever-evolving activity patterns without any external inputs or tasks. Such intrinsic dynamics (or lack thereof) are thought to play crucial roles in typical as well as atypical cognitive functioning. Linking the ever-changing intrinsic dynamics to the rather static anatomy is a challenging endeavor. Dynamical systems models are important tools for understanding how structure and function are linked in the brain. Here, we provide a novel modeling framework to examine such structure-function relations. Our deterministic approach complements previous modeling frameworks, which typically focus on noise-driven (or stochastic) dynamics near a single attractor. We examine the overall organizations of and coordination between all putative attractors. Using our approach, we first provide evidence that examining cross-attractor coordination between brain regions could better predict human functional connectivity than examining noise-driven near-attractor dynamics. Further, we observed that structural connections across scales modulate the energy costs of such cross-attractor coordination. Overall, our work provides a systematic framework for characterizing intrinsic brain dynamics as a web of cross-attractor transitions and associated energy costs. The framework may be used to predict transitions and energy costs associated with experimental or clinical interventions.",

Here we integrated genome-wide chromosome conformation in purified neurons and glia with transcriptomic and enhancer profiles to build the gene regulatory landscape of two major cell classes in the human brain. Within glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, we were able to link enhancers to their cognate genes via neuronal chromatin interaction profiles. These cell-type-specific regulatory landscapes were then leveraged to gain insight into the cellular etiology of several brain disorders. We found that Alzheimers disease (AD)-associated epigenetic dysregulation was linked to neurons and oligodendrocytes, whereas genetic risk factors for AD highlighted microglia as a central cell type, suggesting that different cell types may confer risk to the disease via different genetic mechanisms. Moreover, neuronal subtype-specific annotation of genetic risk factors for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder identified shared (parvalbumin-expressing interneurons) and distinct cellular etiology (upper layer neurons for bipolar and deeper layer projection neurons for schizophrenia) between these two closely related psychiatric illnesses. Collectively, these findings shed new light on cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks in brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid {beta} oligomers (A{beta}O) are potent modulators of two key Alzheimers pathological processes, namely synaptic dysfunction and tau tangle formation in various brain regions. Remarkably, the impact of A{beta}O in one of the earliest brain regions to exhibit Alzheimers pathology, the locus coeruleus (LC), remains to be determined. Of particular importance is the effect of A{beta}O on the excitability of individual LC neurons. This parameter determines brain-wide noradrenaline (NA) release, and thus NA-mediated brain functions, including cognition, emotion and immune function, which are all severely compromised in Alzheimers. Using a mouse model of increased A{beta} production (APP-PSEN1), together with correlative histopathological analyses in post mortem Alzheimers patient samples, we determined the impact of A{beta} pathology on various correlates of LC neuronal integrity. A{beta}O immunoreactivity in the LC of APP-PSEN1 mice was replicated in patient samples, presenting as individual clusters located both intraneuronally, in mitochondrial compartments, as well as extracellularly in association with inhibitory synapses. No specific signal was detected in either patient control or wild type mouse samples. Accompanying this A{beta}O expression profile was LC neuronal hyperexcitability and indicators of oxidative stress in APP-PSEN1 mice. LC hyperexcitability arose from a diminished inhibitory effect of GABA, due to impaired expression and function of the GABA-A receptor (GABAAR) 3 subunit. Importantly, this altered LC 3-GABAAR expression profile overlapped with A{beta}O expression in both APP-PSEN1 mice and Alzheimers patient samples. Finally, strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors (GlyRs) remained resilient to A{beta}O-induced changes and their activation reversed LC hyperexcitability. Alongside this first demonstration of A{beta}O expression in the LC of Alzheimers patients, the study is also first to reveal a direct association between A{beta}O and LC neuronal excitability. GlyR-3-GABAAR modulation of A{beta}O-dependent LC hyperexcitability could delay the onset of cognitive and psychiatric symptoms arising from LC-NA deficits, thereby significantly diminishing the disease burden for Alzheimers patients.",

We recorded single- and multi-unit activity whilst iontophoretically administering dopaminergic agonists and antagonists while rhesus macaques performed a spatial attention task. Out of 88 units, 50 revealed activity modulation by drug administration. Dopamine inhibited firing rates according to an inverted-U shaped dose-response curve and increased gain variability. Dopamine modulated attention-related rate changes and Fano Factors in broad and narrow-spiking units, respectively. D1 receptor antagonists diminished firing rates according to a monotonic function and interacted with attention modulating gain variability in broad-spiking units. Finally, both drugs decreased the pupil light reflex. These data show that dopamine shapes neuronal responses and modulates attentional processing in parietal cortex.",

Psychophysiological interactions identified hippocampal connectivity with SMC during volitional movements, and connectivity effects from multivoxel seeds were compared with alternate methods; a structural seed represented the mean connectivity map from all voxels within a region, whereas a functional seed represented the regional voxel with maximal SMC connectivity. With few exceptions, the same parameters were optimal for activation and connectivity. Larger isovoxels showed larger activation volumes in both SMC and the hippocampus; connectivity volumes from structural seeds were also larger, except from the posterior hippocampus. Regardless of voxel size, the 10mm smoothing kernel generated larger activation and connectivity volumes from structural seeds, as well as larger beta estimates at connectivity maxima; structural seeds also produced larger connectivity volumes than multivoxel seeds. Functional seeds showed lesser effects from voxel size and smoothing kernels. Optimal parameters revealed topography in structural seed connectivity along both the longitudinal axis and mediolateral axis of the hippocampus. These results indicate larger voxels and smoothing kernels improve sensitivity for detecting both cortical activation and hippocampal connectivity.",

    "abstract": "To be able to resolve molecular-clusters it is crucial to access vital informations (such as, molecule density and cluster-size) that are key to understand disease progression and the underlying mechanism. Traditional single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques use molecules of variable sizes (as determined by its localization precisions (LPs)) to reconstruct super-resolution map. This results in an image with overlapping and superimposing PSFs (due to a wide size-spectrum of single molecules) that degrade image resolution. Ideally it should be possible to identify the brightest molecules (also termed as, the fortunate molecules) to reconstruct ultra-superresolution map, provided sufficient statistics is available from the recorded data. POSSIBLE microscopy explores this possibility by introducing narrow probability size-distribution of single molecules (narrow size-spectrum about a predefined mean-size). The reconstruction begins by presetting the mean and variance of the narrow distribution function (Gaussian function). Subsequently, the dataset is processed and single molecule filtering is carried out by the Gaussian distribution function to filter out unfortunate molecules. The fortunate molecules thus retained are then mapped to reconstruct ultra-superresolution map. In-principle, the POSSIBLE microscopy technique is capable of infinite resolution (resolution of the order of actual single molecule size) provided enough fortunate molecules are experimentally detected. In short, bright molecules (with large emissivity) holds the key. Here, we demonstrate the POSSIBLE microscopy technique and reconstruct single molecule images with an average PSF sizes of{sigma} {+/-} {Delta}{sigma} = 15 {+/-} 10 nm, 30 {+/-} 2 nm & 50 {+/-} 2 nm. Results show better-resolved Dendra2-HA clusters with large cluster-density in transfected NIH3T3 fibroblast cells as compared to the traditional SMLM techniques.",

    "abstract": "Membraneless organelles are dynamical cellular condensates formed by the liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins and RNA molecules. Multiple evidence suggests that disordered proteins are structural scaffolds that drive the condensation by forming a dynamic network of inter- and intra-molecular contacts. Despite the blooming research activity in this field, the structural characterization of these condensates is very limited and we still do not understand how the phase behaviour is encoded in the amino-acid sequences of the scaffolding proteins. Here we exploited explicit-solvent atomistic simulations to disentangle the molecular interactions governing the phase behaviour of the N-terminal disordered region of DEAD-box helicase 4 (NDDX4), which is a well-established model for phase separation in vitro and in vivo. Single-molecule simulations clarified the interplay between the intramolecular interactions that shape NDDX4 conformational ensemble and the known determinants of its phase behaviour, such as the attraction between oppositely-charged regions and the presence of arginine and phenylalanine. We then investigated intermolecular interactions associated with phase separation via a divide-and-conquer strategy based on the simulations of various NDDX4 fragments at high concentration. Our approach allowed us to probe conditions mimicking real condensates and revealed, in agreement with mutagenesis results, how these interactions arise from the complex interplay of diverse molecular mechanisms. Particularly, we characterized the transient formation of clusters of arginine and aromatic residues, which may stabilize the assembly of several MLOs. Overall, our results reveal the potential of atomistic simulations in the investigation of biomolecular phase separation paving the way for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity affects ecosystem function, but how this relationship will pan out in a changing world is still a major question in ecology. It remains especially understudied for pico-phytoplankton communities, which contribute to carbon cycles and aquatic food webs year-round. Observational studies show a link between phytoplankton community diversity and ecosystem stability, but there is only scarce causal or empirical evidence. Here, we sampled phytoplankton communities from two biogeographically distinct (but close enough to not be confounded by differences in day length and precipitation) regions in the Southern Baltic Sea, and carried out a series of dilution/regrowth experiments across three assay temperatures. This allowed us to investigate the effects of loss of rare taxa and establish causal links in natural communities between species richness and several ecologically relevant traits (e.g. size, biomass production, and oxygen production), depending on sampling location and assay temperature. We found that the samples bio-geographical origin determined whether and how functional redundancy changed as a function of temperature for all traits under investigation. Samples obtained from the slightly warmer and more thermally variable regions showed overall high functional redundancy. Samples from the slightly cooler, less variable, stations showed little functional redundancy, i.e. function decreased the more species were lost from the community. The differences between regions were more pronounced at elevated assay temperatures. Our results imply that the importance of rare species and the amount of species required to maintain ecosystem function even under short-term warming (e.g. during heat waves) may differ drastically even within geographically closely related regions of the same ecosystem.",

We identified hotspots of change in LHFI and we evaluated the intensity of anthropic pressures in natural regions and ecosystems. We found that LHFI in Colombia increased between 1970 and 2015. The Andean and Caribbean regions presented the highest levels of anthropic impact, remaining stable over time. Hotspots of change were mainly located in the following regions: Andean (Antioquia, Cauca and Valle del Cauca states), Amazon (Amazonas, parts of Meta, Guaviare and Putumayo states) and Orinoco (Casanare and parts of Meta and Vichada states). In addition, ecosystems that under the IUCN ecosystem risk categories are Critically Endangered (CR) and Vulnerable (VU) were the most affected by a high level of human impact. Spatiotemporal evaluation of the human footprint in Colombia provides new insights about trends in human pressures on ecosystems and constitutes an analytical tool with high potential for harmonizing land use planning and biodiversity conservation.",

    "abstract": "O_LIAnimal populations have developed multiple strategies to deal with environmental change. Among them, the demographic buffering strategy consists on constraining the temporal variation of the vital rate(s) (e.g., survival, growth, reproduction) that most affect(s) the overall performance of the population. Given the increase in environmental stochasticity of the current global change scenario, identifying the thresholds beyond which populations are not able to remain viable -despite their potential buffering strategies- is of utmost importance.\nC_LIO_LITortoises are known to buffer the temporal variation in survival (i.e. this vital rate has the highest contribution to the population growth rate{lambda} ) at the expense of a high variability on reproductive rates (lowest contribution to{lambda} ). To identify the potential threshold in buffering ability, here we use field data collected across a decade on 15 locations of Testudo graeca along South-Eastern Spain. We analyse the effects of environmental variables (precipitation, temperature, and NDVI) on the probability of laying eggs and the number of eggs per clutch. Finally, we couple the demographic and environmental data to parametrise integral projection models (IPMs) to simulate the effects of different scenarios of drought recurrence on population growth rate.\nC_LIO_LIWe find that droughts negatively affect the probability of laying eggs, but the overall effects on the population growth rates of T. graeca under the current drought frequencies (one per decade) are negligible. However, increasing the annual frequency of droughts decreases the buffering ability of T. graeca populations, with a threshold at three droughts per decade.\nC_LIO_LIAlthough some species may buffer current environmental regimes by carefully orchestrating how their vital rates vary through time, a demographic buffering strategy may alone not warrant population viability in extreme regimes. Our findings support the hypothesis that the buffering strategy indeed has a threshold of effectiveness. Our methodological approach also provides a useful pipeline for ecologists and managers to determine how effective the management of environmental drivers can be for demographically buffering populations, and which scenarios may not provide long-term species persistence.\nC_LI",

During the critical period of post-natal development, neuronal properties are tuned to participate in functional circuits. In rodents, cervical motoneurons are born prior to lumbar motoneurons, and spinal cord development follows a sequential rostro-caudal sequence. Here we asked whether birth order is reflected in the post-natal development of electrophysiological properties. We show that motoneurons of both segments have similar properties at birth and follow the same developmental profile, with maximal firing increasing and excitability decreasing into the 3rd post-natal week. However, these maturative processes occur in cervical prior to lumbar motoneurons, correlating to the timing of arrival of descending systems. These results suggest that motoneuron properties do not mature by cell autonomous mechanisms alone, but rather depend on developing descending and spinal circuits.",

We recently identified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis regulators such as compound 147 that reduce secretion and aggregation of LCs implicated in AL (Plate, Cooley et al., 2016). Compound 147 promotes adaptive ER proteostasis remodeling through a mechanism involving covalent modification of multiple protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) and subsequent activation of the ATF6 unfolded protein response (UPR) -associated transcriptional signaling pathway (Paxman, Plate et al., 2018). Here, we show that the 147-dependent reduction in amyloidogenic LC secretion from AL patient plasma cells is independent of ATF6 activation, but instead requires on-target PDI modification. Our results reveal pharmacologic targeting of PDIs as a potential strategy to ameliorate AL-associated proteotoxicity and demonstrate that 147 can influence ER proteostasis through multiple on-target mechanisms including ATF6 activation and PDI modification.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTThis study demonstrates the broad potential for endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis regulator compounds such as 147 to influence secretory proteostasis of disease-associated proteins through multiple on target mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral neuroblastic tumors (PNTs) are the most common extracranial solid tumors in early childhood. They represent a spectrum of neural crest derived tumors including neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma. PNTs exhibit heterogeneity due to interconverting malignant cell states described as adrenergic/nor-adrenergic or mesenchymal/neural crest cell in origin. The factors determining individual patient levels of tumor heterogeneity, their impact on the malignant phenotype, and the presence of other cell states are unknown. Here, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of 4267 cells from 7 PNTs demonstrated extensive transcriptomic heterogeneity. Trajectory modelling showed that malignant neuroblasts move between adrenergic and mesenchymal cell states via a novel state that we termed a \"transitional\" phenotype. Transitional cells are characterized by gene expression programs linked to a sympathoadrenal development, and aggressive tumor phenotypes such as rapid proliferation and tumor dissemination. Among primary bulk tumor patient cohorts, high expression of the transitional gene signature was highly predictive of poor prognosis when compared to adrenergic and mesenchymal expression patterns. High transitional gene expression in neuroblastoma cell lines identified a similar transitional H3K27-acetylation super-enhancer landscape, supporting the concept that PNTs have phenotypic plasticity and transdifferentiation capacity. Additionally, examination of PNT microenvironments, found that neuroblastomas contained low immune cell infiltration, high levels of non-inflammatory macrophages, and low cytotoxic T lymphocyte levels compared with more benign PNT subtypes. Modeling of cell-cell signaling in the tumor microenvironment predicted specific paracrine effects toward the various subtypes of malignant cells, suggesting further cell-extrinsic influences on malignant cell phenotype. Collectively, our study reveals the presence of a previously unrecognized transitional cell state with high malignant potential and an immune cell architecture which serve both as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. Early detection is critical to reduce CRC morbidity and mortality. In order to meet this need, we developed a molecular clamping assay called the ColoScape  for early colorectal cancer diagnostics.\n\nMethodsNineteen mutations in four genes APC, KRAS, BRAF and CTNNB1 associated with early events in CRC pathogenesis are targeted in the ColoScape assay. Xenonucleic Acid (XNA) mediated qPCR clamping technology was applied to minimize the wild-type background amplification in order to improve assay sensitivity of CRC mutation detection. The assay analytical performance was verified and validated, cfDNA and FFPE CRC patient samples were evaluated, and a ROC cure was applied to evaluate its performance.\n\nResultsThe data showed that the assay analytical sensitivity is 0.5% Variant Allele Frequency, corresponding to ~7-8 copies of mutant DNA with 5ng total DNA input per test. This assay is highly reproducible with intra-assay CV <3% and inter-assay <5%. We have investigated 380 clinical samples including plasma cfDNA and FFPE samples from patients with precancerous and different stages of CRC. The preliminary assay clinical specificity and sensitivity for CRC cfDNA were 100% (95% CI, 80.3-97.5%) and 92.2% (95% CI, 94.7-100%) respectively with AUC being about 0.96; and 96% (95% CI, 77.6-99.7%) specificity and 92% (95% CI, 86.1-95.6%) sensitivity with AUC 0.94 for CRC FFPE; and 95% specificity (95% CI, 82.5%-99.1%) and 62.5% sensitivity (95% CI, 35.8%-83.7%) with AUC 0.79 for precancerous lesions cfDNA.\n\nConclusionsXNA mediated molecular clamping assay is a rapid, precise, and sensitive assay for the detection of precancerous lesions cfDNA and CRC cfDNA or FFPE samples.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive research, little progress has been made in glioblastoma therapy, owing in part to a lack of adequate preclinical in vivo models to study this disease. To mitigate this, primary patient-derived cell lines, which maintain their specific stem-like phenotypes, have replaced established glioblastoma cell lines. However, due to heterogenous tumour growth inherent in glioblastoma, the use of primary cells for orthotopic in vivo studies often requires large experimental group sizes. Therefore, when using intracranial patient-derived xenograft (PDX) approaches, it is advantageous to deploy imaging techniques to monitor tumour growth and allow stratification of mice. Here we show that stable expression of near-infrared fluorescent protein (iRFP) in patient-derived glioblastoma cells enables rapid direct non-invasive monitoring of tumour development without compromising tumour stemness or tumorigenicity. Moreover, as this approach does not depend on the use of agents like luciferin, which can cause variability due to changing bioavailability, it can be used for quantitative longitudinal monitoring of tumour growth. Notably, we show that this technique also allows quantitative assessment of tumour burden in highly invasive models spreading throughout the brain. Thus, iRFP transduction of primary patient-derived glioblastoma cells is a reliable, cost- and time-effective way to monitor heterogenous orthotopic PDX growth.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clock rhythms are critical to control physiological and development traits, allowing, plants to adapt to changing environments. Here we show that the circadian rhythms of cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare) have slowed and amplitude increased under domestication by comparing with its wild ancestor (H. spontaneum). Moreover, we show a significant loss of thermal plasticity during barley evolution for the period and more extensively for amplitude. Our genetic analysis indicates that wild allele at epistatic loci, which mutually condition clock variation and its thermal plasticity in interspecific crosses, are absent in a contemporary barley breeding panel. These epistatic interactions include conditioned effects of Drivers of Circadian (DOC) clock loci on chromosome 3 and 5, which mediate amplitude decrease and period lengthening, respectively, under domestication. Notably, two significant loci, DOC3.1 and DOC5.1, which are not associated with clock diversity in cultivated breeding material, do show pleiotropic effects on flowering time and grain yield at multiple experimental sites across the U.S. in a temperature-dependent manner. We suggest that transition from winter growth of wild barley (H. spontaneum) to spring growth of modern cultivars included the loss and repurposing of circadian clock regulators to yield adaptation by mechanisms yet to be clarified.\n\nSignificance statementCircadian clock rhythms are crucial factors affecting crop adaptation to changing environments. If faced with increased temperature plants could respond with temperature compensation adaptation and maintain clock rhythms, or they can change period and/or amplitude to adapt. We used a combination of approaches: high-throughput clock analysis under optimal and elevated heat conditions, genome-wide association study (GWAS) with cultivated and wild diversity panels to identify changes under domestication and quantitative trait loci (QTL) that control the clock and its responses, and QTL-environment association for testing environmentally-conditioned effects of these QTLongrain yield and flowering timingacross US. Our findings provide insights into changes of circadian rhythms under domestication and genetic tools for plant breeders to develop better-adapted cultivars to changing environments.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome spatial organization controls functional interactions between genes and regulators, yet the molecular and physical mechanisms underlying folding at the single DNA molecule level remain to be understood. Here we employ models of polymer physics to investigate the conformations of two 2Mb-wide DNA loci in human HCT116 and IMR90 wild-type and cohesin depleted cells. Model predictions on the 3D structure of single-molecules are consistently validated against super-resolution single-cell imaging data, providing evidence that the architecture of the studied loci is controlled by a thermodynamics mechanism of polymer phase separation whereby chromatin self-assembles in segregated globules. The process is driven by interactions between distinct types of cognate binding sites, correlating each with a different combination of chromatin factors, including CTCF, cohesin and histone marks. The intrinsic thermodynamics degeneracy of conformations results in a broad structural and time variability of single-molecules, reflected in their varying TAD-like contact patterns. Globules breathe in time, inducing stochastic unspecific interactions, yet they produce stable, compact environments where specific contacts become highly favored between regions enriched for cognate binding sites, albeit characterized by weak biochemical affinities. Cohesin depletion tends to reverse globule phase separation into a coil, randomly folded state, resulting in much more variable contacts across single-molecules, hence erasing population-averaged patterns. Overall, globule phase separation appears to be a robust, reversible mechanism of chromatin organization, where stochasticity and specificity coexist.",

    "abstract": "Synapses in the cerebral cortex constantly change and this dynamic property regulated by the action of neuromodulators such as dopamine (DA), is essential for reward learning and memory. DA modulates spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a cellular model of learning and memory, in juvenile rodent cortical neurons. However, it is unknown whether this neuromodulation also occurs at excitatory synapses of cortical neurons in mature adult mice or in humans. Cortical layer V pyramidal neurons were recorded with whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology and an extracellular stimulating electrode was used to induce STDP. DA was either bath-applied or optogenetically released in slices from mice. Classical STDP induction protocols triggered non-Hebbian excitatory synaptic depression in the mouse or no plasticity at human cortical synapses. DA reverted long term synaptic depression to baseline in mouse or elicited long term synaptic potentiation in human cortical synapses. Furthermore, when DA was applied during a STDP protocol it depressed presynaptic inhibition in the mouse but not in the human cortex. Thus, DA modulates excitatory synaptic plasticity differently in human versus mouse cortex. The data strengthens the importance of DA in gating cognition in humans, and may inform on therapeutic interventions to recover brain function from diseases.",

    "abstract": "We can make exquisitely precise movements without the apparent need for conscious monitoring. But can we monitor the low-level movement parameters when prompted? And what are the mechanisms that allow us to monitor our movements? To answer these questions, we designed a semi-virtual ball throwing task. On each trial, participants first threw a virtual ball by moving their arm (with or without visual feedback, or replayed from a previous trial) and then made a two-alternative forced choice on the resulting ball trajectory. They then rated their confidence in their decision. We measured metacognitive efficiency using meta-d/d and compared it between different informational domains of the first-order task (motor, visuomotor or visual information alone), as well as between two different versions of the task based on different parameters of the movement: proximal (position of the arm) or distal (resulting trajectory of the ball thrown).\n\nWe found that participants were able to monitor their performance based on distal motor information as well as when proximal information was available. Their metacognitive efficiency was also equally high in conditions with different sources of information available. The analysis of correlations across participants revealed an unexpected result: while metacognitive efficiency correlated between informational domains (which would indicate domain-generality of metacognition), it did not correlate across the different parameters of movement. We discuss possible sources of this discrepancy and argue that specific first-order task demands may play a crucial role in our metacognitive ability and should be considered when making inferences about domain-generality based on correlations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdvancing age affects the brains resting-state functional networks. Combining non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) with neuroimaging is a promising approach to modulate activity across resting-state functional systems and explore their true contribution to cognitive function in aging. However, substantial individual variability in the response to NIBS has been reported and, hence, identifying the individual predictors of NIBS-induced modulatory effects is crucial if we are to harness their potential.\n\nMethodsThirty-one cognitively healthy older adults (71.68 {+/-} 2.5 years; 19 females) underwent two different multifocal real tDCS conditions (C1 and C2) and a sham condition in a crossover design during a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) acquisition. The real tDCS conditions were designed to induce two distinct electric field distribution patterns either targeting generalized cortical overactivity or a dissociation between the frontal areas and the posteromedial cortex. Stimulation was delivered through an MRI-compatible device using 8 small circular electrodes. Each individuals anatomical T1-weighted MRI was used to generate a finite element model to define the individual electric field generated by each tDCS condition.\n\nResultsThe two tDCS conditions modulated resting-state connectivity differently. C1 increased the coactivation of numerous functional couplings as compared to sham, however, a smaller amount of connections increased in C1 as compared to C2, while no differences between C2 and sham were appreciated. At the group level, C1-induced modulations primarily included temporo-occipital areas and distinct cerebellar regions. This functional pattern was anatomically consistent with the estimated distribution of the induced electric field in the C1 condition. Finally, at the individual level, the extent of tDCS-induced rs-fMRI modulation in C1 was predicted by baseline resting-state connectivity and simulation-based electric field magnitude.\n\nDiscussionOur results highlighted that multifocal tDCS procedures can effectively change neural dynamics in the elderly consistently with the spatial distribution of the estimated electric fields on the brain. Furthermore, we showed that specific brain factors that have been revealed to explain part of the individual variability to NIBS in young samples are also relevant in older adults. In accordance, designing multifocal tDCS configurations based on specific fMRI patterns appears to be a valuable approach to precisely adjust those complex neural dynamics sustaining cognition that are affected as a function of age. Furthermore, these innovative NIBS-based interventions should be individually-tailored based on subject-specific structural and functional data to ultimately boost their potential in aged populations.",

The functional changes occurring at these synapses during aging are not fully understood. Here, we characterized this aging process in IHCs of C57BL/6J mice, a strain which is known to carry a cadherin23 mutation and experiences early hearing loss with age. These mice, while displaying a large increase in auditory brainstem thresholds due to 50 % loss of IHC synaptic ribbons at middle age (postnatal day 365), paradoxically showed enhanced acoustic startle reflex suggesting a hyperacusis-like response. The auditory defect was associated with a large shrinkage of the IHCs cell body and a drastic enlargement of their remaining presynaptic ribbons which were facing enlarged postsynaptic AMPAR clusters. Presynaptic Ca2+ microdomains and the capacity of IHCs to sustain high rates of exocytosis were largely increased, while on the contrary the expression of the fast repolarizing BK channels, known to negatively control transmitter release, was decreased. This age-related synaptic plasticity in IHCs suggested a functional potentiation of synaptic transmission at the surviving synapses, a process that could partially compensate the decrease in synapse number and underlie hyperacusis.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials of novel therapeutics for Alzheimers Disease (AD) have consumed a large amount of time and resources with largely negative results. Repurposing drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for another indication is a more rapid and less expensive option. Repurposing can yield a useful therapeutic and also accelerate proof of concept studies that ultimately lead to a new molecular entity. We present a novel machine learning framework, DRIAD (Drug Repurposing In AD), that quantifies potential associations between the pathology of AD severity (the Braak stage) and molecular mechanisms as encoded in lists of gene names. DRIAD was validated on gene lists known to be associated with AD from other studies and subsequently applied to evaluate lists of genes arising from perturbations in differentiated human neural cell cultures by 80 FDA-approved and clinically tested drugs, producing a ranked list of possible repurposing candidates. Top-scoring drugs were inspected for common trends among their nominal molecular targets and their \"off-targets\", revealing a high prevalence of kinases from the Janus (JAK), Unc-51-like (ULK) and NIMA-related (NEK) families. These kinase families are known to modulate pathways related to innate immune signaling, autophagy, and microtubule formation and function, suggesting possible disease-modifying mechanisms of action. We propose that the DRIAD method can be used to nominate drugs that, after additional validation and identification of relevant pharmacodynamic biomarker(s), could be evaluated in a clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency is known to be associated with symptoms of skeletal muscle myopathy including muscle weakness and fatigue. Recently, vitamin D related metabolites have been linked to the maintenance of mitochondrial function within skeletal muscle. However, current evidence is limited to in vitro models and the effects of diet-induced vitamin D deficiency upon skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in vivo have received little attention. In order to examine the role of vitamin D in the maintenance of mitochondrial function in vivo, we utilised an established model of diet-induced vitamin D deficiency in C57BL/6J mice. Mice were fed either a control (2,200 IU/kg) or a vitamin D deplete (0 IU/kg) diet for periods of 1-, 2- and 3-months. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and ADP sensitivity were assessed via high-resolution respirometry and mitochondrial protein content via immunoblotting. As a result of 3-month of diet-induced vitamin D deficiency, respiration supported via CI+IIP and ETC were 35% and 37% lower when compared to vitamin D replete mice (P < 0.05). Despite functional alterations, the protein expression of electron transfer chain subunits remained unchanged in response to dietary intervention (P > 0.05). In conclusion, we report that 3-months of diet-induced vitamin D deficiency reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in C57BL/6J mice. Our data, when combined with previous in vitro observations, suggests that vitamin D mediated regulation of mitochondrial function may underlie the exacerbated muscle fatigue and performance deficits observed during vitamin D deficiency.",

    "abstract": "The investigation of brain networks has yielded many insights that have helped to characterise many neurological and psychiatric disorders. In particular, network classification of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is an important tool for the identification of prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers of brain connectivity disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. However, existing generic network classification methods provide no direct information on the underlying molecular mechanisms of the selected functional connectivity features when applied to fMRI data. To address this, we propose a novel fMRI network classification method that incor-porates brain transcriptional data using a user-specified gene set collection (GSC) to construct feature groups for use in classification of brain connectivity data. The use of GSCs are an opportunity to incorporate knowledge of potential molecular mechanisms which may be associated with a disease. The inclusion of transcriptional data yields improved prediction accuracy on publicly available schizophrenia fMRI data for several of the GSCs we consider. We also introduce a post-hoc interpretation framework to provide transcriptional-data-guided biological interpretations for discriminative functional connectivity features identified by existing fMRI network classification methods.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation has been widely reported to associate with the progression of glioma. DNA methylation at the 5 position of cytosine (5-methylcytosine, 5mC), which is regulated by 5mC regulators (\"writers\", \"erasers\" and \"readers\"), is the most critical modification pattern. However, a systematic study on the role of these regulators in glioma is still lacking. In this study, we collected gene expression profiles and corresponding clinical information of gliomas from three independent public datasets. Gene expression of 21 5mC regulators was analyzed and linked to clinicopathological features. A novel molecular classification of glioma was developed using consensus non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) algorithm, and the tight association with molecular characteristics as well as tumor immune microenvironment was clarified. Sixteen prognostic factors were identified using univariate Cox regression analysis, and a 5mC regulator-based gene signature was further constructed via the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) cox analysis. This risk model was proved as an efficient predictor of overall survival for diffuse glioma, glioblastoma (GBM), and low-grade glioma (LGG) patients in three glioma cohorts. The significant correlation between risk score and intratumoral infiltrated immune cells, as well as immunosuppressive pathways, was found, which explained the difference in clinical outcomes between high and low-risk groups. Finally, a nomogram incorporating the gene signature and other clinicopathological risk factors was established, which might direct clinical decision making. In summary, our work highlights the potential clinical application value of 5mC regulators in prognostic stratification of glioma and their potentialities for developing novel treatment strategies.",

Thousands of species of soil animals feed on detritus and co-exist with apparently low specialisation in food resource use. Trophic niche differentiation may explain species coexistence in such a cryptic environment. However, most of the existing studies provide only few and isolated evidence on food resources, thus simplifying the multidimensional nature of the trophic niches available in soil.\nC_LIO_LIFocusing on one of the most diverse soil taxa - springtails (Collembola) - we aimed to reveal the additional value of information provided by four complementary methods: visual gut content-, digestive enzyme-, fatty acid- and stable isotope analyses, and to demonstrate the multidimensional nature of trophic niches.\nC_LIO_LIFrom 40 studies, we compiled fifteen key trophic niche parameters for 125 species, each analysed with at least one method. Focusing on interspecific variability, we explored correlations of trophic niche parameters and described variation of these parameters in different Collembola species, taxonomic groups and life forms.\nC_LIO_LICorrelation between trophic niche parameters of different methods was weak in 45 out of 64 pairwise comparisons, reflecting the complementarity of the multidimensional trophic niche approach. Gut content and fatty acids provided comparable information on fungivory and plant feeding in Collembola.

Many parameters were affected by taxonomic affiliation but not life form. Furthermore, we showed evidence of bacterial feeding, which may be more common in Collembola than usually assumed.\nC_LIO_LIDifferent methods reveal different feeding dimensions, together drawing a comprehensive picture of the trophic niche in taxa with diverse feeding habits.

    "abstract": "Reptiles have repeatedly invaded and thrived in aquatic environments throughout history, however fewer than 8% of the 6000 extant species are primarily aquatic. The Galapagos Marine Iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus), the worlds only marine lizard, may have had one of the most unique and challenging transitions to aquatic life. Curiously, previous studies have identified relatively few physiological adaptations in Marine Iguanas, however, little is known about the extent of morphological specialisation and performance trade-offs associated with the marine environment. By examining the morphology and locomotory performance of the Marine Iguana in comparison to their closely related mainland ancestors, the Black Spiny-tailed iguana (Ctenosaura similis) and Green Iguana (Iguana iguana), we found variation reflected specialisation to ecological niches. However, variation was more pronounced among subspecies of Marine Iguana, suggesting that little morphological or performance modification is required for iguanids to successfully invade aquatic environments, thus raising the question why there are so few extant aquatic reptilian lineages. We found that specialisation for the marine environment resulted in a trade-off in sprint speed in a terrestrial environment, similar to that seen in extant crocodilians. Reduced performance in a terrestrial environment likely poses little risk to large-bodied apex predators, whereas in iguanids, a performance trade-off would likely incur increased predation. As such, we suggest that this may explain why iguanids and other ancestral lineages have not undergone transitions to aquatic life. Additionally, we found that the magnitude of morphological and performance variation was more pronounced between subspecies of Marine Iguana than between iguanid species.\n\nSummary StatementThe Marine Iguana has undergone a unique evolutionary transition to aquatic behaviour, we explore the extent of morphological and performance specialisation required and why there are so few extant marine reptiles.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "The looming stimulus-evoked flight response is an experimental paradigm for studying innate defensive behaviors. However, how the visual looming stimulus is transmitted from the retina to the brain remains poorly understood. Here, we report that superior colliculus (SC)-projecting RGCs transmit the looming signal from the retina to the brain to mediate the looming-evoked flight behavior by releasing GABA. In the mouse retina, GABAergic RGCs are capable of projecting to many brain areas, including the SC. Superior colliculus (SC)-projecting GABAergic RGCs (spgRGCs) are mono-synaptically connected to the parvalbumin-positive SC neurons known to be required for the looming-evoked flight response. Optogenetic activation of spgRGCs triggers GABA-mediated inhibition in SC neurons. The ablation or silence of spgRGCs compromises looming-evoked flight response but not image-forming functions. Therefore, this study shows that spgRGCs control the looming-evoked flight response by regulating SC neurons via GABA, providing novel insight into the regulation of innate defensive behaviors.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that cyclic, but not static, mechanical loading has anabolic effects on bone. However, the function describing the relationship between the loading frequency and the amount of bone adaptation remains unclear. Using a combined experimental and computational approach, this study aimed to investigate whether bone mechano-regulation is controlled by mechanical signals in the local in vivo environment and dependent on loading frequency. Specifically, by combining in vivo micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging with micro-finite element (micro-FE) analysis, we monitored the changes in microstructural as well as the mechanical in vivo environment (strain energy density (SED) and SED gradient) of mouse caudal vertebrae over 4 weeks of either cyclic loading at varying frequencies of 2Hz, 5Hz, or 10Hz, respectively or static loading. Higher values of SED and SED gradient on the local tissue level led to an increased probability of bone formation and a decreased probability of bone resorption. In all loading groups, the SED gradient was superior in the determination of local bone formation and resorption events as compared to SED. Cyclic loading induced positive net remodeling rates when compared to sham and static loading, mainly due to an increase in mineralizing surface and a decrease in eroded surface. Consequently, bone volume fraction increased over time in 2Hz, 5Hz and 10Hz (+15%, +21% and +24%, p<0.0001), while static loading led to a decrease in bone volume fraction (-9%, p[&le;]0.001). Furthermore, regression analysis revealed a logarithmic relationship between loading frequency and the net change in bone volume fraction over the four week observation period (R2=0.74). In conclusion, these results suggest that bone adaptation is regulated by mechanical signals in the local in vivo environment and furthermore, that mechano-regulation is logarithmically dependent on loading frequency with frequencies below a certain threshold having catabolic effects, and those above anabolic effects. This study thereby provides valuable insights towards a better understanding of the mechanical signals influencing bone formation and resorption in the local in vivo environment.",

    "abstract": "Whole-cell inactivated vaccine against Bordetella pertussis (wP) was substituted in many countries by an acellular subunit vaccine (aP) to reduce side effects. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that aP vaccination in infancy induces less durable immunity than wP vaccination. To determine immunological differences associated with aP vs. wP priming, we performed system-level profiling of the immune response in adults primed with aP vs. wP vaccine in infancy following the Tdap booster vaccination as a surrogate to antigen encounter in vivo. Shared immune responses across cohorts were identified, including an increase of the blood monocyte frequency on day 1, and strong antigen-specific IgG response seven days after boost. Comparing aP and wP primed individuals, we found a subset of aP-primed individuals with higher levels of expression for several genes including CCL3 on day 3 and NFKBIA and ICAM1 on day 7 post immunization. These observations were supported by increased CCL3 concentrations in plasma of aP primed individuals. Contrary to the wP individuals, the CCL3-high aP subset presented boosted PT-specific IgE responses. Furthermore, higher antigen specific IgG4 and IgG3 antibodies against specific vaccine antigens at baseline and post boost of aP individuals was observed, suggesting a long term maintained difference in the IgG subtype response. Overall our findings demonstrate that, while broad immune response patterns to Tdap boost overlap between aP and wP primed individuals, a subset of aP primed individuals present a divergent response. These findings provide candidate targets to study the causes and correlates of waning immunity after aP vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Autonomic nerves convey essential neural signals that regulate vital body functions. Recording clearly distinctive physiological neural signals from autonomic nerves will help develop new treatments for restoring regulatory functions. However, this is very challenging due to the small nature of autonomic nerves and the low-amplitude signals from their small axons. We developed a multi-channel, high-density, intraneural carbon fiber microelectrode array (CFMA) with ultra-small electrodes (8-9 m in diameter, 150-250 m in length) for recording physiological action potentials from small autonomic nerves. In this study, we inserted CFMA with up to 16 recording carbon fibers in the cervical vagus nerve of 22 isoflurane-anesthetized rats. We recorded action potentials with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 15.1-91.7 V and signal-to-noise ratios of 2.0-8.3 on multiple carbon fibers per experiment, determined conduction velocities of some vagal signals in the afferent (0.7-4.4 m/sec) and efferent (0.7-8.8 m/sec) directions, and monitored firing rate changes in breathing and blood glucose modulated conditions. Overall, these experiments demonstrated that CFMA is a novel interface for in-vivo intraneural action potential recordings. This work is considerable progress towards the comprehensive understanding of physiological neural signaling in vital regulatory functions controlled by autonomic nerves.",

    "abstract": "The factors shaping the distribution of giant tropical trees are poorly understood, despite its importance as a link between evolutionary biology and ecosystem biogeochemistry. The recent discovery of clusters of trees over 80 metres tall in the Guiana Shield region of the Amazon rainforest challenges the current understanding of the factors controlling the growth and survival of giant trees. The new discovery led us to revisit the question: what determines the distribution of the tallest trees of the Amazon?\n\nHere, we used high-resolution airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) surveys to measure canopy height across 282,750 ha of primary old-growth and secondary forests throughout the entire Brazilian Amazon to investigate the relationship between the occurrence of giant trees and the environmental factors that influence their growth and survival. Our results suggest that the factors controlling where trees grow extremely tall are distinct from those controlling their longevity. Trees grow taller in areas with high soil clay content (> 42%), lower radiation (< 130 clear days per year) and wind speeds, avoiding alluvial areas (elevations higher than 40 m a.s.l), and with an optimal precipitation range of 1,500 to 2,500 mm yr-1. We then used an envelope model to determine the environmental conditions that support the very tallest trees (i.e. over 70 m height). We found that, as opposed to the myriad of interacting factors that control the maximum height at a large scale, wind speed had by far the largest influence on the distribution of these sentinel trees, and explained 67% of the probability of finding trees over 70 m in the Brazilian Amazon forest.\n\nThe high-resolution pan-Amazon LiDAR data showed that environmental variables that drive growth in height are fundamentally different from environmental variables that support their survival. While precipitation and temperature seem to have lower importance for their survival than expected from previous studies, changes in wind and radiation regimes could reshape our forested biomes. This should be carefully considered by policy-makers when identifying important hotspots for the conservation of biodiversity in the Amazon.",

    "abstract": "While maize with anthocyanin-rich pericarp (purple corn) is rising in popularity as a source of natural colorant for foods and beverages, information on color range and stability--factors associated with anthocyanin decorations and compositional profiles--are currently limited. Using the natural anthocyanin diversity present in a purple corn landrace, Apache Red, we generated a population with variable flavonoid profiles--flavonol-anthocyanin condensed forms (0-83%), acylated anthocyanins (2-72%), pelargonidin-derived anthocyanins (5-99%), and C-glycosyl flavone co-pigments up to 1904 {micro}g/g--all of which contributed in part to the absorbance profile, used here as a proxy for hue. This variability offers targets of selection for breeders looking to expand both stability and the available range of colors that can be sourced from purple corn. With genotyping-by-sequencing of this population we mapped these anthocyanin profile traits. Major QTL for anthocyanin type were found near loci previously identified only in aleurone-pigmented maize varieties [Purple aleurone1 (Pr1) and Anthocyanin acyltransferase1 (Aat1)]. A QTL near P1 (Pericarp color1) was found for both flavone content and flavanol-anthocyanin condensed forms. A significant QTL associated with peonidin-derived anthocyanins near a candidate S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase was also identified, warranting further investigation. This population represents the most anthocyanin diverse pericarp-pigmented maize variety characterized to date. Moreover, the candidates identified here will serve as branching points for future research studying the genetic and molecular processes determining anthocyanin profile in pericarp.",

    "abstract": "Critical periods - brief intervals where neural circuits can be modified by sensory input - are necessary for proper neural circuit assembly. Extended critical periods are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and autism; however, the mechanisms that ensure timely critical period closure remain unknown. Here, we define the extent of a critical period in the developing Drosophila motor circuit, and identify astrocytes as essential for proper critical period termination. During the critical period, decreased activity produces larger motor dendrites with fewer inhibitory inputs; conversely, increased motor neuron activity produces smaller motor dendrites with fewer excitatory inputs. Importantly, activity has little effect on dendrite morphology after critical period closure. Astrocytes invade the neuropil just prior to critical period closure, and astrocyte ablation prolongs the critical period. Finally, we use a genetic screen to identify astrocyte-motor neuron signaling pathways that close the critical period, including Neuroligin-Neurexin signaling. Reduced signaling destabilizes dendritic microtubules, increases dendrite dynamicity, and impairs locomotor behavior, underscoring the importance of critical period closure. Previous work defines astroglia as regulators of plasticity at individual synapses; here, we show that astrocytes also regulate large-scale structural plasticity to motor dendrite, and thus, circuit architecture to ensure proper locomotor behavior.",

To get better insights into their evolutionary origin, we examined the developmental origin of a visual relay nucleus in zebrafish (a teleost fish). Similarly to the tectofugal visual thalamic nuclei in amniotes, the lateral part of the preglomerular complex (PG) in teleosts receives tectal information and projects to the pallium. However, our cell lineage study reveals that the majority of PG cells are derived from the midbrain, not from the forebrain. We also demonstrate that the PG projection neurons develop gradually until juvenile stage, unlike the thalamic projection neurons. Our data suggest that teleost PG is not homologous to the amniote thalamus and that thalamocortical-like projections can evolve from a non-forebrain cell population. Thus, sensory pathways in vertebrate brains exhibit a surprising degree of variation.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental set of cognitive abilities enable humans to efficiently process goal-relevant information, suppress irrelevant distractions, maintain information in working memory, and act flexibly in different behavioral contexts. Yet, studies of human cognition and their underlying neural mechanisms usually evaluate these cognitive constructs in silos, instead of comprehensively in-tandem within the same individual. Here, we developed a scalable, mobile platform, \"BrainE\" (short for Brain Engagement), to rapidly assay several essential aspects of cognition simultaneous with wireless electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Using BrainE, we rapidly assessed five aspects of cognition including (1) selective attention, (2) response inhibition, (3) working memory, (4) flanker interference and (5) emotion interference processing, in 102 healthy young adults. We evaluated stimulus encoding in all tasks using the EEG neural recordings, and isolated the cortical sources of the spectrotemporal EEG dynamics. Additionally, we used BrainE in a two-visit study in 24 young adults to investigate the reliability of the neuro-cognitive data as well as its plasticity to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We found that stimulus encoding on multiple cognitive tasks could be rapidly assessed, identifying common as well as distinct task processes in both sensory and cognitive control brain regions. Event related synchronization (ERS) in the theta (3-7 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) frequencies as well as event related desynchronization (ERD) in the beta frequencies (13-30 Hz) were distinctly observed in each task. The observed ERS/ERD effects were overall anticorrelated. The two-visit study confirmed high test-retest reliability for both cognitive and neural data, and neural responses showed specific TMS protocol driven modulation. We also show that the global cognitive neural responses are sensitive to mental health symptom self-reports. This first study with the BrainE platform showcases its utility in studying neuro-cognitive dynamics in a rapid and scalable fashion.\n\nHighlightsO_LIRapid and scalable EEG recordings reveal common and distinct cortical activations across five core cognitive tasks.\nC_LIO_LIData acquired across visits one-week-apart show high test-retest reliability for both cognitive and neural measurements.\nC_LIO_LIEvoked neural responses during emotion interference processing demonstrate specific short-term plasticity driven by type of neurostimulation.\nC_LIO_LICognitively evoked neural responses are sensitive to variations in mental health symptoms.\nC_LI",

These chaperones function to aid the correct folding of client proteins using an ATP-dependent mechanism. Though Hsc70 is accepted to be a constitutively expressed protein, it has a well-documented function in modulating the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF by the LPS/TLR4 pathway. In this work we attempt to identify protein clients of Hsc70 to gain insight into those which may be responsible for this regulatory effect. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 1 g/mL LPS for 0 to 24 hours. Herein we describe of a large number of newly-categorized Hsc70 clients using immunoprecipitation and nanoLC-MS/MS and we validate several novel Hsc70/client interactions using co-immunoprecipitation. After performing immunoprecipitation using a commercially available antibody, eluted fractions were proteolytically digested either immediately after immunoprecipitation or after separation by SDS-PAGE and sequence analyzed using nanoLC-MS/MS with a Q-Exactive Plus triple-quadrupole/orbitrap mass spectrometer.

    "abstract": "Annotating all cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) and transcription factor (TF) binding sites(TFBSs) in genomes remains challenging. We tackled the task by integrating putative TFBSs motifs found in available 6,092 datasets covering 77.47% of the human genome. This approach enabled us to partition the covered genome regions into a CRM candidate (CRMC) set (56.84%) and a non-CRMC set (43.16%). Intriguingly, like known enhancers, the predicted 1,404,973 CRMCs are under strong evolutionary constraints, suggesting that they might be cis-regulator. In contrast, the non-CRMCs are largely selectively neutral, suggesting that they might not be cis-regulatory. Our method substantially outperforms three state-of-the-art methods (GeneHancers, EnhancerAtlas and ENCODE phase 3) for recalling VISTA enhancers and ClinVar variants, as well as by measurements of evolutionary constraints. We estimated that the human genome might encode about 1.46 million CRMs and 67 million TFBSs, comprising about 55% and 22% of the genome, respectively; for both of which, we predicted 80%.

    "abstract": "Pain is essential for our survival by protecting us from severe injuries. Pain signals may be exacerbated by continued physical activities but can also be interrupted or over-ridden by physical movements, a process called movement-induced analgesia. A number of neural mechanisms have been proposed to account for this effect, including the reafference principle, the gate control theory of pain, and the top-down psychological modulation. Given that the analgesic effects of these mechanisms are temporally overlapping, it is unclear whether movement-induced analgesia results from a single neural mechanism or the joint action of multiple neural mechanisms. To address this question, we conducted five experiments on 130 healthy human subjects. First, the frequency of hand shaking was manipulated in order to quantify the relationship between the strength of the voluntary movement and the analgesic effect. Second, the temporal delay (between hand shaking and nociceptive laser stimuli) and the stimulated side (nociceptive laser stimuli were delivered on the hand ipsilateral or contralateral to the shaken one) were manipulated to quantify the temporal and spatial characteristics of the analgesic effect induced by voluntary movement. Combining psychophysics and electroencephalographic recordings, we demonstrated that movement-induced analgesia is a result of the joint action of multiple neural mechanisms. This investigation is the first to disentangle the distinct contributions of different neural mechanisms to the analgesic effect of voluntary movement. These findings extend our understanding of sensory attenuation arising from voluntary movement and may prove instrumental in the development of new strategies in pain management.",

The three major LHb outputs innervate dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). LHb neurons that project to these targets are segregated and nonoverlapping, and this led us to consider whether they have distinct molecular phenotypes and adaptations to stress exposure. In order to capture a time-locked profile of gene expression after repeated forced swim stress, we used intersectional expression of RiboTag in rat LHb neurons and next-gen RNA sequencing to interrogate the RNAs actively undergoing translation from each of these pathways. The \"translatome\" in the neurons comprising these pathways was similar at baseline, but diverged after stress, especially in the neurons projecting to the RMTg. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we found one module comprising genes downregulated after stress in the RMTg-projecting LHb neurons; there was an overrepresentation of genes associated with phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling in this module. Reduced PI3K signaling in RMTg-projecting LHb neurons may be a compensatory adaptation that alters the functional balance of LHb outputs to GABAergic vs. monoaminergic neurons following repeated stress exposure.",

To examine the neural mechanisms underlying these behaviors, we developed a novel auditory selective listening paradigm for monkeys. In this task, monkeys had to detect a difficult to discriminate target embedded in noise when presented in a pre-cued location (either left or right) and ignore it if it was in the opposite location. While the animals carried out the task we recorded neural activity in primary auditory cortex (AC), dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the basal lateral amygdala (BLA), given that these areas have been implicated in auditory decision making, selective listing, and/or reward-guided decision making. There were two main findings in the neural data. First, primary AC encoded the side of the cue and target, and the monkeys choice, before either dlPFC or the amygdala. The BLA encoded cue and target variables negligibly, but was engaged at the time of the monkeys choice. Second, decoding analyses suggested that errors followed primarily from a failure to encode the target stimulus in both AC and PFC, but earlier in AC. Thus, AC neural activity is poised to represent the sensory volley and decision making during selective listening before dlPFC, and they both precede activity in BLA.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in quantitative imaging of T1, T2 and diffusion contrast in the brain due to greater robustness against bias fields and artifacts, as well as better biophysical interpretability in terms of microstructure. However, acquisition time constraints are a challenge, particularly when multiple quantitative contrasts are desired and when extensive sampling of diffusion directions, high b-values or long diffusion times are needed for multi-compartment microstructure modeling. Although ultra-high fields of 7 T and above have desirable properties for many MR modalities, the shortening T2 and the high specific absorption rate (SAR) of inversion and refocusing pulses bring great challenges to quantitative T1, T2 and diffusion imaging. Here, we present the MESMERISED sequence (Multiplexed Echo Shifted Multiband Excited and Recalled Imaging of STEAM Encoded Diffusion). MESMERISED removes the dead time in Stimulated Echo Acquisition Mode (STEAM) imaging by an echo-shifting mechanism. The echo-shift (ES) factor is independent of multiband (MB) acceleration and allows for very high multiplicative (ESxMB) acceleration factors, particularly under moderate and long mixing times. This results in super-acceleration and high time efficiency at 7 T for quantitative T1 and diffusion imaging, while also retaining the capacity to perform quantitative T2 and B1 mapping. We demonstrate the super-acceleration of MESMERISED for whole-brain T1 relaxometry with total acceleration factors up to 36 at 1.8 mm isotropic resolution, and up to 54 at 1.25 mm resolution qT1 imaging, corresponding to a 6x and 9x speedup, respectively, compared to MB-only accelerated acquisitions. We then demonstrate highly efficient diffusion MRI with high b-values and long diffusion times in two separate cases. First, we show that super-accelerated multi-shell diffusion acquisitions with 370 whole-brain diffusion volumes over 8 b-value shells up to b = 7000 s/mm2 can be generated at 2 mm isotropic in under 8 minutes, a data rate of almost a volume per second, or at 1.8 mm isotropic in under 11 minutes, achieving up to 3.4x speedup compared to MB-only. A comparison of b = 7000 s/mm2 MESMERISED against standard MB pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) diffusion imaging shows 70% higher SNR efficiency and greater effectiveness in supporting complex diffusion signal modeling. Second, we demonstrate time-efficient sampling of different diffusion times with 1.8 mm isotropic diffusion data acquired at four diffusion times up to 290 ms, which supports both Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) at each diffusion time. Finally, we demonstrate how adding quantitative T2 and B1+ mapping to super-accelerated qT1 and diffusion imaging enables efficient quantitative multi-contrast mapping with the same MESMERISED sequence and the same readout train. MESMERISED extends possibilities to efficiently probe T1, T2 and diffusion contrast for multi-component modeling of tissue microstructure.",

    "abstract": "Acute cardiovascular exercise has shown to promote neuroplastic processes, and thus to improve the consolidation of newly acquired motor skills in healthy adults. First results suggest that this concept may be transferred to populations with motor and cognitive dysfunctions. In this context, Parkinsons disease (PD) is highly relevant since patients demonstrate deficits in motor learning. Hence, in the present study we sought to explore the effect of a single post-practice exercise bout on motor memory consolidation in PD patients.\n\nFor this purpose, 17 PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr: 1 - 2.5, age: 60.1 {+/-} 7.9 y) practiced a whole-body task followed by either (i) a moderate-intense bout of cycling, or (ii) seated rest for a total of 30 minutes. The motor task required the participants to balance on a tiltable platform (stabilometer) for 30 seconds. During skill practice, patients performed 15 trials followed by a retention test 1 day and 7 days later. We calculated time in balance (platform within {+/-} 5{degrees} from horizontal) for each trial and within- and between-group differences in memory consolidation (i.e. offline learning = skill change from last acquisition block to retention tests) were analyzed.\n\nGroups revealed similar improvements during skill practice (F4,60 = .316, p = .866), but showed differences in offline learning, which was only evident after 7 days (F1,14 = 5.602, p = .033).\n\nOur results suggest that a single post-practice exercise bout is effective in enhancing long-term motor memory consolidation in a population with motor learning impairments. This may point at unique promoting effects of exercise on dopamine neurotransmission involved in memory formation. Future studies should investigate the potential role of exercise-induced effects on the dopaminergic system.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAcute exercise enhanced motor memory consolidation in PD\nC_LIO_LIEffects were evident only at 7-day retention\nC_LIO_LIResults may indicate unique exercise-effects on the dopaminergic system\nC_LIO_LIFindings show promising potential of exercise for motor rehabilitation\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Evidence associates cardiovascular risk factors with unfavorable systemic and neuro-inflammation and cognitive decline in the elderly. Cardiovascular therapeutics (e.g., statins and anti-hypertensives) possess immune-modulatory functions in parallel to their cholesterol- or blood pressure (BP)-lowering properties. How their ability to modify immune responses affects cognitive function is unknown. Here, we examined the effect of chronic hypercholesterolemia on inflammation and memory function in Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout mice and normocholesterolemic wild-type mice. Chronic hypercholesterolemia that was accompanied by moderate blood pressure elevations associated with apparent immune system activation characterized by increases in circulating pro-inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes in ApoE-/- mice. The persistent low-grade immune activation that is associated with chronic hypercholesterolemia facilitates the infiltration of pro-inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes into the brain of aged ApoE-/- but not wild-type mice, and links to memory dysfunction. Therapeutic cholesterol-lowering through simvastatin reduced systemic and neuro-inflammation, and the occurrence of memory deficits in aged ApoE-/- mice with chronic hypercholesterolemia. BP-lowering therapy alone (i.e., hydralazine) attenuated some neuro-inflammatory signatures but not the occurrence of memory deficits. Our study suggests a link between chronic hypercholesterolemia, myeloid cell activation and neuro-inflammation with memory impairment and encourages cholesterol-lowering therapy as safe strategy to control hypercholesterolemia-associated memory decline during ageing.",

These fluorophores fall into various classes (e.g. fluorescent dyes, fluorescent proteins, etc.), but they all share some general properties (such as excitation and emission spectra, brightness) and require similar equipment for data acquisition. Selecting an ideal set of fluorophores for a particular measurement technology or vice versa is a multidimensional problem that is difficult to solve with ad hoc methods due to the enormous solution space of possible fluorophore panels. Choosing sub-optimal fluorophore panels can result in unreliable or erroneous measurements of biochemical properties in model systems.

    "abstract": "Some Pyropia species, such as nori (P. yezoensis), are important marine crops. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 39 samples of Pyropia species grown in Japan using organellar genome sequences. A comparison of the chloroplast DNA sequences with those from China showed a clear genetic separation between Japanese and Chinese P. yezoensis. Conversely, comparing the mitochondrial DNA sequences did not separate Japanese and Chinese P. yezoensis. Analysis of organellar genomes showed that the genetic diversity of Japanese P. yezoensis used in this study is lower than that of Chinese wild P. yezoensis. To analyze the genetic relationships between samples of Japanese Pyropia, we used whole-genome resequencing to analyze their nuclear genomes. In the offspring resulting from cross-breeding between P. yezoensis and P. tenera, nearly 90% of the genotypes analyzed by mapping were explained by the presence of different chromosomes originating from two different parental species. Although the genetic diversity of Japanese P. yezoensis is low, analysis of nuclear genomes genetically separated each sample. Samples isolated from the sea were often genetically similar to those being farmed. Study of genetic heterogeneity of samples within a single aquaculture strain of P. yezoensis showed that samples were divided into two groups and the samples with frequent abnormal budding formed a single, genetically similar group. The results of this study will be useful for breeding and the conservation of Pyropia species.",

    "abstract": "Over-expression and aggregation of -synuclein (ASyn) are linked to the onset and pathology of Parkinsons disease and related synucleinopathies. Elevated levels of the stress induced chaperone, Hsp70, protects against ASyn misfolding and ASyn-driven neurodegeneration in cell and animal models, yet there is minimal mechanistic understanding of this important protective pathway. It is generally assumed that Hsp70 binds to ASyn using its canonical and promiscuous substrate-binding cleft to limit aggregation. Here we report that this activity is due to a novel and unexpected mode of Hsp70 action, involving neither ATP nor the typical substrate-binding cleft. We use novel ASyn oligomerization assays to show that Hsp70 directly blocks ASyn oligomerization, an early event in ASyn misfolding. Using truncations, mutations and inhibitors, we confirmed that Hsp70 interacts with ASyn via an as yet unidentified, non-canonical interaction site in the C-terminal domain. Finally, a biological role for a non-canonical interaction was observed in H4 neuroglioma cells. Together, these findings suggest that new chemical approaches will be required to target Hsp70-ASyn interaction in synucleinopathies. Such approaches are likely to be more specific than targeting Hsp70 canonical actions. Additionally, these results raise the question of whether other misfolded proteins might also engage via the same non-canonical mechanism.",

Our time-dependent approaches allowed us to obtain both the transient dynamics and the steady state values for the main statistical moments of the cell-size distribution. Also, we established mathematical relationships among the statistics in the two considered perspectives, thus improving our knowledge of how cells control their growth and proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Intercellular mechanisms by which the stromal microenvironment contributes to solid tumor progression and targeted therapy resistance remain poorly understood, presenting significant clinical hurdles. PEAK1 (Pseudopodium-Enriched Atypical Kinase One) is an actin cytoskeleton- and focal adhesion-associated pseudokinase that promotes cell state plasticity and cancer metastasis by mediating growth factor-integrin signaling crosstalk. Here, we determined that stromal PEAK1 expression predicts poor outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancers high in SNAI2 expression and enriched for MSC content. Notably, we identified that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) express high PEAK1 protein levels and MSCs require PEAK1 to potentiate tumorigenesis, lapatinib resistance and metastasis of HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Analysis of PEAK1-dependent secreted factors from MSCs revealed a CCL4-, INHBA- and GDF5-focused network that converged on PI3K/Akt signaling. In this regard, we observed that MSC expression of PEAK1 is required for sustained Akt phosphorylation in neighboring HER2-positive breast cancer cells following lapatinib treatment. Finally, we uncovered a significant correlation between INHBA and PEAK1 expression levels in breast cancer, and that INHBA is an excellent predictor of disease relapse and decreased survival in HER2-positive tumors enriched for PEAK1 expression and MSC content. Importantly, we provide the first evidence that PEAK1 promotes tumorigenic phenotypes through a previously unrecognized SNAI2-PEAK1-INHBA-PI3K/Akt stromal to tumor cell signaling axis. These results establish a new, targetable intercellular mechanism that may be leveraged to improve targeted therapy responses and patient outcomes in breast cancer and other stroma-rich malignancies.",

Of particular interest is the Western-style diet, enriched with {omega}-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that accumulate in membrane phospholipids and oxidize into pronociceptive oxylipins3,4. Here we report that mice administered a diet enriched with {omega}-6 PUFAs develop persistent nociceptive hypersensitivities, spontaneously-active and hyper-responsive glabrous afferent fibers, and histologic markers of peripheral nerve damage reminiscent of a peripheral neuropathy. Linoleic and arachidonic acids accumulate in lumbar dorsal root ganglia, with increased liberation via elevated PLA2 activity. Pharmacological and molecular inhibition of PLA2g7 or diet reversal with high {omega}-3 PUFAs attenuate nociceptive behaviors, neurophysiologic abnormalities, and afferent histopathology induced by high {omega}-6 intake. In addition, {omega}-6 accumulation exacerbates the intensity or duration of allodynia observed in preclinical inflammatory and neuropathic pain models, as well as in clinical diabetic neuropathy. Collectively, these data reveal diet as a novel etiology of peripheral neuropathy and risk factor for chronic pain, and implicate multiple therapeutic considerations for clinical pain management.",

    "abstract": "Infants and adults respond differently to brain injuries. Specifically, improved neuronal sparing along with reduced astrogliosis and glial scarring often observed earlier in life, likely contributes to improved long-term outcomes. Understanding the underlying mechanisms could enable the recapitulation of neuroprotective effects, observed in infants, to benefit adult patients after brain injuries. We reveal that in primates, Eph/ ephrin signaling contributes to age-dependent reactive astrocyte behavior. Ephrin-A5 expression on astrocytes was more protracted in adults, whereas ephrin-A1 was associated only with infant astrocytes. Furthermore, ephrin-A5 exacerbated major hallmarks of astrocyte reactivity via EphA2 and EphA4 receptors, which was subsequently alleviated by ephrin-A1. Rather than suppressing reactivity, ephrin-A1 signaling shifted astrocytes towards GAP43+ neuroprotection, accounting for improved neuronal sparing in infants. Reintroducing ephrin-A1 after middle-aged ischemic stroke significantly attenuated glial scarring, improved neuronal sparing and preserved circuitry. Therefore, beneficial infant mechanisms can be recapitulated in adults to improve outcomes after CNS injuries.",

    "abstract": "In vivo chemical cross-linking combined with LCMSMS of digested extracts (in vivo CX-MS) can reveal stable and dynamic protein-protein interactions at a proteome wide-scale and at the peptide level. In vivo CX-MS requires a membrane permeable and cleavable cross-linker that enables isolation of target peptides and a fast and sensitive search engine to identify the linked peptides. Here we explore the use of the search engine pLink 2 for analysis of a previously obtained LCMSMS dataset from exponentially growing Bacillus subtilis treated in culture with the cross-linker bis(succinimidyl)-3-azidomethyl-glutarate (BAMG). Cross-linked peptide pairs were identified by pLink 2 in very short time at an overall FDR of < 5%. To also obtain a FDR < 5% for inter-protein cross-linked peptide pairs additional thresholds values were applied for matched fragment intensity and for the numbers of unambiguous y and b ions to be assigned for both composite peptides. Threshold values were based on a set of decoy sequences from yeast and human sequence databases. Also the mass- and charge-dependent retention times of target peptides purified by diagonal strong cation exchange chromatography were used as a criterion to distinguish true from false positives. After this filtering, pLink 2 identified more than 80% of previously reported protein-protein interactions.

Based on these criteria we assessed that the FDR of the fraction of non-redundant inter-protein cross-linked peptide pairs was approx. 20-25% by interrogating an entire species specific database at an overall FDR of 5% or 0.1% with a search engine that otherwise scores best in sensitivity among other search engines. We have defined a composite filter to decrease this high FDR of inter-protein cross-linked peptide pairs to only about 2%.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromised individuals. It is surrounded by three concentric structures that separate the cell from the extracellular space: the plasma membrane, the cell wall and the polysaccharide capsule. Although several studies have revealed the chemical composition of these structures, little is known about their ultrastructural organization and remodeling during C. neoformans budding event. Here, by combining the state-of-the-art in light and electron microscopy techniques we describe the morphological remodeling that occurs synergistically among the capsule, cell wall and plasma membrane during budding in C. neoformans. Our results show that the cell wall deforms to generate a specialized budding region at one of the cells poles. This region subsequently begins to break into layers that are slightly separated from each other and with thick tips. We also observe a reduction in density of the capsular polysaccharide around these specialized regions. Daughter cells present a distinct spatial organization, with polysaccharide fibers aligned in the direction of budding. In addition, to control the continuous openings between mother and daughter cells, the latter developed a strategy to shield themselves by forming multilamellar membrane structures in conjunction with their capsules. Together, our findings provide compelling ultrastructural evidence for a dynamic C. neoformans surface remodeling during budding and may have important implications for future studies exploring these remodeled specialized regions as drug-targets against cryptococcosis.",

    "abstract": "Altered neural excitability is considered a prominent contributing factor to cognitive decline during aging. A clear example is the excess neural activity observed in several temporal lobe structures of cognitively impaired older individuals in rodents and humans. At a cellular level, aging-related changes in mechanisms regulating intrinsic excitability have been well examined in pyramidal cells of the CA1 hippocampal subfield. Studies in the inbred Fisher 344 rat strain document an age-related increase in the slow afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that normally occurs after a burst of action potentials, and serves to reduce subsequent firing. We evaluated the status of the AHP in the outbred Long-Evans rat, a well-established model for studing individual differences in neurocognitive aging. In contrast to the findings reported in the Fisher 344 rats, in the Long-Evan rats we detected a selective reduction in AHP in cognitively impaired aged individuals. We discuss plausible scenarios to account for these differences and also discuss possible implications of these differences.",

    "abstract": "In humans, brown adipose tissue (BAT) undergoes progressive involution or atrophy with increasing age, as manifested by decreased prevalence and mass, transformation to white adipose tissue (WAT), and reduction in thermogenic activity. This involution process cannot be fully recapitulated in rodent models and thus underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that the interscapular BAT (iBAT) in rabbits involutes rapidly in early life, similarly to that in humans. The transcriptomic remodeling and identity switch of mature adipocytes are accompanied with the loss of brown adipogenic competence of their precursor cells. Through single-cell RNA sequencing, we surveyed the heterogenous populations of mesenchymal cells within the stromal vascular fraction of rabbit and human iBAT. An analogous FSTL1high population of brown adipocyte progenitors exists in both species while gradually disappear during iBAT involution in rabbits. In mice, FSTL1 is highly expressed by adipocyte progenitors in iBAT and genetic deletion of FSTL1 causes defective WNT signaling and iBAT atrophy in neonates. Our results underscore the BAT-intrinsic contribution from FSTL1high progenitors to age-related tissue involution and point to a potential therapeutic approach for obesity and its comorbidities.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIRabbit BAT irreversibly transforms to WAT before puberty.\nC_LIO_LIiBAT adipocyte progenitors reprogram transcriptome and lose brown adipogenic ability.\nC_LIO_LIComparable FSTL1high brown adipocyte progenitors exist in rabbit and human iBAT.\nC_LIO_LILoss of FSTL1 in brown adipocyte progenitors causes iBAT atrophy in mice.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global pandemic that threatens to bring long-term changes worldwide. Approximately 80% of infected patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms such as fever or cough, while rest of the patients have varying degrees of severity of symptoms, with 3-4% mortality rate. Severe symptoms such as pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome can be caused by tissue damage mostly due to aggravated and unresolved innate and adaptive immune response, often resulting from a cytokine storm. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of such responses remain elusive, with an incomplete understanding of how an intricate interplay among infected cells and cells of innate and adaptive immune system can lead to such diverse clinicopathological outcomes. Here, we use a dynamical systems approach to dissect the emergent nonlinear intra-host dynamics among virally infected cells, the immune response to it and the consequent immunopathology. By mechanistic analysis of cell-cell interactions, we have identified key parameters affecting the diverse clinical phenotypes associated with COVID-19. This minimalistic yet rigorous model can explain the various phenotypes observed across the clinical spectrum of COVID-19, various co-morbidity risk factors such as age and obesity, and the effect of antiviral drugs on different phenotypes. It also reveals how a fine-tuned balance of infected cell killing and resolution of inflammation can lead to infection clearance, while disruptions can drive different severe phenotypes. These results will help further the case of rational selection of drug combinations that can effectively balance viral clearance and minimize tissue damage simultaneously.\n\nSignificance StatementThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already infected millions of people, and thousands of lives have been lost to it. The pandemic has already tested the limits of our public healthcare systems with a wide spectrum of clinicopathological symptoms and outcomes. The mechanistic underpinnings of the resultant immunopathology caused by the viral infection still remains to be elucidated. Here we propose a minimalistic but rigorous description of the interactions of the virus infected cells and the core components of the immune system that can potentially explain such diversity in the observed clinical outcomes. Our proposed framework could enable a platform to determine the efficacy of various treatment combinations and can contributes a conceptual understanding of dynamics of disease pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

    "abstract": "In the medical field, the analysis of the blood sample of the patient is a critical task. Abnormalities in blood cells are accountable for various health issues. Red blood cells (RBCs) are one of the major components of blood. Classifying the RBC can allow us to diagnose different diseases. The traditional time consuming technique of visualizing RBC manually under the microscope is a tedious task and may lead to wrong interpretation because of the human error. The various health conditions can change the shape, texture, and size of normal RBCs. The proposed method has involved the use of image processing to classify the RBCs with the help of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). The algorithm can extract the feature of each segmented cell image and classify it in various types as Microcytes, Elliptocytes, Stomatocytes, Macrocytes, Teardrop RBCs, Codocytes, Spherocytes, Sickel cell RBCs and Howell jolly RBCs. Classification is done with respect to the size, shape, and appearance of RBCs. The experiment was conducted on the blood slide collected from the hospital and RBC images were extracted from those blood slide images. The obtained results compared with reports obtained by the pathology lab and realized 98.5% accuracy. The developed system provides accurate and fast results due to which it may save the life of patients.",

    "abstract": "The daily organisation of most mammalian cellular functions is attributed to circadian regulation of clock-controlled protein expression, driven by daily cycles of CRYPTOCHROME-dependent transcriptional feedback repression. To test this, we compared the circadian proteome and phosphoproteome of wild type and CRY-deficient fibroblast cells. Strikingly, CRY-deficient cells showed a two-fold increase in circadian-regulated proteins, phosphopeptides, and K+ transport. This was accompanied by extensive remodelling of the cellular proteome overall, including reduced phosphatase and proteasome subunit expression. These adaptations rendered CRY-deficient cells more sensitive to stress, which may account for their reduced circadian robustness and contribute to the wide-ranging phenotypes of CRY-deficient mice. We suggest that CRY ultimately functions to suppress, rather than generate, daily rhythms in cellular protein abundance, thereby maintaining protein and osmotic homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The severity of the new COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is strikingly variable in different global populations. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cell receptor, TMPRSS2 protease, and FURIN peptidase to invade human cells. Here, we investigated 1,378 whole-exome sequences of individuals from the Middle Eastern populations (Kuwait, Qatar, and Iran) to explore natural variations in the ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN genes. We identified two activating variants (K26R and N720D) in the ACE2 gene that are more common in Europeans than in the Middle Eastern, East Asian, and African populations. We postulate that K26R can activate ACE2 and facilitate binding to S-protein RBD while N720D enhances TMPRSS2 cutting and, ultimately, viral entry. We also detected deleterious variants in FURIN that are frequent in the Middle Eastern but not in the European populations. This study highlights specific genetic variations in the ACE2 and FURIN genes that may explain SARS-CoV-2 clinical disparity. We showed structural evidence of the functionality of these activating variants that increase the SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness. Finally, our data illustrate a significant correlation between ACE2 variants identified in people from Middle Eastern origins that can be further explored to explain the variation in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates globally.",

We present an approach for reliable SV discovery in non-model species using whole genome sequencing and report 15,483 high-confidence SVs in 492 Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) sampled from a broad phylogeographic distribution. These SVs recover population genetic structure with high resolution, include an active DNA transposon, widely affect functional features, and overlap more duplicated genes retained from an ancestral salmonid autotetraploidization event than expected. Changes in SV allele frequency between wild and farmed fish indicate polygenic selection on behavioural traits during domestication, targeting brain-expressed synaptic networks linked to neurological disorders in humans. This study offers novel insights into the role of SVs in genome evolution and the genetic architecture of domestication traits, along with resources supporting reliable SV discovery in non-model species.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a recently-emerged zoonotic pathogen already well adapted to transmission and replication in humans. Although the mutation rate is limited, recently introduced mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to alter viral fitness. In addition to amino acid changes, mutations could affect RNA secondary structure critical to viral life cycle, or interfere with sequences targeted by host miRNAs. We have analysed subsets of genomes from SARS-CoV-2 isolates from around the globe and show that several mutations introduce changes in Watson-Crick pairing, with resultant changes in predicted secondary structure. Filtering to targets matching miRNAs expressed in SARS-CoV-2 permissive host cells, we identified twelve separate target sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 genome; eight of these targets have been lost through conserved mutations. A genomic site targeted by the highly abundant miR-197-5p, overexpressed in patients with cardiovascular disease, is lost by a conserved mutation. Our results are compatible with a model that SARS-CoV-2 replication within the human host could be constrained by host miRNA defence. The impact of these and further mutations on secondary structures, miRNA targets or potential splice sites offers a new context in which to view future SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and a potential platform for engineered viral attenuation and antigen presentation.",

Semen was cryopreserved in 0.5 ml French straws. Thawing was done at 5{degrees}C for 100 sec in ice water in Experiments 1, 2 and 4, whereas in Experiment 3 thawing was done at 37{degrees}C for 30 sec. The post-thaw sperm motility, live sperm and percent acrosome intact sperm were significantly (P<0.05) lower in cryopreserved samples in all the experiments. No fertile eggs were obtained from cryopreserved samples in Experiments 1 and 2, except for 8% EG RFE treatment where the fertility was 0.83%. In Experiments 3 and 4, highest fertility was obtained in LRD treatment 48.12 and 30.89% respectively. In conclusion, using cryoprotectant EG (8%) and thawing at 37{degrees}C for 30 sec, and DMF (6%) resulted in acceptable level of fertility in Ghagus chicken. Though the diluents influenced post-thaw in vitro semen parameters the fertility was not affected.

Plants BiPs belong to a multi-gene family contributing to development, immunity, and responses to environmental stresses. This study identified three BiP homologues in the Solanum tuberosum (potato) genome using phylogenetic, amino acid sequence, 3-D protein modeling and gene structure analysis. These analyses revealed that StBiP1 and StBiP2 grouped with AtBiP2, whereas StBiP3 grouped with AtBiP3. While the protein sequences and folding structures are highly similar, these StBiPs are distinguishable by their expression patterns in different tissues and in response to environmental stressors such as treatment with heat, chemicals, or virus elicitors of UPR. Ab initio promoter analysis revealed that potato and Arabidopsis BiP1 and BiP2 promoters were highly enriched with cis regulatory elements (CREs) linked to developmental processes, whereas BiP3 promoters were enriched with stress-related CREs. The frequency and linear distribution of these CREs produced two phylogenetic branches that further resolve the groups identified through gene phylogeny and exon/intron phase analysis. These data reveal that the CRE architecture of BiP promoters potentially define their spatio -temporal expression patterns under developmental and stress related cues.",

Systems-level analysis of one of these novel compounds, DJ34, revealed that it induced depletion of c-Myc and activation of p53. c-Myc depletion occurred in a wide range of tumor types, including leukemia, lymphoma, lung, glioblastoma and breast cancer. Further analyses revealed that DJ34 interferes with c-Myc synthesis at the level of transcription, and we provide data showing that DJ34 is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor. Physiologically, DJ34 induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and cell differentiation, and primary leukemic stem cells were particularly sensitive to DJ34. Taken together, we have identified a novel compound that dually targets c-Myc and p53 in a wide variety of cancers, and with particularly strong activity against leukemic stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Many biological processes happen on a nano-to millimeter scale and within milliseconds. Established methods such as confocal microscopy are suitable for precise 3D recordings but lack the temporal or spatial resolution to resolve fast 3D processes and require labeled samples. Multifocal imaging (MFI) allows high-speed 3D imaging but is limited by the compromise between high spatial resolution and large field-of-view (FOV), and the requirement for bright fluorescent labels. Here, we provide a new open-source 3D reconstruction algorithm for multifocal images that allows using MFI for fast, precise, label-free tracking spherical and filamentous structures in a large FOV and across a high depth. We characterize fluid flow and flagellar beating of human and sea urchin sperm with a high z-precision of 0.15 m, in a large volume of 240 x 260 x 21 m, and at high speed (500 Hz). The large sampling volume allowed to follow sperm trajectories while simultaneously recording their flagellar beat. Our MFI concept is cost-effective, can be easily implemented, and does not rely on object labeling, which renders it broadly applicable.",

    "abstract": "Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) are capable of specifically activating a TRPC1-mitochondrial axis underlying cell expansion and mitohormetic survival adaptations. This study characterizes cell-derived vesicles (CDVs) generated from C2C12 murine myoblasts and shows that they are equipped with the sufficient molecular machinery to confer mitochondrial respiratory capacity and associated proliferative responses upon their fusion with recipient cells. CDVs derived from wild type C2C12 myoblasts include the cation-permeable transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, TRPC1 and TRPA1, and directly respond to PEMF exposure with TRPC1-mediated calcium entry. By contrast, CDVs derived from C2C12 muscle cells in which TRPC1 had been genetically knocked-down using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, do not. Wild type C2C12-derived CDVs are also capable of restoring PEMF-induced proliferative and mitochondrial activation in two C2C12-derived TRPC1 knockdown clonal cell lines in accordance to their endogenous degree of TRPC1 suppression. C2C12 wild type CDVs respond to menthol with calcium entry and accumulation, likewise verifying TRPA1 functional gating and further corroborating compartmental integrity. Proteomic and lipidomic analyses confirm the surface membrane origin of the CDVs providing an initial indication of the minimal cellular machinery required to recover mitochondrial function. CDVs hence possess the potential of restoring respiratory and proliferative capacities to senescent cells and tissues.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial keratitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a destructive disease of cornea. Pseudomonas keratitis progresses rapidly and leads to vision loss if untreated. Even with adequate treatment, many patients show poor visual outcomes. The virulence factors or multiple drug-resistant (MDR) mechanisms of the ocular strains responsible for poor clinical outcomes remain largely unknown. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing of five P. aeruginosa strains cultured from corneal scrapings of the healed and corneal buttons of the poor outcome keratitis patients. We investigated the distribution of virulence factors, resistance genes and resistance-associated mutations, the efflux-pump system in all five genomes, and as groups between poor and good clinical outcome as well as MDR vs. non-MDR. We detected several resistance genes and mutations associated with drug resistance in MDR groups; however, a large number of virulence genes were detected in all our genomes. Among the virulence genes, exoU and exoS exotoxin of the Type III secretion system detected in MDR and non-MDR strains, respectively, considered as main virulence contributors of keratitis pathogenesis. Despite this fact, this study did not show an association between MDR with exoU and poor clinical outcomes. However, strain-specific resistance and virulence genes were observed in this study, suggesting their role in the clinical outcome. Mainly, the flagellar genes fliC and fliD, reported to altering the host immune response, might impact the clinical outcome. This comparative study may provide new insights into the genome of ocular strains and requires further functional studies.",

    "abstract": "Bacteroides fragilis has previously been linked to Crohns disease (CD) exacerbations, but results are inconsistent and underlying mechanisms unknown. This study investigates the epidemiology of B. fragilis and its virulence factors bft (enterotoxin) and ubiquitin among 181 CD patients and the impact on the intestinal epithelial barrier in vitro.\n\nThe prevalence of B. fragilis was significantly higher in active (n=69/88, 78.4%) as compared to remissive (n=58/93, 62.4%, p=0.018) CD patients. Moreover, B. fragilis was associated with intestinal strictures. Interestingly, the intestinal barrier function, as examined by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements of Caco-2 monolayers, improved when exposed to secretomes of bft-positive (increased TEER [~]160%, p<0.001) but not when exposed to bft- negative strains. Whole metagenome sequencing and metabolomics, respectively, identified 19 coding sequences and two metabolites that discriminated TEER-increasing from non-TEER-increasing strains.\n\nThis study revealed a higher B. fragilis prevalence during exacerbation. Surprisingly, bft-positive secretomes improved epithelial resistance.",

    "abstract": "Rubisco, the key enzyme of CO2 fixation in photosynthesis, is prone to inactivation by inhibitory sugar phosphates. Inhibited Rubisco undergoes conformational repair by the hexameric AAA+ chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca) in a process that is not well understood. Here we performed a structural and mechanistic analysis of cyanobacterial Rca, a close homolog of plant Rca. In the Rca:Rubisco complex, Rca is positioned over the Rubisco catalytic site under repair and pulls the N-terminal tail of the large Rubisco subunit (RbcL) into the hexamer pore. Simultaneous displacement of the C-terminus of the adjacent RbcL opens the catalytic site for inhibitor release. An alternative interaction of Rca with Rubisco is mediated by C-terminal domains that resemble the small Rubisco subunit. These domains, together with the N-terminal AAA+ hexamer, ensure that Rca is packaged with Rubisco into carboxysomes. Cyanobacterial Rca is a dual-purpose protein with functions in Rubisco repair and carboxysome organization.",
