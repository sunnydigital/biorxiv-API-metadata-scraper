    "abstract": "Symbiodiniaceae are the source of essential coral symbionts of reef building corals. The growth and density of endosymbiotic Symbodiniaceae within the coral host is highly dependent on nutrient availability, yet little is known about how Symbiodiniaceae respond to the dynamics of the nutrients, including switch between different chemical forms and changes in abundance. In this study, we investigated physiological, cytometric, and transcriptomic responses in Fugacium kawagutii to nitrogen (N)-nutrient deficiency and different chemical N forms (nitrate and ammonium) in batch culture conditions. We mainly found that ammonium was consumed faster than nitrate when provided separately, and was preferentially utilized over nitrate when both nitrogen compounds were supplied at 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1 molarity ratios. Besides, N-deficiency caused decreases in growth, energy production, antioxidative capacity and investment in photosynthate transport but increased energy consumption. Growing on ammonium produced a similar cell yield as nitrate, but with a decreased investment in nutrient transport and assimilation. These all have important implications of N nutrient to support symbiosis in coral ecosystem, especially regarding ammonium. In addition, by integrating our current results with previous data, we identified ten highly and stably expressed genes as candidate reference genes, which will be potentially useful for gene expression studies in the future.",

    "abstract": "AbtractSesquiterpenoids are important secondary metabolites with various pharma- and nutraceutical properties. In particular, higher basidiomycetes possess a versatile biosynthetic repertoire for these bioactive compounds. To date, only a few microbial production systems for fungal sesquiterpenoids have been established. Here, we introduce Ustilago maydis as a novel production host. This model fungus is a close relative of higher basidiomycetes. It offers the advantage of metabolic compatibility and potential tolerance for substances toxic to other microorganisms. We successfully implemented a heterologous pathway to produce the carotenoid lycopene that served as a straightforward read-out for precursor pathway engineering. Overexpressing genes encoding enzymes of the mevalonate pathway resulted in increased lycopene levels. Verifying the subcellular localisation of the relevant enzymes revealed that initial metabolic reactions might take place in peroxisomes: despite the absence of a canonical peroxisomal targeting sequence, acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase Aat1 localised to peroxisomes. By expressing the plant (+)-valencene synthase CnVS and the basidiomycete sesquiterpenoid synthase Cop6, we succeeded in producing (+)-valencene and -cuprenene, respectively. Importantly, the fungal compound yielded about tenfold higher titres in comparison to the plant substance. This proof of principle demonstrates that U. maydis can serve as promising novel chassis for the production of terpenoids.",
