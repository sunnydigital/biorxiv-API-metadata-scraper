    "abstract": "During wakeful rest, individuals make small eye movements when asked to fixate. We examined how these endogenously-driven oculomotor patterns impact topography and topology of functional brain networks. We used a dataset consisting of eyes-open resting-state (RS) fMRI data with simultaneous eye-tracking (Nilsonne et al., 2016). The eye-tracking data indicated minor movements during rest, on the order of 1.0 degree on average when analyzed over 2sec epochs, which correlated modestly with RS BOLD data. However, the eye-tracking data correlated well with echo-planar imaging (EPI) time series sampled from the area of the Eye-Orbit (EO-EPI), which is a signal previously used to identify eye movements during exogenous saccades and movie viewing. We found that EO-EPI data correlated with activity in an extensive motor and sensory-motor network, but also some components of the dorsal attention network including the frontal and supplementary eye fields. Partialling out variance related to EO-EPI from RS data reduced connectivity, primarily between sensory-motor and visual areas. For three different network sparsity levels, the resulting RS connectivity networks showed higher modularity, lower mean connectivity strength, and lower mean clustering coefficient. Our results highlight new aspects of endogenous eye movement control during wakeful rest. They show that oculomotor-related contributions form an important component of RS network topology, and that those should be considered in interpreting differences in network structure between populations, or as a function of different experimental conditions.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in the neuroscience community to map the distribution of brain metabolites in vivo. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is often limited by either a poor spatial resolution and/or a long acquisition time which severely limits its applications for clinical or research purposes. Building on a recently developed technique of acquisition-reconstruction for 2D MRSI, we combined fast Cartesian 1H-FID-MRSI acquisition sequence, compressed-sensing acceleration, and low-rank total-generalized-variation constrained reconstruction to produce 3D high-resolution whole-brain MRSI with a significant acquisition time reduction. We first evaluated the acceleration performance using retrospective undersampling of a fully-sampled dataset. Second, a 20 min accelerated MRSI acquisition was performed on the brain of three healthy volunteers resulting in metabolite maps with 5 mm isotropic resolution. The metabolite maps exhibited the detailed neurochemical composition of all brain regions and revealed parts of the underlying brain anatomy. The latter assessment used previous reported knowledge and a brain atlas-based analysis to show consistency of the concentration contrasts and ratio across all brain regions. These results acquired on a clinical 3 Tesla MRI successful combinae of the 3D 1H-FID-MRSI with a constrained reconstruction to produce detailed mapping of metabolite concentrations at high-resolution over the whole brain, with an acquisition time suitable for clinical or research settings.",

Despite improved understanding of phytoplankton diversity and genomics, we lack nanoscale subcellular imaging approaches to understand their physiology and cell biology. Here, we present a complete Focused Ion Beam - Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) workflow (from sample preparation to image processing) to generate nanometric 3D phytoplankton models. Tomograms of entire cells, representatives of six ecologically-successful phytoplankton unicellular eukaryotes, were used for quantitative morphometric analysis. Besides lineage-specific cellular architectures, we observed common features related to cellular energy management: i) conserved cell-volume fractions occupied by the different organelles; ii) consistent plastid-mitochondria interactions, iii) constant volumetric ratios in these energy-producing organelles. We revealed detailed subcellular features related to chromatin organization and to biomineralization. Overall, this approach opens new perspectives to study phytoplankton acclimation responses to abiotic and biotic factors at a relevant biological scale.",

    "abstract": "Convergent trait evolution is a recurrent phenomenon in all domains of the tree of life. While some convergent traits are caused by simple sequence changes, many are associated with extensive changes to the sequence and regulation of large cohorts of genes. It is unknown how organisms traverse this expansive genotype space to assemble such complex convergent phenotypes. C4 photosynthesis is a paradigm of large-scale phenotypic convergence. Conceptual and mathematical models propose that C4 photosynthesis evolved from ancestral C3 photosynthesis through sequential adaptive changes. These adaptive changes could have been rapidly assembled if modifications to the activity and abundance of enzymes of the C4 cycle was neutral in C3 plants. This neutrality would enable populations of C3 plants to maintain genotypes with expression levels of C4 enzymes analogous to those in C4 species and thus enable rapid assembly of a functional C4 cycle from naturally occurring genotypes given shared environmental selection. Here we show that there is substantial natural variation in expression of genes encoding C4 cycle enzymes between natural accessions of the C3 plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We further show through targeted transgenic experiments in the C3 crop Oryza sativa, that high expression of the majority of C4 cycle enzymes in rice is neutral with respect to growth, development, biomass and photosynthesis. Thus, substantial variation in the abundance and activity of C4 cycle enzymes is permissible within the limits of operation of C3 photosynthesis and the emergence of component parts of this complex convergent trait can be facilitated by neutral variation.",

    "abstract": "Interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are DNA lesions frequently induced by chemotherapy that interfere with essential processes such as replication and transcription. ICL repair may be initiated by the convergence of two replication forks at the crosslink, which results in a termination-like DNA structure recognized and processed by the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway. An alternative possibility to generate a suitable substrate for ICL repair involves \"ICL traverse\", a DNA damage tolerance mechanism in which a single fork arriving at the ICL can skip the lesion and restart DNA synthesis from a downstream point. This reaction requires FANCM translocase, the BLM/TOP3A/RMI1-2 (BTR) complex and other factors. Here we report that PrimPol, the second primase-polymerase identified in mammalian cells after Pol/Primase, interacts with BTR and participates in the ICL traverse reaction. A functional complementation assay reveals that the primase activity of PrimPol is required, confirming the need for re-priming events during ICL traverse. Genetic ablation of PRIMPOL strongly impaired this tolerance mechanism, making cells more dependent on fork convergence to initiate ICL repair. PRIMPOL KO cells and mice display hypersensitivity to ICL-inducing drugs, opening the possibility of targeting PrimPol activity to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy based on DNA crosslinking agents.",

    "abstract": "ZC3H5 is an essential cytoplasmic trypanosome protein with a single Cx7Cx5Cx3H zinc finger domain. We here show that ZC3H5 forms a complex with three other proteins, encoded by genes Tb927.11.4900, Tb927.8.1500 and Tb927.7.3040. ZC3H5 interacts directly with Tb927.11.4900, which in turn interacts with Tb927.7.3040. Tb927.11.4900 has a circularly permuted GTPase domain, which is required for the Tb927.7.3040 interaction. RNA immunoprecipitation revealed that ZC3H5 is preferentially associated with poorly translated, low-stability mRNAs, the 5-untranslated regions and coding regions of which are enriched in the motif (U/A)UAG(U/A). Tethering of ZC3H5, or other complex components, to a reporter repressed its expression. However, depletion of ZC3H5 in vivo did not increase the abundance of ZC3H5-bound mRNAs: instead, counter-intuitively, there were very minor decreases in a few targets, and marked increases in the abundances of very stable mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins. Depletion also resulted in an increase in monosomes at the expense of large polysomes, and appearance of \"halfmer\" disomes containing two 80S subunits and one 40S subunit. We speculate that the ZC3H5 complex might be implicated in quality control during the translation of sub-optimal open reading frames; complex assembly might be regulated by GTP hydrolysis and GTP-GDP exchange.",

    "abstract": "The cytoskeleton determines cell mechanics and lies at the heart of important cellular functions. Growing evidence suggests that the manifold tasks of the cytoskeleton rely on the interactions between its filamentous components - actin filaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules. However, the nature of these interactions and their impact on cytoskeletal dynamics are largely unknown. Here, we show in a reconstituted in vitro system that vimentin intermediate filaments stabilize microtubules against depolymerization and support microtubule rescue. To understand these stabilizing effects, we directly measured the interaction forces between individual microtubules and vimentin filaments. Combined with numerical simulations, our observations provide detailed insight into the physical nature of the interactions and how they affect microtubule dynamics. Thus, we describe an additional, direct mechanism for cells to establish the fundamental cross-talk of cytoskeletal components alongside linker proteins. Moreover, we suggest a novel strategy to estimate the binding energy of tubulin dimers within the microtubule lattice.",

    "abstract": "Despite the strong genetic basis of psychiatric disorders, the molecular origins of these diseases are still largely unmapped. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are responsible for most post-transcriptional regulation, from splicing to translational to localization. RBPs thus act as key gatekeepers of cellular homeostasis, especially in the brain. Here, we leverage a deep learning approach to interrogate variant effects genome-wide, and discover that the dysregulation of RBP target sites is a principal contributor to psychiatric disorder risk. We show that specific modes of RBP regulation are genetically linked to the heritability of psychiatric disorders, and demonstrate that diverse RBP regulatory functions are reflected in distinct genome-wide negative selection signatures. Notably, RBP dysregulation has a stronger impact on psychiatric disorders than common coding region variants and explains heritability not currently captured by large-scale molecular QTL studies (expression QTLs and splicing QTLs). We share genome-wide profiles of RBP target site dysregulation, which we used to identify DDHD2 as a candidate schizophrenia risk gene, in a public web server. This resource provides a novel analytical framework to connect the full range of RNA regulation to complex disease.",

These metrics were used to assess a) mapping of reads to the reference genome, b) degree of DNA damage, and c) variant calling. Reads from both sets mapped with similar efficiencies, had similar overall DNA damage rates, measured by the mismatch rate with the reference genome, and produced variant calls sets with similar Transition-Transversion ratios. While evaluating single nucleotide changes that may have arisen from DNA damage, we observed that the A>T and T>A changes were more frequent in DNA from DBS than from WB. However, this did not affect the accuracy of variant calling, with DBS samples yielding a comparable count of high quality SNVs and indels in samples with at least 50x coverage.\n\nConclusionsOverall, DBS DNA provided exome sequencing data of sufficient quality for clinical interpretation.",

The exact etiology of this increased risk in unknown, and thus, several animal models have been developed to investigate the neuroimmune interactions of PTSD. Repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) is an established preclinical model of psychological trauma that recapitulates certain behavioral and inflammatory aspects of human PTSD. Furthermore, RSDS has been utilized to subgroup animals into susceptible and resilient populations based on one specific behavioral phenotype (i.e., social interaction). Herein, we conducted an extensive investigation of circulating inflammatory proteins after RSDS, and found significant elevations in various cytokines and chemokines after exposure to psychological trauma. When categorizing animals into either susceptible or resilient populations based on social interaction, we found no inflammatory or other behavioral differences between these subgroups. Furthermore, assessment of associations between all detectable inflammatory proteins and behavioral outputs found no significant correlation between social interaction parameters and inflammation. In contrast, we identified a panel of 5 circulating inflammatory proteins that showed significant associations with elevated zero maze parameters. Strikingly, these 5 circulating inflammatory proteins displayed a stronger predictive ability of psychological trauma exposure compared to any behavioral outcome. These findings provide new insights into inflammatory markers associated with RSDS, and their ability to predict psychological trauma exposure more robustly than commonly utilized behavioral paradigms.\n\nHighlightsO_LIRepeated social defeat stress (RSDS) reproducibly produces peripheral inflammation\nC_LIO_LIPeripheral inflammation is not coupled to social interaction testing parameters\nC_LIO_LISusceptible and resilient categorization does not reflect peripheral inflammation\nC_LIO_LIAnxiety-like behavioral parameters are linked to peripheral inflammation in RSDS\nC_LIO_LIPeripheral inflammation is more predictive of trauma than behavior in RSDS\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify the potential and mechanisms of microbubble-mediated cavitation in promoting apoptosis and suppressing invasion in cancer cells. AsPC-1 cells were used and divided into four groups: control group, microbubble-only (MB) group, ultrasound-only (US) group, and ultrasound combined with microbubbles (US+MB) group. Pulse ultrasound was used with a frequency of 360 kHz and an intensity of 0.7 W/cm2 for 1 min (duty rate=50%). Then cells in four groups were cultured for 24 h. Cell counting kit-8 illustrated that US+MB could decrease cell viability. Western blot confirmed that US+MB increased cleaved Caspase-3, Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), and decreased the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) levels. Besides, US+MB increased intracellular calcium ions and down-regulated cleaved Caspase-8. For proliferation ability, cells in US+MB group had a lower expression of Ki67 and the weakened colony formation ability. The transwell invasion assay showed that US+MB could decrease invasion ability in AsPC-1 cells. Further evidence showed that cells conducted with US+MB had the lower level of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and Vimentin and the higher expression of E-cadherin than the other three groups. Finally, cells conducted with US+MB had less invadopodia formation. In conclusion, these results suggested that microbubble-mediated cavitation promoted apoptosis and suppressed invasion in AsPC-1 cells.\n\nSignificanceCancer cells have a high rate of cell division and a high rate of cell division can speed up the development of hypoxia which lead to promote cancer invasion and metastasis. Here we used microbubble-mediated cavitation to generate a mechanical shock wave which could effectively kill cancer cells through physical damage and intrinsic signaling pathway. Furthermore, effective killing of cancer cells could restrain the development of hypoxia and prevent invasion ability of cancer cells.",

Spontaneous loss of micronuclear envelope integrity exposes DNA to the cytoplasm, leading to chromosome fragmentation and innate immune activation. Despite connections to cancer genome evolution and anti-tumor immunity, the mechanisms underlying damage and immune sensing of micronuclear DNA are poorly understood. Here, we use a novel method for the purification of micronuclei and live-cell imaging to show that the ER-associated nuclease TREX1 inhibits cGAS sensing of micronuclei by stably associating with and degrading micronuclear DNA upon micronuclear envelope rupture. We identify a TREX1 mutation, previously associated with autoimmune disease, that untethers TREX1 from the ER, disrupts TREX1 localization to micronuclei, alleviates micronuclear DNA damage, and enhances cGAS recognition of micronuclei. Together, these results establish ER-directed resection of micronuclear DNA by TREX1 as a critical regulator of cytosolic DNA sensing in chromosomally unstable cells and provide a mechanistic basis for the importance of TREX1 ER-tethering in preventing autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "Recently, immunotherapeutic modalities with engineered cells and monoclonal antibodies have been effective in treating several malignancies. However, growing evidence suggests that immune-related adverse events (irAE) lead to severe and long-term side effects. Most iRAEs involve prolonged circulation of antibodies. To address this problem, nucleic acid aptamers can serve as alternative molecules to design immunotherapeutics with high functional diversity and predictable circulation times. Here, we report the first synthetic prototype consisting of DNA aptamers, which can activate T-cell receptor cluster of differentiation 3 (TCR-CD3) complex in cultured T-cells. We show that activation potential is similar to that of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against TCR-CD3, suggesting the potential of aptamers in developing efficacious synthetic immunomodulators. The synthetic prototype of anti-TCR-CD3{varepsilon}, as described herein, was designed using aptamer ZUCH-1 against TCR-CD3{varepsilon}, generated by Ligand Guided Selection (LIGS). Aptamer ZUCH-1 was truncated and modified with nuclease-resistant RNA analogs to enhance stability. Several dimeric analogs with truncated and modified variants were designed with variable linker lengths to investigate the activation potential of each construct. Among them, dimeric aptamer with approximate dimensions similar to those of an antibody showed the highest T-cell-activation, suggesting the importance of optimizing linker lengths in engineering functional aptamers. The observed activation potential of dimeric aptamers shows the vast potential of aptamers in designing synthetically versatile immunomodulators with tunable pharmacokinetic properties, expanding immunotherapeutic designs with the use of nucleic acid-based ligands such as aptamers.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent tachycardia. The major injuries caused by AF are systemic embolism and heart failure. Although AF therapies have evolved substantially in recent years, the success rate of sinus rhythm maintenance is relatively low. The reason is the incomplete understanding of the AF mechanisms.\n\nMaterial and methodIn this study, profiles were downloaded from the GEO database (GSE79762). Bioinformatic analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). GO analysis and KEGG analysis were performed to identify the most enriched terms and pathways. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed to determine regulatory genes. Key modules and hub genes were identified by MOCDE and cytoHubba. Transcription factors (TFs) were predicted by PASTAA.\n\nResultsSeventy-seven up-regulated DEGs and 236 downregulated DEGs were identified. In the GO biological process, cellular components, and molecular function analysis, positive regulation of cell migration, anchoring junction and cell adhesion molecule binding were the most significant enrichment terms. The Hippo signaling pathway was the most significantly enriched pathway. In the PPI network analysis, we found that Class A/1 (rhodopsin-like receptors) may be the critical module in AF. Ten hub genes were extracted, including 4 upregulated genes and 6 downregulated genes. CXCR2, TLR4 and CXCR4 may play critical roles in AF. In TF prediction, we found that Irf-1 may be implicated in AF.\n\nConclusionOur study found that the CXCR4, TLR4, CXCR2; Hippo signaling pathway; and class A/1 (rhodopsin-like receptors) modules may play critical roles in AF occurrence and maintenance. This may provide novel targets for AF treatment.",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes are highly variable in some taxonomic groups, but the evolutionary mechanisms underlying this diversity are not well understood. In terrestrial isopod crustaceans, evolutionary turnovers in sex chromosomes are frequent, possibly caused by Wolbachia, a vertically-transmitted endosymbiont causing male-to-female sex reversal. Here, we use surgical manipulations and genetic crosses, plus genome sequencing, to examine sex chromosomes in the terrestrial isopod Trachelipus rathkei. Although an earlier cytogenetics study suggested a ZZ/ZW sex chromosome system in this species, we surprisingly find multiple lines of evidence that in our study population, sex is determined by an XX/XY system. Consistent with a recent evolutionary origin for this XX/XY system, the putative male-specific region of the genome is small. The genome shows evidence of Y-linked duplications of the gene encoding the androgenic gland hormone, a major component of male sexual differentiation in isopods. Our analyses also uncover sequences horizontally acquired from past Wolbachia infections, consistent with the hypothesis that Wolbachia may have interfered with the evolution of sex determination in T. rathkei. Overall, these results provide evidence for the co-occurrence of multiple sex chromosome systems within T. rathkei, further highlighting the relevance of terrestrial isopods as models for the study of sex chromosome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Genital divergence is thought to contribute to reproductive barriers by establishing a \"lock- and-key\" mechanism for reproductive compatibility. One such example, Macaca arctoides, the bear macaque, has compensatory changes in both male and female genital morphology as compared to close relatives. Macaca arctoides also has a complex evolutionary history, having extensive introgression between the fascicularis and sinica macaque species groups. Here, phylogenetic relationships were analyzed via whole genome sequences from five species, including M. arctoides, and two species each from the putative parental species groups. This analysis revealed [~]3x more genomic regions supported placement in the sinica species group as compared to the fascicularis species group. Additionally, introgression analysis of the M. arctoides genome revealed it is a mosaic of recent polymorphisms shared with both species groups. To examine the evolution of their unique genital morphology further, the prevalence of candidate genes involved in genital morphology were compared against genome-wide outliers in various population genetic metrics, while accounting for background variation in recombination rate. This analysis identified 66 outlier genes, including several genes that influence baculum morphology in mice, which were of interest since the bear macaque has the longest primate baculum. The mean of several metrics was statistically different in the candidate genes as compared to the rest of the genome, suggesting that genes involved in genital morphology have increased divergence and decreased diversity beyond expectations. These results highlight how extensive introgression may have contributed to reproductive isolation and shaped the unique genital morphology in the bear macaque.",

    "abstract": "Attention is automatically guided towards stimuli that match the contents of working memory. This has been studied extensively using simplified computer tasks, but it has never been investigated whether (yet often assumed that) memory-driven guidance also affects real-life search. Here we tested this open question in a naturalistic environment that closely resembles real life. In two experiments, participants wore a mobile eye-tracker, and memorized a color, prior to a search task in which they looked for a target word among book covers on a bookshelf. The memory color was irrelevant to the search task. Nevertheless, we found that participants gaze was strongly guided towards book covers that matched the memory color. Crucially, this memory-driven guidance was evident from the very start of the search period. These findings support that attention is guided towards working-memory content in real-world search, and that this is fast and therefore likely reflecting an automatic process.\n\nSignificance statementA core concept in the field of visual working memory (VWM) is that visual attention is automatically guided towards things that resemble the content of VWM. For example, if you hold the color red in VWM, your attention and gaze would automatically be drawn towards red things in the environment. So far, studies on such memory-driven guidance have only been done with well-controlled computer tasks that used simplified search displays. Here we address the crucial and open question of whether attention is guided by the content of VWM in a naturalistic environment that closely resembles real life. To do so, we conducted two experiments with mobile eye tracking. Crucially, we found strong memory-driven guidance from the very early phase of the search, reflecting that this is a fast, and therefore likely automatic, process that also driven visual search in real life.",

Using a novel MrgprC11CreERT2 transgenic mouse line, we labeled a small subset of itch-sensing neurons that express multiple itch-related molecules including MrgprA3, MrgprC11, histamine receptor H1, IL-31 receptor, 5-HT receptor 1F, natriuretic precursor peptide B, and neuromedin B. By combining sparse genetic labeling and whole-mount PLAP histochemistry, we found that itch-sensing skin arbors exhibit free endings with extensive axonal branching in the superficial epidermis and large receptive fields. These results revealed the unique morphological characteristics of itch-sensing neurons and provide novel insights into the basic mechanisms of itch transmission.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum resembles a feedforward, three-layer network of neurons in which the \"hidden layer\" consists of Purkinje cells (P-cells), and the output layer consists of deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) neurons. However, unlike an artificial network, P-cells are grouped into small populations that converge onto single DCN neurons. Why are the P-cells organized in this way, and what is the membership criterion of each population? To consider these questions, in this review I apply elementary mathematics from machine learning and assume that the output of each DCN neuron is a prediction that is compared to the actual observation, resulting in an error signal that originates in the inferior olive. This signal is sent to P-cells via climbing fibers that produce complex spikes. The same error signal from the olive must also guide learning in the DCN neurons, yet the olivary projections to the DCN are weak, particularly in adulthood. However, P-cells that form a population exhibit a special property: they can synchronize their complex spikes, which in turn suppresses activity of the DCN neuron that produced the erroneous output. Viewed in the framework of machine learning, it appears that the olive organizes the P-cells into populations so that through complex spike synchrony each population can act as a surrogate teacher for the DCN neuron it projects to. This error-dependent grouping of P-cells into populations gives rise to a number of remarkable features of behavior, including multiple timescales of learning, protection from erasure, and spontaneous recovery of memory.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to establish a feasible and robust magnetic resonance imaging protocol for the quantitative assessment of cardiac function in marmosets and to present normal values of cardiac function across different ages from young adult, middle-aged, to very old clinically healthy animals.Cardiac MRI of 33 anesthetized marmosets at the age of 2-15 years was performed at 9.4 T using IntraGate-FLASH that operates without any ECG-triggering and breath holding. Normalized to post-mortem heart weight, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LV-EDV) was significantly reduced in older marmosets. The LV end-systolic volume (LV-ESV) and the LV stroke volume (LV-SV) showed a similar trend while the LV ejection fraction (LV-EF) and wall thickening remained unchanged. Similar observations were made for the right ventricle. Moreover, the total ventricular myocardial volume was lower in older monkeys while no significant difference in heart weight was found.In conclusion, IntraGate-FLASH allowed for quantification of left ventricular cardiac function but seems to underestimate the volumes of the right ventricle. Although less strong and without significant sex differences, the observed age related changes were similar to previously reported findings in humans supporting marmosets as a model system for age related cardiovascular human diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Glycosylation is a ubiquitous and heterogeneous post-translational modification (PTM) used to accomplish a wide variety of critical cellular tasks. Recent advances in methods for enrichment and mass spectrometric analysis of intact glycopeptides have produced large-scale, high-quality glycoproteomics datasets, but interpreting this data remains challenging. In addition to being large, complex, and heterogeneous, glycans undergo fragmentation during vibrational activation, making common PTM search strategies ineffective for their identification. We present a computational tool called MSFragger-Glyco for fast and highly sensitive identification of N- and O-linked glycopeptides using open and glycan mass offset search strategies. Reanalysis of recently published N-glycoproteomics data resulted in annotation of 83% more glycopeptide-spectrum matches (glycoPSMs) than in previous results, which translated to substantial increases in the numbers of glycoproteins and glycosites that could be identified. In published O-glycoproteomics data, our method more than doubled the number of glycoPSMs annotated when searching the same peptides as the original search and resulted in up to a 6-fold increase when expanding searches to include large numbers of possible glycan compositions and other modifications. Expanded searches revealed trends in glycan composition and crosstalk with phosphorylation that remained hidden to the original search. With greatly improved spectral annotation, coupled with the fast speed of fragment ion index-based scoring, MSFragger-Glyco makes it possible to comprehensively interrogate glycoproteomics data and illuminate the many roles of glycosylation.",

    "abstract": "Temperature variability and extremes can have profound impacts on populations and ecological communities. Predicting impacts of thermal variability poses a challenge because it has both direct physiological effects and indirect effects through species interactions. In addition, differences in thermal performance between predators and prey and non-linear averaging of temperature-dependent performance can result in complex and counterintuitive population dynamics in response to climate change. Yet the combined consequences of these effects remain underexplored. Here, modeling temperature-dependent predator-prey dynamics, we study how changes in temperature variability affect population size, collapse, and stable coexistence of both predator and prey, relative to under constant environments or warming alone. We find that the effects of temperature variation on interacting species can lead to a diversity of outcomes, from predator collapse to stable coexistence, depending on interaction strengths and differences in species thermal performance. Temperature variability also alters predictions about population collapse - in some cases allowing predators to persist for longer than predicted when considering warming alone, and in others accelerating collapse. To inform management responses that are robust to future climates with increasing temperature variability and extremes, we need to incorporate the consequences of temperature variation in complex ecosystems.",

The rare missense variant SLC30A10 Thr95Ile (rs188273166) associates with a larger elevation in ALT and AST than any other variant tested and this association also replicates in the DiscovEHR study. SLC30A10 excretes manganese from the liver to the bile duct, and rare homozygous loss of function causes the syndrome hypermanganesemia with dystonia-1 (HMNDYT1) which involves cirrhosis. Consistent with hematological symptoms of hypermanganesemia, SLC30A10 Thr95Ile carriers have increased hematocrit and risk of iron deficiency anemia. Carriers also have increased risk of extrahepatic bile duct cancer. These associations suggest that genetic variation in SLC30A10 adversely affects more individuals than patients with diagnosed HMNDYT1.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAchieving inter-site / inter-scanner reproducibility of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) metrics has been challenging given differences in acquisition protocols, analysis models, and hardware factors.\n\nPurposeMagnetic field gradients impart scanner-dependent spatial variations in the applied diffusion weighting that can be corrected if the gradient nonlinearities are known. However, retrieving manufacturer nonlinearity specifications is not well supported and may introduce errors in interpretation of units or coordinate systems. We propose an empirical approach to mapping the gradient nonlinearities with sequences that are supported across the major scanner vendors.\n\nStudy TypeProspective observational study\n\nSubjectsA spherical isotropic diffusion phantom, and a single human control volunteer\n\nField Strength/Sequence3T (two scanners). Stejskal-Tanner spin echo sequence with b-values of 1000, 2000 s/mm2 with 12, 32, and 384 diffusion gradient directions per shell.\n\nAssessmentWe compare the proposed correction with the prior approach using manufacturer specifications against typical diffusion pre-processing pipelines (i.e., ignoring spatial gradient nonlinearities). In phantom data, we evaluate metrics against the ground truth. In human and phantom data, we evaluate reproducibility across scans, sessions, and hardware.\n\nStatistical TestsWilcoxon rank-sum test between uncorrected and corrected data.\n\nResultsIn phantom data, our correction method reduces variation in mean diffusivity across sessions over uncorrected data (p<0.05). In human data, we show that this method can also reduce variation in mean diffusivity across scanners (p<0.05).\n\nConclusionOur method is relatively simple, fast, and can be applied retroactively. We advocate incorporating voxel-specific b-value and b-vector maps should be incorporated in DW-MRI harmonization preprocessing pipelines to improve quantitative accuracy of measured diffusion parameters.",

Crucially, this connectome is dense, meaning all nodes and links are represented, within the limits of experimental error. We consider the connectome as a directed graph with weighted edges. This enables us to look at a number of graph properties, compare them to human designed logic systems, and speculate on how this may affect function.

    "abstract": "Synthetic lethal interactions, where the simultaneous but not individual inactivation of two genes is lethal to the cell, have been successfully exploited to treat cancer. GATA3 is frequently mutated in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers and its deficiency defines a subset of patients with poor response to hormonal therapy and poor prognosis. However, GATA3 is not targetable. Here we show that GATA3 and MDM2 are synthetically lethal in ER-positive breast cancer. Depletion and pharmacological inhibition of MDM2 induce apoptosis in GATA3-deficient models in vitro, in vivo and in patient-derived organoids (PDOs) harboring GATA3 somatic mutation. The synthetic lethality requires p53 and acts via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Our results present MDM2 as a novel therapeutic target in the substantial cohort of ER-positive, GATA3-mutant breast cancer patients. With MDM2 inhibitors widely available, our findings can be rapidly translated into clinical trials to evaluate in-patient efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The shared representations account of empathy suggests that sharing other peoples emotions relies on neural processes similar to those engaged when directly experiencing such emotions. Recent research corroborated this by showing that placebo analgesia resulted in reduced pain empathy and decreased activation in shared neural networks. However, those studies did not report any placebo-related variation of somatosensory engagement during pain empathy. The experimental paradigms used in these studies did not direct attention towards a specific body part in pain, which may explain the absence of effects for somatosensation. The main objective of this preregistered study was to implement a paradigm overcoming this limitation, and to investigate whether placebo analgesia may also modulate the sensory-discriminative component of empathy for pain. We induced a localized, first-hand placebo analgesia effect in the right hand of 45 participants by means of a placebo gel and conditioning techniques, and compared this to the left hand as a control condition. Participants underwent a pain task in the MRI scanner, receiving painful or non-painful electrical stimulation on their left or right hand, or witnessing another person receiving such stimulation. In contrast to a robust localized placebo analgesia effect for self-experienced pain, the empathy condition showed no differences between the two hands, neither for behavioral nor neural responses. We thus report no evidence for somatosensory sharing in empathy, while replicating previous studies showing overlapping brain activity in the affective-motivational component for first-hand and empathy for pain. Hence, in a more rigorous test aiming to overcome limitations of previous work, we again find no causal evidence for the engagement of somatosensory sharing in empathy. Our study refines the understanding of the neural underpinnings of empathy for pain, and the use of placebo analgesia in investigating such models.\n\nHighlightsO_LIInvestigated placebo modulation of somatosensory and affective components of pain\nC_LIO_LILocalized placebo analgesia effects for self-report and fMRI of first-hand pain\nC_LIO_LINo evidence for such effects in empathy for pain\nC_LIO_LISuggests that somatosensory sharing does not play a critical role in pain empathy\nC_LI",

By the end of the experimental period, some larvae were fixed in 4% buffered glutaraldehyde solution to be processed for optical microscopy. Larvae exposed to G2 and G3 presented more structural damage of the mesentery, Malpighi tubules and nerve ganglia.

    "abstract": "Replication forks often stall at damaged DNA. Resumption of DNA synthesis can occur by replacement of the replicative DNA polymerase with specialized, error-prone translesion DNA polymerases (TLS), that have higher tolerance for damaged substrates. Several of these polymerases (Pol{lambda}, Pol{eta} and PrimPol) are stimulated in DNA synthesis through interaction with PolDIP2, however the mechanism of this PolDIP2-dependent stimulation is still unclear. Here we show that PrimPol uses a flexible loop to interact with the C-terminal ApaG-like domain of PolDIP2, and that this contact is essential for PrimPols enhanced processivity. PolDIP2 increases PrimPols primer-template and dNTP binding affinity, which concomitantly enhances PrimPols nucleotide incorporation efficiency. This activity is dependent on a unique arginine cluster in PolDIP2 and could be essential for PrimPol to function in vivo, since the polymerase activity of PrimPol alone is very limited. This mechanism, where the affinity for dNTPs gets increased by PolDIP2 binding, could be common to all other PolDIP2-interacting TLS polymerases, i.e. Pol{lambda}, Pol{eta}, Pol{zeta} and REV1, and might be critical for their in vivo function of tolerating DNA lesions at physiological nucleotide concentrations.",

    "abstract": "The current biodiversity crisis calls for appropriate and timely methods to assess state and change of bio-diversity. In this respect, environmental DNA (eDNA) is a highly promising tool, especially for aquatic ecosystems. While initial eDNA studies assessed biodiversity at a few sites, technology now allows analyses of samples from many points at a time. However, the selection of these sites has been mostly motivated on an ad-hoc basis, and it is unclear where to position sampling sites in a river network to most effectively sample biodiversity. To this end, hydrology-based models might offer a unique guidance on where to sample eDNA to reconstruct the spatial patterns of taxon density based on eDNA data collected across a watershed.\n\nHere, we performed computer simulations to identify best-practice criteria for the choice of positioning of eDNA sampling sites in river networks. To do so, we combined a hydrology-based eDNA transport model with a virtual river network reproducing the scaling features of real rivers. In particular, we conducted simulations investigating scenarios of different number and location of eDNA sampling sites in a riverine network, different spatial taxon distributions, and different eDNA measurement errors.\n\nWe identified best practices for sampling site selection for taxa that have a scattered versus an even distribution across the network. We observed that, due to hydrological controls, non-uniform patterns of eDNA concentration arise even if the taxon distribution is uniform and decay is neglected. We also found that uncertainties in eDNA concentration estimates do not necessarily hamper model predictions. Knowledge of eDNA decay rates improves model predictions, highlighting the need for empirical estimates of these rates under relevant environmental conditions. Our simulations help define strategies for the design of eDNA sampling campaigns in river networks, and can guide the sampling effort of field ecologists and environmental authorities.",

    "abstract": "The chromosome translocations generating PAX3FOXO1 and PAX7FOXO1 chimeric proteins are the primary hallmarks of the paediatric cancer, Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS). Despite the ability of these transcription factors to remodel chromatin landscapes and promote the expression of tumour driver genes, they only inefficiently promote malignant transformation in vivo. The reason for this is unclear. To address this, we developed an in ovo model to follow the response of spinal cord progenitors to PAXFOXO1s. Our data demonstrate that PAXFOXO1s, but not wild-type PAX3 and PAX7, trigger the trans-differentiation of neural cells into ARMS-like cells with myogenic characteristics. In parallel expression of PAXFOXO1s remodels the neural pseudo-stratified epithelium into a cohesive mesenchyme capable of tissue invasion. Surprisingly, gain for PAXFOXO1s, as for wild-type PAX3/7, reduces the levels of CDK-CYCLIN activity and arrests cells in G1. Introduction of CYCLIN D1 or MYCN overcomes PAXFOXO1s mediated cell cycle inhibition and promotes tumour growth. Together, our findings reveal a mechanism underpinning the apparent limited oncogenicity of PAXFOXO1 fusion transcription factors and support a neural origin for ARMS.",

    "abstract": "The precise regulation of the cellular mechanisms underlying axonal morphogenesis is essential to the formation of functional neuronal networks. We previously identified the autism-candidate kinase NUAK1 as a central regulator of axon branching in mouse cortical neurons through the control of mitochondria trafficking. How does local mitochondrial position or function regulate axon branching during development? Here, we characterized the metabolic regulation in the developing axon and report a marked metabolic decorrelation between axon elongation and collateral branching. We next solved the cascade of event leading to presynaptic clustering and mitochondria recruitment during spontaneous branch formation. Interestingly and contrary to peripheral neurons, mitochondria are recruited after but not prior to branch formation in cortical neurons. Using flux metabolomics and fluorescent biosensors, we observed that NUAK1 deficiency significantly impairs mitochondrial metabolism and axonal ATP concentration. Upregulation of mitochondrial function is sufficient to rescue axonal branching in NUAK1 null neurons in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, our results indicate that NUAK1 exerts a dual function during axon branching through its ability to control mitochondria distribution and activity, and suggest that a mitochondrial-dependent remodeling of local metabolic homeostasis plays a critical role during axon morphogenesis.",

Network coactivation was selectively correlated with the state of surprise across movie events, compared to all other cognitive states (e.g. emotion, vividness). The effect was exhibited in the DMN, but not dorsal attention or visual networks. Furthermore, surprise was found to mediate DMN coactivations with hippocampus and nucleus accumbens. These unexpected findings point to the DMN as a major hub in high-level prediction-error representations.",

    "abstract": "Purkinje cells are the principal neurons of the cerebellar cortex. One of their distinguishing features is that they fire two distinct types of action potential, called simple and complex spikes, which interact with one another. Simple spikes are stereotypical action potentials that are elicited at high, but variable, rates (0 - 100 Hz) and have a consistent waveform. Complex spikes are composed of an initial action potential followed by a burst of lower amplitude spikelets. Complex spikes occur at comparatively low rates (~ 1 Hz) and have a variable waveform. Although they are critical to cerebellar operation a simple model that describes the complex spike waveform is lacking. Here, a novel single-compartment model of Purkinje cell electrodynamics is presented. The simpler version of this model, with two active conductances and a leak channel, can simulate the features typical of complex spikes recorded in vitro. If calcium dynamics are also included, the model can capture the pause in simple spike activity that occurs after complex spike events. Together, these models provide an insight into the mechanisms behind complex spike spikelet generation, waveform variability and their interactions with simple spike activity.",

Here, we show that intraperitoneal glucose injection induced changes in hypothalamic distribution and amount of phospholipids, especially arachidonic-acid-containing phospholipids, that were then metabolized to produce prostaglandins. Knockdown of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), a key enzyme for generating arachidonic acid from phospholipids, in the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (VMH), lowered insulin sensitivity in muscles during regular chow diet (RCD) feeding. Conversely, the down-regulation of glucose metabolism by high fat diet (HFD) feeding was improved by knockdown of cPLA2 in the VMH through changing hepatic insulin sensitivity and hypothalamic inflammation. Our data suggest that cPLA2-mediated hypothalamic phospholipid metabolism is critical for controlling systemic glucose metabolism during RCD, while continuous activation of the same pathway to produce prostaglandins during HFD deteriorates glucose metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Folate receptor {beta} (FR-{beta}) is one of the markers expressed on macrophages and a promising target for imaging of inflammation. Here, we report the radiosynthesis and preclinical evaluation of [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-folate (68Ga-FOL). First, we determined the affinity of 68Ga-FOL using human FR-{beta} expressing cells. Then, we studied atherosclerotic mice with 68Ga-FOL and 18F-FDG PET/CT. After sacrifice, the tissues excised were measured with a {gamma}-counter for ex vivo biodistribution. Further, the tracer distribution and co-localization with macrophages in aorta cryosections were studied using autoradiography, hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunostaining with anti-Mac-3 antibody. Specificity of 68Ga-FOL was assessed in a blocking study with excess of folate glucosamine. As a last step, human radiation doses were extrapolated from rat PET data. We were able to produce 68Ga-FOL at high radioactivity concentration, with high molar activity and radiochemical purity. The cell binding studies showed high (5.1 {+/-} 1.1 nM) affinity of 68Ga-FOL to FR-{beta}. The myocardial uptake of 68Ga-FOL (SUV 0.43 {+/-} 0.06) was 20-folds lower compared to 18F-FDG (SUV 10.6 {+/-} 1.8, P = 0.001). The autoradiography and immunohistochemistry of aorta revealed that 68Ga-FOL radioactivity co-localized with Mac-3-positive macrophage-rich atherosclerotic plaques. The plaque-to-healthy vessel wall ratio of 68Ga-FOL (2.44 {+/-} 0.15) was significantly higher than that of 18F-FDG (1.93 {+/-} 0.22, P = 0.005). Blocking studies verified 68Ga-FOL specificity to FR. As estimated from rat data the human effective dose was 0.0105 mSv/MBq. The organ with highest absorbed dose was kidney (0.1420 mSv/MBq). In conclusion, 68Ga-FOL is a promising new FR-{beta}-targeted tracer for imaging macrophage-associated inflammation.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENT/ABSTRACT GRAPHIC O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "SummaryThe bacterial resistome is the collection of all the antibiotic resistance genes, virulence genes, and other resistance elements within a bacterial isolate genome including plasmids and bacteriophage regions. Accurately characterizing the resistome is crucial for prevention and mitigation of emerging antibiotic resistance threats to animal and human health. Reads2Resistome is a tool which allows researchers to assemble and annotate bacterial genomes using long or short read sequencing technologies or both in a hybrid approach. Using a massively parallel analysis pipeline, Reads2Resistome performs assembly, annotation and resistome characterization with the goal of producing an accurate and comprehensive description of a bacterial genome and resistome contents. Key features of the Reads2Resistome pipeline include quality control of input sequencing reads, genome assembly, genome annotation, resistome characterization and alignment. All prerequisite dependencies come packaged together in a single suit which can easily be downloaded and run on Linux and Mac operating systems.\n\nAvailabilityReads2Resistome is freely available as an open-source package under the MIT license, and can be downloaded via GitHub (https://github.com/BioRRW/Reads2Resistome).",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged diagnostic systems globally. Expanding testing capabilities to conduct population-wide screening for COVID-19 requires innovation in diagnostic services at both the molecular and industrial scale. No report to-date has considered the complexity of laboratory infrastructure in conjunction with the available molecular assays to offer a standardised solution to testing. Here we present CONTAIN. A modular biosafety level 2+ laboratory optimised for automated RT-qPCR COVID-19 testing based on a standard 40ft shipping container. Using open-source liquid-handling robots and RNA extraction reagents we demonstrate a reproducible workflow for RT-qPCR COVID-19 testing. With five OT2 liquid handlers, a single CONTAIN unit reaches a maximum daily testing capacity of 2400 tests/day. We validate this workflow for automated RT-qPCR testing, using both synthetic SARS-CoV-2 samples and patient samples from a local NHS hospital. Finally, we discuss the suitability of CONTAIN and its flexibility in a range of diagnostic testing scenarios including high-density urban environments and mobile response units.\n\nVisual abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/106625v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18acad6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10ae5f1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7e34d3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1be3815_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of how the nervous sytem works is limited by our ability to identify the neuronal subtypes that comprise functional circuits. Using a genetic approach, we show that the transcription factor Gbx2 labels two amacrine cell (AC) subtypes in the mouse retina that have distinct morphological, physiological, and molecular properties. One subtype of Gbx2+ ACs are likely the previously characterized On-type GABAergic CRH-1 AC. The other Gbx2+ AC population is a previously uncharacterized non-GABAergic, non-Glycinergic (nGnG) AC subtype. Gbx2+ nGnG ACs are On-Off type cells with asymmetric dendritic arbors. Gbx2+ nGnG ACs also exhibit tracer coupling to bipolar cells (BCs) through gap junctions that are modulated by dopamine signaling. This study genetically identifies a previously uncharacterized AC subtype and reveals an unusual AC-BC connectivity through gap junctions that may provide a novel model of synaptic communication and visual circuit function.",

    "abstract": "Glial cells are early sensors of neuronal injury and are able to store lipids in lipid droplets under oxidative stress conditions. Here, we investigated the glial functions of Spen in the context of Parkinsons disease (PD). Using a data mining approach, we first found that the human ortholog of spen, SPEN/SHARP belongs to the set of astrocyte-expressed genes which mRNA levels are significantly different in the substantia nigra of PD patients as compared to controls. Interestingly, the retrieved list of differentially expressed genes was enriched in genes involved in lipid metabolism. In a Drosophila model of PD, we observed that spen mutant flies were more sensitive to paraquat intoxication. Moreover, the glia-restricted knockdown of spen led to the expansion and the accumulation of lipid droplets as well as the inhibition of Notch pathway. Taken together our results show that Spen regulates lipid metabolism and storage in glial cells and by these means contribute to glia-mediated functions in the context of neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Activity-dependent local protein synthesis is critical for synapse-specific, persistent plasticity. Abnormalities in local protein synthesis have been implicated in psychiatric disorders. We have recently identified the translin/trax microRNA-degrading enzyme as a novel mediator of protein synthesis at activated synapses. Additionally, mice lacking translin/trax exhibit some of the behavioral abnormalities found in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome. Therefore, identifying signaling pathways interacting with translin/trax to support persistent synaptic plasticity is a translationally relevant goal. Here, as a first step to achieve this goal, we have assessed the requirement of translin/trax for multiple hippocampal synaptic plasticity paradigms that rely on distinct molecular mechanisms. We found that mice lacking translin/trax exhibited selective impairment in a form of persistent hippocampal plasticity, which requires postsynaptic PKA activity. In contrast, enduring forms of plasticity that are dependent on presynaptic PKA were unaffected. Furthermore, these mice did not display exaggerated metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term synaptic depression, a hallmark of the mouse model of fragile X syndrome. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that translin/trax mediates long-term synaptic plasticity that is dependent on postsynaptic PKA signaling.",

    "abstract": "The newly emerged human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness. The innate immune response is critical for protection against Coronaviruses. However, little is known about the interplay between the innate immune system and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human airway epithelial (pHAE) cultures, which are maintained in an air-liquid interface. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in pHAE cultures and is directionally released on the apical, but not basolateral surface. Transcriptional profiling studies found that infected pHAE cultures had a molecular signature dominated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine induction, including IL-6, TNF, CXCL8. We also identified NF-{kappa}B and ATF4 transcription factors as key drivers of this pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Surprisingly, we observed a complete lack of a type I or III IFN induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pre-treatment or post-treatment with type I and III IFNs dramatically reduced virus replication in pHAE cultures and this corresponded with an upregulation of antiviral effector genes. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet blocks the production of type I and III IFNs. Further, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs, demonstrating their potential utility as therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe current pandemic of respiratory illness, COVID-19, is caused by a recently emerged coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. This virus infects airway and lung cells causing fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Severe cases of COVID-19 can result in lung damage, low blood oxygen levels, and even death. As there are currently no vaccines or antivirals approved for use in humans, studies of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary human airway epithelial cultures induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet blocks the production of type I and III IFNs. Further, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs, demonstrating their potential utility as therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Notch signaling is essential for multicellular life, regulating core functions such as cellular identity, differentiation, and fate. These processes require highly sensitive systems to avoid going awry, and one such regulatory mechanism is through Notch intracellular domain dimerization. Select Notch target genes contain sequence-paired sites (SPS); motifs in which two Notch transcriptional activation complexes can bind and interact through Notchs ankyrin domain, resulting in enhanced transcriptional activation. This mechanism has been mostly studied through Notch1, and to date, the abilities of the other Notch family members have been left unexplored. Through the utilization of minimalized, SPS-driven luciferase assays, we were able to test the functional capacity of Notch dimers. Here we show that each family member is capable of dimerization-induced signaling, following the same stringent requirements as seen with Notch1. Interestingly, we identified a mechanical difference between canonical and cryptic SPSs, leading to differences in their dimerization-induced regulation. Finally, we profiled the Notch family members SPS gap distance preferences and found that they all prefer a 16-nucleotide gap, with little room for variation. In summary, this work highlights the potent and highly specific nature of Notch dimerization and refines the scope of this regulatory function.",

    "abstract": "Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is an autosomal dominant rare disease that causes the formation of angiogenic tumors. When functional, pVHL acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). Genetic mutations that perturb the structure of pVHL result in dysregulation of HIF, causing a wide array of tumor pathologies including retinal angioma, pheochromocytoma, central nervous system hemangioblastoma, and clear cell renal carcinoma. These VHL-related cancers occur throughout the lifetime of the patient, requiring frequent intervention procedures, such as surgery, to remove the tumors. Although VHL is classified as a rare disease (1 in 39,000 to 1 in 91,000 affected) there is a large heterogeneity in genetic mutations listed for observed pathologies. Understanding how these specific mutations correlate with the myriad of observed pathologies for VHL could provide clinicians insight into the potential severity and onset of disease. Using a set of 285 ClinVar mutations in VHL, we developed a multiparametric scoring algorithm to evaluate the overall clinical severity of missense mutations in pVHL. The mutations were assessed according to eight weighted parameters as a comprehensive evaluation of protein misfolding and malfunction. Higher mutation scores were strongly associated with pathogenicity. Our approach establishes a novel in silico method by which VHL-specific mutations can be assessed for their severity and effect on the biophysical functions of the VHL protein.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Two common ecological assumptions are that host generalist and rare species are poorer competitors relative to host specialist and more abundant counterparts. While these assumptions have received considerable study in both plant and animals, how they apply to ectomycorrhizal fungi remains largely unknown. To investigate how interspecific competition may influence the anomalous host associations of the rare ectomycorrhizal generalist fungus, Suillus subaureus, we conducted a seedling bioassay. Pinus strobus seedlings were inoculated in single- or two-species treatments of three Suillus species: S. subaureus, S. americanus, and S. spraguei. After 4 and 8 months of growth, seedlings were harvested and scored for mycorrhizal colonization as well as dry biomass. At both time points, we found a clear competitive hierarchy among these species: S. americanus > S. subaureus > S. spraguei, with the competitive inferior, S. spraguei, having significantly delayed colonization relative to S. americanus and S. subaureus. In the single-species treatments, we found no significant differences in the dry biomasses of seedlings colonized by each Suillus species, suggesting none of these species was a more effective plant symbiont relative to each other. Taken together, these results indicate that the rarity and anomalous host associations exhibited by S. subaureus in natural settings are not driven by inherently poor competitive ability or host growth promotion, but that the timing of colonization is a key factor determining the outcome of ectomycorrhizal fungal competitive interactions.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is a public health emergency. COVID-19 typically exhibits respiratory illness. Unexpectedly, emerging clinical reports indicate that neurological symptoms continue to rise, suggesting detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show that a Dusseldorf isolate of SARS-CoV-2 enters 3D human brain organoids within two days of exposure. Using COVID-19 convalescent serum, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 preferably targets soma of cortical neurons but not neural stem cells, the target cell type of ZIKA virus. Imaging cortical neurons of organoids reveal that SARS-CoV-2 exposure is associated with missorted Tau from axons to soma, hyperphosphorylation, and apparent neuronal death. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 co-localizes specifically with Tau phosphorylated at Threonine-231 in the soma, indicative of early neurodegeneration-like effects. Our studies, therefore, provide initial insights into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 as a neurotropic virus and emphasize that brain organoids could model CNS pathologies of COVID-19.\n\nOne sentence summaryCOVID-19 modeling in human brain organoids",

    "abstract": "COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, started in China in late 2019, and soon became a global pandemic. With the help of thousands of viral genome sequences that have been accumulating, it has become possible to track the evolution of viral genome over time as it spread across the world. An important question that still needs to be answered is whether any of the common mutations affect the viral properties, and therefore the disease characteristics. Therefore, we sought to understand the effects of mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), particularly the common 14408C>T mutation, on mutation rate and viral spread. By focusing on mutations in the slowly evolving M or E genes, we aimed to minimize the effects of selective pressure. Our results indicate that 14408C>T mutation increases the mutation rate, while the third-most common RdRp mutation, 15324C>T, has the opposite effect. It is possible that 14408C>T mutation may have contributed to the dominance of its co-mutations in Europe and elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDIn the Covid-19 pandemic, highly selective serological testing is essential to define exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus. Many tests have been developed, yet with variable speed to first result, and of unknown quality, particularly when considering the prediction of neutralizing capacity.\n\nOBJECTIVES/METHODSThe LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay was designed to measure antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 native S1/S2 proteins in a standardized automated chemiluminescent assay. Clinical and analytical performance of the test were validated in an observational study using residual samples (>1500) with positive or negative Covid-19 diagnosis.\n\nRESULTSThe LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay proved highly selective and specific, and offers semiquantitative measures of serum or plasma levels of anti-S1/S2 IgG with neutralizing activity. The diagnostic sensitivity was 91.3% and 95.7% at >5 or [&ge;]15 days from diagnosis respectively, and 100% when assessed against a neutralizing assay. The specificity ranged between 97% and 98.5%. The average imprecision of the assay was <5 % coefficient of variation. Assay performance at 2 different cut-offs was evaluated to optimize predictive values in settings with different % disease prevalence. CONCLUSIONS. The automated LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay brings efficient, sensitive, specific, and precise serological testing to the laboratory, with the capacity to test large amounts of samples per day: first results are available within 35 minutes with a throughput of 170 tests/hour. The test also provides a semiquantitative measure to identify samples with neutralizing antibodies, useful also for a large scale screening of convalescent plasma for safe therapeutic use.\n\nIMPORTANCEWith the worldwide advance of the COVID-19 pandemic, efficient, reliable and accessible diagnostic tools are needed to support public health officials and healthcare providers in their efforts to deliver optimal medical care, and articulate sound demographic policy. DiaSorin has developed an automated serology based assay for the measurement of IgG specific to SARS CoV-2 Spike protein, and tested its clinical performance in collaboration with Italian health care professionals who provided access to large numbers of samples from infected and non-infected individuals. The assay delivers excellent sensitivity and specificity, and is able to identify samples with high levels of neutralizing antibodies. This will provide guidance in assessing the true immune status of subjects, as well as meeting the pressing need to screen donors for high titer convalescent sera for subsequent therapeutic and prophylactic use.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) installs a profound host shut-off during lytic infection. The virion host shut-off (vhs) protein plays a key role in this process by efficiently cleaving both host and viral mRNAs in a translation-initiation-dependent manner. Furthermore, the onset of viral DNA replication is accompanied by a rapid decline in transcriptional activity of the host genome. Both mechanisms have tremendous impact on the RNA expression profile of the infected cells. To dissect their relative contributions and elucidate gene-specific host transcriptional responses throughout the first 8h of lytic HSV-1 infection, we here employed RNA-seq of total, newly transcribed (4sU-labelled) and chromatin-associated RNA in wild-type (WT) and {Delta}vhs infection of primary human fibroblasts. Following virus entry, vhs activity rapidly plateaued at an elimination rate of around 30% of cellular mRNAs per hour until 8h p.i. In parallel, host transcriptional activity dropped down to 10-20%. While the combined effects of both phenomena dominated infection-induced changes in total RNA, extensive gene-specific transcriptional regulation was observable in chromatin-associated RNA. This was surprisingly concordant between WT HSV-1 and its {Delta}vhs mutant and at least in parts mediated by the embryonic transcription factor DUX4. Furthermore, both WT and {Delta}vhs infection induced strong transcriptional up-regulation of a small subset of genes. Most of these were either poorly or not at all expressed prior to infection but already primed by H3K4me3 histone marks at their promoters. Most interestingly, analysis of chromatin-associated RNA revealed vhs-nuclease-activity-dependent transcriptional down-regulation of at least 150 cellular genes, in particular of many genes encoding integrin adhesome and extracellular matrix components. This was accompanied by a vhs-dependent reduction in protein levels by 8h p.i. for many of these genes. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive picture of the molecular mechanisms that govern cellular RNA metabolism during the first 8h of lytic HSV-1 infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe HSV-1 virion host shut-off (vhs) protein efficiently cleaves both host and viral mRNAs in a translation-dependent manner. In this study, we model and quantify changes in vhs activity as well as the virus-induced global loss of host transcriptional activity during productive HSV-1 infection. In general, HSV-1-induced alterations in total RNA levels were found to be predominantly shaped by these two global processes rather than gene-specific regulation. In contrast, chromatin-associated RNA depicted gene-specific transcriptional changes. This revealed highly concordant transcriptional changes in WT and{Delta} vhs infection, confirmed DUX4 as a key transcriptional regulator in HSV-1 infection and depicted vhs-dependent, transcriptional down-regulation of the integrin adhesome and extracellular matrix. The latter explained some of the gene-specific effects previously attributed to vhs-mediated mRNA degradation and resulted in a concordant loss in protein levels by 8h p.i. for many of the respective genes.",

Rapid SARS-CoV-2 countermeasure development is contingent on the availability of robust, scalable, and readily deployable surrogate viral assays to screen antiviral humoral responses, and define correlates of immune protection, and to down-select candidate antivirals. Here, we describe a highly infectious recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S as its sole entry glycoprotein that closely resembles the authentic agent in its entry-related properties. We show that the neutralizing activities of a large panel of COVID-19 convalescent sera can be assessed in high-throughput fluorescent reporter assay with rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S and that neutralization of the rVSV and authentic SARS-CoV-2 by spike-specific antibodies in these antisera is highly correlated. Our findings underscore the utility of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S for the development of spike-specific vaccines and therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of viral entry and its inhibition.",

The PVP-I gel forming nasal spray (IVIEW-1503) and PVP-I gel forming ophthalmic eye drop (IVIEW-1201) rapidly inactivated SARS-CoV-2, inhibiting the viral infection of VERO76 cells. No toxicity was observed for the PVP-I formulations. Significant inactivation was noted with preincubation of the virus with these PVP-I formulations at the lowest concentrations tested. It has been demonstrated that both PVP-I formulations can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virus efficiently in both a dose-dependent and a time-dependent manner. These results suggest IVIEW-1503 and IVIEW-1201 could be potential agents to reduce or prevent the transmission of the virus through the nasal cavity and the eye, respectively.

    "abstract": "As of middle May 2020, the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, has infected over 4 million people with more than 300 thousand death as official reports1,2. The key to understanding the biology and virus-host interactions of SARS-CoV-2 requires the knowledge of mutation and evolution of this virus at both inter- and intra-host levels. However, despite quite a few polymorphic sites identified among SARS-CoV-2 populations, intra-host variant spectra and their evolutionary dynamics remain mostly unknown. Here, using deep sequencing data, we achieved and characterized consensus genomes and intra-host genomic variants from 32 serial samples collected from eight patients with COVID-19. The 32 consensus genomes revealed the coexistence of different genotypes within the same patient. We further identified 40 intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs). Most (30/40) iSNVs presented in single patient, while ten iSNVs were found in at least two patients or identical to consensus variants. Comparison of allele frequencies of the iSNVs revealed genetic divergence between intra-host populations of the respiratory tract (RT) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT), mostly driven by bottleneck events among intra-host transmissions. Nonetheless, we observed a maintained viral genetic diversity within GIT, showing an increased population with accumulated mutations developed in the tissue-specific environments. The iSNVs identified here not only show spatial divergence of intra-host viral populations, but also provide new insights into the complex virus-host interactions.",

Despite the identification of several effector T cell (TEFF)-driving transcription factors (TF), the transcriptional coordination of TEFF biology remains poorly understood. We developed an in vivo T cell CRISPR screening platform and identified a novel mechanism restraining TEFF biology through the ETS family TF, Fli1. Genetic deletion of Fli1 enhanced TEFF responses without compromising memory or exhaustion precursors. Fli1 restrained TEFF lineage differentiation by binding to cis-regulatory elements of effector-associated genes. Loss of Fli1 increased chromatin accessibility at ETS:RUNX motifs allowing more efficient Runx3-driven TEFF biology. CD8 T cells lacking Fli1 provided substantially better protection against multiple infections and tumors. These data indicate that Fli1 safeguards the developing CD8 T cell transcriptional landscape from excessive ETS:RUNX-driven TEFF cell differentiation. Moreover, genetic deletion of Fli1 improves TEFF differentiation and protective immunity in infections and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Aquaculture is the fastest growing primary industry worldwide. Marine finfish culture in open ocean net pens, or pontoons, is one of the largest growth areas and is currently the only way to rear high value fish such as bluefin tuna. Ranching involves catching wild juveniles, stocking in floating net pens and fattening for four to eight months. Tuna experience several parasite-induced disease challenges in culture that can be mitigated by application of praziquantel (PZQ) as a therapeutic. In this study, we characterized the microbiome of ranched southern Bluefin Tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, across four anatomic sites (gill, skin, digesta, and anterior kidney) and evaluated environmental and pathological factors that influence microbiome composition, including the impact of PZQ treatment on microbiome stability. Southern bluefin tuna gill, skin, and digesta microbiome communities are unique and potentially influenced by husbandry practices, location of pontoon growout pens, and treatment with the antiparasitic PZQ. There was no significant relationship between the fish mucosal microbiome and incidence or abundance of adult blood fluke in the heart or fluke egg density in the gill. An enhanced understanding of microbiome diversity and function in high-value farmed fish species such as bluefin tuna is needed to optimize fish health and improve aquaculture yield. Comparison of the bluefin tuna microbiome to other fish species, including Seriola lalandi (yellowtail kingfish), a common farmed species from Australia, and Scomber japonicus (Pacific mackerel), a wild caught Scombrid relative of tuna, showed the two Scombrids had more similar microbial communities compared to other families. The finding that mucosal microbial communities are more similar in phylogenetically related fish species exposes an opportunity to develop mackerel as a model for tuna microbiome and parasite research.",

COPA is a subunit of coat protein complex I (COPI) that mediates Golgi to ER transport3. Missense mutations that disrupt the COPA WD40 domain impair binding and sorting of proteins targeted for retrieval to the ER but how this causes disease remains unknown1,4. Given the importance of COPA in Golgi-ER transport, we speculated that type I interferon signaling in COPA syndrome involves missorting of STING. Here we show that a defect in COPI transport due to mutant COPA causes ligand-independent activation of STING. Furthermore, SURF4 is an adapter molecule that facilitates COPA-mediated retrieval of STING at the Golgi. Activated STING stimulates type I interferon driven inflammation in CopaE241K/+ mice that is rescued in STING-deficient animals. Our results demonstrate that COPA maintains immune homeostasis by regulating STING transport at the Golgi. In addtion, activated STING contributes to immune dysregulation in COPA syndrome and may be a new molecular target in treating the disease.",

There was a strong convergent sequence signature across patients, and we identified 777 clonotypes convergent between at least four of the COVID-19 patients, but not present in healthy controls. A subset of the convergent clonotypes were homologous to known SARS and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein neutralising antibodies. Convergence was also demonstrated across wide geographies by comparison of data sets between patients from UK, USA and China, further validating the disease association and consistency of the stereotypical immune response even at the sequence level.

    "abstract": "Melanin, a black-brown pigment found throughout all kingdoms of life, has diverse biological functions including: UV protection, thermoregulation, oxidant scavenging, arthropod immunity, and microbial virulence. Given melanins broad roles in the biosphere, particularly in insect immune defenses, it is important to understand how exposure to ubiquitous environmental contaminants affects melanization. Glyphosate - the most widely used herbicide globally - inhibits melanin production, which could have wide-ranging implications in the health of many organisms, including insects. Here, we demonstrate that glyphosate has deleterious effects on insect health in two evolutionary distant species, Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and Anopheles gambiae (Diptera: Culicidae), suggesting a broad effect in insects. Glyphosate reduced survival of G. mellonella caterpillars following infection with the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans and decreased the size of melanized nodules formed in hemolymph, which normally help eliminate infection. Glyphosate also increased the burden of the malaria- causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum in A. gambiae mosquitoes, altered uninfected mosquito survival, and perturbed the microbial composition of adult mosquito midguts. Our results show that glyphosates mechanism of melanin inhibition involves antioxidant synergy and disruption of the reaction oxidation-reduction balance Overall, these findings suggest that glyphosates environmental accumulation could render insects more susceptible to microbial pathogens due to melanin inhibition, immune impairment, and perturbations in microbiota composition, potentially contributing to declines in insect populations.",

Here we describe a Diaphorina citri densovirus (DcDV)-derived EVE in the genome of Diaphorina citri. We found that this EVE gives rise to DcDV-specific primary piRNAs and is unevenly distributed among D. citri populations. Unexpectedly, we found that DcDV is targeted by ping-pong-dependent viral piRNAs (vpiRNAs) in D. citri lacking the DcDV-derived EVE, while four naturally infecting RNA viruses of D. citri are not targeted by vpiRNAs. Furthermore, a recombinant Cricket paralysis virus containing a portion of the DcDV genome corresponding to the DcDV-derived EVE was not targeted by vpiRNAs during infection in D. citri harboring the EVE. These results represent the first report of ping-pong-dependent vpiRNAs outside of mosquitoes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBacterial vaginosis (BV) was the most common condition for womens health caused by the disruption of normal vaginal flora and an overgrowth of certain disease-causing bacteria, affecting 30-50% of women at some time in their lives. Gram stain followed by Nugent scoring (NS) based on bacterial morphotypes under the microscope was long considered golden standard for BV diagnosis. This conventional manual method was often considered labor intensive, time consuming, and variable results from person to person.\n\nMethodsWe developed four convolutional neural networks (CNN) models, and evaluated their ability to automatic identify vaginal bacteria and classify Nugent scores from microscope images. All the CNN models were first trained with 23280 microscopic images labeled with Nugent scores from top experts. A separate set of 5815 images were evaluated by the CNN models. The best CNN model was selected to generalize its application on an independent sets of 1082 images collecting from three teaching hospitals. Different hardwares were used to take images in hospitals.\n\nResultsOur model could classify three Nugent Scores from images with high three classification accuracy of 89.3% (with 82.4% sensitivity and 96.6% specificity) on the 5815 test images, which was better diagnostic yield than the top-level technologists and obstetricians in China. The ability of generalization for our model was strong that it obtained 75.1%, which was 6.6% higher than the average of technologists.\n\nConclusionThe CNN model over performed human healthcare practitioners on accuracy, efficiency and stability for BV diagnosis using microscopic image-based Nugent scores. The deep learning model may offer translational application in automating diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis with proper supporting hardware.",

    "abstract": "The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis uses serine not only as building block for proteins but also as an important precursor in many anabolic reactions. Moreover, a lack of serine results in the initiation of biofilm formation. However, in excess serine inhibits the growth of B. subtilis. To unravel the underlying mechanisms, we isolated suppressor mutants that can tolerate toxic serine concentrations by three targeted and non-targeted genome-wide screens. All screens as well as genetic complementation in Escherichia coli identified the so far uncharacterized permease YbeC as the major serine transporter of B. subtilis. In addition to YbeC, the threonine transporters BcaP and YbxG make minor contributions to serine uptake. A strain lacking these three transporters was able to tolerate 100 mM serine whereas the wild type strain was already inhibited by 1 mM of the amino acid. The screen for serine-resistant mutants also identified mutations that result in increased serine degradation and in increased expression of threonine biosynthetic enzymes suggesting that serine toxicity results from interference with threonine biosynthesis.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementSerine is an important precursor for many biosynthetic reactions, and lack of this amino acid can induce biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis. However, serine is toxic for the growth of B. subtilis. To understand the reason(s) for this toxicity and to identify the so far unknown serine transporter(s) of this bacterium, we performed exhaustive mutant screens to isolate serine-resistant mutants. This screen identified YbeC, the major serine transporter of B. subtilis. Moreover, we observed an intimate link between serine and threonine metabolism that is responsible for serine toxicity by inhibiting threonine biosynthesis.",

In ACE 8/8 mice that over-expresses cardiac ACE protein but also has no kidney ACE expression, ACE2 protein in kidney membranes was also decreased (38 % of the WT, p<0.01). In kidney membranes from mice that received captopril or telmisartan for 2 weeks there was a reduction in ACE2 protein (37% in captopril treated p<0.01) and 76% in telmisartan treated p <0.05). In lung membranes the expression of ACE2 was very low and not detected by western blotting but no significant differences in terms of ACE2 activity could be detected in mice treated with captopril (118% of control) or telmisartan (93% of control).\n\nConclusionsGenetic kidney ACE protein deficiency, suppressed enzymatic activity by Captopril or blockade of the AT1 receptor with telmisartan are all associated with a decrease in ACE2 in kidney membranes. ACE2 protein in kidney or lungs is decreased or unaffected by RAS blockers indicating that these medications can not pose a risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection related to amplification of ACE2 at these two target sites for viral entry.",

    "abstract": "Cells use sophisticated molecular circuits to interpret and respond to extracellular signal factors, such as hormones and cytokines, which are often released in a temporally varying fashion. In this study, we focus on type I interferon (IFN) signaling in human epithelial cells and combine microfluidics, time-lapse microscopy, and computational modeling to investigate how the IFN-responsive regulatory network operates in single cells to process repetitive IFN stimulation. We found that IFN- pretreatments lead to opposite effects, priming versus desensitization, depending on the input durations. These effects are governed by a regulatory network composed of a fast-acting positive feedback loop and a delayed negative feedback loop, mediated by upregulation of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18). We further revealed that USP18 upregulation can only be initiated at the G1 and early S phases of cell cycle upon the treatment onset, resulting in heterogeneous and delayed induction kinetics in single cells. This cell cycle gating provides a temporal compartmentalization of feedback control processes, enabling duration-dependent desensitization to repetitive stimulations. Moreover, our results, highlighting the importance of IFN dynamics, may suggest time-based strategies for enhancing the effectiveness of IFN pretreatment in clinical applications against viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Fitness landscapes are a central concept in evolutionary biology and have been thoroughly detailed in terms of genotypes. However, our understanding of the selected metabolic and gene expression adaptations, and their dependence on genetic background, remains limited. Here, we reveal multi-scale adaptation principles in the E. coli species by taking multi-omics measurements of six different strains throughout their adaptive evolution to glucose minimal media. Statistics and matrix factorization is applied to yield four key results. First, analysis of the metabolic and physiological data shows evolutionary convergence in growth rate, glucose uptake rate, glycolytic ATP and NADH production but divergence in NADPH production strategies. Second, factorization-based analysis of the transcriptome revealed six conserved transcriptomic adaptations describing increased expression of ribosome and amino acid biosynthetic genes and decreased expression of stress response and structural genes. Third, correlation analysis identifies five tradeoffs underlying the transcriptomic profiles. Fourth, statistical tests leveraging ALE design identify four mutation-flux correlates and eight mutation-transcriptomic correlates that link mutations to systems level adaptation principles. Our total results reveal the dominant metabolic and regulatory constraints governing E. coli growth adaptation that either distinguish strains or are conserved principles.",

The expected function of this gene, its two dysfunctional mutations, and genetic diversity were described recently in a related study.\n\nResultsWe have developed PCR and LAMP markers to detect mutant alleles and to present experimental options depending on available laboratory equipment. At field stations, where PCR machines are not available, LAMP markers were developed. LAMP only needs heat-blocks or a water bath to perform the isothermal amplification and assay results can be easily seen by eye. Because the causative mutations were deletions, two kinds of PCR markers, amplified length polymorphism (ALP) and allele specific PCR (ASP) markers, were developed. These assays can be carried out by capillary or agarose gel electrophoresis.",

The analysis yielded at total of 11 haplotypes with 27 variable positions, all of which have been described in previous equine mitochondrial DNA d-loop studies. Four main haplotype clusters were present in the Cleveland Bay breed describing 89% of the total sample. This suggests that only four principal maternal ancestry lines exist in the present-day global Cleveland Bay population. Comparison of these sequences with other domestic horse haplotypes shows a close association of the Cleveland Bay horse with Northern European (Clade C), Iberian (Clade A) and North African (Clade B) horse breeds. This indicates that the Cleveland Bay horse may not have evolved exclusively from the now extinct Chapman horse, as previous work as suggested. The Cleveland Bay horse remains one of only fivedomestic horse breeds classified as Critical on the Rare Breeds Survival Trust (UK) Watchlist and our results provide important information on the origins of this breed and represent a valuable tool for conservation purposes.",

The present study aimed to treat different types of wastewater including domestic, hospital, textile, pharmaceutical and mixed wastewaters using indigenous bacterial isolates to remove contaminants and render these wastewaters safer for irrigation. 37 bacterial strains were isolated from the 5 wastewater samples collected from different sites in Lahore, Pakistan. Under optimum growth conditions, the isolates D6, D7 and P1 showed maximum decolourisation potential of 96, 96, 93 %, respectively against hospital wastewater. GCMS analysis of the untreated hospital wastewater confirmed the presence of pharmaceutic pollutants i.e. Phenol, Salicylic acid, Caffeine, Naproxen, Octadecene and Diazepam. These organic compounds were biodegraded into derivate Ticlopidine in the case of isolate D6, derivatives Tetradecene and Griseofulvin in the case of isolate D7, and derivatives Lidocaine and Butalbital in the case of isolate P1. 16S rDNA sequencing was used to identify these isolates. Isolates D6 and D7 showed 100 and 99.86 % homology to Bacillus paramycoides, a novel strain from Bacillus cereus group (Liu et al., 2017). Isolate P1 showed 97.47 % homology to Alcaligenes faecalis. These strains therefore could represent a low-cost and low-tech alternative to bioremediate complex wastewaters prior to irrigation to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 6 - clean water and sanitation in Pakistan.",

    "abstract": "Significant progress has been made in advancing and standardizing tools for human genomic and biomedical research, yet the field of next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis for microorganisms (including multiple pathogens) remains fragmented, lacks accessible and reusable tools, is hindered by local computational resource limitations, and does not offer widely accepted standards. One of such \"problem areas\" is the analysis of Transposon Insertion Sequencing (TIS) data. TIS allows perturbing the entire genome of a microorganism by introducing random insertions of transposon-derived constructs. The impact of the insertions on the survival and growth provides precise information about genes affecting specific phenotypic characteristics. A wide array of tools has been developed to analyze TIS data and among the variety of options available, it is often difficult to identify which one can provide a reliable and reproducible analysis. Here we sought to understand the challenges and propose reliable practices for the analysis of TIS experiments. Using data from two recent TIS studies we have developed a series of workflows that include multiple tools for data de-multiplexing, promoter sequence identification, transposon flank alignment, and read count repartition across the genome. Particular attention was paid to quality control procedures such as the determination of the optimal tool parameters for the analysis and removal of contamination. Our work provides an assessment of the currently available tools for TIS data analysis and offers ready to use workflows that can be invoked by anyone in the world using our public Galaxy platform (https://usegalaxy.org).

    "abstract": "Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most concerning pathogens in hospital infections. A. baumannii is categorized as an \"Urgent Threat\" by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the highest priority pathogen by the World Health Organization due to its propensity for broad antibiotic resistance and its associated high mortality rates. New treatment options are urgently needed for MDR A. baumannii infections. Our prior studies have demonstrated an unappreciated utility of the macrolide azithromycin (AZM) against MDR A. baumannii in tissue-culture medium. This finding is all the more surprising since AZM has no appreciable activity against A. baumannii in standard bacteriological media. The basis for this media-dependent activity of AZM against A. baumannii is not fully defined. In this study, we utilize a variety of techniques (growth dynamics, bacterial cytological profiling, RNA sequencing, and LC/MS) to profile the response of MDR A. baumannii to AZM in both standard bacteriological and more physiological relevant mammalian tissue-culture medium.\n\n\n[Table 1]",

    "abstract": "In coming decades drought is expected to expand globally owing to increased evaporation and reduced rainfall. In order to reduce the vulnerability of agricultural systems we need to understand the crop plant growth environment. Understanding, predicting and controlling the rhizosphere has potential to harness plant microbe interactions, improve plant responses to environmental stress and mitigate effects of climate change. Our plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are isolated from the natural laboratory  Evolution Canyon Israel (EC). The endophytic rhizobacteria from the wild progenitors of cereals have been co-habituated with their hosts for long periods of time. The study revealed that silica particles (SN) triggered the PGPR production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) containing D-glucuronate (D-GA). This leads to increased plant biomass accumulation in drought-stressed growth environments. The PGPR increased EPS content increases the water holding capacity (WHC) and osmotic pressure of the biofilm matrix. Light- and electron-microscopic studies show that in the presence of SN particles, bacterial morphology is changed, indicating that SNs are associated with significant reprogramming in bacteria.\n\nThe results here show that the production of EPS containing D-GA is induced by SN treatment. The findings encourage formulation of cells considering microencapsulation with materials that ensure higher WHC and hyperosmolarity under field conditions. Our results illustrate the importance of considering natural soil nanoparticles in the application of PGPR. Osmotic pressure involvement of holobiont cohabitation is discussed.",

    "abstract": "All apicomplexan parasites have complex life cycles exhibiting division characterized by a tightly regulated cell cycle control, resulting in the emergence of daughter parasites in possession of a single nucleus and a complete set of organelles. Apicomplexa have evolved efficient and distinctive strategies for intracellular replication where the timing of emergence of the daughter cells, a process termed \"budding\", is a decisive element. However, the molecular mechanisms that provide the proper timing of parasite budding remain unknown. Using Toxoplasma gondii as a model Apicomplexa, we identified a master regulator that controls the timing of the budding process. We show that an ApiAP2 transcription factor, TgAP2IX-5, controls cell cycle events downstream of centrosome duplication including organelle division and segregation. TgAP2IX-5 binds to the promoter of hundreds of genes and controls the activation of the budding-specific cell cycle expression program. We show that TgAP2IX-5 regulates the expression of specific transcription factors that are necessary for the completion of the budding cycle. TgAP2IX-5 acts as a licensing factor that ensures that asexual proliferation continues by promoting the inhibition of the differentiation pathway at each round of the cell cycle. Therefore, TgAP2IX-5 is a master regulator that controls both cell cycle and developmental pathways.",

    "abstract": "RNA turnover is essential in all domains of life. The endonuclease RNase Y (rny) is one of the key components involved in RNA metabolism of the model organism Bacillus subtilis. Essentiality of RNase Y has been a matter of discussion, since deletion of the rny gene is possible, but leads to severe phenotypic effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the rny mutant strain rapidly evolves suppressor mutations to at least partially alleviate these defects. All suppressor mutants had acquired a duplication of an about 60 kb long genomic region encompassing genes for all three core subunits of the RNA polymerase - , {beta}, {beta}'. When the duplication of the RNA polymerase genes was prevented by relocation of the rpoA gene in the B. subtilis genome, all suppressor mutants carried distinct single point mutations in evolutionary conserved regions of genes coding either for the {beta} or {beta} subunits of the RNA polymerase that were not tolerated by wild type bacteria. In vitro transcription assays with the mutated polymerase variants showed massive decreases in transcription efficiency. Altogether, our results suggest a tight cooperation between RNase Y and the RNA polymerase to establish an optimal RNA homeostasis in B. subtilis cells.",

In this study, we used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected bone-marrow-derived macrophage (BMM) and cyclic phosphate cDNA sequencing to identify the RNA targets of EndoU. EndoU targeted viral RNA, cleaving the 3' side of pyrimidines with a strong preference for UA and CA sequences (endoYA). EndoU-dependent cleavage was detected in every region of MHV RNA, from the 5' NTR to the 3' NTR, including transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). Cleavage at two CA dinucleotides immediately adjacent to the MHV poly(A) tail suggest a mechanism to suppress negative-strand RNA synthesis and the accumulation of viral dsRNA. MHV with EndoU (EndoUmut) or 2'-5' phosphodiesterase (PDEmut) mutations provoked the activation of RNase L in BMM, with corresponding cleavage of RNAs by RNase L. The physiologic targets of EndoU are viral RNA templates required for negative-strand RNA synthesis and dsRNA accumulation.\n\nImpactCoronavirus EndoU cleaves UA and CA sequences (endoYA) within viral (+) strand RNA to evade dsRNA-activated host responses.",

    "abstract": "Ruminants are critical to global food security as they transform lignocellulosic biomass into high-quality protein products. The rumen microbes ferment feed to provide necessary energy and nutrients for the ruminant host. However, we still lack insight into the metabolic processes encoded by most rumen microbial populations. In this study, we implemented metagenomic binning approaches to recover 2,809 microbial genomes from cattle, sheep, moose, deer, and bison. By clustering genomes based on average nucleotide identity, we demonstrate approximately one-third of the metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to represent species not present in current reference databases and rumen microbial genome collections. Combining these MAGs with other rumen genomic datasets permitted a phylogenomic characterization of the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from 8,160 rumen microbial genomes, including the identification of 5,346 diverse gene clusters for nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis. A subset of Prevotella and Selenomonas BGCs had higher expression in steers with lower feed efficiency. Moreover, the microdiversity of BGCs was fairly constant across types of BGCs and cattle breeds. The reconstructed genomes expand the genomic representation of rumen microbial lineages, improve the annotation of multi-omics data, and link microbial populations to the production of secondary metabolites that may constitute a source of natural products for manipulating rumen fermentation.",

    "abstract": "Actinobacteria are a large and diverse phylum of bacteria that contains medically and ecologically relevant organisms. Many members are valuable sources of bioactive natural products and chemical precursors that are exploited in the clinic. These are made using the enzyme pathways encoded in their complex genomes. Whilst the number of sequenced genomes has increased rapidly in the last twenty years, the large size and complexity of many Actinobacterial genomes means that the sequences remain incomplete and consist of large numbers of contigs with poor annotation, which hinders large scale comparative genomics and evolutionary studies. To enable greater understanding and exploitation of Actinobacterial genomes, specialist genomic databases must be linked to high-quality genome sequences. Here we provide a curated database of 612 high-quality actinobacterial genomes from 80 genera, chosen to represent a broad phylogenetic group with equivalent genome reannotation. Utilising this database will provide researchers with a framework for evolutionary and metabolic studies, to enable a foundation for genome and metabolic engineering, to facilitate discovery of novel bioactive therapeutics and studies on gene family evolution.\n\nSignificance as a bioresource to the communityThe Actinobacteria are a large diverse phylum of bacteria, often with large, complex genomes with a high G+C content. Sequence databases have great variation in the quality of sequences, equivalence of annotation and phylogenetic representation, which makes it challenging to undertake evolutionary and phylogenetic studies. To address this, we have assembled a curated, taxa-specific, non-redundant database to aid detailed comparative analysis of Actinobacteria. ActDES constitutes a novel resource for the community of Actinobacterial researchers that will be useful primarily for two types of analyses: (i) comparative genomic studies - facilitated by reliable identification of orthologs across a set of defined, phylogenetically-representative genomes, and (ii) phylogenomic studies which will be improved by identification of gene subsets at specified taxonomic level. These analyses can then act as a springboard for the studies of the evolution of virulence genes, the evolution of metabolism and identification of targets for metabolic engineering.\n\nData summaryAll genome sequences used in this study can be found in the NCBI taxonomy browser https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/www.tax.cgi and are summarised along with Accession numbers in Table S1\n\nAll other data are available on Figshare https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12167529 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3830391\n\nO_LIPerl script files available on GitHub https://github.com/nselem/ActDES including details of how to batch annotate genomes in RAST from the terminal https://github.com/nselem/myrast\nC_LIO_LISupp. Table S1 List of genomes from NCBI (Actinobacteria database.xlsx) https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12167529\nC_LIO_LICVS genome annotation files including the FASTA files of nucleotide and amino acids sequences (individual .cvs files) https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12167880\nC_LIO_LIBLAST nucleotide database (.fasta file) https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12167724\nC_LIO_LIBLAST protein database (.fasta file) https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12167724\nC_LIO_LISupp. Table S2 Expansion table genus level (Expansion table.xlsx Tab Genus level) https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12167529\nC_LIO_LISupp. Table S2 Expansion table species level (Expansion table.xlsx Tab species level) https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12167529\nC_LIO_LIAll GlcP and Glk data - blast hits from ActDES database, MUSCLE Alignment files and .nwk tree files can be found at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12167529\nC_LIO_LIInteractive trees in Microreact for Glk tree https://microreact.org/project/w_KDfn1xA/90e6759e and associated files can be found at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12326441.v1\nC_LIO_LIInteractive trees in Microreact for GlcP tree https://microreact.org/project/VBUdiQ5_k/0fc4622b and associated files can be found at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12326441.v1\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "One of the most powerful approaches to understanding gene function involves turning genes on and off at will and measuring the impact at the cellular or organismal level. This particularly applies to the cohort of essential genes where traditional gene knockouts are inviable. In Plasmodium falciparum, conditional control of gene expression has been achieved by using multi-component systems in which individual modules interact with each other to regulate DNA recombination, transcription or posttranscriptional processes. The recently devised TetR-DOZI aptamer system relies on the ligand-regulatable interaction of a protein module with synthetic RNA aptamers to control the translation of a target gene. This technique has been successfully employed to study essential genes in P. falciparum and involves the insertion of several aptamer copies into their 3 untranslated regions (UTRs) which provide control over mRNA fate. However, aptamer repeats are prone to recombination and one or more copies can be lost from the system, resulting in a loss of control over target gene expression. We rectified this issue by redesigning the aptamer array to minimize recombination while preserving the control elements. As proof of concept, we compared the original and modified arrays for their ability to knock down the levels of a putative essential apicoplast protein (PF3D7_0815700) and demonstrated that the modified array is highly stable and efficient. This redesign will enhance the utility of a tool that is quickly becoming a favored strategy for genetic studies in P. falciparum.\n\nImportanceMalaria elimination efforts have been repeatedly hindered by the evolution and spread of multidrug-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The absence of a commercially available vaccine emphasizes the need for a better understanding of Plasmodium biology in order to further translational research. This has been partly facilitated by targeted gene deletion strategies for the functional analysis of parasite genes. However, genes that are essential for parasite replication in erythrocytes are refractory to such methods, and require conditional knockdown or knockout approaches to dissect their function. One such approach is the TetR-DOZI system that employs multiple synthetic aptamers in the untranslated regions of target genes to control their expression in a tetracycline-dependent manner. Maintaining modified parasites with intact aptamer copies has been challenging since these repeats are frequently lost by recombination. By interspacing the aptamers with unique sequences, we created a stable genetic system that remains effective at controlling target gene expression.",
